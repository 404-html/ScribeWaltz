1
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,690
Thank you.
So,

2
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,140
um,
I looked today and these lectures have 

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,380
now been watched by,
they've been viewed a million times,

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,500
so that's pretty amazing.

5
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,950
Thank you.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,480
Or they've been,
they've been glanced at a million times 

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
that might,
that's also possible.

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,890
Alright.
So,

9
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:48,340
well let's get right into it.
So last week,

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,400
um,
I think was mostly remarkable for the 

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,050
absolute dearth of content that was 
actually biblically related.

12
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,550
So that was,
um,

13
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,810
I'm,
I'll just recap what I laid out so that 

14
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:07,510
it sets the frame properly for what 
we're going to discuss tonight.

15
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:12,511
And I presented you with an elaborated 
description of,

16
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,740
of this diagram essentially,
which I spent quite a lot of time 

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,190
formulating for probably about 25 years 
ago,

18
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:29,191
I guess,
which kind of accounts for its graphic 

19
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:29,191
primitiveness I suppose.
Um,

20
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,950
I was really pushing the limits of my 
four 86 computer to produce that I can 

21
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,320
tell you.
So,

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,150
and it's,
it's,

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,540
it's a,
it's a description representation of the

24
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:45,541
archetypical circumstances of life and,
and the archetypical circumstances are 

25
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:51,361
the circumstances that are true under 
all conditions for all time.

26
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,990
And so you can think about them as 
descriptively characteristic of the 

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,441
nature of human experience that's not 
exactly the same as the nature of 

28
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:05,140
reality,
but because you can,

29
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,530
you can divide reality into it's 
subjective and objective elements and 

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,290
there's utility in doing that,
but these sorts of representations don't

31
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:19,291
play that game that they consider human 
experience as constant constituted 

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,930
constitutive of reality,
and that's how we experienced it.

33
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:30,931
And so we'll just go with that.
The idea basically is that we always 

34
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:35,311
exist inside a damaged structure and 
that structure is partly biological and 

35
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:40,060
it's.
It's partly socio-cultural.

36
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,100
It's partly what's been handed to us by 
our,

37
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,790
by our ancestors,
both practically in terms of 

38
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,350
infrastructure,
but also psychologically in terms of the

39
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,600
active learning content of our,
of our psyches,

40
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,060
and so that would include,
for example,

41
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:03,061
our ability to do utilize language and 
the words that we use and the phrases 

42
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:08,011
that we use and the mutual understanding
that we developed as a consequence of 

43
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:08,011
interacting with each other.

44
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,920
Architecturally speaking,
that structure is always.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,840
It's always dad didn't corrupt and the 
reason it's dead is because it was made 

46
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:23,851
by people who are dead and the reason 
it's corrupt is because things fall 

47
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:27,970
apart of their own accord and the fact 
that people don't aim properly,

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,570
let's say speeds along that process of 
degeneration.

49
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,990
And so what that means,
and I think this is something worth 

50
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,351
knowing.
Maybe I'll try standing back here and 

51
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,000
see if that problem goes away.
Um,

52
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,940
what that means is that young people 
always have a reason to be upset and 

53
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:53,310
cynical about the current state of 
affairs and,

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,670
and it's that way forever.
And,

55
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,580
and so it's useful,
I think,

56
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:00,790
to consider such consideration search 
such conceptualizations as the,

57
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,990
of the,
as the patriarchy in that light because 

58
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,460
it's an archetypal truth that the social
structure is corrupt and incomplete.

59
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,530
And,
and what that means is that it's 

60
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:14,590
something that you have to contend with 
every moment.

61
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:17,320
It's some sense of your life.
It's a,

62
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,240
it's a permanent fact of existence.
And to be upset that

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,280
the

64
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,220
structure is social structures or even 
the biological structures within which 

65
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,121
we live are incomplete and imperfect,
is to not take that personally,

66
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:40,121
that that's the worst part of it,
to take that personnel personally is a 

67
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:43,751
misreading of the existential condition 
of humankind because it's always the 

68
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:48,851
case that what you have been given and 
what you live in is degenerate and 

69
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:51,050
corrupt and in need of repair.

70
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,830
And it's easier just to accept that 
because there's also a positive element 

71
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:03,201
and the pause development as well.
You've been granted something rather 

72
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:08,481
than nothing and maybe you haven't been 
granted pure hell because especially in 

73
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:12,510
a culture like ours where many things 
actually functioned quite well.

74
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,630
So there's room for gratitude there.
Even if it's a broken machine,

75
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:20,631
it's not one that's completely 
devastated and it's not absolutely hell 

76
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:22,260
bent on at every second on your misery 
and destruction.

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
And it easily could be because many 
societies are like that.

78
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,040
And so the fact that we happen to live 
in one that isn't corrupt beyond 

79
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,050
imagining is something to be eternally 
grateful for.

80
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,720
While.
So we live inside a damage structure and

81
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,780
we also bear responsibility for that 
damage because we don't do everything we

82
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:49,620
can to constantly repair it.
And you might say,

83
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:51,420
well that's actually one of the 
fundamental,

84
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,470
you know,
people say,

85
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:53,790
well,
what's the meaning of life?

86
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,370
What they really mean is what's the 
positive meeting of light?

87
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,100
Because as we've already discussed,
the negative

88
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,840
meanings of life or more or less self 
evident,

89
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,440
well,
the positive meaning of life is to be 

90
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,870
found in noting the state of lack of 
repair,

91
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:08,900
of the,
of the walled city that you inhabit,

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,980
and then sally being forced to do 
something about that,

93
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:17,981
to repair the breaches and to fix up the
walls and to make the structure that you

94
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:23,291
inhabit as secure and as productive as 
it possibly can be.

95
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,150
And

96
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,060
there's no shortage of opportunities to 
do that.

97
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:34,620
You can do that in your own mind.
You can do that in your own room.

98
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:37,880
You can do that in your own household,
in your local community,

99
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,160
you.
And maybe if you get good at doing it at

100
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:43,680
all those levels,
then you can start to look beyond that.

101
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,070
And so there's challenges.
That's the thing that's kind of 

102
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,651
interesting about this insufficient 
structure is that it has a set of 

103
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,921
challenges built into it because of its 
insufficiency and perhaps even because 

104
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:59,091
of its corrupt nature that calls forth 
the potential response from you of 

105
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:05,571
heroic adventure and the heroic 
adventure is to man the barricades and 

106
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:09,930
repair the city.
And you can always do that.

107
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:13,050
It doesn't matter what what your 
personal circumstances are.

108
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,590
There's always something that isn't 
right near you,

109
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,810
isn't correct,
isn't laid out properly,

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,030
that you could just fix if you want it 
to.

111
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,160
And one of the things that we're going 
to talk about tonight is the idea that

112
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,860
if you adopt the attitude,
an attitude that's like that,

113
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,890
that the rule that you should play is to
make things better wherever you are.

114
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:40,500
However you can.
That what would actually happen would be

115
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,160
that things would get better wherever 
you are in all sorts of ways.

116
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:47,490
And that we've really,
as a species you might say,

117
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:50,700
or maybe even as singular individuals 
we've,

118
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,140
we've explored that rarely.
It isn't something that's put forth as a

119
00:07:55,141 --> 00:08:00,141
proposition that often.
And it's quite surprising to me and you 

120
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:03,761
know,
I had an interesting experience the 

121
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:05,070
other day I went to the Gig,
I go there because I have food allergies

122
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:07,530
and they're very careful with people who
have food allergies.

123
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,860
And the waiter took me to the table and 
he said that he had been watching my 

124
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,151
lectures and that's a very common 
experience and he was happy about that 

125
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:23,181
and he said that he'd had two promotions
out the keg in the last four months 

126
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:26,511
because he'd been watching my lectures 
and like I really found that in 

127
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,200
affecting experience because,
you know,

128
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:29,160
you might say,
well,

129
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,190
he's working as a waiter at the keg and 
there's nothing particularly heroic 

130
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,190
about that.

131
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,820
And,
and I disagree with that actually 

132
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,040
because I don't care where you're 
located,

133
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:43,070
you can do a hell of a job.
And I mean that literally at whatever 

134
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,070
job you have,
you can,

135
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,440
you can take whatever job you have and 
you can make it a real nice little piece

136
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:49,740
of absolute misery.
Or you can do.

137
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,840
You can act like a civilized human 
being.

138
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:54,900
And notice that no matter where you are,
there's a,

139
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,920
there's a richness and a complexity 
that's completely inexhaustible,

140
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:02,370
right at hand,
and then you can take that seriously and

141
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,270
you can say,
well,

142
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,580
I happened to be a waiter at the keg and
perhaps that's not what I expected.

143
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:13,581
And,
and he's a young guy and perhaps that 

144
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:13,800
isn't where I want to end up,
but it's not nothing,

145
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,280
it's a rich environment and I can make 
it a lot better if I want to.

146
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,280
I can get along properly with my 
coworkers and not gossip behind their 

147
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,431
back and I can treat my customers 
properly and if an opportunity comes my 

148
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,170
way I can take it and I can see what 
happens.

149
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,100
And so he said that's what he had 
started doing and that things were 

150
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,951
working out much better for him.
He was in a much better job than he was 

151
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,620
three months ago in three months.
That's nothing,

152
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:40,050
right?
I mean that's a nice trajectory.

153
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:45,051
It's an uphill trajectory and that's 
what you want really an uphill 

154
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,940
trajectory is actually even better than 
being somewhere good as far as I'm 

155
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,820
concerned because one of the things that
really makes your life meaningful is the

156
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:54,570
clear realization that you're headed 
somewhere better than you are now.

157
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,750
And then it's even better if you also 
understand that there's a direct causal 

158
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,261
relationship between the things that 
you're doing and the steepness of that 

159
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:03,261
inclined.

160
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:05,970
And so I get a lot of letters from 
people like that and they're more,

161
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,700
most frequently young men,
although not always.

162
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,840
And they say,
well,

163
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:14,841
you know,
I've been listening to these lectures 

164
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:15,330
and I decided that I'm going to try to 
take responsibility for my life.

165
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:20,331
And so I'm,
I've started to stop doing all the 

166
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:20,660
stupid things that I know that,
uh,

167
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,010
that are stupid that I know I shouldn't 
be doing.

168
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,280
And I've started doing some of the 
things that aren't stupid that I know I 

169
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,530
should be doing,
which seems pretty obvious really if you

170
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:33,531
think about it.
But it obvious though it may be that 

171
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:34,290
isn't necessarily what people do.
And then they write and say,

172
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,930
you can't believe what difference that 
makes.

173
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,050
And they're thrilled about it.
And so I'm thrilled about it when I get 

174
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,811
letters like that because I really don't
experience anything as better than a 

175
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:50,391
letter like that or a message like that 
because it's so good to see things that 

176
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,640
aren't so good,
replaced by something better.

177
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,860
And I really do think it's an open 
question.

178
00:10:55,861 --> 00:11:00,861
I truly believe it's an open question.
To what degree we could make things 

179
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,850
better if that's what we actually aimed 
at doing.

180
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,800
You know,
in some of the stories that we've,

181
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,950
we've covered already that story of Cain
and Abel in particular is really an 

182
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,150
analysis of that problem which is so 
remarkable that it occurs so,

183
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,730
so early in this document.
It's such a,

184
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,230
such a foundational story.
And it basically says,

185
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:21,030
well,
there's two modes of being in the world,

186
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:26,031
right?
There's one where you adopt the 

187
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:29,151
responsibility for living properly,
for being properly and you make the 

188
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:35,211
sacrifices necessary for doing that.
And then everything will flourish 

189
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:39,081
properly.
And the other one is a pathway of 

190
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:40,140
resentment and bitterness and rejection 
and murder.

191
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,920
And genocide,
and that just seems exactly right to me.

192
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,370
And so if the positive path beckons,
if you can actually see what it is,

193
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:54,531
if you can,
if you can lower yourself enough to see 

194
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:54,531
what it is.

195
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:58,530
Young Carl young set,
once that modern people didn't see God 

196
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,320
because they didn't look low enough.
So phrase I really,

197
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:03,370
really like because people denigrate the
opportunities that are right in front of

198
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:08,371
them and there's no reason to do that 
because what's right in front of you is 

199
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:10,390
the majesty of being.
That's what's right in front of you.

200
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:13,750
It's inexhaustibly complex and full of 
potential.

201
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:18,751
And there's no reason to assume that 
wherever you happen to be isn't as good 

202
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,680
as starting place as anywhere else.
Now,

203
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,690
you know,
I know some people have terrible,

204
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:27,691
terrible lives.
They're in situations that are 

205
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:29,521
absolutely unbearable and,
but I also do know that even situations 

206
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:30,850
like that can be made a hell of a lot 
worse by the bat,

207
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,570
by,
by,

208
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,750
by the worst kind of attitude.
That's for sure.

209
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,310
So,
so anyways,

210
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:38,440
so that's where you are,
you're in a damaged structure,

211
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,960
you're a damaged structure,
you're in a damaged structure,

212
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,950
but you know at least it's got some 
walls,

213
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,680
you know you're not being fed to the 
lions on a regular basis.

214
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,040
So that's a good thing and you can,
you can emerge forward,

215
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,750
know,
heroically,

216
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,380
magically to confront the chaos that 
constantly threatens the structure 

217
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,300
within which you live and you can free 
something as a consequence of that.

218
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:04,150
You can learn something.
You can strengthen yourself.

219
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:09,151
That's the other thing,
because the way what you're actually 

220
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:10,720
made of in many ways that what informs 
you,

221
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:14,260
what you're made of is what you 
encounter when you voluntarily encounter

222
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:19,261
the unknown.
And so the more you voluntarily 

223
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:21,571
encountered the unknown,
the more you get made of and the more 

224
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:24,481
you get made of the more there is to you
and then the more you're good at 

225
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:28,040
encountering the unknown and 
restructuring order and calling forth 

226
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,300
proper order out of the potential of 
being and God,

227
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:33,790
you got to think,
why wouldn't you do that?

228
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,520
Since you can do that,
and it's an endless mystery.

229
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,170
You know,
I think part of it is that people,

230
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,070
well,
it's also encapsulated to some degree in

231
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:47,071
the story of Adam and Eve because what 
happens to Adam is when you become self 

232
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:47,071
conscious,
right?

233
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:51,490
He,
he becomes ashamed of his self in 

234
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,720
regards himself as a lowly sort of 
creature and there's endless reasons why

235
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:57,721
people would do that because of course 
were rife with imperfection and so he 

236
00:13:57,721 --> 00:14:01,621
hides from God.
And I think that's actually the answer 

237
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:03,640
to the conundrum,
which is that people don't aspire to the

238
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:08,641
highest good because they're deeply 
ashamed of themselves and their 

239
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:12,190
weaknesses and their insufficiencies.
And so it's,

240
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,150
it's not the only reason.
I mean there's,

241
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,280
there's the desire to avoid 
responsibility and there's all the 

242
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,951
negative motivations as well,
like resentment and hatred and the 

243
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,270
desire to make things worse.
I don't want to,

244
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,310
you know,
give us,

245
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,170
given us too much of a break,
but,

246
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,630
but it's something like that,
but it's okay to not be in a very good 

247
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:39,481
place if what you're trying to do with 
that not very good place is make it 

248
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:39,481
better.

249
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,960
And one of the things I really have 
learned as a clinical psychologist is 

250
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,270
that you just cannot believe how 
powerful incremental progress is you.

251
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,580
You can do the calculations like it's 
like compound interest,

252
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:53,581
you know,
if you make your life a 10th of a 

253
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:53,750
percent better a week,
man in two or three years,

254
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:58,751
you're,
you're in such a better place than you 

255
00:14:58,751 --> 00:14:59,360
were,
that it isn't even like the same domain.

256
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,000
And if you keep that up for 10 years or 
20 years,

257
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,860
you know,
especially if you're young and you start

258
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:08,861
early,
you start to straighten yourself out 

259
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:08,861
and,
and fix the things that you can fix.

260
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:12,110
You can transform your lives in ways 
that are completely unimaginable.

261
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:17,111
And God only knows what the upper limit 
of that is in terms of human 

262
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:19,130
possibility.
Because we are amazing creatures,

263
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:24,131
you know,
when we really get our act together and 

264
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:24,131
stopped running at 10 percent of our 
capacity.

265
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,320
So,
so,

266
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,860
so that's what you do.
You've got,

267
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,890
you know,
the fact that things aren't exactly the 

268
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:32,890
way they should be,
at least gives you something to do.

269
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,340
You know.
And that's,

270
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,080
that's and,
and,

271
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:40,081
and maybe something great to do because 
there's no shortage of suffering and 

272
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:43,211
trouble that besets the world that you 
could conceivably ameliorate in some way

273
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:48,851
and the utility and meaning the utility 
of that and the intrinsic meaning of 

274
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:54,251
that is self evident.
So it also makes me curious about 

275
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:54,890
nihilism,
for example,

276
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:59,891
in despair,
because I mean I understand those 

277
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:01,250
emotions and understand them deeply and 
the intellectual mindset that goes along

278
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,770
with it,
but they just see beside the point to me

279
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:08,771
in some sense,
because there are so many things that 

280
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:11,321
need doing that all you really have to 
do is open your eyes and look at them 

281
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,070
and then decide that you're actually 
going to do something about them.

282
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,970
And you might think,
well,

283
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,700
what's within my scope of,
of,

284
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,060
of influence is so trivial that it's not
worth doing.

285
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:23,990
It's like it won't stay trivial for long
if you do it not at all.

286
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:25,670
And I don't think it's trivial to begin 
with.

287
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,730
I don't think that any.
I really don't believe that anything 

288
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,131
done right is trivial.
And my experience in my life has been 

289
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:36,851
that anything I actually did paid off it
did didn't pay off necessarily in the 

290
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,940
way that I expected it to pay off.
That's a whole different story.

291
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,120
But if it was genuine commitment to do 
something,

292
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,300
even if it went sideways and the outcome
was really something other than what I 

293
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,511
expected,
the net consequence over time was 

294
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,151
nothing but good.
So every new frontier that can be 

295
00:16:55,151 --> 00:17:00,101
conquered is an advance forward and 
there's no shortage of frontier because 

296
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:01,130
we're surrounded by the unknown.

297
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,130
We're surrounded by our own ignorance 
and we can continually move into that 

298
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:08,000
domain,
into the domain of chaos,

299
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,540
or we can restructure pathological order
and that's,

300
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,640
that's the secret to proper being.
And so then you encounter chaos.

301
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:21,641
That way you know,
and then you can regard yourself as the 

302
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:21,641
sort of entity that despite its 
insufficiency,

303
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,270
has the capability to conquer chaos.
Despite the danger of that.

304
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:31,271
That's the other thing,
because the fact that you're fragile is 

305
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:31,310
actually a precondition for your 
heroism.

306
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:36,311
Because if you weren't fragile,
then there'd be nothing heroic about 

307
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:36,311
doing something difficult.
Right?

308
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:40,181
Because if you couldn't be hurt or 
damaged or defeated or or end up in 

309
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:41,360
failure,
then where's the.

310
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,530
Where's the moral courage in the 
endeavor it had?

311
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,380
It has to be that the fragility is built
into the courage and so it's not a.

312
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:54,381
it's not a reason not to engage in it at
all and in fact quite the contrary and 

313
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,080
so

314
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,660
well and so then you know what do you do
while you put the city back together and

315
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:06,661
maybe the way you want it so that it's 
functional and efficient and beautiful 

316
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:11,281
and so the people can flourish there and
and and flourish in a manner that makes 

317
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:14,400
them,
that makes them what w?

318
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,440
W,
what would you say that makes them feel 

319
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,201
that the unbearable catastrophe of being
is worth it for the experience.

320
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:26,080
That's what you're aiming at and it's 
not an impossibility.

321
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,350
It's not an impossibility,
and then not only that,

322
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:31,570
not only do you repair the city when you
do that,

323
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:36,571
but you make yourself the sort of thing 
that continually repairs the city and 

324
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:39,550
that's even better.
That's the end goal because it's not the

325
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,170
repair of the city.
That's the goal.

326
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:46,171
It's the transformation of yourself into
the thing that continually repairs the 

327
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:50,581
city and so there's just no reason for 
that not to happen and the more it can 

328
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:53,990
happen,
the better.

329
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,540
Well there's A.
There's an under current to this story 

330
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,721
and that is also the story of the flood 
and that's the fact that you know the 

331
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:10,251
city that can become corrupt because 
people don't engage in heroic endeavor 

332
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:11,880
perhaps because they engage in precisely
the opposite of that,

333
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:16,881
which is outright destructive behavior 
and this is also something that's worth 

334
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:18,960
considering too because if you.
If you,

335
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,320
if you consider your your own manner of 
being,

336
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:24,780
you know,

337
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,550
you can say things to people like tell,
tell the truth and be good.

338
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,700
And those are.
Those are cliches obviously and so they 

339
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:39,921
lack power because they're cliches,
but you can take them apart and utilize 

340
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:44,901
them in a manner that stops being a 
cliche and you do that by being more 

341
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,940
humble about them.
I would say because maybe you can't tell

342
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:49,740
the truth because you don't know what 
the truth is.

343
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,770
But one thing you can do is you can 
start saying things that you know to be 

344
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:54,770
untrue,
and you might say,

345
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,550
well,
how do I know that they're untrue?

346
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,470
And the answer to that is,
well,

347
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:03,471
you need a whole philosophy of truth,
the elaboration of an entire philosophy 

348
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:04,920
of truth to answer that question and so 
we're not going to bother answering that

349
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,960
question because in some sense at the 
moment,

350
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:09,000
it's beside the point that isn't the 
issue.

351
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:14,210
The issue is there are times in your 
life where you know that the thing that 

352
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:14,910
you're saying is not true.
It's a deception.

353
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,940
It's a lie of some sort,
and you're using it to manipulate 

354
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,510
yourself or another person or the world 
and you're also possessed,

355
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,760
fully possessed of the idea that you can
get away with it.

356
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,350
And there's a satanic arrogance about 
that.

357
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:31,351
If in fact that is the of arrogance 
that's portrayed in the mythological 

358
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:35,010
character of Satan.
Because Satan is precisely the archetype

359
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,040
of the element of the mind that believes
that it can twist and and banned the 

360
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:44,010
structure reality without paying the 
price for that.

361
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,830
And you can't imagine anything that's 
more arrogant than not because really do

362
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:52,831
you really think that you can twist the 
structure of a reality and that that's 

363
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:54,400
going to work out for you without it 
snapping back?

364
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,560
It's so obvious that that can't work,
that,

365
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,660
that everyone knows it,
but anyways,

366
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:02,580
back to the initial point is that you 
know by,

367
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,890
by the rules of the game that you 
yourself are playing,

368
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,070
that some of the Times you're violating 
the rules of the game that you're 

369
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,800
playing,
and the first issue with regards to say,

370
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,870
stating the truth or behaving in a 
responsible manner would be merely 

371
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:23,770
stopped cheating at whatever game it is 
that you've chosen to play.

372
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,740
That's a good start and that'll 
straightened.

373
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,830
That'll straighten out your life.
It'll start in the street and start to 

374
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,471
straighten out your life.
And so well the flood.

375
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,130
What?
How does the flood tie into this?

376
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:38,000
Well,
you know,

377
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:40,720
we live in a corrupt structure were 
corrupt as individuals.

378
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,740
We live in a corrupt structure and part 
of that corruption has just 

379
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:45,740
happenstance.
It's the way things fall apart.

380
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,920
But the other part of it is that not 
only are we not aiming up,

381
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:53,921
we're actually aiming down and the flood
story is a warning and it's a very clear

382
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:59,021
warning,
and the warning is if you aim down 

383
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:01,220
enough and then if enough of you aimed 
down at the same time,

384
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,340
everything will degenerate into 
something that's

385
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,230
indistinguishable from the chaos from 
which things emerged at the beginning of

386
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:13,150
time.
It's something like that because the,

387
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,250
the,
the cosmos that's presented in in 

388
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:18,700
mythological representations is chaos 
versus order.

389
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:19,960
Right?
The order is on top,

390
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:24,961
you might say in the chaos is always 
underneath and the chaos can break 

391
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:28,261
through or the order can crumble and you
can fall into the chaos and that chaos 

392
00:22:28,261 --> 00:22:28,840
is intermingled,
intermingled potential,

393
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,080
and the way that you destroy the order 
and let the chaos rise back up,

394
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:39,511
which,
which is exactly how it's portrayed in 

395
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:39,511
the flood story,
is by

396
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,860
well,
by inhabiting the corpse of your father.

397
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:46,861
That's one mythological motif and 
feeding on the remains and with no 

398
00:22:46,861 --> 00:22:51,451
gratitude and no attempt to replenish 
what it is that you're taking from and 

399
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:58,050
the warning and the flood story is don't
do that for very long because things 

400
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,881
will happen that are so awful you cannot
possibly imagine it and that'll happen 

401
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,901
to you personally and what happened to 
your family and it'll happen to your 

402
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:09,331
community and it's happened to people 
over and over throughout history and 

403
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:12,440
it's quite interesting.
You know it's very soon after the story 

404
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,530
of Cain and Abel.
When you see evil enter the world in the

405
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:18,160
story of Adam and Eve,
along with self consciousness and evil,

406
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:21,220
there is the ability.
That's the knowledge of good and evil.

407
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:24,150
That's the ability to hurt other people,
self-consciously,

408
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,400
to know what you're doing,
and then of course instantly cane takes 

409
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,791
that to the absolute extreme and he uses
that capacity to to destroy really what 

410
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:33,820
he loves best.

411
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,120
He,
he gets as close as a human being can to

412
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:40,120
destroying the divine ideal because of 
course his brother is able,

413
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,090
enabled,
is favored by God and and destroys them,

414
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:47,390
which cane tells God at the end of that 
episode that his punishment is more than

415
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:50,030
he can bear,
and I think the reason for that is where

416
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:52,400
are you?
Once you destroy your own ideal,

417
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,330
what's left for you?
There's nowhere to go.

418
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,660
There's no op and when there's no APP,
there's a lot of down and you know 

419
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:06,140
there's an idea that was put forth very 
nicely in Milton's paradise lost when he

420
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:09,290
was describing from a psychological 
perspective.

421
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,620
Essentially what hell is hell is your 
inhale to the degree that you're distant

422
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:21,101
from the good,
that that might be a good way of 

423
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:21,860
thinking about it,
and if you destroy your own ideal,

424
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:27,130
which you do with jealousy and 
resentment and and the desire to pull 

425
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,190
down people who you would like to be,
let's say,

426
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,520
then you end up in a situation that's 
indistinguishable from hell and the way 

427
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,270
the story,
the biblical story unfolds as well.

428
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,120
It's,
it's,

429
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,240
it's Cain and then it's the flood,
and so kane adopts this mode of being 

430
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:45,140
that's antithetical to being itself,
at least a positive being itself.

431
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:50,141
He does it voluntarily.
He does it knowing full well what he's 

432
00:24:50,141 --> 00:24:53,411
doing and the net consequence of this 
that as it ripples through the entire 

433
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:56,360
social structure is that God stands back
and says,

434
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,420
this whole thing has got so bad.
The only thing we can do is wipe it to 

435
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,410
the ground and that is.
That is no joke.

436
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,470
That's exactly how things work.
And one of the things that's 

437
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,650
extraordinarily terrifying about that 
sequence of stories,

438
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:14,000
and I believe this to be true.
I think I realized this independently of

439
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,350
any of the analysis that I was doing of 
mythological stories because I looked at

440
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,910
what happened in places like the Soviet 
Union and miles,

441
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:25,930
China and in Nazi Germany and the most 
penetrating observers of those 

442
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,690
societies.

443
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:31,690
The people who are most interested in 
how it was that those absolute 

444
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,950
catastrophes came about.
All said the same thing.

445
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,660
It was rooted in the degeneration of the
individuals who made up the society.

446
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,160
You know,
you hear well,

447
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:45,161
people will fault were following orders.
It's like no that that explanation 

448
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:46,640
doesn't hold water or that you'd be 
punished if you resisted.

449
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:49,310
While there was some truth in that,
but nowhere near as much as people might

450
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:54,311
think,
especially at the beginning of the 

451
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:55,931
process more it was that people decided 
each and every one of them to turn a 

452
00:25:55,971 --> 00:26:00,971
blind eye to the catastrophes and to 
participate in the lies and that worked 

453
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:02,180
the entire societies and they went,
as you know,

454
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,210
they,
they veered their way downward to 

455
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,660
something as closely approximating hell 
as you could hope to manage,

456
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:13,661
especially in places like Nazi Germany 
and well in all three of those places 

457
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:15,170
and in China and in the Soviet Union.

458
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:20,170
And so the thing that's so frightening 
about one of the things that's so 

459
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,580
frightening about the stories in genesis
is they say something very clear,

460
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:27,581
which is that your moral degeneration 
contributes in no small way to the 

461
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:31,910
degeneration of the entire cosmos and 
you say,

462
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:35,090
well,
I would like my life to be meaningful.

463
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:37,850
People say that really?
Would you really?

464
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,740
You really would like your life to be 
meaningful.

465
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:43,100
You think maybe people would trade a 
little nihilism to not have to face that

466
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,720
realization,
and I think people do that all the time.

467
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,050
It's a terrible wait to to to realize,
but we are networked together in the 

468
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,290
price of or let's say that's the 
vulnerability that's associated with our

469
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:03,291
intense capacity to communicate and it 
is certainly possible that the ripples 

470
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:10,221
of our individual actions have 
consequences that are far beyond the 

471
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:14,370
limits of our immediate consciousness 
and I also think people know that too.

472
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,750
They know that in the way that people 
know things when they don't want to know

473
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,640
them,
which means they know them,

474
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,110
embodied,
they can feel them,

475
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:24,540
they can sense them.
They have an emotional response to them,

476
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,660
but there's no damn way they're going to
let them become articulate because they 

477
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,541
don't want to know and when you're 
feeling guilty and ashamed about the 

478
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:36,411
things you've done or not done,
and I know that can get out of hand as 

479
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:39,591
well.
It's often because there is a crooked 

480
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:40,890
little part of you that's aiming at the 
worst possible outcome.

481
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,480
You know,
one of the things you said about the 

482
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:46,480
shadow,
you know,

483
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,131
that young's famous idea that everyone 
has a dark side and that that dark side 

484
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:50,040
needs to be incorporated and made 
conscious.

485
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,660
Young said to the shadow of the human 
being,

486
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,780
reaches all the way to hell,
and he actually,

487
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,960
that's the thing that's so interesting 
about interesting about reading Carl 

488
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,150
young is he actually means what he says.

489
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,100
It's not a metaphor.
It's like the part of you that's twisted

490
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:12,540
against being is aligned with the part 
of the cosmos.

491
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:17,541
Let's say the conscious cosmos that's 
aiming at making everything as terrible 

492
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:21,570
as it can possibly be and you know,
it's a terrible shock to realize that.

493
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:26,571
It's partly why people don't realize 
that it's something that people keep at 

494
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,000
an arm's length.
It's,

495
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,260
it's the same as recognizing yourself as
a Nazi concentration gap camp guard,

496
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:36,261
which is a very useful exercise because 
there's absolutely no reason why you 

497
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:39,810
couldn't have been or still could be one
so.

498
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:45,010
And if you think otherwise,
then all the more reason for assuming 

499
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,961
that you would be unable to resist the 
temptation if it wasn't in fact offered 

500
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:53,011
to you.
And if you don't think it's a 

501
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:54,181
temptation,
then the then there's so much that you 

502
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:55,640
don't know about human beings that 
you're not even in the game.

503
00:28:55,641 --> 00:29:00,641
Because if it wasn't a temptation,
then people bloody well wouldn't have 

504
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:01,040
done it.
And plenty of people did it.

505
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,290
And it's no wonder.
So.

506
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,790
So things get serious in genesis very,
very rapidly.

507
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,360
And,
and the depth of the seriousness is 

508
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,360
ultimate archetipal.
That's it.

509
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,650
It gets as serious as it can get.

510
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:27,570
The story of Noah and the flood opens in
a fragmentary manner.

511
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:32,290
And I believe that these passages are 
part of a longer story,

512
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:37,291
that we only have bits and pieces of it.
And also one that's fragmented in its in

513
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:37,930
its.

514
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,950
It's parts of more than one story.
And it starts like this and it came to 

515
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,591
pass.
When men began to multiply on the face 

516
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:51,481
of the earth and daughters were born 
unto them that the sons of God saw the 

517
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:56,551
daughters of men,
that they were fair and they took them 

518
00:29:56,551 --> 00:29:58,120
wives of all which they chose.
Now there's an idea there.

519
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,900
There's two ways of looking at the past 
and you can kind of see that in the 

520
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,810
political landscape that we inhabit.
Now on the more conservative end of the 

521
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,591
spectrum,
people regard the past as the land of 

522
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:13,591
giants,
right?

523
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:17,220
They were the heroes of the past who 
established the current conditions that 

524
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,151
we exist and then the people on the left
are more concerned perhaps with the,

525
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,660
what would you call it,
with a lineage of corruption that's come

526
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:29,230
down through the centuries and both of 
those perspectives are are are accurate.

527
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,040
You can say,
well,

528
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,220
there were there,
there were the great heroes of the past 

529
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,971
who established our modes of being.
You can think of them as competent 

530
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:38,971
beings if you want.
That's fine.

531
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:42,490
That's a perfectly reasonable way of 
thinking about it and you can also think

532
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:46,780
of the of the accumulation of corruption
and evil that's come along the centuries

533
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:51,781
as well,
and so you see both of those reflected 

534
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:52,210
in these initial few lines that the sons
of gods,

535
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:57,270
so those are the heroes.
So the daughters of men that they were 

536
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:57,670
fair and they took them wives of all of 
which they chose.

537
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Then this statement comes in as somewhat
of a non sequitur and the Lord said,

538
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:10,480
my spirit shall not always strive with 
man for that he is also flesh.

539
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,780
Yet his days shall be 120 years.
And I looked at a variety of 

540
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:20,191
interpretations of that line because it 
doesn't seem to follow so clearly from 

541
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:22,300
the previous line and exactly what it 
means isn't obvious,

542
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:25,030
but it seems to be.

543
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:30,070
The first line talks about the heroes of
the past and and this.

544
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,340
The second line says,
well,

545
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:36,410
wait a second.
There's something corrupt about the 

546
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,491
human mode of being and one of the 
consequences of that as far as God is 

547
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:41,920
concerned,
is that there are conditions under which

548
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,880
the divine spirit will not strive with 
man.

549
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:50,910
What?
What that means is there are conditions 

550
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,251
under which let's say the.
I don't think there's any other way of 

551
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,890
putting it is the divine impulse towards
the good will abandon you because of 

552
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,331
things that you've done and then the 
secondary consideration here is that 

553
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,340
perhaps because of the disc degeneration
of people,

554
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,100
it's not so obvious here that our 
lifespans are limited,

555
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:10,070
that the,
that the,

556
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:15,130
that the spirit that inhabits us will 
only do so for a limited amount of time 

557
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,600
and that's tangled in a strange way in 
with the idea of human moral culpability

558
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,050
and that's posed against the notion of 
the giants of the past.

559
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,160
And then it returns to the giant idea.
That narrative returns to the giant idea

560
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,400
and reads.
There were giants in the earth in those 

561
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,281
days and also after that,
when the sons of men came in unto the 

562
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:35,410
daughters of men and they bare children 
to them.

563
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,470
The same became mighty men,
which were of old men of renown,

564
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,430
and that that's the end of that sequence
of fragments.

565
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:48,431
It's very broken,
but you can see a dual narrative 

566
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:50,630
underneath it.
And,

567
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:56,590
and one of the narratives is that 
there's the kind of corruption despite 

568
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,260
the giant,
the nature of the giants of the past.

569
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:05,261
There's the kind of corruption lurking 
that would cause God to withhold his 

570
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:09,890
grace and allow men to deteriorate.
And,

571
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,040
and that sets the stage for Noah and the
flood.

572
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,960
And God saw that the wickedness of man 
was great in the earth and that the,

573
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,020
and that every imagination of the 
thoughts of his heart was only evil 

574
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,540
continually.
You know,

575
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,420
one of the things I really didn't like 
about going to church when I was a kid,

576
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,390
I went to a pretty moderate church.
It was the United Church,

577
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,340
which has hardly even become a church 
now.

578
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:37,190
It's so moderate,
so to speak.

579
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Um,
one of the things I didn't like was the 

580
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,371
constant harping by the ministry on the 
sinful nature of human beings like it.

581
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,820
It didn't speak to me properly,
partly because I really didn't 

582
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:52,820
understand what it meant.
Um,

583
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,140
and partly because it seemed

584
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,870
well sort of,
what would you say was self-flagellating

585
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:05,970
in an an attractive way?
I don't know if there is an attractive 

586
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:06,680
way to be self-flagellating,
but there was,

587
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,880
it was,
and there was something about it that 

588
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,030
was also wrote and fake that I didn't 
like,

589
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,630
but you know,
in later years I thought about that more

590
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:21,631
and I started to understand that there 
was some real utility in asking people 

591
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
to keep the evil that they're doing 
clear and conscious in the forefront of 

592
00:34:28,781 --> 00:34:33,781
their imagination.
I think I mentioned to you guys last 

593
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,990
week that this little episode from what 
we know of Mesopotamian culture 

594
00:34:37,421 --> 00:34:40,060
surrounding the emperor,
the New Year's festival,

595
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,560
they would take the emperor outside of 
the walled city and strip him of his

596
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:51,050
garb so that he was reduced to just an 
ordinary man and then humiliate them 

597
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:56,031
richly and then ask him how it was over 
the last year that he wasn't a 

598
00:34:56,941 --> 00:35:01,941
spectacular embodiment of Marduk.
Marduk was the Mesopotamian daddy who 

599
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:06,050
made order out of chaos essentially.
And the emperor was supposed to sit and 

600
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,050
think,
okay,

601
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,450
well,
you know,

602
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,820
I'm emperor and everything.
I should be doing a good job.

603
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:13,821
Maybe I should even be doing a great job
and probably I'm coming up short and a 

604
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:17,931
bunch of ways and that actually happens 
to be important since I'm running the 

605
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:17,940
entire show.
I should be very,

606
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:22,941
very cognizant of how I'm failing to 
live up to the ideal.

607
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,990
And that is what that call that constant
clarion call that's degenerated,

608
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:30,060
I would say an institutional 
Christianity.

609
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,340
That was actually the idea was,
look,

610
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:37,341
there's a bunch of ways that you're not 
being everything you could be and it is 

611
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:39,270
not supposed to be a to try to knock you
down.

612
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,210
Although maybe it's a whip to knock down
your pride.

613
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:44,910
The pride that stops you from being 
aware of your insufficiencies.

614
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,510
It's more like a call to the opposite.
It's like,

615
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,840
well,
you should stop doing those things 

616
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,120
because you could be so much more than 
you are and that would be so much better

617
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,830
for you and everyone else.
That is just.

618
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,890
It's just not good that you continue 
doing these things.

619
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,170
Continue Breaking your own rules,
let's say,

620
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,740
because we could certainly,
as I said,

621
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:09,741
we could start this game by assuming 
that you should at least play the game 

622
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:12,531
that you're playing straight and so,
and it is the case that if you watch 

623
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:16,080
yourself,
it's a terrifying thing to do.

624
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,250
But if you watch yourself,
you'll see you lie a lot.

625
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,480
Like when I learned this to begin with,
I was in my twenties and I was.

626
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,570
I'm a smart person and I was very proud 
of that because I was also a small 

627
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:33,120
person.
I was moved ahead one year in school and

628
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,800
I was a small person

629
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:40,750
to begin with.
And so as a very small person in my 

630
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,540
classes and also very mouthy,
which might not come as much of a 

631
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,470
surprise and somewhat provocative.
And so you know,

632
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,650
and I got pushed around a fair bit 
because pete,

633
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:52,690
everybody gets pushed around and my 
weapon was to be mouthy and it was a 

634
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,300
fairly effective weapon.
Although tended to backfire because,

635
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,420
you know,
if you're really effectively mouthy with

636
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:58,460
large,
obnoxious people,

637
00:36:58,461 --> 00:37:01,910
then they tend to respond in a 
relatively negative physical way.

638
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:06,440
And so that sort of thing was happening 
to me a fair bit and but I was quite,

639
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,660
I was quite proud of the fact that I 
was,

640
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,970
that I,
I was,

641
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,620
I had some intellectual power

642
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,090
and

643
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:20,420
darn it was then in my twenties when I 
learned about some of the danger of that

644
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:25,421
because I started to read partly 
Milton's paradise lost and I started to 

645
00:37:25,421 --> 00:37:29,591
understand the,
the danger of the intellect and the 

646
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:30,890
danger of the intellect as far as I can 
tell,

647
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:35,891
is that it tends towards pride and 
arrogance and it also tends to fall in 

648
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:37,950
love with its own productions.
And so that's actually Lucifer in,

649
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:38,380
in,
in,

650
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,040
in paradise lost.
That's Lucifer.

651
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:45,041
Lucifer is the intellect that falls in 
love with its own productions and then 

652
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,730
assumes that there's nothing outside of 
what it thinks.

653
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,130
That's the totalitarian mentality,
right?

654
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:54,131
It's like we have a total system and we 
know how everything works and we're 

655
00:37:54,131 --> 00:37:55,640
gonna implement it and that'll bring 
about heaven on earth.

656
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:57,400
Right?
That's that say that.

657
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:02,460
That's the totalitarian mindset and 
that's associated with intellectual 

658
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,500
arrogance and

659
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,900
another at the same time.
Another thing that was happening to me,

660
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:13,901
so I was noticing that I started to 
understand what that meant and I also 

661
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:16,910
started to understand that there was 
more to life than the intellect,

662
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,090
much more because I smoked too much and 
I drank too much and I weighed like 130 

663
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,690
pounds.
I wasn't in good physical shape and like

664
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:28,870
I had a lot of things to do when I went 
to graduate school to put myself 

665
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,010
together and at the same time I was 
trying to understand why things had gone

666
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:36,011
so crazily wrong with the world.
It's encapsulation in the cold and what 

667
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:37,720
role I might be playing in that,
if any,

668
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:39,640
or what role any of us were playing in 
that.

669
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,420
Um,
at the same time I was working at a 

670
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:50,980
prison only a little bit.
I worked with this crazy psychologist.

671
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,440
Um,
he,

672
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,050
he used to put jokes on is multiple 
choice tests.

673
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,300
Uh,
he was a really eccentric guy,

674
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:01,030
but I really liked his courses.
He and he,

675
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:06,150
he taught a course on creativity and he 
was also a prison psychologist and he 

676
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,111
was an eccentric guy and he for some 
reason liked me and maybe because I was 

677
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:13,651
eccentric to and he invited me to go out
to the Edmonton maximum security prison 

678
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:14,170
with them a couple of times,
which I did.

679
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,200
And that was a very interesting 
experience because I was trying to 

680
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,111
figure out what role each individual's 
behavior bore to the pathology of the 

681
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:31,681
group with something like that.
And I went out there and I met a little 

682
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,400
guy smaller than me.
I was a little bigger by then and he was

683
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:39,010
a pretty innocuous guy.
And uh,

684
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,250
what had happened was I was out in this 
gymnasium,

685
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,080
it looks like a high school,
the prison,

686
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,210
which is really quite telling in my 
estimation,

687
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:51,211
but,
and there were all these like monsters 

688
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:51,211
in their weight weightlifting and like 
they were monsters.

689
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:56,130
I remember one guy who was tattooed 
everywhere and he had like a huge scar 

690
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,101
running down the middle of his chest.
It looked like someone had to hit them 

691
00:39:59,101 --> 00:39:59,101
with an ax and you know,
and,

692
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:03,180
and I was in there and I had this Weird 
Cape that I used to wear that I bought 

693
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,781
and Portugal and some boots that went 
along with it and yeah,

694
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,570
it was like an 1890 sherlock Holmes Cape
and it was really like,

695
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:15,571
it was from the eighties and nineties 
because this little village was up on a 

696
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:18,601
hill.
It was a walled city on a hill and they 

697
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:19,240
sold these things and I don't think they
changed the style since 1890.

698
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,700
And so I thought they were really cool 
and so I was wearing that,

699
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:26,701
which wasn't perhaps the most 
conservative garb to dawn if you're 

700
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:35,011
going to wear,
if you're going to go to a maximum 

701
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:35,011
security prison.

702
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:37,590
So anyways,
I was in the gymnasium and the 

703
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,470
psychologist,
the psychologist left and God only 

704
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:40,470
knows.
I mean that's what he was like.

705
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,900
And all these guys came around.
All these guys came around me,

706
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:48,901
you know,
and they were offering to trade their 

707
00:40:48,901 --> 00:40:51,300
prison clothes for my cape and he was 
like,

708
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,010
I was being made an offer.
I couldn't refuse,

709
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:54,880
you know,
and so I didn't,

710
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,240
I didn't really know what to do and then
this little guy said something like 

711
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,490
that,
the psychologist sent me to come and 

712
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,030
take you away or something like that.
And so I thought,

713
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:08,110
well better this little guy then all 
these monsters.

714
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:12,850
So we went outside the gym through some 
doors,

715
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,420
like school doors.
We had outside the gym into the exercise

716
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:21,421
yard I guess,
and we're wandering along and he was 

717
00:41:21,421 --> 00:41:21,421
talking to me and he seemed like a kind 
of an innocuous guy.

718
00:41:21,421 --> 00:41:25,000
And then the psychologist showed up at 
the door and motioned us back and so,

719
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:30,330
which was kind of a relief.
And so I went into his office and he 

720
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:30,330
said,
you know,

721
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,000
that guy that you walked out in the yard
with?

722
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:31,690
And I said,
yeah.

723
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:33,130
He said he,
uh,

724
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,860
he took two cops one night and he had 
them kneel down and while they were 

725
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,070
begging for their lives,
he shot them both in the back

726
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,930
they had.
And I thought,

727
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,020
hmm.
That's.

728
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,040
See,
the thing that was so interesting was 

729
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,040
that he was so innocuous,
right?

730
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,960
Because what you'd hope is that someone 
like that would be very much unlike you,

731
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:59,990
let's say,
and certainly wouldn't be like somewhat 

732
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,840
innocuous that you'd met.
What you'd want is that the guy would be

733
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:01,330
like,
you know,

734
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,220
half world wolf and half vampire so you 
could just tell right away that he was a

735
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:06,960
cold blooded killer.
But no,

736
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:11,961
he was this sort of ineffectual little 
guy who was certainly not ineffectual if

737
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:13,890
you gave him a revolver and the upper 
hand.

738
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,820
And so.
So that made me think that made me think

739
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:22,560
a lot about the relationship between 
being innocuous and being dangerous.

740
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:27,561
And then another thing happened.
I met another guy out there and then a 

741
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:31,050
week or two later I heard that he and a 
friend of his head held another guy down

742
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,950
and pulverized his left leg with a lead 
pipe,

743
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,910
like just

744
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,930
pulverized it.
And the reason for that was that they 

745
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:41,930
thought that he was a snitch and maybe 
he was.

746
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,120
And that that time I did something 
different instead of being shocked and 

747
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,360
horrified by that.
Although I certainly was.

748
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,690
I thought,
how in the world could you do that?

749
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,400
Because I didn't think I could do that,
hey,

750
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,680
I didn't think that.
I thought that there was a qualitative 

751
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,071
distinction between me and those people 
and so I spent about two weeks trying to

752
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:06,720
see if I could figure out under what 
conditions I could do that,

753
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:11,930
like what kind of psychological 
transformation I would have to undergo 

754
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,740
to be able to do that.
And so that was a meditative exercise,

755
00:43:13,741 --> 00:43:16,890
let's say,
and it only took about 10 days for me to

756
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:21,891
realize that not only could I do that,
that it would be a hell of a lot easier 

757
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:21,891
than I thought it would be.

758
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:26,990
And that's sort of where that wall 
between me and what you describe is the 

759
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:30,231
shadow started to fall apart and that 
also was very useful because I started 

760
00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:35,631
to wreck.
I started to treat myself as somewhat 

761
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:36,480
different entity because I hadn't been 
aware up to that point,

762
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,740
you know,
because I thought I was a good guy and 

763
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,090
there's no reason for me to think that 
because you're not a good guy unless you

764
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:43,950
really made a bloody effort to be a good
guy.

765
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:49,010
You're just not.
It's not easy and so you're probably a 

766
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,580
moderately bad guy and that's a long 
ways from being an absolutely horrible 

767
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,351
guy,
but it's also a long ways from being a 

768
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:59,781
good guy and so,
but I had a little more respect for 

769
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:02,241
myself after that because I also 
understood that there was a monstrous 

770
00:44:02,311 --> 00:44:07,311
element to the human psyche that re that
you needed to respect and that was part 

771
00:44:08,821 --> 00:44:12,270
of you that you should regard yourself 
in some sense as a loaded weapon.

772
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,420
It's very useful around children to 
regard yourself as a loaded weapon 

773
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,730
because around children you are a loaded
weapon and the terrible experiences that

774
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:23,190
many children have with their parents 
are testament to that.

775
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:26,690
Anyways,

776
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:32,810
about the same time,
I don't exactly how these things were 

777
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:36,801
causally related.
I guess it was because I was trying to 

778
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:39,660
figure out who I was and how that could 
be fixed.

779
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Something like that.
I started to pay very careful attention 

780
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,291
to what I was saying.
I don't know if that happened 

781
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:51,921
voluntarily or involuntarily,
but I could feel a sort of split 

782
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:54,831
developing in my psyche and the split 
and I've actually had students tell me 

783
00:44:54,831 --> 00:44:58,641
the same thing has happened to them 
after they've listened to some of the 

784
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:01,140
material that,
that I've been describing to all of you,

785
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,940
but split into two,
let's say.

786
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,780
And one part was the,
let's say the old me that was talking a 

787
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,951
lot and that liked to argue and that 
liked ideas and there was another part 

788
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:21,861
that was watching that part,
like just with it's eyes open and 

789
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:26,480
neutrally judging and the part that was 
neutrally judging was watching the part 

790
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:29,760
that was talking and going,
that isn't your idea.

791
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,530
You don't really believe that you don't 
really know what you're talking about.

792
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,440
That isn't true.
And I thought,

793
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,700
hmm,
that's really interesting.

794
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:43,701
So now,
and that was happening to like 95 

795
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:43,701
percent of what I was saying and so then
I didn't really know what to do.

796
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:44,160
I thought,
okay,

797
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:45,990
this is strange,
so maybe I've,

798
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,630
I've fragmented and that's just not a 
good thing at all.

799
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,780
I mean,
it wasn't like it was hearing voices or 

800
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:53,780
anything like that.
I mean,

801
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,050
it wasn't like that.
It was,

802
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,700
it was.
Well,

803
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,450
people have multiple parts,
so then I had a weird conundrum.

804
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:01,530
It's like,
well,

805
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:06,531
which of those two things are me?
Is it the part that's listening and 

806
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:06,960
saying,
no,

807
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,240
that's rubbish.
That's a lie.

808
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:11,970
That's you're doing that to impress 
people.

809
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:13,800
You're just trying to win the argument,
you know,

810
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,750
was that me or was the part that was 
going about my normal verbal business?

811
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:22,350
Me and I didn't know,
but I decided I would go with the critic

812
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,560
and then what I tried to do,
what I learned to do I think was to stop

813
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:32,571
saying things that made me weak and now 
that I mean I'm still trying to do that 

814
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:38,241
because I'm always feeling when I talk,
whether or not the words that I'm saying

815
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:41,850
are either making me a align or making 
me come apart,

816
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,710
and I think the alignment.
I really do think the alignment is.

817
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,930
I think alignment is the right way of 
conceptualizing it because I think if 

818
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,350
you say things that are as true as you 
can say them,

819
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,290
let's say,
then they come up,

820
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:01,190
they come out of the depths inside of 
you because we don't know where it 

821
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,300
thoughts come from.
We don't know how far down into your 

822
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:04,300
substructure.
The thoughts emerge.

823
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:09,080
We don't know what processes have 
physiological alignment are necessary 

824
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,440
for you to speak from the core of your 
being.

825
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,080
We don't understand any of that.
We don't even conceptualize that,

826
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:16,680
but I believe that you can feel that and
I learned some of that from reading Carl

827
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,070
Rogers,
by the way,

828
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:22,071
who's a great clinician because he 
talked about mental health in part as a 

829
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:23,480
coherence between the,
the,

830
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:28,630
the spiritual or the or the abstract and
the physical that the two things were 

831
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,811
aligned and,
and there's a lot of idea of alignment 

832
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:33,010
in,
in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking.

833
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,820
But anyways,
I decided that I would start practicing 

834
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,970
not saying things that would make me 
weak.

835
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,240
And what happened was that I had to stop
saying almost everything that I was 

836
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,411
sick.
I would say 95 percent of it as a hell 

837
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:50,770
of a shock to wake up and mean.
This was over a few months,

838
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:55,771
but it's a hell of a shock to wake up 
and realize that you're mostly dead 

839
00:47:55,771 --> 00:47:55,771
wood.

840
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,390
It's a shock,
you know,

841
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,170
and you might think,
well,

842
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:00,820
do you really want all of that to burn 
off?

843
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:01,300
It's like,
well,

844
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:02,830
there's nothing left,
but a little husk,

845
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:04,210
five percent of you.
It's like,

846
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:07,840
well,
if that five percent is solid,

847
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,020
then maybe that's exactly what you want 
to have happen.

848
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,960
Well,
so I told you that story is an 

849
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,831
elaboration of this line,
and God saw that the wickedness of man 

850
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:22,621
was great in the earth and that every 
imagine have the imagination of the 

851
00:48:22,621 --> 00:48:25,711
thoughts of his heart was only evil 
continually to question worth asking 

852
00:48:25,711 --> 00:48:29,290
just exactly what are your motives?
Well,

853
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:34,380
you know,
maybe they're purer than mine were and 

854
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,781
it's certainly possible.
I don't think that I'm naturally a 

855
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:37,900
particularly good person.
I think I have to work at it very,

856
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:41,800
very hard and I don't necessarily think 
that everyone is like that,

857
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,730
but some people are worse than that.

858
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:51,630
And everyone's like that to some degree.
So it's worth thinking about just how 

859
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:55,840
much trouble are you trying to cause,
you know,

860
00:48:55,841 --> 00:49:00,841
and the other thing you might think 
about is that if you're not doing 

861
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:00,970
something important with your life by 
your own definition,

862
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,800
because that's the game that we're 
playing,

863
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:05,290
you get to define the terms at least 
initially,

864
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:11,070
maybe you're prone to cause trouble just
because you don't have anything better 

865
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,390
to do because at least it's trouble is 
more interesting than boring.

866
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:18,930
You know,
that's something you learn if you read 

867
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:18,930
Dostoevsky,
does Tsq knew that extraordinarily well?

868
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:23,610
And so if you're not doing something,
if you're not pushing yourself to the 

869
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:24,790
limits of your capacity,
then you have plenty of leftover.

870
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:31,380
What would you say will power,
energy and resources to devote to 

871
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,310
causing interesting trouble?
And so well.

872
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,910
So I would say this is also an 
archetypal scenario.

873
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:42,210
God saw that the wickedness of man was 
great in the earth and that every 

874
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,360
imagination of the thoughts of his heart
was only evil continually.

875
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:49,530
That's something to meditate on and it's
not self destructive because what it is,

876
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:53,080
is an attempt to.
It's like the diagnosis of an illness.

877
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:56,560
It's like if that does happen to be the 
case for you or to some degree,

878
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,390
maybe it's only 10 percent of you or 
something,

879
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:03,391
or maybe it's 90 percent.
Well then coming to terms with that is 

880
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,021
excellent because then maybe you can 
start doing it and what would be the 

881
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:09,700
downside to that?
You'd have to give up your resentment,

882
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:11,380
obviously in your hatred and all of 
that,

883
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:13,870
and that's really annoying because those
emotions are very.

884
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:19,110
They're easy to engage in in there and 
they're engaging and they have this 

885
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,270
feeling of self righteousness with them 
and that goes along with them,

886
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,290
but you're not doing this.
In order to put yourself down.

887
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:31,291
You're doing this in order to separate 
the wheat from the chaff and to leave 

888
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:32,690
everything that you don't have to be 
behind,

889
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,060
and it repented the Lord that he had 
made man on the earth and it grieved him

890
00:50:43,061 --> 00:50:45,100
at his heart,
and the Lord said,

891
00:50:45,101 --> 00:50:48,070
I will destroy man whom I've created 
from the face of the earth,

892
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:53,550
both man and beast and the creeping 
thing and the fowls of the air for 

893
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:53,550
repentance.
Me That I've made them.

894
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,570
What's the idea?
Well,

895
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:59,350
the idea is that the cosmos that God 
created has become corrupt,

896
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,800
and that's a funny thing because you 
know this is the other thing about 

897
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,480
genesis that always hits me,
is that that's also true.

898
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,440
I told you that the Mesopotamians 
believed that human beings were made out

899
00:51:11,441 --> 00:51:14,920
of the blood of king,
knew who was the worst monster monster.

900
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:19,090
That the dragon of chaos could imagine.
That's a pretty harsh diagnosis,

901
00:51:19,091 --> 00:51:24,091
but,
but the reason the Mesopotamians 

902
00:51:24,091 --> 00:51:25,330
believed that is because they knew as 
did the authors of Genesis,

903
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:30,280
that human beings are the only creatures
in the cosmos.

904
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:34,870
Let's say the cosmos of being who are 
actually capable of deceit,

905
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,850
conscious deceit,
and malevolence,

906
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:42,810
and the question is,
to what degree does the expression of 

907
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:46,381
that conscious deceit and malevolence 
corrupt things so badly that it would be

908
00:51:46,511 --> 00:51:48,730
better that they didn't exist at all?

909
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,240
Well,
you see stories.

910
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,510
There's a story associated with this in 
the epic of Gilgamesh,

911
00:51:56,511 --> 00:52:01,511
associated with the flood that has 
exactly the same underlying narrative 

912
00:52:01,511 --> 00:52:01,511
structure.
In fact,

913
00:52:01,511 --> 00:52:02,840
some people think the story of Noah was 
derived from it,

914
00:52:02,841 --> 00:52:07,841
where the gods who created repented of 
their creation and determined that 

915
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,410
erasing it would be better than allowing
it to propagate.

916
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,200
And you see the same thing in the 
Mesopotamian creation myth.

917
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:20,170
Enuma elish because the early gods,
so they're representatives of,

918
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,880
of the giants of humanity,
I would say,

919
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:28,450
make so much noise and are so careless 
that the original creator God timeout in

920
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:34,210
her concert time,
Matt decides to wipe them from the face 

921
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,471
of the earth.
And so when you read something like 

922
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:45,191
this,
if you read it from an informed 

923
00:52:45,191 --> 00:52:47,861
historical perspective,
it starts to have a depth that makes it 

924
00:52:47,861 --> 00:52:52,630
transcend the sort of archaic and fairy 
tale like element of the story.

925
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:58,271
It's like I've read some very terrible 
things about what happened in Nazi 

926
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,720
Germany and what happened when the 
Japanese invaded China and just what 

927
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,250
happened generally in the history of 
mankind.

928
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:12,420
Things can get so bad that it takes the 
imagination of a very bad person to 

929
00:53:12,551 --> 00:53:17,530
conceptualize them and when they get 
that bad,

930
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,230
this is the only kind of language that 
works to describe them.

931
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:25,860
You know,
that's another thing that I've 

932
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,870
discovered working with my clinical 
clients is when their lives are really 

933
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,640
not going well,
you know,

934
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:35,660
when they're close to suicide or when 
they're close to homicide or when there 

935
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:40,671
are things going on in the family that 
are so corrupt and terrible that they 

936
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:44,031
reached back generations and they're 
aimed at nothing but misery and 

937
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:47,241
destruction.
The only language that suffices has a 

938
00:53:47,241 --> 00:53:50,640
religious tone because there's nothing 
else that's available to describe what's

939
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:53,010
happening with the proper level of 
seriousness.

940
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:58,310
And it might be that you've never 
encountered a situation that required 

941
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:02,211
that level of seriousness,
but that doesn't mean that those 

942
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:02,211
situations don't exist.

943
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:07,160
They exist.
You generally do everything you can to 

944
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,971
avoid being ensconced in them,
but they certainly do exist in the 

945
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:12,240
probability that you'll encounter a 
situation like that.

946
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:17,241
Or two,
at some point in your life is 

947
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:19,161
extraordinarily high.
You'll tangle with someone who's 

948
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:21,660
malevolent right to the core,
and maybe it'll be you that is,

949
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,200
and that'll be a big shock.
And then these sorts of things,

950
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:29,040
these sorts of poetic descriptors start 
to become much more real.

951
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,270
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the 
Lord.

952
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:39,170
These are the generations of Noah.
Noah was a just man and perfect in his 

953
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:41,550
generations.
And Noah walked with God.

954
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,940
That's an interesting line because if 
you remember back in the story of Adam 

955
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,331
and Eve,
what happens to Adam once he eats the 

956
00:54:50,331 --> 00:54:54,710
fruit of the tree,
of the knowledge of good and evil and 

957
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:55,320
wakes up the scales fall from his eyes,
become self conscious,

958
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:59,040
develops the knowledge of good and evil 
is he won't walk with God when God calls

959
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:04,041
him in the garden and so noah is Adam 
without the fall essentially,

960
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,590
and there's something that Noah was 
doing right that

961
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:15,340
motivates God to spare him or maybe to 
show him a pathway through the emergent 

962
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,160
chaos,
something like that,

963
00:55:16,161 --> 00:55:21,161
and that's worth thinking about a lot 
because there will be situations in your

964
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:26,351
life where what you face is the emergent
chaos and maybe that'll be some terrible

965
00:55:26,361 --> 00:55:30,410
catastrophe inside your family or maybe 
it'll be something that's occurring on a

966
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:35,411
much broader social level,
but the chaos is coming and what you're 

967
00:55:35,871 --> 00:55:38,120
going to want to know.
Unless you want to be a dentist and have

968
00:55:38,121 --> 00:55:41,330
the chaos or even a contributor to it 
and perhaps that is what you want.

969
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:44,600
Because many people under those 
circumstances choose that.

970
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:51,910
What you want is to know how you build 
an Ark and get through it.

971
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:57,680
That's what you.
If you're,

972
00:55:57,681 --> 00:56:01,730
if you're interested in life,
if you're interested in proper being and

973
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,870
you're disinclined to produce any more 
suffering,

974
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:10,871
the necessary,
then you want to know how to conduct 

975
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:13,031
yourself when the catastrophe comes so 
that you have a reasonable possibility 

976
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:17,560
of of moving through it and starting a 
new.

977
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,920
So when when this old story says,
well,

978
00:56:23,211 --> 00:56:25,430
God's not happy and he's going to wipe 
everything out.

979
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:26,540
It's like,
well,

980
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:28,310
you might want to take that seriously

981
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:36,640
and then when it says,
but there's one person who had a motive 

982
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,001
being that protected him from that.
That's also something you might want to 

983
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:43,181
take seriously because you might want to
know what that mode of being is because 

984
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:46,900
you might need to use it,
and so these sorts of things are 

985
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,751
practical in the deepest possible sense.
They're real in the deepest possible 

986
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:51,710
sense and practical in the deepest 
possible sense.

987
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,760
So Noah walked with God.
Now I'm going to switch way ahead here 

988
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:03,370
because I said at the beginning of the 
lecture series that the Bible is a 

989
00:57:06,171 --> 00:57:11,171
hyperlinked text and everything refers 
to everything else and so there's 

990
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:14,990
utility in reading it in linear order,
but it's not a linear document.

991
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,070
It's a document that

992
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,390
that you can move through in an infinite
number of.

993
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:26,560
There's an infinite number of pathways 
that you can use to walk through it and 

994
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,300
all of the document expands upon and 
refers to all of the rest of the 

995
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,940
document and so I'm going to search 
switch to the sermon on the mount,

996
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:39,941
which I think is probably the key 
document in the New Testament and I'm 

997
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:44,321
going to switch to it because I think 
it's the closest thing we have to a 

998
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:49,481
fully articulated description of what it
would mean to walk with God so that 

999
00:57:50,421 --> 00:57:52,850
you're in the Ark.
When the flood comes.

1000
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:58,630
It's the.
It's the most fully articulated 

1001
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,920
realization of that idea that that leaps
out of the metaphorical.

1002
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,220
Because if I say,
well,

1003
00:58:02,221 --> 00:58:03,980
you should conduct yourself like,
no,

1004
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:08,981
and walk with God and build an Ark.
Obviously those are poetic and 

1005
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:13,070
metaphorical suggestions and it's not 
that easy to bring them into practice,

1006
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:13,370
right?

1007
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:18,370
It's the distance.
There's a big distance between you and 

1008
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,491
the archetype.
It isn't obvious how to manifest it in 

1009
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:24,071
your own life and what has to happen is 
the archetype has to be differentiated 

1010
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:28,661
in articulated so that it becomes 
sufficiently practical and personal so 

1011
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:33,521
that you can actually implement it.
So I'm going to take apart some of the 

1012
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:36,371
sermon on the mount.
It starts in Matthew five and I'm not 

1013
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:39,911
going to talk about Matthew Five.
I'm going to talk about the end of 

1014
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:42,671
Matthew six and most of matthew seven.
Consider the lilies of the field,

1015
00:58:43,581 --> 00:58:45,290
how they grow.
They toil.

1016
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:50,291
Not Neither do they spin,
and yet I say unto you that even Solomon

1017
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,930
in all his glory was not arrayed like 
one of these.

1018
00:58:55,750 --> 00:59:00,750
Wherefore,
if God so clothes the grass of the 

1019
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:00,750
field,
which today is and tomorrow is cast into

1020
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,730
the oven,
shall he not much more clothe you.

1021
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,800
Oh Ye of little faith.
Therefore,

1022
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:10,801
take no thought saying what shall we eat
or what shall we drink or wherewithal 

1023
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:14,941
shall we be closed?
Those are famous lines and that sort of 

1024
00:59:14,941 --> 00:59:16,090
Christ the Hippie,
right?

1025
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:17,890
It's like,
Hey,

1026
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,350
let it all hang out.
It's an old phrase,

1027
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:26,590
do your thing and everything will come 
to you and these lines have been 

1028
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:32,711
interpreted in that manner many times,
but that's seriously not the proper 

1029
00:59:34,881 --> 00:59:39,881
interpretation because there's a kicker 
with this injunction and the kicker is 

1030
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:45,941
this,
for your heavenly father knows that you 

1031
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:51,160
have need of all these things,
but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and

1032
00:59:51,161 --> 00:59:53,620
his righteousness and all these things 
shall be added unto you.

1033
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,900
That's a lot different than the hippie 
thing,

1034
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,570
right?
Because there's a very,

1035
00:59:58,571 --> 01:00:00,550
very,
very interesting idea here.

1036
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:05,551
It's,
it's certainly one of the most profound 

1037
01:00:05,551 --> 01:00:07,360
ideas that I've ever encountered and the
idea is this,

1038
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:12,450
is that if you configure your life so 
that what you are genuinely doing is 

1039
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:18,720
aiming at the highest possible good,
then the things that you need to

1040
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:25,850
to survive and to thrive on a day to day
basis will deliver themselves to you.

1041
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,040
That's a hypothesis and it's not some 
simple hypothesis,

1042
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:34,290
right?
Because what it basically says is if you

1043
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:37,290
dare to do the most difficult thing that
you can conceptualize,

1044
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,840
your life will work out better than it 
will.

1045
01:00:39,841 --> 01:00:42,060
If you do anything else.
Well,

1046
01:00:42,061 --> 01:00:43,470
how are you going to find out if that's 
true?

1047
01:00:43,471 --> 01:00:45,750
Well,
it's a Kierkegaardian leap of faith.

1048
01:00:45,751 --> 01:00:50,751
There is no way you're gonna.
Find out whether or not that's true 

1049
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:52,701
unless you do it so no,
no one can tell you either because just 

1050
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:56,670
because it works for someone else.
I mean that's interesting and all that,

1051
01:00:56,671 --> 01:00:58,380
but it's no proof that it'll work for 
you.

1052
01:00:58,381 --> 01:01:03,381
You have to be all in in this game,
and so the idea is seek ye first the 

1053
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:09,200
Kingdom of God and his righteousness.
It's like that's actually a fairly 

1054
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,231
important caution when you're talking 
about not having to pay attention to 

1055
01:01:12,811 --> 01:01:17,811
what you're going to eat or what you're 
going to where it's like what it's 

1056
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:21,381
essentially saying is that those 
problems are trivial in comparison and 

1057
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:24,180
the probability is that if you manifest 
yourself properly in the world,

1058
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:28,710
that those things will come your way is 
extraordinarily high and I believe,

1059
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,450
I believe that that's exactly right.

1060
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:31,110
I mean,
I,

1061
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,600
I've,
I've watched people operate in the world

1062
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:38,630
and I would say that there is no more 
effective way of operating in the world 

1063
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:45,230
then to conceptualize the highest good 
that you can and then strive to attain 

1064
01:01:45,331 --> 01:01:50,331
it.
There's no more practical pathway to the

1065
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:55,050
kind of success that you could have if 
you actually knew what success was.

1066
01:01:56,430 --> 01:02:01,430
And so that's what this,
that's what this sermon is attempting 

1067
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:01,430
to,

1068
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:05,920
to pause it.
It's like in,

1069
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:10,921
in the story of Pinocchio.
You know what happens at the beginning 

1070
01:02:10,921 --> 01:02:12,720
of the story of Pinocchio is that Japan 
auto wishes on a star.

1071
01:02:12,721 --> 01:02:17,721
We talked about that a little bit and so
what you pedal does is align himself 

1072
01:02:17,721 --> 01:02:21,890
with the metaphorical manifestation,
the highest good he can conceptualize 

1073
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,260
and say,
he says he makes sure he makes a 

1074
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:30,470
commitment.
Let's say he aims at the star and for 

1075
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,570
him the star is the possibility that he 
can take his creation,

1076
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:38,780
a puppet whose strings are being pulled 
by unseen forces and have it transform 

1077
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:42,660
into something that's our economists and
real.

1078
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:43,780
Yeah,

1079
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,880
well that's a hell of an ambition.
You know when we're wise enough to put 

1080
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,481
that into children's movie,
but too foolish to understand what it 

1081
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:56,351
means.
It's such an interesting juxtaposition 

1082
01:02:56,351 --> 01:02:56,630
that that we can both know that and not 
know it.

1083
01:02:56,631 --> 01:02:58,640
At the same time you can go to the 
movie,

1084
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:03,641
you can watch it and it makes sense,
but that doesn't mean that you can go 

1085
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:03,641
home and think,
well,

1086
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:05,360
I know what that meant.
While people are complicated,

1087
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:07,160
right?
We exist at different levels and all the

1088
01:03:07,161 --> 01:03:08,750
levels don't communicate with one 
another,

1089
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:13,751
but.
But the movie is a hypothesis and the 

1090
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:17,471
hypothesis is there's no better pathway 
to self realization and the enablement 

1091
01:03:18,501 --> 01:03:23,501
of being than to pause it.
The highest good that you can conceive 

1092
01:03:23,501 --> 01:03:26,510
of and commit yourself to it.
And then you might also ask yourself,

1093
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:30,320
and this is definitely worth asking,
is do you really have anything better to

1094
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:32,090
do?
And if you don't,

1095
01:03:32,091 --> 01:03:37,091
well why would you do anything else?
Therefore take no thought for the 

1096
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,630
morrow,
for the moral shall take thought for the

1097
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:42,780
things of itself sufficient unto the day
is the evil thereof.

1098
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:49,120
I spend a long time trying to figure out
what that man to because it's another 

1099
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:49,120
one of those lines

1100
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:55,150
can easily be read as pro grasshopper 
and anti amped.

1101
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:01,380
You know,
you remember the old fable of the 

1102
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:01,380
grasshopper and the end.
Maybe not,

1103
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,720
I'm not going to tell it,
but that works.

1104
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:08,200
And the grasshopper fiddles and the aunt
has a pretty good time in the winter and

1105
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:13,201
the grasshopper dies.
And so this is like a pro grasshopper 

1106
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:16,771
line,
but it's not because it says something 

1107
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:19,021
else.
It says that if you orient yourself 

1108
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:19,021
properly

1109
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:24,370
and then pay attention to what you do 
every day that works and it.

1110
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:29,470
I actually think that that's in 
accordance with what with what we have 

1111
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:32,441
come to understand about human 
perception because what happens is that 

1112
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:36,230
the world shifts itself around your aim 
because you're.

1113
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:41,290
You're a creature that has an aim.
You have to have an ame in order to do 

1114
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:41,290
something.
You're aiming creature.

1115
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:44,030
You look at a point and you move towards
it.

1116
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,180
It's built right into you and so you 
have a name.

1117
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:52,181
Well,
let's say your aim is the highest 

1118
01:04:52,181 --> 01:04:53,621
possible ame.
Well then so that sets up the world 

1119
01:04:53,621 --> 01:04:53,621
around you.
It,

1120
01:04:53,621 --> 01:04:58,290
it organizes all of your perceptions.
It organizes what you see and you don't 

1121
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:02,171
see.
It organizes your emotions and your 

1122
01:05:02,171 --> 01:05:02,360
motivations.
So you organize yourself around that aim

1123
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:07,361
and then what happens is the day 
manifests itself as a set of challenges 

1124
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,620
and problems and if you solve them 
properly,

1125
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:14,890
then you stay on the pathway towards 
that eighth and you can concentrate on 

1126
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:14,890
the,
on the,

1127
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:19,330
on the day,
and so that way you get to have your 

1128
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:19,330
cake.
And eat it because you can,

1129
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:23,490
you can point into the distance,
the far distance and you can live in the

1130
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:23,650
day

1131
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,630
and it seems to me that that's.
That makes every moment of the day 

1132
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:34,231
supercharged with meaning that that's 
because if everything that you're doing 

1133
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:36,070
everyday is related to the highest 
possible aim,

1134
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:37,870
that you can conceptualize,
well,

1135
01:05:37,871 --> 01:05:42,871
that's the very definition of the 
meaning that would sustain you in your 

1136
01:05:42,871 --> 01:05:43,750
life well,
and then the issue is well back to Noah,

1137
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:46,750
well all hell is about to break loose 
and chaos is coming.

1138
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,370
It's like when that's happening in your 
life,

1139
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:53,610
you might want to be doing something 
that you regard as truly worthwhile 

1140
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,710
because that's what will keep you afloat
when,

1141
01:05:55,830 --> 01:06:00,830
when everything is flooded and you don't
want to wait until the flood comes to 

1142
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:07,111
start doing that.
Because if you're arcs half built and 

1143
01:06:07,111 --> 01:06:11,041
you don't know how to captain it,
the probability is very high that that 

1144
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:15,940
you'll drown.
Take therefore no thought for the moral,

1145
01:06:18,431 --> 01:06:21,640
but for the morrow shall take thought 
for the things of itself,

1146
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:24,910
sufficient unto the day is the evil 
thereof.

1147
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:29,960
That's not a particularly optimistic 
formulation,

1148
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,330
judge,
not that you be not judged for with what

1149
01:06:36,331 --> 01:06:41,331
judgment you judge.
You shall be judged and with what 

1150
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:41,331
measure you meet.
It shall be measured to you.

1151
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:41,331
Again,

1152
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,360
to sensible piece of.
It's a sensible description.

1153
01:06:48,361 --> 01:06:53,361
I wouldn't call it a piece of advice 
because I don't think that any of this 

1154
01:06:53,361 --> 01:06:55,981
is advice.
It's a description of the structure of 

1155
01:06:55,981 --> 01:06:58,041
reality that's not the same as advice 
and it basically says that you'll be 

1156
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:01,590
held accountable by the rules of the 
game that you choose to play

1157
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:08,500
and that I also think is perfectly in 
keeping with what we understand about 

1158
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,910
human psychology because you you are 
playing.

1159
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:15,970
You have to play a game that other 
people will allow you to play and that 

1160
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:18,851
will cooperate with you while you're 
playing and that will compete with you 

1161
01:07:18,851 --> 01:07:21,461
while you're playing it,
but you have a fair bit of flexibility 

1162
01:07:21,461 --> 01:07:21,461
in setting up the parameters of the 
game,

1163
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:26,530
but you don't have any choice about 
whether or not you're going to be in a 

1164
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:29,141
game.
You're in a game and you're going to be 

1165
01:07:29,141 --> 01:07:32,531
held accountable by the rules of the 
game because that's how the game works 

1166
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:37,510
and so you might want to pick a game by 
whose rules you would be willing to be 

1167
01:07:38,481 --> 01:07:43,481
held accountable and why be hold us Dow,
the moat that isn't my brother's eye,

1168
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:49,321
but consider it's not the beam that is 
in dire or how will you say to that,

1169
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:54,631
I brother,
let me pull out the motive out of the 

1170
01:07:54,631 --> 01:07:54,631
Nih and behold,
a beam is in nine Onei.

1171
01:07:54,631 --> 01:07:56,710
What you might be wondering,
what a b medicine,

1172
01:07:57,970 --> 01:08:02,970
a moat is,
the dust speck and a beam is a very 

1173
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:06,070
large piece of lumber and so the issue 
is

1174
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:12,210
not so much the blindness of others even
though there's as much blindness among 

1175
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:17,911
others as there is as there is for you.
But the issue here,

1176
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:24,310
the advice here,
the description here is you should be 

1177
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,671
concerned about what's interfering with 
your own vision first and you should 

1178
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:29,720
leave other people.
The hell alone in relationship to that.

1179
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:34,100
And so if you're a mode of being in the 
world is if you would just act better,

1180
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:39,101
things would improve for me.
Or if you identify the evil and the 

1181
01:08:39,621 --> 01:08:44,621
catastrophe is something that's outside 
that someone else needs to fix or that 

1182
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,550
someone's responded to someone else's 
responsible for,

1183
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:51,820
then then you're not going to fix that 
and you're going to remain blind to the 

1184
01:08:59,231 --> 01:09:02,620
things that you're doing and not doing 
that make things not go well.

1185
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,650
And so it's just better to think,
all right,

1186
01:09:05,651 --> 01:09:10,651
I'm probably blind in many,
many ways and maybe there are some ways 

1187
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:15,060
that I could rectify that because it's 
highly probable that you're blind and 

1188
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:15,060
all sorts of ways.
I mean it's,

1189
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:20,051
it's in fact it's virtually certain and 
so it's just more useful to think,

1190
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,120
how is it that I'm wrong in this 
situation?

1191
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,990
I'll tell you something that I learned 
to do when I was arguing with my wife,

1192
01:09:27,991 --> 01:09:32,991
which happened quite frequently.
Because when you actually communicate 

1193
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:38,001
with people,
you find out that there's many things 

1194
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:39,951
that you don't agree on and that's 
because you are actually different 

1195
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:42,801
creatures.
And so if you're actually going to have 

1196
01:09:42,801 --> 01:09:45,531
a truthful conversation,
then you're going to find out that you 

1197
01:09:45,531 --> 01:09:48,441
don't see things the same way and then 
you can either pretend that that's not 

1198
01:09:48,441 --> 01:09:52,581
the case in gloss over it and then ended
up in a 30 year silent war or you can or

1199
01:09:54,721 --> 01:09:59,721
you can have the damn fight when you 
need to have it and see if you can 

1200
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:02,901
straighten it out.
So now and then we'd get into a 

1201
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:06,731
situation where we were at loggerheads,
we couldn't move and it would spiral up 

1202
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,080
into hate speech,
let's say,

1203
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:14,400
because yeah,
everyone laughs because they know they 

1204
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:14,930
manifest plenty of hate speech towards 
those they love.

1205
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:20,500
So one of the things we learned to do 
was when we hit an impasse was to 

1206
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:25,040
separate and to go our own ways and to 
go sit and think,

1207
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:25,970
okay,
look,

1208
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,840
we're at this

1209
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,010
unpleasant situation.
We can't figure out how to move forward.

1210
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,340
I'd always think,
of course it's her fault.

1211
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:39,170
Obviously it's her fault.
Least Ninety five percent.

1212
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:44,500
But maybe there was something I did that
contributed like five percent to it.

1213
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,090
And so I would sit and think and ask 
myself a question,

1214
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:55,570
which was,
is there anything I did in the last six 

1215
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:57,770
months that increase the probability 
that this impasse would manifest itself?

1216
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,980
And I'll tell you,
you have no idea how fast your mind will

1217
01:11:00,981 --> 01:11:05,981
generate an answer to a question like 
that because there's undoubtedly some 

1218
01:11:05,981 --> 01:11:07,010
idiotic thing that you did that you 
know,

1219
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:12,011
that you remember,
that increased the probability that 

1220
01:11:12,011 --> 01:11:12,800
you're going to have your hands around 
the throat of the person that you love.

1221
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:17,160
And then you can go tell them that and 
then you can have a conversation,

1222
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,020
especially if they do the same thing.

1223
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:19,770
Say,
look,

1224
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:24,771
you know,
here's how I'm an idiot in this 

1225
01:11:24,771 --> 01:11:24,780
situation.
Now there person says,

1226
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:25,590
well,
yeah,

1227
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,030
it's,
here's how I'm an idiot,

1228
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:29,730
and then your two idiots and then maybe 
you can have a conversation.

1229
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,860
So thou hypocrite first cast out the 
beam of light out of I know,

1230
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:39,861
and I,
and then shalt thou see clearly to cast 

1231
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:39,861
out the mote of my brothers.
I,

1232
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:44,430
that's pay hard to argue with that ask.
And it shall be given you.

1233
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:49,491
Seek and Ye shall find knock and it 
shall be opened unto you for everyone 

1234
01:11:49,491 --> 01:11:53,061
that Asketh receive it and he that 
seeketh findeth and to him that hath it 

1235
01:11:53,061 --> 01:11:55,770
shall be opened.
That sounded pretty optimistic again,

1236
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,170
but,
but again,

1237
01:11:58,171 --> 01:12:02,110
I think it's a description of the 
structure of existential reality and and

1238
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,050
by,
by which I mean

1239
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:12,350
when I'm in my clinical practice and I 
observe and this is also the case with 

1240
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:15,531
my students,
is let's say people's lives aren't what 

1241
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:17,580
they would like them to be.
And so then you ask why?

1242
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:23,090
Well,
forget about tragedy and catastrophe 

1243
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,090
because that's self evident and we're 
not gonna discuss that.

1244
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:29,450
Although the degree to which you bring 
about your own tragedy is always 

1245
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:33,400
indeterminant,
but I would never say that every 

1246
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,210
terrible thing that is visited on a 
person is something they deserved.

1247
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:39,240
I think that that's a very dangerous 
presupposition,

1248
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:42,480
especially because everyone gets sick 
and everyone dies,

1249
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,490
but one of the main reasons that people 
don't get what they want is because they

1250
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:55,491
don't actually figure out what it is and
the probability that you're going to 

1251
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,060
get.
What would be good for you.

1252
01:12:57,061 --> 01:12:58,800
Let's say,
which would even be better than what you

1253
01:12:58,801 --> 01:12:59,550
want,
right?

1254
01:12:59,551 --> 01:13:04,551
Because you know,
you might be wrong about what you want 

1255
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:04,620
easily,
but maybe you could get.

1256
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:08,320
What would really be good for you?
Well,

1257
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,260
why don't you.
Well,

1258
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,900
because you don't try.
You don't think,

1259
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:13,380
okay,

1260
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:19,830
here's what I would like if I could have
it and I don't mean I don't mean in a 

1261
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:24,811
way that you manipulate the world to 
force it to deliver you good for status 

1262
01:13:24,811 --> 01:13:26,590
or something like that.
That isn't what I mean.

1263
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:31,920
I mean something like imagine that you 
were taking care of yourself like you 

1264
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,550
were someone you actually cared for and 
then you thought,

1265
01:13:33,551 --> 01:13:35,410
okay,
I am caring for this person.

1266
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,170
I would like things to go as well for 
them as possible.

1267
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:43,440
What would their life have to be like in
order for that to be the case where 

1268
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,070
people don't do that?
They don't sit down and think,

1269
01:13:45,071 --> 01:13:45,540
all right,
know,

1270
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:46,750
let's,
let's figure it out.

1271
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,650
You're,
you've got a life.

1272
01:13:47,651 --> 01:13:49,180
It's hard.
Obviously.

1273
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:52,660
It's like three years from now you can 
have what you need.

1274
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:57,590
You got to be careful about it.
You can't have everything you can have,

1275
01:13:57,591 --> 01:14:02,591
what would be good for you,
but you have to figure out what it is 

1276
01:14:02,591 --> 01:14:02,591
and then you have to aim at it.

1277
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:06,140
Well,
my experience with people as being as if

1278
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,890
they figure out what it is that would be
good for them and then they aim at it,

1279
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,290
then they get it and it's strange 
because they don't know.

1280
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,600
It's a strange thing.
It's not quite that simple because you 

1281
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,871
know you may formulate an idea about 
what would be good for you and then you 

1282
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:24,751
take 10 steps towards that and you find 
out that your formulation was a bit off 

1283
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:25,210
and so you have to reformulate your 
goal.

1284
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:29,290
So you're kind of going like this as you
move towards the goal.

1285
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:34,590
But a huge part of the reason that 
people fail is because they don't ever 

1286
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:38,730
set up the criteria for success.
And so since success is a very narrow 

1287
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:43,351
line in very unlikely,
the probability that you're going to 

1288
01:14:43,351 --> 01:14:45,841
stumble on it randomly is zero.
And so if there's a proposition here in 

1289
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:49,870
the proposition is if you actually want 
something,

1290
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,100
you can have it.

1291
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,140
Now the question then would be,
well,

1292
01:14:55,141 --> 01:15:00,141
what do you mean by actually want?
And the answer is that you reorient your

1293
01:15:00,481 --> 01:15:05,481
life in every possible way to make the 
probability that that will occur as 

1294
01:15:07,171 --> 01:15:10,050
certain as possible and that's a 
sacrificial idea,

1295
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,060
right?
It's like you don't get everything.

1296
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:18,050
Obviously you obviously,
but maybe you can have what you need and

1297
01:15:18,361 --> 01:15:21,120
maybe all you have to do to get it is 
ask,

1298
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:26,570
but asking isn't a whim or today's wish.
It's like you have to be deadly serious 

1299
01:15:29,551 --> 01:15:30,510
about it.
You have to think,

1300
01:15:30,511 --> 01:15:34,020
okay,
like I'm taking stock of myself and if I

1301
01:15:34,021 --> 01:15:39,021
was going to live properly in the world 
and I was going to set myself up such 

1302
01:15:39,091 --> 01:15:42,540
that being would justify itself in my 
estimation,

1303
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,950
and I don't mean as a harsh judge 
exactly what is it that I would aim at?

1304
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:52,970
Well,
one of the things I've found is that in 

1305
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:56,600
test of this theory,
let's say you can try this.

1306
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:02,850
This is a form of prayer knocking.
Sit on your bed one day and ask 

1307
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:07,501
yourself,
what's what remarkably stupid things am 

1308
01:16:07,991 --> 01:16:11,410
I doing on a regular basis to absolutely
screw up my life,

1309
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:15,730
and if you actually asked that question,
but you have to want to know the answer,

1310
01:16:15,731 --> 01:16:20,731
right,
because that's actually what asking the 

1311
01:16:20,731 --> 01:16:20,731
question means.
It doesn't mean just mouthing the words.

1312
01:16:20,731 --> 01:16:22,750
It means you have to decide that you 
want to know.

1313
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,870
You'll figure that out so fast.
It'll make your hair curl.

1314
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,290
It's as if young thought about this,
he saw it.

1315
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:36,560
He thought that people had two poles of 
consciousness in one was the individual 

1316
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,290
consciousness that we each identify 
within.

1317
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:39,890
The other was something he called the 
self and the self is the.

1318
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:42,510
You might think about it as the divine 
within.

1319
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:47,720
That's close enough approximation.
It's the universal part of your 

1320
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:48,510
consciousness.
It's your conscience.

1321
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:52,260
That's another way of thinking about it.
Whatever your conscience is,

1322
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,650
but it's something that you can consult.
It's like the Socratic Damon.

1323
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,800
Socrates said that the thing that made 
him different than everyone else in 

1324
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,150
Greece was that he consulted his demon,
his genius.

1325
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:07,770
He asked himself how it was that he 
should conduct himself in the world,

1326
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,950
and then he did that,
whatever it was,

1327
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,450
he didn't try to force a solution.
You know,

1328
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:14,960
he didn't try to force a solution.
Selfishly,

1329
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:18,140
he asked,
I'm going to manifest myself in the best

1330
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:20,450
possible manner in the world.
I would like to do that.

1331
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:25,930
What would that be?
While you're perfectly capable of 

1332
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:29,711
thinking,
God only knows how you're perfectly 

1333
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:32,651
capable of immense feats of imagination 
and dreams and fantasies.

1334
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:38,560
God only knows how you do all of that.
What would happen if you consulted 

1335
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,200
yourself about the best possible outcome
for you?

1336
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,690
You might get an answer,
well,

1337
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:43,190
that's what this proposition is

1338
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,910
have or what man is the review.
Who if his son asks for bread,

1339
01:17:52,911 --> 01:17:55,040
will give him a stone or if he asks for 
a fish,

1340
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:58,730
will give him a serpent if he then being
evil,

1341
01:17:58,731 --> 01:18:00,740
know how to give good gifts unto your 
children.

1342
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,960
How much more shall your father,
which is in heaven,

1343
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:06,740
give good things to them that ask him,
well,

1344
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:09,380
this is a question about the fundamental
nature of being,

1345
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:15,100
I suppose and one of the hypotheses in 
the new testament which is different.

1346
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,760
It's a different hypothesis in some 
sense than the one that structures the 

1347
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,631
old testament is that faith bakes being 
good.

1348
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,040
It's a very interesting proposition and 
so the notion would be,

1349
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:34,800
and it it's an action oriented issue as 
well.

1350
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:39,420
You act out the proposition that if you 
act properly in the world,

1351
01:18:39,421 --> 01:18:41,730
that being will reveal itself to you as 
benevolent,

1352
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,450
but you will not know.
You'll never know unless you do it.

1353
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:51,170
So this is a call to that.
Act out the proposition that if you act 

1354
01:18:51,181 --> 01:18:54,090
properly,
that being itself is benevolent.

1355
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:03,330
There's no reason to assume the 
contrary.

1356
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,600
I mean to assume the contrary.
It would be to be as cynical and bitter 

1357
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,870
as possible and it's not like we don't 
have reason for that.

1358
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,720
It's not like I don't understand why 
that happens to people.

1359
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:19,620
Therefore all things whatsoever you 
would that men should do to you.

1360
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:24,650
Do you even,
so to them for this as the law and the 

1361
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,640
prophets and that's a reciprocity issue,
right?

1362
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:31,641
It's like while imagine what would be.
This is another thing I learned from 

1363
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:34,080
young because young reverse this because
this is often read,

1364
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:37,950
it's the golden rule.
It's often read is be nice to be nice to

1365
01:19:37,951 --> 01:19:42,951
other people.
It's like that is not what this rule 

1366
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:44,901
means.
It doesn't mean that even a little bit 

1367
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:47,540
it means something like and we'll 
reverse it so that will concentrate on 

1368
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,060
you rather than the other person to 
begin with.

1369
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:55,240
It means something like conceptualize 
how things could be great if they were 

1370
01:19:58,071 --> 01:20:03,071
great for you,
if you were taking care of yourself and 

1371
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,290
then work to make that the case for 
everyone else.

1372
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:09,760
You know?
You see that in Buddhism because Buddha 

1373
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:09,760
reached Nirvana,
right?

1374
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,850
That's the theory and then he.
He was tempted with offer to stay there 

1375
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,400
and he rejected that offer and came back
to the profane world because he felt 

1376
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:24,210
that the attainment of nirvana was 
insufficient unless everyone attained it

1377
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:27,000
simultaneously and so it's something 
like that,

1378
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:32,390
but it's treat yourself properly.
That's a hard thing to do because you're

1379
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,750
a fallen,
shameful,

1380
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,030
cowardly,
deceitful,

1381
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,200
malevolent,

1382
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,890
mortal creature,
and so it's not easy and you know it and

1383
01:20:45,891 --> 01:20:49,800
it's not easy to treat something like 
that properly and and,

1384
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:55,220
and it isn't obvious that people treat 
themselves better than they treat other 

1385
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:55,460
people.
I don't think that's obvious at all,

1386
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:57,500
but maybe you could start with yourself 
and think,

1387
01:20:57,501 --> 01:21:00,080
okay,
I'm going to take care of myself as if I

1388
01:21:00,081 --> 01:21:05,081
have value.
What would that look like and then I'm 

1389
01:21:05,081 --> 01:21:05,660
going to work to extend that courtesy to
everyone else.

1390
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:07,520
And that's.
Well,

1391
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:13,180
the hypothesis here is that if you take 
all of the moral wisdom that mankind has

1392
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,300
generated over,
it's millennia of struggle,

1393
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:23,740
evolved and then manifested metaphor,
story and then codified into law,

1394
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:30,400
articulated law,
and you pick one principle that 

1395
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,880
dominated all of that.
This would be the principal

1396
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:41,460
and it's interesting too because it's 
the law and the prophets and the law is 

1397
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,060
the rules,
but the prophets or the process by which

1398
01:21:43,061 --> 01:21:45,030
the rules are being updated,
right?

1399
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:50,060
So the profits are a superordinate in 
some sense to the law and the 

1400
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:54,031
proposition that set forth in this 
particular statement is that this maxim 

1401
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:59,100
which is optimize your own mode of being
and then work to do the same for 

1402
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:02,170
everyone around you,
is not only the thing that's at the core

1403
01:22:02,171 --> 01:22:04,360
of the law,
but it's at the core of the process that

1404
01:22:04,361 --> 01:22:06,130
generates it updates the law

1405
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:14,380
to hell of a thing for someone to say,
enter ye in at the narrow gate,

1406
01:22:14,691 --> 01:22:19,691
because that's what straight means.
Enter ye in at the straight gate for 

1407
01:22:19,691 --> 01:22:20,930
wide is the gate and broad is the way 
that leads to destruction.

1408
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:26,140
Well,
who in the world could possibly argue 

1409
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:26,140
with that?
Every one in their right mind knows that

1410
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:30,281
there's a million ways of doing things 
wrong and one way if you're lucky to do 

1411
01:22:30,281 --> 01:22:32,090
things right,
and so the notion that it's a very,

1412
01:22:32,091 --> 01:22:35,780
very narrow pathway that you tread upon 
if you're doing things right.

1413
01:22:35,781 --> 01:22:37,790
That's,
that's wisdom.

1414
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:44,500
That's the line between chaos and order 
that you're supposed to be on 

1415
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:44,500
constantly,
right?

1416
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:48,611
It's a very,
very thin line because if you're a 

1417
01:22:48,611 --> 01:22:48,830
little bit too far in one direction,
then it's too much chaos and if you're a

1418
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:53,831
little too far in the other direction 
that it's too much order and both of 

1419
01:22:53,831 --> 01:22:53,831
those aren't good,
it has the balance,

1420
01:22:53,831 --> 01:22:58,421
has to be exactly right and you can feel
that and I truly believe you can feel 

1421
01:22:58,421 --> 01:22:59,570
that and I think it's your deepest 
instinct.

1422
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:01,790
It's your deepest instinct that I mean 
that.

1423
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:05,120
I mean that biologically.
I don't mean that metaphorically.

1424
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:10,350
I think that your psyche is arranged to 
exist in a cosmos that's composed of 

1425
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:15,990
chaos and order.
I think that's why you have the 

1426
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:15,990
hemispheric structure that you have 
this.

1427
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:20,160
This is deeper than metaphor and then 
when you feel as if you're meaningfully 

1428
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:24,520
engaged in the world,
when the terror of your mortality strips

1429
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:28,180
away and you're engaged and it's 
timeless,

1430
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:33,630
that's the deepest instinct you have 
telling you that you're in the right 

1431
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:38,101
place at the right time and then what 
you do is practice being their practice 

1432
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:42,901
being there and that's that.
That narrow spot that's so difficult to 

1433
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:42,901
find.
You wander around it,

1434
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:44,410
maybe if you're lucky,
you can watch,

1435
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,120
you can watch.
This is an experiment.

1436
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:51,360
Watch yourself for two weeks like you 
don't know who you are because you 

1437
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:51,360
don't.

1438
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,440
So watch yourself for two weeks and 
notice there's gonna be times when 

1439
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,510
things are proper there,
raid properly for you.

1440
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:59,470
It's not easy to notice because when 
they're arrayed like that,

1441
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:01,670
you're so engaged.
You don't exactly notice,

1442
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:02,920
you know,
but you'll see,

1443
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:04,150
oh,
I'm in the right place.

1444
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:04,900
It's like,
okay,

1445
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:07,810
how'd I get here?
What am I doing right?

1446
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:13,630
You know,
how is it that this could happen more 

1447
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:13,630
often?
I'd like this to happen more often.

1448
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:15,550
How would I have to conduct myself in 
order for that to happen more often,

1449
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
and then you practice that and then 
maybe instead of 10 minutes a month or 

1450
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,330
10 minutes a week,
it's like 15 minutes a day and then it's

1451
01:24:22,331 --> 01:24:25,540
half an hour a day and then it's an hour
a day and then it's four hours a day and

1452
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:28,270
maybe if you're.
If you're extraordinarily careful,

1453
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:33,220
then you get to a point where you're 
like that a good proportion of the time,

1454
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:40,520
because straight is the gate and narrow 
is the way which leadeth unto life and 

1455
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:43,641
few there be that find it.
You were a false prophets which come to 

1456
01:24:45,091 --> 01:24:47,880
you in sheep's clothing,
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

1457
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:51,420
That's particularly good advice for 
today's political situation.

1458
01:24:51,421 --> 01:24:52,080
I can tell you,

1459
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:58,310
you shall know them by their fruits.
Do men gather grapes,

1460
01:24:58,311 --> 01:25:03,311
have thorns or figs of thistles even so 
every good tree bringeth forth good 

1461
01:25:03,471 --> 01:25:08,471
fruit,
but a corrupt tree bring forth evil 

1462
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:08,471
fruit?
Well,

1463
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:13,271
that's what I learned from studying the 
history of totalitarianism in the 20th 

1464
01:25:13,271 --> 01:25:17,291
century is that a corrupt tree brings 
forth evil fruit and that's for sure.

1465
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:25,550
It's so funny.
You know people who think when they're 

1466
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:28,640
thinking about the relationship with 
divinity or their relationship with God,

1467
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:32,270
they think it's a primitive and childish
way of thinking.

1468
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:37,570
What if a miracle just manifest?
Why kind a miracle just manifest itself 

1469
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:38,390
and I would be convinced,
and the funny thing is,

1470
01:25:38,391 --> 01:25:41,270
is first of all actually you wouldn't be
if a miracle actually happened,

1471
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,790
you would actually forget about it and 
about six months,

1472
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,710
that's I mean you'd think that's not 
true,

1473
01:25:45,711 --> 01:25:50,711
but it's true.
You would actually forget about it 

1474
01:25:50,711 --> 01:25:51,320
because that's what people are like,
but there are negative miracles that are

1475
01:25:51,321 --> 01:25:55,010
happening all the time which actually 
lend some credence to my supposition and

1476
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:00,160
we don't pay any attention to that.
If we can't learn from what happened in 

1477
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,311
the 20th century,
then we are absolutely incapable of 

1478
01:26:03,311 --> 01:26:06,131
learning because what in the 20th 
century was as bitter a set of lessons 

1479
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:11,270
as you could possibly imagine,
and it's associated precisely with this.

1480
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:13,940
A corrupt tree bringeth forth evil 
fruit.

1481
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:16,100
A good tree cannot bring forth evil 
fruit.

1482
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,590
Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth 
good fruit.

1483
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:27,990
Every tree that bringeth forth that 
bringith not forth good fruit is hewn 

1484
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:31,390
down and cast into the fire will.
That's a flood motif right there.

1485
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:35,530
It's like we're constantly the archetype
of the tree.

1486
01:26:35,531 --> 01:26:38,570
That's the archetype of being the 
architect.

1487
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:39,640
Of the self often,

1488
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:47,040
what's the warning here is that if 
you're mostly dead wood,

1489
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,640
you're going to get,
you're going to burn up and you can 

1490
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:52,640
think about that metaphysical.
You can.

1491
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:57,530
You can project that into eternity and 
you can think about that as a form of 

1492
01:26:57,530 --> 01:27:01,341
hell.
And the funny thing is is that when 

1493
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,501
that's happening to you in real time,
it is like an eternity in hell.

1494
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,970
It's a perfectly reasonable way of 
thinking about it,

1495
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:09,000
but you can strip the metaphysical 
elements off and you can say,

1496
01:27:09,001 --> 01:27:11,670
well,
if you're mostly dead wood,

1497
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:16,650
then a spark will light you on fire,
and that's also very much worth thinking

1498
01:27:16,651 --> 01:27:19,560
about.
Wherefore by their fruits shall you know

1499
01:27:19,561 --> 01:27:22,410
them.
Not everyone that say a fun to me,

1500
01:27:22,411 --> 01:27:27,030
Lord shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven,
but he that doeth the will of my father,

1501
01:27:27,031 --> 01:27:32,031
which is in heaven.
That's an interesting line.

1502
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:32,640
I think.

1503
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:36,900
I mean one of the proper critiques of 
Traditional Christianity.

1504
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:41,901
Maybe this is the sort of critique that 
needs you to put forth was that 

1505
01:27:41,901 --> 01:27:44,250
Christianity had degenerated and its 
moral mission.

1506
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:47,640
Young was a little bit more sympathetic 
and I'll tell you why in a minute,

1507
01:27:47,641 --> 01:27:52,641
but niches idea was that Christianity 
had lost its way when it generated the 

1508
01:27:53,911 --> 01:27:58,911
presupposition that humanity was saved 
in some final sense by the sacrifice of 

1509
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:06,501
Christ.
It meant that the work was already done 

1510
01:28:06,501 --> 01:28:06,501
and that,
and I'm,

1511
01:28:06,501 --> 01:28:11,470
I'm being.
I'm being harsh in my judgment for the 

1512
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:15,831
purpose of rhetorical simplification,
but the idea was that if you just 

1513
01:28:15,901 --> 01:28:18,180
professed faith that that had already 
occurred,

1514
01:28:18,181 --> 01:28:22,410
then you were granted eternal salvation.
It's like,

1515
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:28,640
well,
it's not so straightforward and I think 

1516
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:28,640
that that's what this line actually 
represents.

1517
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,391
It says,
how do you enter into the Kingdom of 

1518
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:33,880
Heaven?
And again,

1519
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:38,940
you can think about that under the 
aspect of eternity or you can think 

1520
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:41,580
about it as a psychological statement 
and the answer is quite straightforward,

1521
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:41,980
is that

1522
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,570
you

1523
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:50,900
do what Noah did to make him immune from
the flood and that's to walk with God 

1524
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:57,380
and that's what this sermon is about.
It's laying out the practical elements 

1525
01:28:57,380 --> 01:29:02,271
of that and the practical elements are 
aim at the highest possible.

1526
01:29:03,391 --> 01:29:07,380
Good and play that out in the world.
And then

1527
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:13,530
you may have the opportunity to inhabit 
the highest possible good that you're 

1528
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:16,270
positing into existence.
Perhaps not,

1529
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,870
but you can't think of any more 
practical way of going about that.

1530
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:25,110
I mean,
if you build a house that maybe you can 

1531
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,110
live in it,
if you don't build a house,

1532
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,110
you're not going to be able to live in 
it.

1533
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,310
If you build a good house,
then you'll be able to live in a house.

1534
01:29:27,311 --> 01:29:32,311
And if you build a perfect house,
then maybe you can live in a perfect 

1535
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:35,071
house.
But if you just say that the house has 

1536
01:29:35,071 --> 01:29:37,771
already been built for you and that you 
can just say that the house is being 

1537
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:42,241
built for you,
well then the probability that you're 

1538
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:45,751
going to be able to live where you need 
to live is there's no probability that 

1539
01:29:45,751 --> 01:29:46,210
you're going to be able to live where 
you need to live.

1540
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:49,390
Many will say to me in that day,
that's the judgment day.

1541
01:29:49,391 --> 01:29:54,391
Lord,
have we not prophesied in thy name and 

1542
01:29:54,391 --> 01:29:56,840
the name,
have cast out devils in the [inaudible] 

1543
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:56,840
name,
done many wonderful works.

1544
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,750
And then I will profess unto them,
I never knew you,

1545
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:02,020
depart from me,
you that work iniquity.

1546
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:05,660
See,
that's judgment day.

1547
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:10,661
You know?
That's an archetypal idea and partly 

1548
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:15,631
it's archetipal because everyday is 
judgment day and the part of you that 

1549
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,070
the part of you that's equivalent to the
logo,

1550
01:30:19,071 --> 01:30:21,650
say the part of you,
that's your own ideal,

1551
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:26,060
sits in eternal judgment on your 
inequity,

1552
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:30,030
and that's the con.
That's the source of guilt and shame and

1553
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:35,480
and and withdrawal and then resentment 
and then murderousness and then 

1554
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:42,081
genocide.
It's because you can intuit the ideal 

1555
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:48,481
and the problem with intuiting,
the ideal is that an ideal is always a 

1556
01:30:48,481 --> 01:30:48,481
judge.

1557
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:53,630
There are no difference between an ideal
and the judge and so you're eternally 

1558
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:53,790
judged by your own ideal.
If you have no idea,

1559
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:56,370
well then you've got no direction and no
meaning in your life.

1560
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,280
And then of course the more extreme,
the ideal,

1561
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:03,690
the harsher the judge.
That's actually why young young was very

1562
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:08,691
curious about why the book of revelation
was tacked onto the Bible because the 

1563
01:31:08,691 --> 01:31:11,910
book of revelation,
that's a very weird book and you know in

1564
01:31:11,911 --> 01:31:12,930
in,
in the Gospels,

1565
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:15,930
Christ is I would say perhaps primarily 
merciful.

1566
01:31:15,931 --> 01:31:20,931
There,
there's a maybe a war in his character 

1567
01:31:20,931 --> 01:31:24,231
between truth and mercy,
but it's one of the two perhaps mercy 

1568
01:31:24,231 --> 01:31:27,740
and Young's observation was the gospel.
Christ was to merciful and that's why 

1569
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:31,800
the book of revelation was tapped on,
tacked onto the new testament because in

1570
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:33,510
the book of revelation,
Christ,

1571
01:31:33,511 --> 01:31:35,790
who's the ideal,
who's above the pyramid,

1572
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:40,791
right?
The transcendent ideal is nothing but a 

1573
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:43,521
judge and everyone fails,
and of course the ultimate ideal is the 

1574
01:31:43,521 --> 01:31:48,291
ultimate judge.
And so that's the archetypal reality 

1575
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:48,291
there.
And you can say,

1576
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:51,711
well,
I don't want to be judged and so I'll 

1577
01:31:51,711 --> 01:31:51,711
dispense with the ideal,
but then your cane,

1578
01:31:51,711 --> 01:31:54,000
because cane is exactly the person who 
dispenses with the ideal.

1579
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:59,660
And so there's no escaping from it.
There's no escaping from eternal 

1580
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:01,060
judgment.
That's the archetypal story.

1581
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:08,300
You know,
people put a lot of work into these 

1582
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:08,300
representations,
you know,

1583
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,630
and there's thousands of them.
They weren't messing around.

1584
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,030
These are serious pieces of work,
you know,

1585
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:18,120
we don't understand them,
but that doesn't mean that the people 

1586
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:18,120
who created them didn't know what they 
were doing.

1587
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,820
These were geniuses who created these 
pieces of work.

1588
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It's not like they understood in an 
articulated manner exactly what they 

1589
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,270
were trying to represent,
but what they were representing,

1590
01:32:27,271 --> 01:32:30,030
where the metaphor is at the core of our
culture,

1591
01:32:30,031 --> 01:32:32,850
to the degree that our culture is 
functional and good.

1592
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:38,300
These are the metaphors upon which it's 
founded and they're not for the faint of

1593
01:32:39,121 --> 01:32:39,920
heart.
You know,

1594
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:42,600
you say religion is the opiate of the 
masses.

1595
01:32:42,601 --> 01:32:43,170
It's like,
yeah.

1596
01:32:43,171 --> 01:32:46,130
Then how do you explain this exactly.
You know,

1597
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:49,680
because if it was opiates hereafter,
you might just get rid of that panel.

1598
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:59,520
Especially when.
The other thing that's so interesting 

1599
01:32:59,520 --> 01:32:59,520
about the proposition,
if you look at revelations,

1600
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,000
revelation,
and you look at the judgment,

1601
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:06,070
almost everyone ends up on the right 
side of this panel.

1602
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:10,540
So if you were just conjuring up some 
sort of pathetic wish fulfillment,

1603
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:16,260
why in the world would you tilt the 
scales in that manner you think that's 

1604
01:33:16,751 --> 01:33:19,360
supposed to make people feel good?
I don't think so.

1605
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:24,420
There's almost nothing about this 
picture that should make people feel 

1606
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:26,500
good.
It should if you understand it properly,

1607
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:29,020
it should terrify you to the depths of 
your soul.

1608
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:33,100
That's what the picture is for.
Therefore,

1609
01:33:33,101 --> 01:33:35,410
whoever hears these sayings of mine and 
do with them,

1610
01:33:35,411 --> 01:33:39,580
I will liken him unto a wise man which 
built his house upon a rock and the rain

1611
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:44,581
descended and the winds blew and the 
floods came and beat upon the house and 

1612
01:33:44,581 --> 01:33:48,781
it fell not for it was founded upon a 
rock and everyone that hears these 

1613
01:33:50,881 --> 01:33:55,881
sayings of mine and do with them not,
she'll be likened unto a foolish man 

1614
01:33:55,881 --> 01:33:59,120
which built his house upon the sand and 
the rain descended and the floods came 

1615
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,690
and the winds blew and beat upon that 
house and it,

1616
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:02,670
oh,

1617
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,880
I made a mistake and it fell for.
It was founded upon the sand and it came

1618
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:11,970
to pass.
This is a very interesting line.

1619
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,340
I really,
I really know now,

1620
01:34:14,341 --> 01:34:19,341
and then you run across lines in this 
particularly happens in biblical 

1621
01:34:19,951 --> 01:34:24,951
settings.
You run across lines that you cannot 

1622
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:27,351
believe actually exists.
You cannot imagine how someone could 

1623
01:34:27,351 --> 01:34:31,331
have imagined up and conjured up the 
line and and these two lines are like 

1624
01:34:31,331 --> 01:34:32,910
that as far as I'm concerned.
And it came to pass when Jesus had ended

1625
01:34:32,911 --> 01:34:36,540
these sayings that people were 
astonished at his doctrine for he taught

1626
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:39,510
them as one having authority and not as 
the scribes.

1627
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:45,080
And that's something so interesting 
because that was another thing that 

1628
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,710
really I didn't really appreciate about 
the churches that I attended to and that

1629
01:34:46,711 --> 01:34:51,711
would be that the lessons were taught by
scribes and the words were mouthed,

1630
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,450
but there was no power in them.

1631
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,130
There was no meaning in them.
It was,

1632
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:58,340
it was as if,
well,

1633
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,160
it was like when I was 20 years old and 
I was saying all these things,

1634
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:02,360
I didn't mean,
you know,

1635
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:04,070
they were words that sounded good.
They were like,

1636
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:08,120
like gilded cloth,
I suppose that you can that you can wrap

1637
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:13,121
around yourself,
but there no substance to them and 

1638
01:35:13,121 --> 01:35:16,151
there's a big difference between 
listening to something that has 

1639
01:35:16,151 --> 01:35:19,100
substance and listening to something 
that is spoken because it sounds like it

1640
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:24,101
should sound good and this line says 
that whoever spoke the lines that we 

1641
01:35:24,101 --> 01:35:29,051
just described was someone who sounded 
like he knew what he was talking about 

1642
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:34,670
and not someone who is just repeating 
something for the sake of sounding good,

1643
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:40,240
and it certainly seems to me that the 
lines that we just reviewed have the 

1644
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:45,140
awesome impact of authority

1645
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:48,970
act to noah,

1646
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:51,710
but Noah found grace in the eyes of the 
Lord.

1647
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:57,130
These are the generations of Noah.
Noah was a just man and perfect in his 

1648
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:57,980
generations.
Noah walked with God,

1649
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:00,080
and Noah begat three sons,
Shem,

1650
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:01,580
Ham,
and Japheth.

1651
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:05,840
The Earth was also corrupt before God 
and the earth was full of violence,

1652
01:36:05,841 --> 01:36:10,220
filled with violence.
Any of you see the new NRA ad?

1653
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:16,360
You might want to look that up.
I would say that's the most shocking 

1654
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,360
manifestation of political polarization 
in the United States that I've yet seen.

1655
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,420
Most of it I've seen on the left,
the real.

1656
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,670
What's shocked me mostly has been on the
left,

1657
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:31,300
but the new NRA ad,
that's a whole new thing.

1658
01:36:31,301 --> 01:36:35,500
So it's this attractive woman doing a 
voiceover.

1659
01:36:35,501 --> 01:36:38,230
She kind of looks like Demi Moore,
although she's Kinda tough looking.

1660
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:43,440
I guess Demi Moore could look tough now 
and then and she has contempt on her 

1661
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:47,701
face and that's a dangerous thing and in
the background there's nothing but 

1662
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:55,060
images of antifa riots and Berkeley 
riots and fire and protest and she's 

1663
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:04,151
describing that is a conspiracy,
essentially a conspiracy that involves 

1664
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:07,310
the intellectual elite including 
Hollywood,

1665
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:12,311
which is named by name.
The accusation is that there is a cabal 

1666
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:14,590
of

1667
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,020
corrupt intellectuals,
let's say,

1668
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:23,790
who are bringing the country to its 
knees and that it's time to get your God

1669
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:28,791
damn guns and so look up that and see 
what you think because

1670
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:37,860
there's lots of people who would be 
perfectly happy if that was the 

1671
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:39,160
direction in which we're headed.
And one of the things that I'm hoping is

1672
01:37:39,161 --> 01:37:41,620
that we might be able to talk our way 
through it,

1673
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:46,610
but we're in a situation where every act
of interview,

1674
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:51,760
individual idiocy will push us one iota 
closer to the break and that'll make the

1675
01:37:54,671 --> 01:37:59,671
15 of the population or 30 percent of 
the population who would love to see 

1676
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:04,791
everything degenerated into chaos,
perfectly happy because that's their 

1677
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:07,100
aim.
Theory.

1678
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:12,110
Salsa was corrupt before God and the 
earth was filled with violence and God 

1679
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:15,411
looked upon the earth.
And behold it was corrupt for all flesh 

1680
01:38:15,411 --> 01:38:15,900
is corrupted his way upon the earth.
And Noah said,

1681
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:19,110
and God said unto Noah,
the end of all flesh has come before me.

1682
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,240
For the earth is filled with violence 
through them.

1683
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:23,280
And behold,
I will destroy them with the earth.

1684
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:28,740
Make the an ark of gopher wood rooms 
shalt thou make in the arch,

1685
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:32,100
and then pitch it within and without 
with pitch.

1686
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:34,530
And this is the fashion which thou shalt
make of it.

1687
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:35,770
The length of the Ark,
shelby,

1688
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,380
300 cubits,
the breadth of it.

1689
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:40,990
50 cubits and the height of it.
30 cubits and window shelf.

1690
01:38:40,991 --> 01:38:45,991
They'll make to the arc in a cubit,
shelldale finishing above and the door 

1691
01:38:45,991 --> 01:38:49,401
and the art shelters set in the side 
there or with lower second and third 

1692
01:38:49,401 --> 01:38:50,670
stories shall make it,
and behold,

1693
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:56,660
I even I do bring a flood of waters upon
the earth to destroy all flesh wherein 

1694
01:38:56,660 --> 01:39:00,800
is the breath of life from under heaven.
Everything that is in the earth shall 

1695
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,731
die,
but with the I will establish my 

1696
01:39:04,731 --> 01:39:05,160
covenant and now she'll come into the 
Ark,

1697
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:08,090
thou and thy sons and a wife and they 
sons wives with the.

1698
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:12,270
That's a fairly optimistic twist on the 
story because not only is it noah,

1699
01:39:12,271 --> 01:39:17,271
but he gets to save his whole family and
down a couple of generations and so 

1700
01:39:17,271 --> 01:39:21,030
that's a good thing to think about.
It's like as things you know,

1701
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:26,330
I had this client and she had a very 
hard upbringing.

1702
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:32,990
I would say.
Not a lot of encouragement to say the 

1703
01:39:32,990 --> 01:39:35,631
least.
Let's say a fair bit of discouragement 

1704
01:39:35,631 --> 01:39:38,630
and she had a son.
And what was really interesting about 

1705
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:44,390
her in relationship to her son is that 
all the things that she could have 

1706
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:47,841
learned to do to him,
given her extensive experience with 

1707
01:39:47,841 --> 01:39:52,460
being made as miserable as possible by 
someone who was hell bent on bringing 

1708
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:53,010
her to her knees,
she refused to do,

1709
01:39:53,011 --> 01:39:54,390
to respond,
right?

1710
01:39:54,391 --> 01:39:58,290
She learned the opposite lesson from all
her misery and tournament,

1711
01:39:58,291 --> 01:40:00,900
which was not to move that forward down 
the generations.

1712
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:05,900
And so the idea here is that if you walk
properly and aimed properly and act 

1713
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:10,170
properly,
if you walk with God in this manner that

1714
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:13,080
we've been discussing,
is that perhaps that isn't only good for

1715
01:40:13,081 --> 01:40:18,081
you,
perhaps it's also the thing that will 

1716
01:40:18,081 --> 01:40:20,001
save your family and then by implication
perhaps save society because that's 

1717
01:40:20,001 --> 01:40:21,660
exactly what happens with Noah,
right?

1718
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:24,690
First attempt and then it's his family,
but everything else goes.

1719
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:30,110
And so by saving himself,
by acting properly and by saving his 

1720
01:40:30,110 --> 01:40:31,770
family,
he actually saves the world.

1721
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:34,110
It's interesting,
you know,

1722
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:39,111
like the most profound people that I've 
read who've meditated deeply on the 

1723
01:40:39,111 --> 01:40:41,400
problem,
say of totalitarian catastrophe.

1724
01:40:41,401 --> 01:40:44,100
And I would put Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 
at the top of that list,

1725
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:46,500
you know,
hit the his,

1726
01:40:46,530 --> 01:40:50,850
his entire Corpus,
three volume 700 pages long.

1727
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:55,880
Each in tiny type is a long scream about
the absolute necessity of individual,

1728
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:05,960
the absolute necessity of individual 
honesty and ethical behavior as the only

1729
01:41:07,441 --> 01:41:10,170
bulwark against totalitarian 
catastrophe.

1730
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:15,730
And the.
And I've read many writers who've 

1731
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:18,560
attempted to diagnose the problems of 
the 20th century and I think units.

1732
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:19,700
And

1733
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:26,690
he came to the same conclusions that 
Victor Frankel came to as a consequence 

1734
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:29,730
of his experiences in the Nazi 
concentration camps and Frankel.

1735
01:41:30,170 --> 01:41:35,170
I'm also an admirer of Frankl,
but soldier knits and takes it to an 

1736
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:38,451
entire different level of profundity and
makes an extraordinarily strong case 

1737
01:41:38,451 --> 01:41:42,771
that not only do societies deteriorate 
because the people within the societies 

1738
01:41:43,921 --> 01:41:48,921
become individually corrupt,
but that the only way to stave that off 

1739
01:41:48,921 --> 01:41:53,000
is for the individuals within that 
society to reject that corruption in 

1740
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,921
the,
in the confines of their own personal 

1741
01:41:56,921 --> 01:41:58,671
lives.
And he tells endless stories of people 

1742
01:41:58,671 --> 01:41:59,670
that he met in the Gulag,
in the work camps,

1743
01:41:59,671 --> 01:42:02,070
in the death camps,
in the Soviet Union of people.

1744
01:42:02,071 --> 01:42:07,071
And this is what he learned.
If people who are so incredibly tough 

1745
01:42:07,071 --> 01:42:10,470
that even under conditions the most 
possible extreme conditions,

1746
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:16,010
there wasn't a chance that they were 
going to step off that straight narrow 

1747
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:16,010
line.

1748
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:20,390
There was nothing the authorities could 
do to move them and just watching that 

1749
01:42:21,331 --> 01:42:26,331
was enough to transform soldier knits 
and because of course one of the things 

1750
01:42:26,331 --> 01:42:29,301
he wondered was after spending a good 
amount of time in the work camps was 

1751
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:34,140
well just exactly how did I get here?
And it wasn't well,

1752
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:36,120
it was Hitler's fault and it was 
[inaudible] fault.

1753
01:42:36,121 --> 01:42:41,121
Although it was definitely the fault of 
both of them for social incident was 

1754
01:42:41,121 --> 01:42:44,800
well,
it was also his fault because he was 

1755
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:44,850
playing the same game.
He just wasn't as good at it.

1756
01:42:46,770 --> 01:42:51,770
And of every living thing of all flesh,
two of every sort shall they'll bring 

1757
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:51,770
into the ark to keep them alive with 
you.

1758
01:42:51,770 --> 01:42:55,010
They shall be male and female.
And so the they.

1759
01:42:55,320 --> 01:43:00,320
There's A.
There's another message in this story 

1760
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,181
which is that it isn't only Noah and his
family and human society that's 

1761
01:43:02,861 --> 01:43:07,210
dependent on Noah's appropriate actions 
in the world.

1762
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:12,450
It's the entire living planet and in an 
era of excessive and extreme and 

1763
01:43:16,001 --> 01:43:21,001
genuinely disingenuous environmental 
catastrophizing,

1764
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:24,540
that's something to consider very 
seriously.

1765
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:30,510
Think perhaps there's nothing better 
that you can do for everything.

1766
01:43:35,071 --> 01:43:40,071
All things considered,
including those things that are outside 

1767
01:43:40,071 --> 01:43:42,990
the confines of human society than to 
get your act together and align yourself

1768
01:43:42,991 --> 01:43:46,500
properly along all of the dimensions of 
your being,

1769
01:43:46,501 --> 01:43:47,610
from,
from,

1770
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:52,400
from the tiniest microcosm to the to the
macrocosm,

1771
01:43:52,401 --> 01:43:55,130
and that's the way that all of being is 
redeemed.

1772
01:43:56,650 --> 01:44:01,130
That's what the story suggests and we 
read it.

1773
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:03,380
You know,
a cynical modern people.

1774
01:44:03,381 --> 01:44:08,000
We read it as if it was written by 
primitive people who thought that it was

1775
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:12,290
really the case that someone could build
a boat and put two of every kind into it

1776
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,090
and thereby save the world.

1777
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:21,110
It's embarrassing to see things 
interpreted in a manner that shallow,

1778
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:25,400
especially by people who don't have 
ignorance as a justification.

1779
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:30,610
You know,
these stories have to appeal to 

1780
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:30,610
everyone,
right?

1781
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:33,220
And there's lots of people in the world 
who aren't very bright and so they tend 

1782
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:35,780
to take things concretely like a child 
would take things concretely if you read

1783
01:44:35,781 --> 01:44:38,360
them a story,
and this story can be taken concretely,

1784
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,240
but it has to be because the stories 
have to be for everyone.

1785
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:46,241
But if you're a sophisticated,
that doesn't mean that you should 

1786
01:44:46,241 --> 01:44:46,910
dismiss it as if it's written for a 
child.

1787
01:44:46,911 --> 01:44:50,330
It's maybe you have the obligation to 
look a bit deeper and think for a moment

1788
01:44:50,331 --> 01:44:55,331
that it wouldn't be conserved for these 
many thousands of years if there wasn't 

1789
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:58,751
something more to it than a casual 
intellectual dismissal would indicate 

1790
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:03,440
and take the onto the of all food that 
is eaten and thou shalt gather it to the

1791
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:06,110
shelby food for the end for them.
Thus did noah.

1792
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:10,580
According to all that God commanded him.
So did he.

1793
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:14,900
And the Lord said unto Noah,
come down and all the house into the arc

1794
01:45:14,901 --> 01:45:19,400
for the I've seen righteous before me.
In this generation of every clean beast,

1795
01:45:20,530 --> 01:45:25,530
thou shalt take to the by sevens.
The male and female and obesity are 

1796
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:26,470
clean but not cleaned by to the male and
female and,

1797
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,570
uh,
follows also of the error by sevens,

1798
01:45:28,571 --> 01:45:33,400
the male and the female to keep seed 
alive upon the face of all the earth for

1799
01:45:33,401 --> 01:45:36,460
yet seven days,
I will cause it to rain upon the earth.

1800
01:45:36,461 --> 01:45:41,461
Forty days and 40 nights.
And every living substance that I have 

1801
01:45:41,461 --> 01:45:41,461
made will I destroy from off the face of
the earth.

1802
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:44,950
And Noah did according unto all that the
Lord commanded him.

1803
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:50,140
And Noah was 600 years old when the 
flood of waters was upon the earth.

1804
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:56,010
And Noah went in and his sons and his 
wife and his sons wives with them into 

1805
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:56,140
the arc because of the waters of the 
flood,

1806
01:45:56,470 --> 01:46:01,470
of clean beasts and obese that are not 
cleaning the fouls and have everything 

1807
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:01,470
that creepeth upon the earth.

1808
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:03,790
They went in to and to and to know into 
the arc.

1809
01:46:03,791 --> 01:46:05,950
The male and the female is guarded,
demanded Noah.

1810
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:11,310
And it came to pass after seven days 
that the waters of the flood were upon 

1811
01:46:11,310 --> 01:46:13,570
the earth in the 600th year of Noah's 
life.

1812
01:46:13,571 --> 01:46:16,030
In the second month,
the 17th day of the month,

1813
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:21,060
the same day,
we're all the fountains of the great 

1814
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:23,791
deep broken up and the windows of Heaven
were opened and the rain was upon the 

1815
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:26,620
earth.
Forty days and 40 nights in the selfsame

1816
01:46:26,621 --> 01:46:29,110
day entered Noah and chairman,
Ham and Japheth,

1817
01:46:29,230 --> 01:46:32,860
sons of Noah and Noah,
his wife and the three wives of his sons

1818
01:46:32,861 --> 01:46:37,861
with him into the arc.
They in every beast after his kind and 

1819
01:46:37,861 --> 01:46:42,620
all of the cattle after their kind and 
every creeping thing that creepeth upon 

1820
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:43,440
the earth after his kind and every fowl 
after his kind,

1821
01:46:43,441 --> 01:46:47,010
every bird of every sort of they went 
into Noah unto no into the Ark,

1822
01:46:47,011 --> 01:46:50,370
to and to evolve flesh.
We're in is the breath of life

1823
01:46:55,380 --> 01:47:00,380
that makes no the ultimate shepherd,
right shepherd of all things tender of 

1824
01:47:05,591 --> 01:47:10,591
the garden and shepherd of all things.
That's a hell of a role and maybe that's

1825
01:47:13,181 --> 01:47:15,190
the one that keeps you afloat during the
flood.

1826
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,680
And they that went in,
went in,

1827
01:47:18,681 --> 01:47:21,080
male and female of all flesh is God had 
commanded him.

1828
01:47:21,081 --> 01:47:26,081
And the Lord shout a man and the flood 
was 40 days upon the earth and the 

1829
01:47:26,081 --> 01:47:27,500
waters increased and bear up the ark and
it was lifted up above the earth and the

1830
01:47:27,501 --> 01:47:30,620
waters prevailed and were increased 
greatly upon the earth.

1831
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:36,940
15 cubits upward did the waters prevail 
and the mountains were covered and all 

1832
01:47:40,171 --> 01:47:43,830
flesh died that moved upon the earth.
Both have fallen of cattle and the beast

1833
01:47:43,831 --> 01:47:48,831
and over every creeping thing that 
creepeth upon the earth and every man 

1834
01:47:48,831 --> 01:47:51,660
and all in whose nostrils was the breath
of life of all that was in the dry land,

1835
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:56,300
died in every living substance was 
destroyed,

1836
01:47:56,301 --> 01:48:01,301
which was upon the face of the earth.
Both man and cattle and the creeping 

1837
01:48:01,301 --> 01:48:04,961
things in the fall of the heaven.
And they were destroyed from the earth 

1838
01:48:04,961 --> 01:48:06,680
and no only remained alive.
And they that were with him in the Ark.

1839
01:48:06,950 --> 01:48:08,840
And the water's prevailed upon the 
earth.

1840
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:10,430
One hundred and 50 days.

1841
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:17,460
And God remembered no on every living 
thing and all the capital that was with 

1842
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:20,341
him in the Ark.
And God made a wind to pass over the 

1843
01:48:20,341 --> 01:48:23,161
earth and the waters receded the 
fountains also of the deep and the 

1844
01:48:23,161 --> 01:48:28,141
windows of heaven were stopped in.
The rain from heaven was restrained and 

1845
01:48:28,141 --> 01:48:28,141
the water's returned from off the earth 
continually.

1846
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:31,330
And after the end of 150 days,
the waters were abated.

1847
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,860
And the Ark rested in the seventh month,
on the Seventeenth Day of the month upon

1848
01:48:35,861 --> 01:48:40,861
the mountains of air rat.
And the water's decreased continually 

1849
01:48:40,861 --> 01:48:43,711
until the 10th month,
the 10th month on the first day of the 

1850
01:48:43,711 --> 01:48:43,900
month where the tops of the mountain 
scene.

1851
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:50,490
And it came to pass at the end of 40 
days that Noah opened the window of the 

1852
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:50,490
Ark,
which he had made.

1853
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:54,481
And he sent forth a raven which went to 
and fro until the waters were dried up 

1854
01:48:54,481 --> 01:48:58,530
from off the earth.
And he also sent forth a dove from him 

1855
01:48:58,530 --> 01:48:59,620
to see if the waters were abated from 
off the face of the ground.

1856
01:48:59,830 --> 01:49:02,110
But the dove found no rest for the sole 
of her foot.

1857
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:07,320
And she returned unto him in the Ark for
the waters on the face of the whole 

1858
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:10,090
earth that he put forth his hand and 
took her and pulled her in unto him into

1859
01:49:10,091 --> 01:49:12,670
the Ark,
and he stayed yet another seven days.

1860
01:49:12,790 --> 01:49:14,950
And again,
he sent forth the dove out of the Ark.

1861
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:21,150
And the devil came into him in the 
evening and low in her mouth was an 

1862
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:23,791
olive leaf plucked off.
So no one knew that the waters were 

1863
01:49:23,791 --> 01:49:26,731
abated from off the earth.
And he stayed there yet another seven 

1864
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:30,701
days and sent forth the dove,
which returned not again onto him any 

1865
01:49:30,701 --> 01:49:33,611
more.
And it came to pass in the 600th and 

1866
01:49:33,611 --> 01:49:36,611
first year in the first month.
The first day of the month of waters 

1867
01:49:36,611 --> 01:49:40,090
were dried up from off the earth.
And Noah removed the covering of the 

1868
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:40,160
orchid,
looked up and behold,

1869
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:41,930
the face of the ground was dry.

1870
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:47,680
And in the second month on the seventh 
and 20th day of the month was the dried.

1871
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:49,900
And God spake unto Noah,
saying,

1872
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:55,140
go forth of the arc,
thou and thy wife and they sons and 

1873
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:55,140
their sons waves with the

1874
01:49:55,530 --> 01:49:59,270
bring forth with the every living thing 
that is with the of all flesh,

1875
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:04,510
both of fall,
end of cattle and over every creeping 

1876
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:06,851
thing that creepeth upon the earth that 
they may breed abundantly in the earth 

1877
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:08,030
and be fruitful and multiply upon the 
earth.

1878
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:11,210
And Noah went forth and his sons and his
wife and his sons wives with him.

1879
01:50:11,390 --> 01:50:16,390
Every beast creeping thing every fall 
and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth 

1880
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:17,600
after their kinds went forth out of the 
Ark.

1881
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:24,010
And Noah building an altar unto the Lord
and took of every clean beast and of 

1882
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:26,360
every clean foul and offered burnt 
offerings on the altar.

1883
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,780
Immediate return to the sacrificial 
motif.

1884
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:38,020
And the Lord smelled a sweet savor.
And that's new as proper sacrifice.

1885
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,800
And the Lord said into his heart,
I will not again curse the ground 

1886
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:47,221
anymore for man's sake.
For the imagination of Man's heart is 

1887
01:50:47,221 --> 01:50:49,900
evil from his youth.
Neither will I again smite anymore.

1888
01:50:49,901 --> 01:50:54,901
Every living thing has I have done while
the Earth remaineth seed time and 

1889
01:50:54,901 --> 01:50:55,960
harvest,
cold and heat in summer and winter,

1890
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:01,470
day and night shall not cease,
and God blessed Noah and his sons and 

1891
01:51:01,541 --> 01:51:06,541
said unto them,
be fruitful and multiply and replenish 

1892
01:51:06,541 --> 01:51:09,361
the earth and the fear of you and the 
dread of you shall be upon every beast 

1893
01:51:09,361 --> 01:51:13,471
of the earth and upon every fowl of the 
air upon all that moveth upon the earth,

1894
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:16,870
upon all the fishes of the sea into your
hand or they delivered.

1895
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:29,740
You know,
I've heard commentators,

1896
01:51:29,741 --> 01:51:31,270
David Suzuki,
for example,

1897
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:39,760
who claim that the substructure of 
Western culture in lines such as this

1898
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:49,860
deliver the earth over to human beings 
and and justify our ravaging of the,

1899
01:51:52,110 --> 01:51:53,410
of,
of being,

1900
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:59,550
but I don't think that that's a very 
careful reading and it seems to me that 

1901
01:52:01,330 --> 01:52:06,330
given such matters,
given the importance of such matters 

1902
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:07,000
that are very close reading is actually 
necessary.

1903
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:13,290
You know,
in the story of Adam and Eve when Adam 

1904
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:16,471
and eve are thrown out of the garden,
God tells eve that she's going to be 

1905
01:52:16,471 --> 01:52:18,940
subordinated to her husband.
He doesn't say that.

1906
01:52:18,941 --> 01:52:23,440
That's what should happen.
He says that's what's going to happen,

1907
01:52:23,890 --> 01:52:28,890
and the same thing as far as I'm 
concerned is contained in lines like 

1908
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:31,030
this isn't necessarily that this is 
something that should happen.

1909
01:52:31,031 --> 01:52:34,660
It's something that did happen.
It's quite remarkable.

1910
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:39,690
You know,
to think about how long ago these lions 

1911
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:43,231
were penned,
it wasn't obvious until perhaps the 19 

1912
01:52:43,231 --> 01:52:45,830
sixties that we had dominated the earth 
so completely that it's very

1913
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:51,340
future existence was in our hands and 
that's a prophetic element of this tale 

1914
01:52:55,220 --> 01:53:00,220
and the fear of you and the dread of you
shall be upon every beast of the earth 

1915
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:03,191
and upon every fowl of the air and upon 
all that moveth upon the earth and upon 

1916
01:53:03,191 --> 01:53:04,550
all the fishes of the sea into your 
hand.

1917
01:53:04,551 --> 01:53:06,380
Are they delivered?
It's like,

1918
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:11,410
that's exactly right.
Every moving thing that lives shall be 

1919
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:16,101
meat for you.
Even as the green herb I've given you 

1920
01:53:16,101 --> 01:53:18,441
all things,
have I given you all things but flesh 

1921
01:53:18,441 --> 01:53:18,570
with the life therapy,
which is the blood thereof,

1922
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:24,020
shall you not eat and surely your blood 
of your lives will I require at the hand

1923
01:53:25,731 --> 01:53:30,731
of every beast will I required in at the
hand of man at the hand of every man's 

1924
01:53:30,731 --> 01:53:33,320
brother will I require the life of man?
This is a hard section to interpret,

1925
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:35,240
but what it means is something like 
this.

1926
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:41,530
God describes the dominion over the 
planet that revivified humanity will 

1927
01:53:42,561 --> 01:53:47,561
have and notes the power that goes along
with that and then puts a limitation on 

1928
01:53:48,711 --> 01:53:53,711
it and the limitation is maintain the 
sanctity of life despite your power.

1929
01:53:56,210 --> 01:54:01,210
And although it's not easy to extract 
from the manner in which this has been 

1930
01:54:01,521 --> 01:54:06,521
translated.
What God is telling Noah is that if you 

1931
01:54:06,521 --> 01:54:08,300
kill yourself,
if you kill someone else,

1932
01:54:08,301 --> 01:54:13,301
and if any animal kills a human being,
that there will be a price to pay for 

1933
01:54:13,301 --> 01:54:17,501
that.
So there's a an opportunity which is 

1934
01:54:17,501 --> 01:54:20,450
that the descendants of Noah can 
dominate the earth,

1935
01:54:20,451 --> 01:54:23,570
but there's a moral limitation placed on
that.

1936
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:28,690
Which is nonetheless,
life itself is to be regarded as 

1937
01:54:28,730 --> 01:54:30,230
sanctified and sacred.

1938
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,920
Whoever shared with man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed for in 

1939
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:42,290
the image of God made he man and you be 
fruitful and multiply.

1940
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:47,380
Bring forth abundantly in the earth and 
multiply their in and God spake to Noah 

1941
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:53,760
and to his sons with him saying,
and I behold I establish my covenant 

1942
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:57,631
with you and with your seat after you 
and with every living creature that is 

1943
01:54:57,631 --> 01:54:57,790
with you.
Have the fall in the cattle and to every

1944
01:54:57,791 --> 01:55:00,560
beast of earth that is with you.
For all that.

1945
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:02,620
Go out of the Ark to every beast of the 
earth.

1946
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,580
And I will establish my covenant with 
you.

1947
01:55:09,180 --> 01:55:12,120
Neither shall all flesh be cut off 
anymore by the waters of the flood.

1948
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:15,390
Neither shall there be any more.
A flood to destroy the earth.

1949
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:21,810
And God said,
this is the token of the covenant which 

1950
01:55:21,810 --> 01:55:23,941
I make between me and you and every 
living creature that is with you for 

1951
01:55:23,941 --> 01:55:26,551
perpetual generations.
I do set my bow in the cloud and it 

1952
01:55:26,551 --> 01:55:30,271
shall be for a token of a covenant 
between me and the Earth and it shall 

1953
01:55:30,271 --> 01:55:33,391
come to pass when I bring a cloud over 
the earth that the Hoa shall be seen in 

1954
01:55:33,391 --> 01:55:36,160
the cloud and I will remember my 
covenant which is between me and you and

1955
01:55:36,161 --> 01:55:41,161
every living creature of all flesh and 
the waters shall no more become a flood 

1956
01:55:41,161 --> 01:55:44,401
to destroy all flesh.
There's a negotiated agreement there of 

1957
01:55:44,401 --> 01:55:44,401
sorts

1958
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:49,550
and then negotiated agreement is as far 
as I can tell to the degree that 

1959
01:55:51,601 --> 01:55:55,050
humanity agrees to act in the manner of 
Noah.

1960
01:55:55,860 --> 01:56:00,860
Then the threat of catastrophic 
destruction will remain at bay and the 

1961
01:56:10,351 --> 01:56:15,351
bowl shall be in the cloud and I will 
look upon it that I may remember the 

1962
01:56:15,351 --> 01:56:18,051
everlasting covenant between God and 
every living creature of all flesh that 

1963
01:56:18,051 --> 01:56:18,720
is upon the earth.
And God said unto Noah,

1964
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:23,960
this is the token of the covenant which 
I've established between me and all 

1965
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:27,621
flesh that is upon the earth.
This is the token of the covenant which 

1966
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:33,270
I have established between me and all 
flesh.

1967
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:38,870
That is upon the earth,
so that's a good place to stop and 

1968
01:56:42,170 --> 01:56:47,170
there's no lecture next week by the way,
because the theater was booked so 

1969
01:56:47,170 --> 01:56:50,771
there'll be a one week break and then 
when we get back we'll finish the story 

1970
01:56:50,771 --> 01:56:52,190
of Noah.
There's not much left of it.

1971
01:56:52,990 --> 01:56:55,550
We'll talk about the tower of Babel,
which is a very short story,

1972
01:56:55,551 --> 01:56:56,990
but a very,
very interesting one.

1973
01:56:57,350 --> 01:57:02,350
And then we'll move on to the story of 
Abraham and so thank you very much for 

1974
01:57:02,541 --> 01:57:03,430
coming in.
We'll see you again

1975
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:08,460
two weeks.
Thank you.

1976
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:28,350
Now is the person who has the 
notification for the meetup after this 

1977
01:57:28,350 --> 01:57:30,070
here and do they have the notification?
Okay.

1978
01:57:30,071 --> 01:57:31,720
Because if you give that to me this 
time,

1979
01:57:31,721 --> 01:57:34,090
I'll remember to read it before everyone
leaves.

1980
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:38,410
So do you want to start?
Okay.

1981
01:57:38,411 --> 01:57:43,411
So see,
let's see if the mic is working because 

1982
01:57:43,411 --> 01:57:45,280
lots of people will listen to this 
question and so.

1983
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:47,170
Okay.
Okay.

1984
01:57:48,210 --> 01:57:50,850
So you said on a recent live stream that
you were two,

1985
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:52,800
you didn't have enough energy to answer 
this question,

1986
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:57,860
but you said it was intriguing.
So I was wondering if you had the energy

1987
01:57:58,231 --> 01:58:03,231
to answer how someone might help someone
that has borderline personality disorder

1988
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:11,360
by example,
by example.

1989
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:15,340
You have an example?
No,

1990
01:58:15,730 --> 01:58:16,180
no,
no,

1991
01:58:16,181 --> 01:58:16,780
I don't.
I don't.

1992
01:58:16,781 --> 01:58:20,050
I don't mean that precisely.
I mean that the.

1993
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:24,250
Let's not take borderline personality 
disorder precisely as the example.

1994
01:58:24,251 --> 01:58:26,740
Okay.
I understand the question.

1995
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:32,340
The question to some degree is how do 
you help someone that's lost and the 

1996
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:35,440
answer to that is if they aren't willing
to not be lost,

1997
01:58:35,441 --> 01:58:39,310
you cannot help them.
And I would also say that as a clinician

1998
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:42,160
you see,
I mean it's an.

1999
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:47,220
It's a statement that's informed,
I would say by my mythological 

2000
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:50,290
knowledge,
but also by straight clinical wisdom,

2001
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:55,460
not mine particularly.
I mean one of the things that Carl 

2002
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:59,340
Rogers pointed out was that there were 
necessary preconditions for entering 

2003
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,921
into a therapeutic relationship and that
that would be really any relationship 

2004
01:59:01,921 --> 01:59:04,870
where the mutual flourishing of the two 
people involved was the paramount goal.

2005
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:10,380
And one of the preconditions was that 
both people have to want that to happen 

2006
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:14,880
and Rogers believed he didn't know how 
to get the horse to drink.

2007
01:59:15,730 --> 01:59:20,730
Once you had brought it to the water,
and I've thought about that a lot 

2008
01:59:20,730 --> 01:59:24,300
because when people are really lost,
sometimes they're so lost that they 

2009
01:59:25,181 --> 01:59:30,181
can't be found and I think the only 
thing that you can do in a situation 

2010
01:59:30,181 --> 01:59:34,261
like that is get your life together and 
she and manifest the reality of an 

2011
01:59:36,101 --> 01:59:39,070
alternative motive being that's what 
you've got.

2012
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:44,880
And so that's the only way I knew of to 
solve an intractable problem and I would

2013
01:59:46,751 --> 01:59:51,751
say the reason that I went down that 
direction with regards to borderline 

2014
01:59:51,751 --> 01:59:56,221
personality disorders because it's one 
of the most serious of the personality 

2015
01:59:56,221 --> 01:59:58,540
disorder.
It's very difficult to treat and so I'll

2016
01:59:58,541 --> 02:00:03,541
generalize from that to situations that 
are very difficult to deal with.

2017
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:05,980
And you know,
there's a statement too,

2018
02:00:05,981 --> 02:00:09,250
and this has nothing to do with 
borderline personality disorder per se.

2019
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:12,160
There's a statement in the new testament
that's really vicious.

2020
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:13,450
In fact,
there's a number of them,

2021
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:18,451
but this is a particularly vicious one 
and that is don't cast pearls before 

2022
02:00:18,451 --> 02:00:23,371
swine.
And what that means is if you're trying 

2023
02:00:23,371 --> 02:00:25,450
to help and it doesn't work,
then stop helping.

2024
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:28,780
It's not helping,
right?

2025
02:00:28,781 --> 02:00:32,530
It may be just wasting your time.
It might be making things worse.

2026
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,520
Now,
if you're.

2027
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:36,130
If you're offering something and it's 
not taken,

2028
02:00:36,790 --> 02:00:41,790
then perhaps you should be offering it 
somewhere else and sometimes if you 

2029
02:00:42,311 --> 02:00:44,140
offer hand in,
the person won't take it.

2030
02:00:44,141 --> 02:00:49,141
You have to stop offering the hand and 
then what you do is you go off and you 

2031
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:52,540
have your life and sometimes that means 
in people's lives,

2032
02:00:52,541 --> 02:00:57,541
for example,
that they have to leave their family 

2033
02:00:57,541 --> 02:00:57,541
members behind.
There's a scene in the new testament.

2034
02:00:57,541 --> 02:00:59,980
This is another very hard scene where 
Christ is walking down the road with his

2035
02:00:59,981 --> 02:01:00,670
disciples.

2036
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:04,000
I hope I've got this story right,
but I've got it essentially right,

2037
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:09,300
and his mother calls to him and says,
I believe that he's supposed to come 

2038
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:13,831
back to the home because his uncle has 
died and that there's going to be a 

2039
02:01:14,171 --> 02:01:19,171
funeral,
and he turns to his mother and says 

2040
02:01:19,171 --> 02:01:20,770
something like,
let the dead bury their dead.

2041
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:24,190
I'm about my father's business.
It's something like that.

2042
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:26,620
And you read that and you think,
Huh,

2043
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:29,650
that should have been edited out.
No,

2044
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:34,770
but it shouldn't have been edited out 
because it's exactly right because 

2045
02:01:34,770 --> 02:01:37,591
sometimes the thing you do is walk away 
because there's no other solution and if

2046
02:01:39,921 --> 02:01:40,220
you

2047
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:45,220
are trapped in pathological 
relationships and you see no way out of 

2048
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:45,220
them,
if you,

2049
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:49,120
if someone who is sinking has their 
hands around your neck and is pulling 

2050
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,540
you down,
you're not obligated to drown with them.

2051
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:52,460
No.
There's a rule to.

2052
02:01:52,461 --> 02:01:53,900
If you're a lifeguard,
you know,

2053
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:58,960
some of you have had lifeguard training.
How do you approach someone who's 

2054
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,800
drowning and panicking in the water feed
out?

2055
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:02,150
Right?
Like this.

2056
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:07,420
It's like all save you,
but that doesn't mean you get to drown 

2057
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:10,580
me while I'm doing it and if it's you 
drown or both of us drown.

2058
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:14,540
It's you drown.
And that's wisdom.

2059
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:18,140
That's not cruelty,
right?

2060
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:20,740
So yeah,

2061
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:31,040
couple of questions about dialogue and 
engaging in dialogue with people.

2062
02:02:31,041 --> 02:02:36,041
So the first issue that I face is I have
a very high need for intellectual 

2063
02:02:36,051 --> 02:02:40,070
stimulation and I don't get that with 
most people.

2064
02:02:40,090 --> 02:02:42,140
It's something like,
um,

2065
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,300
you can,
you can have a dialogue for a time,

2066
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:45,450
but then it

2067
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:48,040
titrate openness.
Yeah.

2068
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:53,610
And and now,
but then they started run out of ideas 

2069
02:02:53,610 --> 02:02:54,320
or they can keep up and it sort of falls
apart and okay,

2070
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:58,040
this is a problem that intellectuals 
have quite frequently.

2071
02:02:58,041 --> 02:02:59,900
You said they,
they sort of,

2072
02:02:59,901 --> 02:03:02,300
once they start reading difficult to 
devoting stuff,

2073
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:07,780
they stopped wanting to talk to regular 
people and I think that contributes to 

2074
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:12,401
the disconnect that you see between 
intellectuals and working class people 

2075
02:03:12,401 --> 02:03:12,530
and,
and stuff like that.

2076
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:14,790
And the other question I had was about,

2077
02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:16,670
okay wait,
I don't know if that's the question.

2078
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:19,790
I mean I believe there's a question in 
there,

2079
02:03:19,791 --> 02:03:19,950
but I,

2080
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:21,530
the question is how,
how do you,

2081
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:24,540
how should we address that?
How should I address it?

2082
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:27,480
And is that something that can be 
dressed?

2083
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:28,110
Well,
part of,

2084
02:03:28,111 --> 02:03:30,930
part of the answer to that is that's 
what the universities were for.

2085
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:32,220
I mean,
you know,

2086
02:03:32,221 --> 02:03:37,221
not everybody is equipped to or 
interested in engaging in high level 

2087
02:03:37,711 --> 02:03:39,840
discussion of abstract and creative 
ideas.

2088
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:45,020
You know,
you hear this idea that everyone's 

2089
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:45,020
creative.
That's a lie.

2090
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:46,260
It's a straightforward.
Is that true?

2091
02:03:46,261 --> 02:03:48,330
Creativity is very,
very rare.

2092
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:53,780
And so,
and if you happen to be a creative 

2093
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:54,690
person or if you happen to be someone 
who's profoundly interested in ideas,

2094
02:03:54,691 --> 02:03:57,840
you are in a pronounced minority,
just as you are,

2095
02:03:57,841 --> 02:04:01,110
if you happen to be extremely 
extroverted or extremely agreeable,

2096
02:04:01,111 --> 02:04:03,900
are extremely conscientious.
These are minority issues.

2097
02:04:03,901 --> 02:04:08,901
And what you do is you find likeminded 
people who are capable of engaging that 

2098
02:04:08,901 --> 02:04:13,880
we know a heavyweight heavyweight 
weightlifters compete with heavy weight 

2099
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:17,100
weight lifters for a reason and everyone
thinks that's fine.

2100
02:04:17,101 --> 02:04:20,240
And the same thing applies to 
intellectual and creative endeavors.

2101
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:25,050
So what you do is you try to find a 
community where that's,

2102
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:31,340
that's the nature of the community and 
you likely have to find a relationship 

2103
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:31,670
like that as well.
You know?

2104
02:04:31,830 --> 02:04:36,830
So I don't think so.
I think what contributes to the siloing 

2105
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:39,330
is the arrogance goes along with it 
because if you're,

2106
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:43,440
you can be interested in ideas and you 
can be creative.

2107
02:04:44,090 --> 02:04:45,750
Well that's the arrogance of the 
intellect,

2108
02:04:45,751 --> 02:04:47,430
right?
That's the thing the Catholic Church had

2109
02:04:47,431 --> 02:04:50,010
warned about for centuries is the 
arrogance of the intellect.

2110
02:04:50,490 --> 02:04:55,490
So because if you're,
if you're wise as well as smart and 

2111
02:04:55,490 --> 02:04:56,910
there is no relationship between being 
smart and being wise,

2112
02:04:56,911 --> 02:05:01,911
they are not the same thing.
There's no quick pathway from smart to 

2113
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:05,601
wise.
And many of the people who I've known 

2114
02:05:05,601 --> 02:05:08,421
who were very wise were,
some of them were intellectually 

2115
02:05:08,421 --> 02:05:11,580
impaired and we're still wise.
So it's the arrogance that brings up the

2116
02:05:11,581 --> 02:05:12,030
block.

2117
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:17,030
And I see this for example happening in 
the United States in particular because 

2118
02:05:17,030 --> 02:05:17,910
the last time I went down there for 
example,

2119
02:05:17,911 --> 02:05:22,911
I was.
I had friends down there and some of 

2120
02:05:22,911 --> 02:05:25,581
those friends are very,
very smart people and some of them were 

2121
02:05:25,581 --> 02:05:28,080
talking about the trump voters and they 
were talking about the trump voters with

2122
02:05:28,081 --> 02:05:33,081
contempt and I thought you better watch 
that because that's 50 percent of the 

2123
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:38,090
population and it might be convenient to
think that they're stupid and beneath 

2124
02:05:38,090 --> 02:05:40,230
you,
but it's not conducive to a civil state.

2125
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:45,440
And there's no evidence that it's true 
because there isn't a straight line 

2126
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:48,570
between intelligent and wise.
And so I think that if your.

2127
02:05:49,110 --> 02:05:52,410
If your character is developed and 
you're intelligent,

2128
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:55,620
you can have your siloed,
creative community,

2129
02:05:56,010 --> 02:06:01,010
but you develop enough wisdom so that 
you can see all the things that people 

2130
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:04,701
can do that or have high ethical utility
that are outside the intellectual 

2131
02:06:04,701 --> 02:06:04,701
domain.

2132
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:10,040
You know,
and I think that's why in the New 

2133
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:12,440
Testament,
I think that's why Christ is a 

2134
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:12,440
carpenter,
right?

2135
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:12,440
Because,
well,

2136
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:17,130
first of all,
carpenter is one of those jobs that when

2137
02:06:17,131 --> 02:06:22,131
you're dishonest,
it manifests itself immediately because 

2138
02:06:22,131 --> 02:06:22,920
what you build falls down and so if 
you're an honest carpenter,

2139
02:06:22,921 --> 02:06:25,380
you build a good house.
So there's a nice metaphor there,

2140
02:06:25,381 --> 02:06:29,550
but it's also.
It's also a warning in some sense,

2141
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:34,640
against the the equation of intellectual
brilliance with moral superiority.

2142
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:42,380
And so if the intellects would drop 
their moral superiority and fat chance 

2143
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:46,641
there is of that,
then that divide between the working 

2144
02:06:46,641 --> 02:06:50,421
class say and the elite would would 
resolve.

2145
02:06:52,110 --> 02:06:56,460
And there's every reason to have respect
for decent working class people.

2146
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:02,480
It's on their labor as the left wingers 
at least hypothetically agree that the 

2147
02:07:03,931 --> 02:07:07,680
entire edifice of the culture is,
is resting.

2148
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:10,650
So you can have your cake and eat it 
too,

2149
02:07:10,651 --> 02:07:15,651
but you have to not assume that your 
niche makes you superior.

2150
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:18,720
And it's very difficult for smart 
people,

2151
02:07:18,721 --> 02:07:21,750
especially smart.
There's this scene in niches.

2152
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:26,850
Sins thus spake Zarathustra Zarathustra.
The prophet comes down from the mountain

2153
02:07:26,851 --> 02:07:31,851
and he comes into a public square and 
there's this crowd around this little 

2154
02:07:31,851 --> 02:07:36,051
midget who was only about this high,
who has a gigantic ear and everyone is 

2155
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:38,350
marveling at him.
Well,

2156
02:07:38,351 --> 02:07:40,330
that's what the moderate intellect is 
like.

2157
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:45,570
It's a midget with a giant.
Well mouth generally not an ear and the 

2158
02:07:45,570 --> 02:07:50,350
being is underdeveloped,
but the intellect is hyper activated and

2159
02:07:50,490 --> 02:07:53,140
it makes the person extraordinarily 
unbalanced.

2160
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:58,380
And it's partly because a,
they can't compete outside the 

2161
02:07:58,380 --> 02:07:59,350
intellectual realm and that makes them 
very bitter because they tend to think,

2162
02:07:59,351 --> 02:08:00,370
well God,
I'm so smart.

2163
02:08:00,371 --> 02:08:01,780
Everything should just come to me.
It's like,

2164
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:03,400
sorry,
that's not how the world works.

2165
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:05,480
And,
and it,

2166
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:07,150
it also that,
that,

2167
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:08,680
and that,
that,

2168
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:13,150
that attitude is immediately evident to 
people that they're talking to when they

2169
02:08:13,151 --> 02:08:18,151
talk in the manner that they talk.
If they are arrogant intellectuals of 

2170
02:08:18,151 --> 02:08:21,241
that sort.
You see that in the simpsons did a good 

2171
02:08:21,241 --> 02:08:23,821
job of that with Comic Book Guy.
I mean he completely useless in every 

2172
02:08:24,131 --> 02:08:28,670
possible dimension with an Iq of about 
160 and it's very annoying to people who

2173
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:31,960
have an Iq of 160 that they can also be 
completely useless,

2174
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:35,320
but it happens a lot.
So yeah.

2175
02:08:37,670 --> 02:08:42,670
Thank you.

2176
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:45,830
Long time.
No,

2177
02:08:45,831 --> 02:08:47,360
see how are you doing?
Thanks.

2178
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:51,740
So I was at first going to ask about 
your thoughts on a very popular TV show.

2179
02:08:51,741 --> 02:08:52,670
Rick and Morty

2180
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:59,060
just recommended that to me and they 
said they thought I would find it funny 

2181
02:08:59,060 --> 02:09:02,161
and that makes me nervous because I like
the simpsons and I liked the trailer 

2182
02:09:02,161 --> 02:09:04,770
park boys for actually liked the Turner.
I really liked the trailer park boys.

2183
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:07,800
And so if someone said,
I know it's so sad,

2184
02:09:08,170 --> 02:09:12,690
you know,
but they said that I would like rick and

2185
02:09:12,691 --> 02:09:15,030
Morty,
so I'm kind of afraid to even watch it.

2186
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:18,750
It does have a nihilistic theme to it,
I would say.

2187
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:23,760
So that was just quite telling of the 
young population which say falling in 

2188
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,840
love with it.
Everyone's talking about it,

2189
02:09:24,841 --> 02:09:25,110
so,

2190
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:30,700
okay,
well I'll definitely watch it because 

2191
02:09:30,700 --> 02:09:30,700
I'd been looking for something to watch 
when I'm brain dead at night.

2192
02:09:30,700 --> 02:09:30,700
So,

2193
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:36,300
but I just had to tell him my question 
from a different angle if I,

2194
02:09:36,410 --> 02:09:37,380
if I may.
Um,

2195
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:39,190
and it's about,
um,

2196
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:41,480
the case that governments,
let's say,

2197
02:09:41,481 --> 02:09:46,481
such as Russia and Iran,
they are even more extreme cases like 

2198
02:09:46,481 --> 02:09:50,831
isis.
They do not want to conform to a 

2199
02:09:50,831 --> 02:09:51,680
nihilistic aspects of the West.
And as a result,

2200
02:09:51,681 --> 02:09:56,681
they've taken an anti western approach 
as someone with a Middle Eastern 

2201
02:09:56,681 --> 02:09:56,700
background.
Um,

2202
02:09:56,710 --> 02:10:01,710
I've been trying to figure out where the
origins of this hostility more precisely

2203
02:10:02,001 --> 02:10:04,790
comes from and why things are the way 
they are.

2204
02:10:05,570 --> 02:10:10,570
I recently found out that certain key 
uranium philosophers and political 

2205
02:10:10,641 --> 02:10:14,240
activist who are partially 
intellectually responsible for the 19,

2206
02:10:14,241 --> 02:10:19,241
79 and renowned revolution were highly 
influenced by the anti western 

2207
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:24,520
Heideggerian philosophy.
And this is partially why they believe 

2208
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:25,250
that an Islamic state,
uh,

2209
02:10:25,251 --> 02:10:28,550
would it be be unnecessary counter 
position,

2210
02:10:28,830 --> 02:10:29,410
uh,
to the,

2211
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:32,280
to the nihilistic western thought.
Uh,

2212
02:10:32,290 --> 02:10:34,010
you,
I know you also found there with

2213
02:10:34,570 --> 02:10:38,030
Aleksandr Dugin,
a puddings advisor,

2214
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:41,570
except Dougan doesn't really seem to 
have a coherent answer.

2215
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:46,830
He says that an answer like that is 
necessary and that hypothetically it's 

2216
02:10:46,830 --> 02:10:48,080
something that Russia might be able to 
offer,

2217
02:10:48,081 --> 02:10:51,020
but the details seem to me somewhat 
obscure.

2218
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:55,640
I mean the Russians may be,
the Russians are doing what Solzhenitsyn

2219
02:10:55,641 --> 02:10:57,890
suggested in returning to Orthodox 
Christianity,

2220
02:10:57,891 --> 02:11:02,891
although Russia's corrupt enough so that
it's very difficult to tell from the 

2221
02:11:02,891 --> 02:11:06,671
outside if that's mirror collusion 
between a corrupt church and a corrupt 

2222
02:11:06,671 --> 02:11:07,130
state or if there's something genuine 
going on there.

2223
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:08,420
Now,
you know,

2224
02:11:08,580 --> 02:11:09,160
the,
the,

2225
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:14,470
I would say there's a question under 
your question which is tyranny or 

2226
02:11:14,470 --> 02:11:15,190
nihilism?
Well,

2227
02:11:15,191 --> 02:11:17,720
that's a good question man.
That's a good question.

2228
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:23,560
Well,
lots of people would pick tyranny over 

2229
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:25,781
nihilism.
And so if that's the only choice that 

2230
02:11:25,781 --> 02:11:28,661
people are offered then.
And I also think that tyranny is 

2231
02:11:28,661 --> 02:11:28,661
stronger than nihilism because what are 
you going to do?

2232
02:11:28,661 --> 02:11:31,190
Organize nihilists hardly.
Well,

2233
02:11:31,191 --> 02:11:32,960
look at,
look at what happened to,

2234
02:11:32,961 --> 02:11:35,510
what was that thing in central park,
you know,

2235
02:11:35,511 --> 02:11:37,310
against the one percent.
Jesus.

2236
02:11:37,311 --> 02:11:39,140
I mean,
what a dismal affair that was.

2237
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:45,160
We'd like things to be different.
How well we don't know.

2238
02:11:47,950 --> 02:11:48,260
It's like

2239
02:11:49,410 --> 02:11:53,550
thank you.

2240
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:58,740
So you know your.
You can just run over that if you're a 

2241
02:11:58,740 --> 02:12:01,891
tyrannical and organized,
you can just run over that like there's 

2242
02:12:01,891 --> 02:12:04,441
nothing there at all and that I think 
there is a danger and I do think that 

2243
02:12:04,441 --> 02:12:09,121
were enticing Islamofascism let's say by
our nihilistic weakness and I think more

2244
02:12:11,711 --> 02:12:16,711
than that,
I think that we're doing something more 

2245
02:12:16,711 --> 02:12:16,711
than that because one of the things that
I've been curious about,

2246
02:12:16,711 --> 02:12:20,970
and I'm going way out on limb here,
is I've been really interested in the 

2247
02:12:20,970 --> 02:12:24,421
alliance between the Neo Marxist 
denialists suspicious or the Neo 

2248
02:12:24,421 --> 02:12:24,421
Marxist,
postmodern,

2249
02:12:24,421 --> 02:12:26,810
especially the feminists and the 
Islamofascism.

2250
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:30,280
I just don't get that.
It's like there's something very,

2251
02:12:30,281 --> 02:12:34,270
very interesting going on there and I 
think part of it is that when you,

2252
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:39,010
when you drift too far into the 
nihilistic substructure,

2253
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:44,170
there is a huge call for tyrannical 
order that manifests itself 

2254
02:12:44,170 --> 02:12:47,731
unconsciously.
And so that's the dynamic that I see 

2255
02:12:47,731 --> 02:12:50,731
playing out in that peculiar 
relationship between the modern neo 

2256
02:12:50,731 --> 02:12:53,440
Marxist feminists in the Islamic 
fascists.

2257
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,270
I don't.
I don't know.

2258
02:12:58,271 --> 02:13:03,271
That's a very.
That's very interesting that that's a 

2259
02:13:03,271 --> 02:13:04,240
very interesting idea that you brought 
to mind.

2260
02:13:04,241 --> 02:13:09,241
I had no idea that there was a 
relationship between heidegger and what 

2261
02:13:09,241 --> 02:13:12,931
happened in Iran in the 19 seventies.
If you could send me a citation about 

2262
02:13:12,931 --> 02:13:15,310
that or something to read,
I'd be very interested in doing that.

2263
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:16,420
So.
Okay.

2264
02:13:16,690 --> 02:13:17,350
Yep.
Yep.

2265
02:13:19,820 --> 02:13:23,780
Thanks.

2266
02:13:26,730 --> 02:13:29,720
Thank you.
That's,

2267
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:32,010
that's the closest thing

2268
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:37,010
I think I'll experience to,
to Arnold Schwartzenegger actually 

2269
02:13:37,010 --> 02:13:37,010
delivering that line.

2270
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:54,550
April titled the Case for Free Speech

2271
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:03,040
Distribution.
Yeah.

2272
02:14:03,970 --> 02:14:05,890
Not Ross,
but yeah.

2273
02:14:07,090 --> 02:14:12,090
Whereby I guess the square root of the 
number of people involved in some sort 

2274
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:12,220
of productive endeavor

2275
02:14:12,340 --> 02:14:13,630
do half the work

2276
02:14:14,360 --> 02:14:15,890
would result in half the production.

2277
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,080
Oh,
it's a nasty,

2278
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:18,390
nasty law.
Yeah.

2279
02:14:18,391 --> 02:14:19,890
It was also known as price's law.

2280
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:24,610
Four hundred,
500 people we've all cleaned up.

2281
02:14:27,740 --> 02:14:28,260
Great.

2282
02:14:28,410 --> 02:14:33,410
What you're saying is that if you say 
that this Perrino distribution 

2283
02:14:33,410 --> 02:14:37,570
approximates a natural law,
we all understand the force of gravity 

2284
02:14:38,530 --> 02:14:41,090
and there's no escaping the influence of
gravity,

2285
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:47,030
that means that there's 20 people in 
this room who are going to be,

2286
02:14:47,410 --> 02:14:52,410
I guess candidates to accomplishing.
I guess the goal of being the next 

2287
02:14:52,521 --> 02:14:53,330
Jordan Peterson.

2288
02:14:54,830 --> 02:14:56,300
Hopefully there's fewer of them.

2289
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:05,620
Two things.
The first is if it isn't obvious what 

2290
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:10,101
the population would be,
that you would compare this population 

2291
02:15:10,101 --> 02:15:10,530
too,
right?

2292
02:15:10,531 --> 02:15:11,550
Because you could say,
well,

2293
02:15:11,551 --> 02:15:13,470
the boundaries,
the 400 people in this room,

2294
02:15:13,471 --> 02:15:17,550
but it isn't necessarily the case.
The 400 people in this room might be the

2295
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:20,940
square root of the broader population.
We're interested in this sort of thing.

2296
02:15:20,941 --> 02:15:25,941
But with the prieto distribution,
what you also see is that it's itself 

2297
02:15:25,941 --> 02:15:27,120
similar.
And so,

2298
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:32,510
um,
let's say there's 400 people doing 

2299
02:15:32,510 --> 02:15:33,180
something,
20 of them are doing half the work,

2300
02:15:33,181 --> 02:15:36,810
but if you take 20,
those 24 of them are doing half the work

2301
02:15:36,811 --> 02:15:39,750
of the 20 and one of the forest doing 
half the work of the four.

2302
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:41,010
And so

2303
02:15:42,010 --> 02:15:42,670
it,

2304
02:15:42,820 --> 02:15:47,470
it.
So why am I telling you that it's it,

2305
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:48,540
isn't it?
Well,

2306
02:15:48,541 --> 02:15:50,610
first of all,
it isn't that there isn't useful work to

2307
02:15:50,611 --> 02:15:54,870
be done at multiple slices of the prieto
distribution.

2308
02:15:54,871 --> 02:15:59,871
But the other thing is it's also the 
case that there's not only one prieto 

2309
02:15:59,871 --> 02:15:59,871
distribution,
right?

2310
02:15:59,871 --> 02:16:00,930
Because he might say,
well,

2311
02:16:00,931 --> 02:16:05,931
if it's just the square root of the 
number of people in a domain that are 

2312
02:16:05,931 --> 02:16:06,030
doing half the work,
then what do you do with the rest of the

2313
02:16:06,031 --> 02:16:11,031
people?
And the answer to that might be while 

2314
02:16:11,031 --> 02:16:11,250
they're in a pre to a different prieto 
distribution as well,

2315
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:12,840
where they're doing something 
productive.

2316
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:13,860
So.

2317
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,600
Well,
I think it's a good question.

2318
02:16:24,601 --> 02:16:24,950
Like,
ah,

2319
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:26,030
we don't exactly.
Um,

2320
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:28,140
so,
so the basic rule is the look,

2321
02:16:28,141 --> 02:16:33,141
the basic rule is example,
if you take 100 scientists in a given 

2322
02:16:33,141 --> 02:16:37,141
domain,
10 of them will have published half the 

2323
02:16:37,141 --> 02:16:37,390
papers.
And this works with everything.

2324
02:16:37,391 --> 02:16:40,270
It works with every creative domain.
The rule applies.

2325
02:16:40,810 --> 02:16:45,810
So now the question is why?
And I think the answer to that seems to 

2326
02:16:45,810 --> 02:16:49,801
be,
and I've watched people who've become 

2327
02:16:49,801 --> 02:16:51,301
spectacularly successful and what 
happens is that zero is a really bad 

2328
02:16:51,881 --> 02:16:53,290
place to be,
right?

2329
02:16:53,291 --> 02:16:58,291
It's really hard to get out of zero.
And that's often why people are trapped 

2330
02:16:58,291 --> 02:17:02,671
in poverty because if you have nothing 
getting to something is virtually 

2331
02:17:02,671 --> 02:17:04,270
impossible.
Once you have something,

2332
02:17:04,271 --> 02:17:06,910
getting to a little more of something is
actually quite a bit easier.

2333
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:12,270
And so what seems to happen,
this is also called the matthew 

2334
02:17:13,091 --> 02:17:14,560
principle,
right?

2335
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:18,310
It's the same principle.
So that's a new testament citation.

2336
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:23,400
Let's say the matthew principle is to 
those who have everything more will be 

2337
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:27,580
given from those who have nothing.
Everything will be taken.

2338
02:17:27,730 --> 02:17:32,730
That's another one of those lines in the
new testament that you'd think that a 

2339
02:17:32,730 --> 02:17:33,180
good editor would have just got rid of.
So but,

2340
02:17:33,181 --> 02:17:38,181
but,
but I think what it is is that every 

2341
02:17:38,181 --> 02:17:40,411
time you make a step forward,
the probability that you'll be able to 

2342
02:17:40,411 --> 02:17:44,161
take the next step forward increases.
And it seems to increase in a nonlinear 

2343
02:17:44,161 --> 02:17:44,161
way.
So the,

2344
02:17:44,161 --> 02:17:48,650
the world that the matthew principal 
describes is nonlinear.

2345
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:49,570
You know,
so you might say,

2346
02:17:49,571 --> 02:17:54,571
well,
what's your trajectory if you're moving 

2347
02:17:54,571 --> 02:17:54,571
upward?
Well,

2348
02:17:54,571 --> 02:17:55,030
it's not this,
it's this.

2349
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:58,150
What's your trajectory if you're moving 
downward,

2350
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:01,090
it's not this,
it's this,

2351
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:02,710
right?
You Fall,

2352
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:04,330
you fall,
you plummet,

2353
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:06,730
you rise,
you rise,

2354
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:11,850
you transcend.
It's something like that and you might 

2355
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:11,850
say,
well that's a hell of a world,

2356
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:15,661
but whatever.
It has to be run by some principle and 

2357
02:18:15,661 --> 02:18:15,850
the principle that it appears to be run 
by.

2358
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,070
Yes,

2359
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:25,850
no,
no,

2360
02:18:25,851 --> 02:18:27,200
no.
It doesn't mean that at all.

2361
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:31,040
What it means is that every truth claim 
you make,

2362
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:34,340
including those that are implicit in 
your actions,

2363
02:18:34,670 --> 02:18:39,670
carries with it an ethic that justifies 
or doesn't justify the action.

2364
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:45,220
So for example,
let's say I have a tool and I say it's 

2365
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:46,880
an ax and I go out in the forest and I 
cut down.

2366
02:18:46,881 --> 02:18:49,400
I tried to cut down a tree with it and 
it doesn't work.

2367
02:18:49,850 --> 02:18:52,730
It's not an ax,
it's something else.

2368
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:54,020
And so what the,
what the.

2369
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:58,430
There's a good book on pragmatism called
the metaphysical club,

2370
02:18:58,431 --> 02:19:03,431
a history of American ideas.
It's one I would really recommend and 

2371
02:19:03,431 --> 02:19:06,400
what the pragmatists.
I can't give you a full answer because 

2372
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:09,011
this is such a complicated issue,
but what the pragmatist we're wrestling 

2373
02:19:09,011 --> 02:19:11,930
with back in the late 18 hundreds,
the late 18 hundreds.

2374
02:19:12,050 --> 02:19:14,960
This was William James and his crew in,
in in Boston.

2375
02:19:15,330 --> 02:19:18,160
I'm including a philosopher named CS 
purse,

2376
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:20,330
who is perhaps America's greatest 
philosopher.

2377
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:26,740
They were wrestling with the same issue 
that the postmodernist would wrestle 

2378
02:19:26,740 --> 02:19:26,740
with 100 years later,
which is

2379
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:31,190
things are indefinitely complex and 
we're not very bright.

2380
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:36,520
So how is it that we can make claims to 
truth about anything and what they were,

2381
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:41,210
what their hypothesis essentially was,
is that with every action and with every

2382
02:19:41,211 --> 02:19:46,211
truth claim you similar demarcate a 
territory within which that claim is 

2383
02:19:46,211 --> 02:19:50,060
valid and you,
you determine whether the claim is valid

2384
02:19:50,061 --> 02:19:55,061
by noting whether your prediction about 
the outcome of your action or your or 

2385
02:19:55,061 --> 02:19:59,651
your belief is commensurate is in 
keeping with so if the outcome is in 

2386
02:20:01,041 --> 02:20:06,041
keeping with the prediction than what 
you've said or done is true or good 

2387
02:20:06,041 --> 02:20:10,640
enough and that's as good as you get.
And so that's the pragmatic perspective.

2388
02:20:10,641 --> 02:20:12,260
And then when,
when,

2389
02:20:12,710 --> 02:20:16,910
when the pragmatists encountered Charles
Dark Charles Darwin's works works,

2390
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:22,330
they immediately recognized that Darwin 
had generated a pragmatic solution to 

2391
02:20:22,330 --> 02:20:24,050
the problem of the impossibility of 
being.

2392
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:29,530
The impossibility of being is this,
there's way more cosmos than there is 

2393
02:20:29,530 --> 02:20:29,810
you.

2394
02:20:30,230 --> 02:20:35,230
You are going to die.
You cannot generate a sufficient 

2395
02:20:35,230 --> 02:20:37,610
solution to the problem of you're being.
No one can.

2396
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:38,540
Nothing.
Cat,

2397
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:42,860
it's like the environment is a snake 
that moves unpredictably across time and

2398
02:20:42,861 --> 02:20:45,080
you're trying to stay on its back while 
I was how to,

2399
02:20:45,110 --> 02:20:47,600
how does the Darwinian process deal with
that?

2400
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:51,020
It produces infinite variance roughly 
speaking,

2401
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:56,380
almost all of which die.
And that's how it solves the problem 

2402
02:20:56,380 --> 02:20:57,900
across time and the things that exist.
This,

2403
02:20:57,980 --> 02:21:00,950
the things that stay alive,
our true enough,

2404
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:03,710
and that's the best you get.
That's the argument I was trying to have

2405
02:21:03,711 --> 02:21:06,850
with Sam Harris because Harris doesn't 
take his evolutionary cycle,

2406
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:08,780
his evolutionary theory,
seriously enough,

2407
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:11,030
but we get.
We kept getting bogged down.

2408
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:12,370
Anyways,
that's,

2409
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:17,900
that's the best answer to that.
I'd like to agree with that,

2410
02:21:17,901 --> 02:21:18,770
but it's not true.

2411
02:21:23,050 --> 02:21:27,710
Yup,
Yup,

2412
02:21:27,710 --> 02:21:32,710
Yup,
Yup.

2413
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:39,170
True scientific.

2414
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:42,160
You really do like to ask hard 
questions,

2415
02:21:42,161 --> 02:21:43,520
don't you?
Um,

2416
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,580
I think it depends.
See,

2417
02:21:45,581 --> 02:21:48,850
this is also why like the Piagetian take
let's say on,

2418
02:21:48,970 --> 02:21:53,970
on pragmatism,
because I think that pragmatism as a 

2419
02:21:53,970 --> 02:21:56,020
philosophy has the limitation that you 
just described,

2420
02:21:56,860 --> 02:21:59,170
but only if you think about the Games is
limited.

2421
02:21:59,860 --> 02:22:02,380
If you have to play the game in an 
iterative way,

2422
02:22:02,530 --> 02:22:07,530
then that issue resolves itself and the 
game theorists have done a good job of 

2423
02:22:07,530 --> 02:22:09,730
mapping that out.
It's like you could say,

2424
02:22:09,731 --> 02:22:14,731
let's say pragmatically speaking,
there is no reason I shouldn't deceive 

2425
02:22:14,731 --> 02:22:14,731
you once.
If I can get what I want,

2426
02:22:14,790 --> 02:22:15,730
it's yeah.
Yeah.

2427
02:22:15,790 --> 02:22:19,270
Except that I'm probably not only going 
to interact with you once.

2428
02:22:19,450 --> 02:22:24,450
I'm going to interact with you a lot and
even if it isn't you that I interact 

2429
02:22:24,450 --> 02:22:27,781
with,
it's going to be a bunch of beings that 

2430
02:22:27,781 --> 02:22:27,781
are so much you that it might as well 
be.

2431
02:22:27,781 --> 02:22:30,300
You might as well be you.
It's going to be me if nothing else.

2432
02:22:30,301 --> 02:22:35,301
And so the pragmatic game stretched 
across time would include the necessity 

2433
02:22:36,211 --> 02:22:41,211
of interability in relationship to the 
validations of the truth claims.

2434
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:45,070
That's,
that's how it looks to me when you.

2435
02:22:46,010 --> 02:22:46,860
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna.

2436
02:22:46,890 --> 02:22:48,890
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

2437
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:53,720
Stop you say that again?
Denied on several occasions.

2438
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:57,510
Yes.
Like you're good at rhetoric.

2439
02:22:57,780 --> 02:22:59,910
Yes.
Thank you.

2440
02:23:01,470 --> 02:23:03,180
Yes.
But that's not all I am.

2441
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:13,460
Uh,
so this is on behalf of somebody,

2442
02:23:13,550 --> 02:23:18,550
uh,
Dr Peterson having listened to your 

2443
02:23:18,550 --> 02:23:20,421
expositions on the mythological 
evolution and amalgamation of religion 

2444
02:23:20,421 --> 02:23:24,020
and keeping in mind your working 
definitions of belief and truth and 

2445
02:23:24,020 --> 02:23:27,060
despite the obvious reasons for somebody
of your background to identify most with

2446
02:23:27,061 --> 02:23:32,061
Christianity,
my understanding is that you believe 

2447
02:23:32,061 --> 02:23:34,880
Christianity to be the most complete and
articulated form of many of the 

2448
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:36,120
metaphysical ideas that proceeded.
It led up to that.

2449
02:23:36,750 --> 02:23:41,750
Keeping that in mind,
would it also be accurate to therefore 

2450
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:41,750
say that you're not only a believer in 
Christianity,

2451
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:45,650
but also if to a lesser degree also 
believer in,

2452
02:23:45,940 --> 02:23:50,940
in Marta,
in the ancient Egyptian gods and the 

2453
02:23:50,940 --> 02:23:50,940
subsequent gods that you've spoken of 
here,

2454
02:23:50,940 --> 02:23:52,140
uh,
that lead up and contributed to the form

2455
02:23:52,141 --> 02:23:55,500
of Christianity that you're discussing 
and that you identify with.

2456
02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:01,960
Okay.
I got to take that one apart a little 

2457
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:03,801
bit.
I'm bounded in my judgment with regards 

2458
02:24:03,801 --> 02:24:08,571
to Christianity by my ignorance.
I'm no student of Hinduism so I can't 

2459
02:24:12,061 --> 02:24:17,061
make the claim forthrightly that there's
something intrinsically superior to the 

2460
02:24:17,881 --> 02:24:22,080
Judeo Christian tradition because I 
don't know enough to make that claim.

2461
02:24:23,130 --> 02:24:28,130
The claim I can make is that there's 
something that's dreadfully right about 

2462
02:24:28,130 --> 02:24:32,690
this core elements of the Judeo 
Christian tradition and I've seen 

2463
02:24:32,690 --> 02:24:33,180
analogs to that.
Like one of the things I'd like to do,

2464
02:24:33,181 --> 02:24:38,181
for example,
is to do a a short series on the Tao Te 

2465
02:24:38,181 --> 02:24:40,710
Ching because that is one remarkable 
document.

2466
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:43,440
Once you know,
especially you might want to read it,

2467
02:24:43,470 --> 02:24:45,180
you can go online and read.
It's very short.

2468
02:24:45,181 --> 02:24:50,181
Tao Te Ching t a o,
t h I C H I n g,

2469
02:24:50,850 --> 02:24:55,850
and it's the fundamental texts of Taoism
and once you know that the world of 

2470
02:24:55,850 --> 02:25:00,141
being is made of chaos and order and you
know that that's represented by the Yin 

2471
02:25:00,141 --> 02:25:04,581
and the Yang,
all of a sudden you can understand the 

2472
02:25:04,581 --> 02:25:04,581
Tao te Ching and it's just.

2473
02:25:04,581 --> 02:25:08,160
It's brilliantly simple and 
straightforward in new sex position,

2474
02:25:08,250 --> 02:25:11,550
but it also seems to me to be entirely 
commensurate with the line of,

2475
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:14,910
of let's call it logic.
It's more like a,

2476
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:19,740
the the mode of description of being 
that's encapsulated in these stories.

2477
02:25:20,190 --> 02:25:22,800
Now with regards to being a believer,
people ask me all the time,

2478
02:25:22,801 --> 02:25:23,590
two thinks,
hey,

2479
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:25,900
do you believe in God and are you a 
Christian?

2480
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:28,150
And they answered without both of those 
is actually.

2481
02:25:28,210 --> 02:25:33,210
There's two answers.
One is what the hell makes you think 

2482
02:25:33,210 --> 02:25:33,220
it's any of your business?
That's the first answer.

2483
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:38,340
And the second is why do you think that 
you mean the same thing with those 

2484
02:25:38,340 --> 02:25:39,760
questions that I would mean with my 
answer.

2485
02:25:40,450 --> 02:25:42,030
So you know,
because it's,

2486
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:44,920
it's such a funny thing because I've 
spent like three.

2487
02:25:45,470 --> 02:25:48,420
This is no accusation with regards to 
your questions in the least.

2488
02:25:48,430 --> 02:25:48,600
You know,

2489
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:53,700
I think it's more about trying to track 
the development of these ideas and you 

2490
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:53,700
know,
the residual truths and psych,

2491
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:56,530
psychological significance of all these 
other traditions that team.

2492
02:25:56,590 --> 02:25:57,460
Well,
you know,

2493
02:25:57,690 --> 02:25:58,550
the,
the.

2494
02:25:58,700 --> 02:26:03,700
I've been floored by either mythological
structures like when I first understood 

2495
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:10,120
or thought I understood the meaning of 
the Mesopotamian creation method,

2496
02:26:10,121 --> 02:26:13,270
just I've never recovered from that I 
would say,

2497
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:18,420
and the same thing is true of the 
investigations I did into the Egyptian 

2498
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:21,040
myths of Horus and Isis and Osiris and 
seth.

2499
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:24,700
It's just they,
they're so relevant.

2500
02:26:24,701 --> 02:26:26,920
I mean there are so unbelievably 
relevant.

2501
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:31,921
And how do,
how do see this is a problem that none 

2502
02:26:31,921 --> 02:26:33,250
of us really know how to,
how to solve.

2503
02:26:33,251 --> 02:26:36,100
It's like there are sources of wisdom 
all over the world,

2504
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:41,280
let's say,
and they need to be made commensurate 

2505
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:44,971
with one another,
which isn't to say that they need to be 

2506
02:26:44,971 --> 02:26:45,670
turned into a fast food.
A mall,

2507
02:26:45,690 --> 02:26:46,240
you know,
that's,

2508
02:26:46,241 --> 02:26:47,710
that's like multiculturalism,
right?

2509
02:26:47,711 --> 02:26:52,711
It's like all the food of the world 
served in the most terrible possible 

2510
02:26:52,711 --> 02:26:55,060
manner all in one place and something 
like that.

2511
02:26:55,060 --> 02:26:57,250
And you don't want to do that with 
comparative religion.

2512
02:26:57,640 --> 02:26:59,650
It's just water everything down and say,
well,

2513
02:26:59,651 --> 02:27:00,670
it's all nice.
It's like,

2514
02:27:00,671 --> 02:27:01,840
no,
it is not nice.

2515
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:07,380
Yeah.
Or that it's all the same because it's 

2516
02:27:07,380 --> 02:27:08,971
not all the same.
So the job of communicating between 

2517
02:27:09,941 --> 02:27:13,660
those domains of wisdom is really 
continuing.

2518
02:27:13,661 --> 02:27:18,661
Right?
It's been a problem ever since the 

2519
02:27:18,661 --> 02:27:21,420
beginning of civilization,
but it's continuing and I would say the 

2520
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:22,330
psychoanalysts too young in particular 
was a huge,

2521
02:27:22,331 --> 02:27:27,331
huge steps in the direction of doing 
that in an extraordinarily positive way 

2522
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:31,420
and not a simple minded way at all and 
not just hand waving that.

2523
02:27:31,421 --> 02:27:36,421
Oh well it's.
Everyone has one in all shall have 

2524
02:27:36,421 --> 02:27:36,421
prizes.
Not that.

2525
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:36,910
So yeah,

2526
02:27:37,450 --> 02:27:42,450
thank you.

2527
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:43,930
Last question

2528
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:50,600
actually is a kind of in the same vein,
but it's in regards to another kind of 

2529
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:54,161
mythology.
So in terms of I guess Carl Jung's own 

2530
02:27:54,161 --> 02:27:54,280
those,
sorry to mix.

2531
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:57,050
Certainly tall,
but a lot of the.

2532
02:27:57,770 --> 02:28:01,250
I actually found some kind of archetypes
like for example,

2533
02:28:01,251 --> 02:28:03,980
in my own life,
but also I've noticed in European life.

2534
02:28:04,310 --> 02:28:09,310
So for example,
in regards to Odin and norse mythology 

2535
02:28:09,310 --> 02:28:12,770
with Carl Jung's essay,
I've only been able to touch you skim it

2536
02:28:12,771 --> 02:28:14,970
because I've been trying to find 
something like.

2537
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Because it felt like there's always this
kind of psyche that was almost 

2538
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:20,000
underneath,
I guess,

2539
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:24,701
Western civilization and we've seen it 
really like embodied in this specific 

2540
02:28:24,951 --> 02:28:25,850
figure,
this deity,

2541
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:27,800
the wanderer,
the knowledge,

2542
02:28:27,820 --> 02:28:30,860
gather the seeker,
but he's also a war.

2543
02:28:30,861 --> 02:28:35,861
God is,
he is all these different aspects that 

2544
02:28:35,861 --> 02:28:38,270
are an accumulation of what seems to be 
something that's distinctly western.

2545
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:43,070
And I feel this is almost like the 
symbol in a way.

2546
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:45,110
Of course,
it's not always positive.

2547
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:48,890
There seems to be something.
Maybe there seems to be something.

2548
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:53,950
I do think that the idea of the 
individual has been articulated most 

2549
02:28:53,961 --> 02:28:56,840
fully in the west.
I don't think that's really a,

2550
02:28:57,170 --> 02:29:00,200
I don't think that's a contentious claim
actually.

2551
02:29:00,570 --> 02:29:05,570
Um,
that doesn't mean that the latent 

2552
02:29:05,570 --> 02:29:09,040
structures from which that idea might 
emerge weren't also many other places 

2553
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:13,811
simultaneously.
And the other thing from let's say from 

2554
02:29:13,811 --> 02:29:16,811
a biological perspective is that we're 
only talking about differences of a few 

2555
02:29:16,811 --> 02:29:18,770
hundred years in terms of the 
manifestation of these ideas.

2556
02:29:18,771 --> 02:29:19,310
Right?
From A,

2557
02:29:19,610 --> 02:29:21,410
from an evolutionary perspective,
that's,

2558
02:29:21,710 --> 02:29:23,270
it's instantaneous.
And it's like,

2559
02:29:23,271 --> 02:29:25,580
well,
a new idea has to arise somewhere.

2560
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:28,340
So it's going to be somewhere first and 
but it,

2561
02:29:28,341 --> 02:29:30,650
it's spreading.
Christianity for example,

2562
02:29:30,651 --> 02:29:35,651
spreads so rapidly that it's absolutely 
beyond belief and it is actually 

2563
02:29:35,651 --> 02:29:36,530
spreading more rapidly in China now than
it did in ancient Rome.

2564
02:29:36,950 --> 02:29:37,430
So.

2565
02:29:37,700 --> 02:29:42,700
Well in regards to that,
it's also been seen like almost in the 

2566
02:29:42,700 --> 02:29:46,451
wake of a dying Christianity.
I've noticed that like there's been a 

2567
02:29:46,451 --> 02:29:47,540
tendency to go towards I guess paganism,
right?

2568
02:29:47,810 --> 02:29:49,360
Yes.
I'm understand the lake.

2569
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:51,520
Some people love at off.
Yes,

2570
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:56,540
you have waco,
which was mainly a manifestation of all 

2571
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:58,880
Alistair Crowley has it works which were
then handed off to whoever actually made

2572
02:29:58,881 --> 02:30:02,360
the actual ideology.
And then next thing you know,

2573
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:07,280
we're finding something almost more 
stable in I guess norse mythology and it

2574
02:30:07,281 --> 02:30:12,200
seems like it's acting almost as a 
pendulum swing from something that.

2575
02:30:12,650 --> 02:30:14,010
Well,
people are like.

2576
02:30:14,150 --> 02:30:15,010
The thing is,
is when,

2577
02:30:15,011 --> 02:30:15,560
when,
when,

2578
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:17,930
when one mythological structure 
collapses,

2579
02:30:18,530 --> 02:30:22,160
it's going to collapse into another 
mythological structure or another set of

2580
02:30:22,161 --> 02:30:25,070
mythological structures and,
and because you,

2581
02:30:25,071 --> 02:30:27,530
you can't get out of the mythological 
structures,

2582
02:30:27,531 --> 02:30:29,800
there's no possible way of doing that.
What?

2583
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:35,080
And so I wouldn't say necessarily that 
the fact that other belief systems 

2584
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:37,880
emerge in the aftermath of the collapse 
of the overarching belief system,

2585
02:30:37,881 --> 02:30:39,920
I don't think that that's necessarily a 
bad idea.

2586
02:30:40,220 --> 02:30:43,160
I think that it has its attendant 
dangers.

2587
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:48,700
And so I should stop because I'm 
starting to get tired and I'm not going 

2588
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:50,520
to be able to formulate any clear 
answers than that.

2589
02:30:50,521 --> 02:30:53,380
And it's also 10:00.
So we also do have to start.

2590
02:30:57,970 --> 02:30:58,590
Oh yes.

2591
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:06,460
There is an unofficial meetup and 
discussion group at Hemingway's 

2592
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:06,650
restaurant.
Second floor,

2593
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:11,330
142 cumberland street.
Just say you're with the Jordan Peterson

2594
02:31:11,331 --> 02:31:13,010
discussion group.
Yes.

2595
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:18,100
Everyone is invited.
If you say you're with the Jordan 

2596
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:18,600
Peterson discussion group,
please don't miss.

2597
02:31:18,601 --> 02:31:20,010
Behave too badly.
