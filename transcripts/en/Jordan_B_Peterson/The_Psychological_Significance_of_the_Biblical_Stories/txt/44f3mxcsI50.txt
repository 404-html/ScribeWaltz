Speaker 1:          00:00:16       So I'm going to read you something. I get some, I get a lot of mail and I don't know where I got this. I have been a lot of different places in the last week and this showed up at one of them and I'm going to read it to you. I have no idea what to make of it. It's written in a female hand. So that's about all I can tell, but there's no address or name on it. This isn't a question, but a comment or more accurately perhaps a message. I spent this past weekend in an Iowaska ceremony, which for those of you who don't know is a South American visionary plant medicine. Some of you may roll your eyes at this, but IOWASCA brings you into direct contact with the archetypal realm of being. Users of this medicine initiates, I should say, refer to Iowasca as she because the spirit of the plant is decidedly feminine and encounter with Iowasca is an encounter with the great mother of creation, the goddess, the void from which all things come. The Feminine counterpart of Logos, Dr Peterson, you appeared in one of my Osca visions.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Might account for why have been rather fatigued late. Dr Peterson. You appeared in one of my Iowasca visions and I asked, I asked her, who is Jordan Peterson? What is he doing that which is something I'd really like to know as well, and she responded with Kristalina clarity quote here he is here to invoke and initiate the divine masculine principle on earth at this time.

Speaker 2:          00:02:18       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       So I'm up here to thank you deeply and profoundly on behalf of the great mother herself, the goddess, the divine feminine principle who has been eagerly awaiting the awakening of the masculine principle into divinity and service. So, you know, get a letter like that every day. Actually I get a letter to like that every day. So you know what went through my head when I read this and this is of course completely crazy, but we know one of the things I learned to do as a psychotherapist was just to tell people who were talking to me, what came into my head, what I'm thinking. Exactly. Because that's not exactly the same thing, you know what comes into your head is more like a dream. It comes unbidden and it's like your imagination. If you're thinking, there seems to be like a voluntary element of that, right? I mean some of who God only knows how we think, but it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       It seems partly voluntary at least, and you only thought about it, Carl young thought about it like a dialogue between the conscious mind and the unconscious mind. There was a constant continual dialogue, but when things just pop into your mind, it's not much different than walking into a room. Having something there, which is an observation. I also derived from young by the way, because he pointed out quite rightly that people don't really think that thoughts appear to them. Now you can think because you can take the thoughts that appear to you and then you can subject them to criticism and elaboration and so on instead of just assuming that they're true right off the bat, but people often don't do that. They just. Something just pops into their head and then they assume that it's true. Anyways. One of the things that I tend to do in psychotherapy is just to tell people what pops into my head because, well, why?

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       Because then the person that is talking to me gets one person's untrammeled opinion. Not even that reaction, not opinion. It's not really an opinion. I don't think an opinion maybe is what I think later. And there's this personal flavor to it. What popped into my head was this story about socrates, you know, he had this when he was being put on trial by the Athenians for corrupting the nation's youth. Something I've been accused of by the way, although it's not self evident to me that it's me doing the corrupting. Um, he said that somebody had asked him once, had asked the delphic oracle once and the delphic oracle was this retreat that you could go to if you were an ancient Greek citizen and you'd, you'd, you'd be there and you'd have a dream and then you'd go ask the delphic oracle to interpret it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:16       And nobody really knows what was up with the delphic oracle today, how that worked exactly. But she would interpret your dream in any case. And somebody wants to ask her who the wisest man in Greece was and the delphic oracle said it was socrates because he knew he didn't know anything. That's essentially the story that popped into my mind. It's a crazy comparison. But you know, I have a crazy wine so I guess that's how it works out. So now one of the things I'm going to do today, which I haven't done before because I'm going to read you a little bit of. I told you I finished my book last week and I haven't read it, read to anyone.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       I have given it to a couple of friends to review a one person in particular, a screenwriter named Gregg Hurwitz has been unbelievably helpful. He's so fast and so sharp at this sort of thing and I can send him like a 20 page dense 20 page manuscript and he'll rip it to shreds and send it back to me and like 90 minutes. It's just unbelievable. He's so good at that. He's been very helpful, but I haven't. No one else has seen it depart from my editor and I haven't read it to anyone. So. But some of it seemed particularly appropriate for tonight's lecture, so I thought I would start the lecture tonight by reading a little bit of it, and it's. It's from a chapter. It's on the issue of sacrifice as such. This is Abraham and Isaac. This is a very strange old testament story, right?

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       This is one of the stories that's contained in the old testament that makes modern people think that maybe we should just not have that much to do with the old testament per say it at all, and especially with regards and maybe shouldn't have anything to do with the god of the Old Testament either. Because I mean, as far as Abraham is concerned, God tells him to sacrifice his own son. Now it turns out that God was just kidding, so to speak. You know, I'm obviously being flippant, but it does raise the question, what do you make of a divine being? Who would, who would require such thing, such a thing? Or conversely, what do you make of Abraham who would have such delusions? Either way, it's a little hard on the what would you call modern believability and moral integrity of the Old Testament, but these are very, very strange storks and they're not what they seem to be or they are, but they're more so.

Speaker 3:          00:07:43       We're going to talk a lot about sacrifice tonight and here's some of the things that I've been thinking about sacrifice. So this is from. This book is called 12 rules for life, an antidote for chaos and it's coming out in January, which I think I mentioned and this is from rule seven, which is do what is meaningful, not what is expedient. And so here's, here's some of the writing I've been doing over the last three years on the, on the Motif of sacrifice. I'll start with just a brief intro before I read this. It took me a long time to understand what was meant in the Old Testament by sacrifice and which is strange because once I figured it out, it seemed bloody obvious. It seemed like, oh y'all. Obviously that's what it means, but lots of times if you figure something out correctly, it seems self evident as soon as you figured it out correctly. Well, we'll see how that goes, but it seemed to work for me anyways.

Speaker 3:          00:08:45       I knew that of course, at least implicitly I knew of the modern usage of the idea of sacrifice. Everyone understands that Motif is that if you want to make things better in the future, then you make sacrifices in the present and maybe you even do that multi-generationally. In fact, you most definitely do if you're a good parent. I mean, and that's I would say that's really particularly typical of of of immigrants because immigrants often come from terrible places and have to undergo terrible things to come to a new community where they get a rough reception and have a hard time getting their life going and a big part of the reason that they do it is to make their lives of their children better and luckily when they come to Canada, usually given where they came from, that actually works because where they came from is worse and here is better.

Speaker 3:          00:09:39       Even though you know immigrants often have to struggle to to get on their feet again, they have to learn a new language and becoming culturated and face the fact that they're not part of the mainstream culture and well, you know, many of you know the whole story, so the idea that you make sacrifices for the future and you make sacrifices for your children and that's everyone understands that and it's part of being responsible and mature and shouldering the burden of being properly, and you do that for yourself too. If you're disciplined in, in fact, that's almost what discipline means. That discipline means that you're capable of making sacrifices because you're not disciplined. If you just do something you want more rather than something that you're doing that's not disciplined, that's maybe that works then great. If your life is working out that way, great man, but that isn't.

Speaker 3:          00:10:27       That isn't disciplined. This is plan is when you want to do something right now and instead you think, no, I'm going to forestall my gratification. Maybe forever, but certainly for a very long period of tar medium to long period of time and you concentrate on something that you think will bear fruit in the medium to long run, and so you'll look into the future and you decide that by making today a little less impulsively pleasurable, shall we say you'll make tomorrow a little bit more secure and productive and then you actually do it too. And that's difficult. You know, and we discussed last week, Adam and Eve's discovery of the future and the revelation of the possibility of the future, including the possibility of tragedy and suffering in the future. And it's our knowledge of the possibility of tragedy and suffering in the future that motivates us to sacrifice in the present so that we can reduce the unnecessary anxiety and uncertainty and pain that awaits us.

Speaker 3:          00:11:29       Now. That's a negative way of putting it. We're also doing it so that we can have some joy and we can make life better and all of that. And, and that's not trivial, but the fundamental issue, especially once you have small children, this fundamental issue is to stave the suffering the hell off, right? That's what you want to do. That's your primary moral obligation. If you're a person who has any, if your eyes are open at all, that's your primary obligation and so you make the sacrifices that are necessary and you set up the future and well, the the Motif of sacrifice is there in the Old Testament, but it's more, it's so concrete that it's difficult to draw a parallel between the two. At least for me, they didn't align self evidently and I don't remember in my rather limited religious education as a child in the United Church because I went to the United Church till I was about 13.

Speaker 3:          00:12:26       I don't ever remember anybody pointing out that the sacrifices that can enable, we're making or the sacrifice that Abraham was supposed to make or the sacrifices that people were making to God. We're the call were the precursors, let's say the dramatic precursors to the psychological idea of sacrifice that we all hold as civilized people in the modern world. So although it seems obvious, as I said, once you lay it out, I don't remember that ever being explained to me, but, and then, well, and then let me read this. So now that I sort of introduced it, here's what happened. As humanity developed, first we're the endless tens or hundreds of thousands of years prior to the emergence of written history and drama, the twin practices of delay and exchange began to emerge slowly and painfully. So here's a cool psychological study. So it's called the marshmallow test and maybe it's even a reliable study.

Speaker 3:          00:13:31       Even though it was done by social psychologists, it's probably replicable and it's a nice study. So you take small children and you bring them into a room and you put something that they would like in front of them, a marshmallow and you then you torture them. Basically you say see that marshmallow and the things I see that marshmallow. It's like you can have that marshmallow right now or if you wait, I think the experiment is 10 minutes. Then you can have two marshmallows. And so that puts the child in quite a conundrum because they're being asked to trade in actual concrete, tangible marshmallow for two hypothetical future marshmallows and it's not that easy to conjure up a hypothetical future reality that has the same tangible significance as something real right in front of you. And so it's amazing thing that people can do that. And so then the experimenter leaves and some children's grabbed the marshmallow and just chomp that thing down right now.

Speaker 3:          00:14:38       Other kids, they videotaped kids while they're waiting and they do all sorts of things. They whistled, they look at the ceiling, they sit on their hands, you know, they try to distract themselves. Course they're eyeing that marshmallow, like a squirrel lying and not and, and trying to restrain themselves. And you know, what I see in that is that the child's prefrontal Cortex, the higher cortical systems are warring with the underlying motivational systems, more primordial motivational systems that govern such things as hunger. The hunger system, hypothalamic system says there is something sweet and fat, right? Sitting there, right bloody. Now grab that thing and stuff it down. Now, and I'm sure many of you have a constant battle with your hypothalamus with regards to sweet and fat things and often lose so you can feel some sympathy for the child, but the hypothalamus has these tremendously powerful tendrils upward into the brain, into the parts that we would associate more with voluntary control and the voluntary control centers have these little weak ribbons going down to control the hypothalamus since it's pretty obvious if you know something about neuroanatomy, what part is actually in charge when the chips are down, and it's not easy for children to learn to regulate those underlying primordial impulses.

Speaker 3:          00:15:59       The ones that are wired in, the ones that we share with animals, but they do it and, and, and the cool thing is, this is what Walter Michelle found. He's the guy who did the study, was that the longterm outcome for the children who can delay gratification in the marshmallow test is much more positive than it is for the children that are impulsive and eat the marshmallow instantly. It's delay of gratification. Now it's likely that that's associated with trait conscientiousness, although that specifically has that specific connection has not yet been established, but they seem conceptually very, very similar. Um, so, so anyways, this emerges in children probably between the ages of two and four, something like that. They should have it in place by four because it's very difficult for them to really interact well with other children without having that delay of gratification in place because you can't delay gratification.

Speaker 3:          00:16:57       Other kids don't like you because you're, you want everything your way and you want it now and you're, you're liable to temper tantrums and that sort of thing. You haven't got to kind of self control necessary to make you fun to play with. So you can see that emerging in children and it's pretty. It's pretty interesting. And not only that, if it emerges, it predicts positive longterm outcomes, just like trait conscientiousness does, by the way, because trait conscientiousness is the second best predictor of longterm success over the lifespan. In Western cultures, it's second after intelligence. And so in our societies, the people who do best across time are the people who have high iqs and who work hard, and I would say that's a pretty decent, what would you call it? It's a validation in some sense that our cultures are working properly because what you would want, I would say if the system is working meritocratic

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       Lee like it should, and if you're trying to extract resources from those who can contribute at a higher rate than what you would want to have happen is that the hardworking, smart people do better. Hopefully. If that's the case, then everyone does better hopefully

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       anyways, so you can see this developing in children first worthy, endless tens or hundreds of thousands of years. Prior to the emergence of written history and drama, the twin practices of delay and exchange began to emerge slowly and painfully. They hadn't. They became represented in metaphorical abstraction as rituals and tales of sacrifice. It says, if there's a powerful figure in the sky who's judging you, you better keep them happy or look the hell out. We've been watching ourselves deal with him for a long time. He seems to like it when you give up something you value, so practice sharing and sacrificing until you get good at it. No one actually said any of this so long ago, although they said something very similar, but it was implicit in the practice and then in the stories action comes first. Implicit comes first. People watched the successful succeed and the unsuccessful fail for thousands and thousands of years and we thought it over and we drew a conclusion. The successful among us sacrifice, the successful among us, delay gratification, the successful among us bargain with the future, and then a great idea begins to emerge in evermore articulated form. That idea is the point of a long and profound story.

Speaker 1:          00:19:41       It's the moral of this story and I'm going to engage in some foreshadowing here. What's the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful? The successful sacrifice and things get better as the successful practice. There are sacrifices. The question becomes increasingly precise and simultaneously broader.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       What is the greatest possible sacrifice for the greatest possible? Good. No. If you. If you push a question in section, perhaps there comes a time when you can't formulate it any more precisely and broadly and and, and that, that, that, that's the point at which the question in some sense, and perhaps even the answer, the question becomes archetipal, it becomes archetipal because it, it can't be bested and, and this is like an ultimate question in some sense. How are you going to ask a more broad based question than that? What is given the initial presuppositions that you have to make sacrifices? Then the logical end point to that is something like, okay, if you have to make a sacrifice, was the greatest possible sacrifice and for the greatest possible good. Now that's a good question. The answer becomes increasingly profound. The God of Western tradition, like so many gods requires sacrifice. We've already examined why, but sometimes he goes even further and requires the sacrifice of what is love best. This is why, and this is another one of mankind's fundamental discoveries. Sometimes things do not go well, that, that self evident, but here's the rub. Sometimes when things are not going well, it's precisely that which is most valued. That is the cause,

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       why? It's because the world is revealed through the template of your values. If the world you are seeing is not the world you want, therefore it's time to examine your values. It's time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions. There's a famous experiment that I've alluded to a couple of times I believe in this lecture series, the invisible gorilla experiment, and in the invisible gorilla experiment, there's two teams of players, each with three members, one dressed in black and the other dressed in white, and each team is passing the basketball back and forth to the team members and milling about. You see a video of them doing so. They've basically filled the video screen and the white team is passing a basketball to the white team. Members in the block team is passing a basketball to the black team members. And your job as, as far as the experimenter is concerned, is for you to count the number of times that the black black team, yes, black team passes the basketball back and forth.

Speaker 1:          00:22:42       So that's what you do, so now you have an ambition and a name and a value and they ambition and the aim and the value, they're all the same thing and that is to perform well at the task. Now the thing that's so cool about this, and this is really so cool, it's just unbelievably. It's just unbelievable that this is the case. It's like a complete validation of, of a certain element of the Buddhist worldview. So they pass the ball for a couple of minutes and then the experimenter says to you, how many? And you say 15 and [inaudible] you're happy and you're happy with yourself because you've been paying attention. And, and the experimenter says, yeah, that's right. Or maybe not. Maybe you missed one. And then the experimenter says, did you see the gorilla? And half of you say, what? What, what gorilla? Like really? And he and the experimenter says yes. And then he rewinds it and plays the video. And like a minute and a half into the three minute video. Sure enough, in walks this guy in a gorilla suit, six foot three or so stands in the middle of the game, right in the middle of the game,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       the same size as the players, perfectly obviously evident beats his chest for like a second and a half and then sorta saunders off and half the people who watched the video don't see the gorilla, which is absolutely shocking, and what that means is that your ambitions blind you to the nature of reality. Now they eliminate some reality, but they blind you to most of it and that's fine because you're not. There's not a lot of you. In some ways, you're very pinpoint thing like a laser beam and so you just can't be attending to everything all the time. But one of the things that you might ask yourself once you know that is that if you're suffering dreadfully than one possibility is that you're so fixed on the point. You're so fixed on a point. The fact that you're so fixed on the point that you're fixed on might be integrally related to why things are going so catastrophic it wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:24:46       Now perhaps not because you know there's a lot of arbitrary ness about life and perhaps you suffer even when you don't deserve to. That seems to happen in the book of Job for example, because job is a good guy and God has a bet with Satan, which seems like another relatively nasty thing to do to let's say just torture him and he does quite nicely to see if he'll turn against God and it seems like a rather playground sort of thing for God to engage in. But the point is is that even in a document like the Old Testament, there's ample suggestion that sometimes people just get wiped out and hurt even if they're living good moral lives, aiming properly and all that. There's an arbitrary this in life that's not radical, but it's possible that it's what you're clinging to that's hurting you and it's even possible.

Speaker 3:          00:25:41       That's the thing that you're clinging to the hardest that's hurting you the most. That could easily be someone you love. Like lots of times I see people in therapy and they're miserable for one reason or another and sometimes it's because they have a very close relationship with a family member and that just isn't working. You know, the family member for the sake of simplicity we'll say is not really oriented towards helping them have a good life. The family member is instead oriented towards making them as bloody miserable as you can possibly make anyone and and what would you say? Exploiting the bond between family members in order to enable that and then sometimes the sacrifice that's necessary is either merely distancing yourself from that person, sometimes substantively and sometimes seriously distancing yourself from like we don't talk anymore ever and so that's pretty damn rough and it hurts and all of that, but, but

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       it's a good example of the fact that sometimes in order to extract yourself from the miserable bit of chaos that you happen to be in meshed in. You have to let go of what you love best. If the world you are seeing is not the world you want, therefore it's time to examine your values. That's really worth. It's really worth thinking about, you know, because the alternative is to curse fate, right? Because if it isn't you and there's nothing you can do to change, there isn't something you're doing that's wrong. Then it's fate itself. It's the world itself. It's other people let's say because they're a huge part of the world or it's the nature of the world itself or, or it's God himself in whatever form you either believe in or don't believe in because it's fundamentally all the same in this situation that I'm describing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       So. And one of the things that's really interesting and I mentioned this before about the Israelites in the Old Testament, is that they got this right. It's really something because what happens to the Israelites over and over in the Old Testament is that they get all puffed up about how wonderful they are and then they make moral errors because they're arrogant and then God comes along and just cuts them into pieces for like generation after generation and they wobble back to their feet and they always maintain the same attitude, which is we did something wrong. We did something wrong. It's like it's like, it's like an axiom rather than observation is that if we're not, if things are not laying themselves out for us as they should be, then we cannot curse God. We have to look to ourselves while and you think, well, why not curse?

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       God knows. Maybe it's his fault. That's a really good question and one of the things that I've tried to figure out over the last 30 years is, well, why not just curse God? Because there is this arbitrary element to existence and we are vulnerable and there is plenty of suffering and things are unfair, like there's problems, right? There's injustice and unfairness and all of these things and an endless suffering, so why not just laid at the feet of God and the whether God exists or not. In some sense, by the way, with regards to the metaphysics of this particular discussion is not relevant. It's the point remains the same either way and the answer is as far as I can tell that if you refuse to take on the responsibility yourself and you attempted to lay it at the feet of either society or being itself, then you instantly start to act in a way that makes everything much worse, not only for you but for everyone else and maybe even for being itself and so it's not helpful. Now, if you're. If you decide that it's you, you've got the problem, maybe that's not even true, like maybe you are someone who's being tortured by the bet between God and Satan and like too bad for you if that happens to be the case, but it still seems to be the appropriate thing

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       for a human being who's standing on his or her own two feet in a proper manner to take the responsibility on for themselves regardless of the counter arguments that might be made against it. That's really something. It's time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions. I also think of that it's a deadwood issue. You know, one of the things you see with motifs like the pair of the Phoenix, remember when Harry Potter goes off to fight, he's like St George. He goes off to fight the hell. Is that thing, the bast list that turns you to stone? When you look at it, it's a dragon. For all intents and purposes, it's guarding. Avert a virgin for. What's her name? For just not Virginia. It's close to that though. Ginny. Ginny Ginevra, right? Which is a variant of virgin and very introvert, Virginia. Well, when he gets bitten by the, by the dragon and poisoned, that's the dragon of chaos, right?

Speaker 3:          00:30:39       The thing that turns you to stone, when you look at it, when he gets bitten by it, then he's going to die and yeah, well, if you get bitten by the thing that turns you to stone when you look at it, if it bites you, man, if you're not dead, you're going to wish you are. It's one of the two, and then the phoenix flies in and cries tears into the wound and that heals them. And the Phoenix is the thing that allows the dead wood to burn off occasionally, let's say. Well, it's, I think it's once every hundred years with the Phoenix and of course it's pretty dramatic. The whole damn bird has to go up in flames and then there's nothing left but an egg. But there's a very serious message there too, which is that you can compare yourself in some sense to a forest fire, to a forest, you know, in a forest has to burn now.

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       And then for the deadwood to clear so that the forest can actually maintain its continued existence. And if you stop the forest from burning for a prolonged period of time, which happened in the United States when they were trying to manage the forest fires too tightly, then all that happens is the dead would accumulate and accumulate and accumulates and accumulates and accumulates until the whole damn forest is dead wood. And then lightning hits it and it burned so hot that it burns the topsoil off. And then there's nothing left. Nothing grows. And so that's a good moral lesson, which is don't wait too long to let the dam did, would burn off, you know, maybe a little self immolation on a daily basis might be preferable to burning yourself all the way down to the bedrock, you know, once every 20 years or so. Because maybe there won't be anything left of you when you do that and you know that happens to people all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:32:11       I've seen that happen to people many, many times. The deadwood accumulates the mess around them, gathers the chaos that they haven't dealt with accumulates. And then one day the spark comes and they burned so far and so fast that there's not enough left of them to recover. And then they're the people who've been eaten by the beast. They are the people who've been eaten by the Dragon. And now we're inside its belly. Another very common architectural motif. And while maybe a hero will come along and rescue them or maybe they'll just stay in there forever. And that's a precursor

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       to the idea of hell. And it's not something I would recommend. So a little medicine on a regular basis is a lot better too. Then total emulation. I'm on terms other than your own sporadically. It's time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions. There's another thing that

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       see in the Soviet Union went solzhenitsyn, wrote about the Soviet Union and its pathologies. It, it sort of peaked in terms of it's pathological authoritarianism when it became illegal to complain that your life wasn't going well and you just think about how horrible that Esa. Because because you know lots of times you're isn't going well, and I don't mean this in some casual way. I mean maybe, I don't know, maybe you have diabetes in your own. Maybe you're gonna lose your feet or something like it's really not. It's nothing trivial that's going on here. Something is not good. Or maybe it's economic or maybe you're unemployed or, and. But you see the idea of the Soviet Union was, well, we already have all the answers. Everything's perfect already. That's what totalitarians think. Well, if everything's perfect and you're suffering, then well maybe there's something wrong with you because everything is perfect after all.

Speaker 1:          00:34:00       And if you're a suffering then and what are you gonna come out and say, well, I'm suffering. It's like, well then your evidence that things aren't perfect, right? You're a widow or an orphan in an old testament story, you know when the Kings got too high and mighty, then they wouldn't pay enough attention to the widows and the orphans, and then the profit would come along and say, you know what? Those widows and orphans a lot more important than you think they are, and if you don't pay attention to them properly, then things are going to fall apart around you in a way that you just can't even imagine and so well then you're sort of like your own widow in your own orphaned, but you don't get to say, hey look, you know things aren't perfect yet because I'm actually having still quite a rough time here. You don't get to admit to your own suffering. If you can't admit to your own suffering, then you certainly see the suffering, especially the additional suffering. The excess suffering should be treated as evidence that you're not doing something quite right yet.

Speaker 1:          00:34:55       It should be treated as evidence that you're wrong. There's something important that you're doing that's wrong. I understand how harsh that is, and I'm not saying that everyone who is suffering is suffering because they're doing something in some simple way that's wrong. I was in an elevator once in a hospital. It was a very terrifying thing and this person got on who was just in an absolute state of shock, you know, I mean, it was really not good and I don't remember how this happened, but I engaged the person in conversation and they just said that they had just been diagnosed with what looked to be terminal cancer. And uh, what was horrifying about it was that what they were doing was going over life in the elevator trying to figure out what they had done in order to deserve such a fate. You know, they immediately taken it on themselves as a moral failing.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       And that's not what I'm saying. You can't come up to someone who has cancer and say, well, if you weren't such a bloody idiot throughout your whole life, you wouldn't have cancer. And believe me, that happens a lot more than you think. And people who have diseases like that get blamed for it. That's not what I'm saying. It's not like that. It's, it's, it's, it's a more generalized attitude. That is that if life isn't yet what it should be, then you have a response. You have a primary responsibility to do something about it, and the place to start looking is to your own errors and to fix them. And that's. And that's, that's, that's a safe bet man, because you're probably doing some things that you wouldn't have to be doing that if you fixed would make things better. So it's time to let go and to sacrifice who you are for who you could become.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       There's an old story about how to catch a monkey in case any of you are interested in how to catch a monkey. Now you're now you're going to know how to do it. First you have to take a large, narrow neck jar just large enough in diameter at the top for a monkey to put his hand inside. Then you have to fill it partway with rocks. So it's too heavy for the monkey to carry, then you scatter some treats near the jar to attract them and you put some inside inside the narrow neck jar. A monkey will come along if you're lucky and grabbed the goodies, but he'll want the ones inside the jar too. So then put his hand in there and grab what's in there. And if you've set up your monkey trap properly, then he won't be able to get his hand out because he's got the goodies.

Speaker 1:          00:37:33       Not Without unclenching his hand, not without relinquishing what he already has. The monkey coucher can just walk over and just pick up the monkey because the monkey isn't into the whole sacrifice thing because he's just a monkey, you know? And so you can catch him as a consequence of his own. An regulated hypothalamic desires to be. What would you say, charitable to the Monkey if you put out candy or something like that. So like how often does a monkey get candy? He's probably a little more motivated than you are to not let go. But you can get the point. The monkey catcher can just walk over to the jar and pick up the monkey. The animal will not sacrifice the part for the whole. That's actually a pretty good phrase. Hey, it's the animal that will not sacrifice the part for the whole. Perhaps this story is apocryphal, but as an eccentric psychology professor once told me, fiction lies to you in the most truth, in the most truthful possible manner, something valuable given up ensures future prosperity, something valuable, sacrificed, pleases the Lord. Those are equivalent statements. One's more articulated, I would say. That's the first statement, and the second one is more dramatic and more embedded in a collective religious dream. You might say, what's most valuable and best sacrificed? Well, obviously that depends on the culture and the time.

Speaker 1:          00:39:01       What is it least emblematic of that? A choice cut of meat. Well, if you're a herdsman, for example, that that's a big deal. If, I mean, generally speaking, throughout human history, meat has been a very valuable commodity as it is. By the way, among chimpanzees. Chimpanzees hunt, they like to hunt colobus monkeys and you know they'll, they'll basically start eating the damn monkey lie. They weigh about 40 pounds despite the fact that the thing is screaming away and that's pretty interesting because one of the things that indicates is that male monkeys that mail chimp's, they're the ones that do the hunting, aren't really inhibited that much when they're in your mode by what you might describe as empathy and there's certain elements of human behavior that are reminiscent of that. You see that sort of thing have merged now and then in human battlefields when groups of men seem to abandoned all internal regulation whatsoever to a degree that makes you wonder if internal regulation even exists.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       Nice cut of meat, well meets valuable. You know, and here's a good document by Richard Wrangham. I think while back a book about the human invention of fire. I think I told you a little bit about this random claim that we invented, fire or discovered fire mastered it maybe two or 3 million years ago. That's a long time longer than people had thought and that that's what actually transformed us physiologically from our chimp, like ancestors into the sort of spelt creatures we are now because it's a lot easier to digest cooked meat and meat is a terminal, the source of of nutrition, energy, raw materials, all of that, especially if it's cooked. So me, it's a big deal. Cooked meat is a big deal and maybe it's a choice cut of meat. The

Speaker 1:          00:40:47       kindy might offer to a guest if you're not A. I always say this wrong. Is it Vegan, Vegan or Vegan? I was Vegan, but that's wrong. That's a star. Vegas a start, right? They're not like star creatures. They're there anyway, so you know, you might offer that, especially, especially if a guest came to your abode and you were heard, man, you might sacrifice a high end animal and offer your guests a nice choice cut of meat and that would actually matter. It would mean something from the best animal in a flock. What's above even that? Well, in terms of the thing you could sacrifice while your best animal. That's good. Well, how about you? How about your child, how about you? Well, that would be next on the hierarchy. It's kind of hard to get past that. Right, and I think it's a. it's a toss up whether the sacrifice is greater. If it's you or if it's your child. I would say being a parent that is greater if it's your child, because I think most people who have established

Speaker 4:          00:41:54       a

Speaker 1:          00:41:57       I hate, I hesitate to say proper, but I'm going to anyway. He's a proper relationship with their children. It's if push came to shove,

Speaker 4:          00:42:04       they'd take the bullet and let their kid go live.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       The sacrifice of the mother is exemplified profoundly by Michelangelo's great sculpture. The Ada. Mary is Contemplating Her son crucified in ruins, so that's his body after he's being crucified, it's her fault. It was through her. He entered the great drama of being. So what's the meaning of this sculpture? It's a great sculpture. It's just an absolutely unbelievable sculpture. You just can't believe that someone could exist who could make something up. Of course it wasn't the only thing Michael Angelo made, right? It was like, that's it. It was something he just tossed off and a couple of months while he was doing other unbelievable things, but you know, it's, it's an, it's an object of contemplation, which is why it's integrate cathedral, integrate city. It's an object of contemplation and the ideas. Something like what, what, what's the role of a mother if she's awake. I had a client come to see me a while back, not very long ago, woman in about who's about 30 and trying to make decisions about her life. She was pretty career oriented and so I asked her about, although maybe having a bit of trouble with their career. I've seen this many, many times, so this is an amalgam. This is a story that's an amalgam and I talked to her about the other elements of your life. It's,

Speaker 4:          00:43:30       Oh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:43:33       there's only five things you do in life, so you've got your career down, know what do you do outside of your career that's meaningful and engaging. How are things going with your family? Could be your family of origin, your siblings, whatever. Do you have an intimate relationship and like what's your plan for your own family? And apart from those five things there's sort of something like get some exercise now and then don't eat too badly and try to stay away from the drugs, you know, that, that, that kind of had an, a crime that kind of lays out life and if you miss any of those five things or if you do any of those other things wrong, then you're in trouble and you can get away with missing a couple of them, but not all of them, you know? And she said something along the lines of, well, I'm not sure I should bring a child into this world. And I thought, Oh god Christ, you got to come up with something better than that. Such a bloody cliche, which is what I told her. I said, you know, you must have thought that up when you were 16. It's like, really? That's your, you can't do any better. This was a very, very smart woman. It's like, really? You can't do any better than that.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       It's like, yes, obviously this is a veil of tears and a, you know, a well of suffering and all of that. If you asked 30 people who are wondering about having children, why they're wondering, 20 of them will say that and so that that tells you how original it is. It's not original at all. It's not a thought. It's like this little. It's like a. it's like a. it's a meme. It's something that lives in your mind. It's not a thought and it's certainly not something. It's certainly not something that you should just take it face value and say, oh, well I'm not having a family. Then it's like, no, no. You kind of look at that and you criticize it a little bit. It's like, well, the pop. The other one, that's the other one that's very common. There's too many people on the planet already.

Speaker 3:          00:45:14       It's like, I really don't like that statement. It's like, just who are you going to ask to leave? Just how are you going to get them to leave? You know? It's a serious question and who says there's too many people? What the Hell's wrong with people anyways when we're running around ruining the planet? Yeah, so like I think it was the club of Rome who, who prophesied by the way that there would be so many people on the planet by the year 2000, that there would be widespread starvation and they were completely and utterly wrong about that and I think it was the club of Rome who either compared us to a virus or a cancer on the face of the planet. It's like, oh, really? That's what you think about people a, aren't you something? Isn't that something to think about? Human beings, viruses and cancer. What do you do with viruses and cancer? Invite them in and make them at home. It's like, no, you tried to eradicate them. If you've got a bloody well watch your metaphors folks, because it isn't clear that you come up with them or that they run you, so you better watch him.

Speaker 4:          00:46:15       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:46:18       So anyways, Mary and Mary's the great mother, right? That she's the mother. That's what Mary is. Whether she existed or not is not the point. She exists at least as a hyper reality. She exists as the mother will. What's the sacrifice of the mother? Well, that's easy if you're a mother and if you're a mother who's worth her salt, you offer your son to be destroyed by the world. That's what you do. I mean, that's what's going to happen, right? He's gonna be born and he's going to suffer. He's gonna have his trouble in life. He's going to have his illnesses. He's going to face his failures and catastrophes and he's going to die. That's what's going to happen, and if you're awake, you know that, and then you say, well, perhaps he will live in a way that will justify that and then you try to have that happen and that's what makes you worthy of a statue like that, but still the sacrifice of the mother. Is it right to bring a baby into this terrible world?

Speaker 3:          00:47:22       Well, every woman asked yourself that question and some say no, and they have the reasons Mary answers. Yes. Voluntarily. Mary is the archetype of the woman who answers yes to life voluntarily. That's what that image means and not because she's blind, she knows what's going to happen and so she's the archetypical representation of the woman who says yes to life knowing full well what, what life is not naive, not someone who got pregnant in the backseat of the 1957 Chevy, you know, in one in a one night of, of, of, of half drunk idiocy. Not that, but consciously, consciously knowing what's to come and then also allows it to happen because that's another thing that's a testament to the courage of mothers. My mother was good at this. My mother's a very agreeable person too. Agreeable for her own good, but that's what happens if you're agreeable because you're too agreeable if for your own good.

Speaker 3:          00:48:19       That's the definition of agreeable and so she's a nice person and still is. Luckily she's still alive and we've had a very good relationship and I have always been able to make her laugh, which is, which is a good thing and but she was tough cookie. That woman, you know, if, if I remember once she came across, I was out playing in this baseball diamond, little diamond and empty lot really in this little town I grew up in. I was about 10 and she walked by. I was there with a bunch of my friends and I was about to have a fistfight with his little tough kid that I hung around with and there were half girls on the team and the fistfight had some relationship to status maneuvering, you know, in relationship to that. Anyways, we going to have a fight and my mum walked by, she took a look and I could see from her demeanor that she knew exactly what was about to happen and she looked for a second and then she walked by and I thought, Whoa, good work mom. No kidding. Hey. It's like last bloody thing I needed at that moment was for her to come charge it up and say, you boys aren't planning to have a fight, are you? It's like, well yeah, mom, where we're actually planning to have a fight and now that you came and intervened, I actually lost before the God damn thing even started.

Speaker 3:          00:49:46       So two thumbs up for mom. She was also the person that said because I had some trouble with my dad when I was a key adolescent. He had some trouble with me. So you know, it was 50 slash 50. That's for now, it's probably 70 slash 30 with me on the 70 end of the being the trouble. And anyways, I left home when I was about 17 and she said something really interesting when I left home. She said it was too good at home. You'd never leave. I thought, hey mom, that's pretty good. You know, for, for an agreeable person, you've got a real spine man. So that was pretty good. So. So you know, a that says this. The

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       mother is the person who also says, get out there, take your God damn lumps because you're tough enough so that you can handle it. She doesn't say you just stayed down there in your bedroom bruiting away because the world is unfair and treating you badly and your suffering is too much. He says, yeah, there's a lot of suffering out there, but you're a hell of a lot tougher than you think you are.

Speaker 4:          00:50:54       So

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       in turn, Mary's son Christ offers himself to God so completely that is faith and trust in the world is not broken by betrayal, torture, or death. That's the model for the honorable man. So when you have an interesting dynamic, there you have the woman who's willing to make the sacrifice, lays the groundwork for the son who is willing to make the sacrifice that works out pretty nicely, and it's a good thing to know and Christ case. However, as he sacrifices himself, God, his father is simultaneously sacrificing his son, right? That's one of the oddities of the trinitarian model is that God sacrifices himself to himself. Same thing happens in norse mythology, right?

Speaker 4:          00:51:48       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:51:49       is it norse Zeus, Germanic mythology. Zoo sacrifices himself to himself. He actually hangs on a tree. It's actually wounded in his side. It's very interesting parallel, but I think part of the idea is, well, the humanity, the human race is trying to work out well. What's the ultimate sacrifice? It's something like that ultimate sacrifice, a value. Well, the, the, the, the passion story, and I told you I was foreshadowing. I'm bringing this into consideration. Things we won't talk about for a long time. Maybe not at all in this lecture series. I don't know because I don't know how far I'll get is that, well, there's a supreme sacrifice demanded on the part of the mother and there's a supreme sacrifice demanded on the part of the sun and there's a supreme sacrifice demanded on the part of the father all at the same time and then that makes the supreme sacrifice possible. And hypothetically, that's the one that renews. That's the sacrifice that renews and redeems. It's a hell of an idea, man. And the thing about it is that I don't know if it's true, but I know that its opposite is false

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       and generally the opposite of something that's false is true. It's the opposite is false is because if the mother doesn't make the sacrifice, then you get the horrible eatable situation or something like that in the household, which is just its own absolute catastrophic hell, and if you want a really good insight into that, I would say watch the documentary Crumb, c, r u, m b, a man that's been rated by some critics has the best documentary ever made and it is some piece of work, man. He does. The only thing I've ever seen that actually lays out the eatable catastrophe in its full nightmare. You

Speaker 3:          00:53:25       know, so you could, you could look at that. So if the maternal sacrifice isn't there, then that doesn't work. If the paternal sacrifice isn't there, if the father isn't willing to put his son out into the world, let's say, to be broken and betrayed and all of those things, then that's a nonstarter because the kid doesn't grow up. And then if the sun isn't willing to do that, well then who the hell is going to shoulder the responsibility? So if those three things don't happen, then it's cataclysmic. It's chaotic, it's hell. If they do happen, is it the opposite of that? While you could say, well, maybe it depends on the degree to which they happen and and it's a continuum. How thoroughly can they happen? What we don't know? Because you might say, how good a job do you do have encouraging your children to live in truth?

Speaker 3:          00:54:15       Let's say, well, that's part of the answer to this question and the answer likely is, well not you don't do as good a job of it as you could so it works out quite well, but you don't know how well it could work if you did it really well are spectacularly well or ultimately well or something like that. You don't know and you know people have an intimation of this because one of the things that's really cool about having a young baby, this is something you don't know until you have. There's two things you don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:54:45       There's a lot more than two. There's three things you don't know until you have a baby. The one is that you didn't grow up yet because you actually don't grow up until someone else is more important than you. You can't, so people think they grow up if they don't have children, but they don't. They just think they do. Now there are some people who make sacrifices of other sorts, but this is a whole different ball of wax as far as I'm concerned. It's not a very elegant metaphor, but you learn that it's kind of relief relief not to be the center of attention. That's cool that you can sit back because of course your child in your family and in society is immediately the center of attention and so unless you're a narcissistic than you allow that to happen and then you learn all sorts of really good things about other people because other people really like babies.

Speaker 3:          00:55:37       It's so cool. I lived in Montreal when we had our first child and I lived in a pretty rough neighborhood by Montreal standards. Right. It's like, you know, Montreal has such a great city like Toronto. It's like even the rough neighborhoods are there more like charming with a little dark under belly, something like that, but there were some rough characters in our neighborhood and it was pretty poor and we'd. We'd push her around in her stroller and these like grizzled rectal guys would come by and they'd look at her and they just light up and they'd come over and like smile at her and you know, he just saw there the positive element of their humanity just. Well, fourth, you have to be something seriously wrong with you if you don't respond that way to a baby, you know, I mean, that's, that's not good. That's not good. But it was so cool to see these

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       people. You kind of give them generally you sort of walk four feet around them on the street, you know, and yet they were all of a sudden all that, the layers that were on them would just fall off and they'd be so. And the babies are sort of like public property weirdly enough to sort of like pregnant women, you know, because people often treat pregnant women sort of like their public property too. I mean in a positive way. Oh well Laura, you're going to have a baby a. well, they do all sorts of cute things. So. So you know, the reason I'm telling you that is because there's a strong impulse in people to note that there's something miraculous about the existence of a new human being and the miraculous element is all the potential that's there, right? That's all there is. There is potential.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       And with every birth there is the potential for something remarkable to be introduced in the world. And one of the things I've thought too is the other thing you don't know is that babies are generic until you have one and then you're a baby isn't a generic baby at all. It's like instantly it's a person with whom you have a relationship that's closer perhaps than any relationship that you've ever had and that you can keep perfect, right? Because most of the relationships you've had already or with people who are screwed up and 50 different ways and so are you. But here you've got this baby and like hair, but it's not ruined yet. And so you have this possibility of maintaining this relationship that starts out that baby really likes you. And generally that continues for quite a long time. Is there are two years old and you come home, they're really happy to see. It's kind of like having a puppy, you know? It's like they're thrilled when you come home. It's like how many people are thrilled when you come home? You know, so I'll see you again. It's like, no, not a little kid. A little kid is thrilled when you come home and you can keep that going. And so there's this pristine element to the potential relationship between parents and children that's terribly devalued in our society terribly.

Speaker 1:          00:58:30       It's almost as if were willfully blind to it and I think it's an absolute catastrophe because there's nothing. There's very little in life that can compare to establishing a proper relationship with the child. They make great company if you, if you keep your relationship with them pristine and so you know it's worthwhile. You think, well, so. So the reason I'm telling you this is because people look at infants and they think they think this could be the potential savior of mankind. That is what they think. That's how they act. So that's what they think. And the thing is, it's also true now how true it is, I don't know, but that's I think probably because I think it's probably because people don't dare to find out how it's how it looks to me in Christ case. However, as he sacrifices himself, God, his father is simultaneously sacrificing his son. It is for this reason that the Christian sacrificial drama of Sun and self is archetipal. Nothing greater can be imagined. That's why it's an architect. You can't push past it.

Speaker 4:          00:59:45       So

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       that's the very definition of archetypal. That's the core of what constitutes religious. The greatest of all possible sacrifices, his self and child of that, there can be no doubt, pain and suffering define the world of that. Equally. There can be no doubt the person who wants to alleviate suffering, who wants to bring about the best of all possible futures, who wants to create heaven on earth, will therefore sacrificed everything he has to God to live in the truth. So that's a page and half from the book I'm going to release in January.

Speaker 4:          01:00:25       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       So back to genesis of we're all. We already up to genesis four and Adam knew eve, his wife, and she conceived

Speaker 1:          01:00:43       and Bare Cain and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. Now this is after Adam and eve had been chased out of the garden of Eden. Right? So what's really cool about this? I really think that the atoms that can enable stories, the most profound story I've ever read, especially given that it's. You can tell it in 15 seconds, I won't because I tend not to tell stories in 15 seconds as you may have noticed, but, but you can read the whole thing that quickly and it's so densely packed that I just can't. It's, it's A. It's actually unbelievable to me that it can be that densely packed. Okay? So the first thing is, is that Adam and eve are not the first two human beings can enable or the first two human beings, because Adam and eve were made by God and they were born in paradise.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       It's like what kind of cumin beings are those? You don't know any human beings like that. Human beings aren't born in paradise and made by God. Human beings are born of other human beings, right, and so, so that's the first thing, and it's post-fall. We're out in the world world in history now. We're not in some archetipal beyond, although we are still to some degree, not to the degree that was the case with the story of Adam and eve. We we've already been thrown out of the garden, were already self conscious. We're already awake, we're already covered. We're already working. We're full fledged human beings, and so you have the first two human beings can enable prototypical human beings. So what's cool is that humanity enters history at the end of the story of Adam and eve, and then the architectural

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       patterns for human behavior are instantaneously presented. It's, it's, it's absolutely mind boggling and it's not a great. It's not a very nice story, right? So they're your brothers, they're hostile brothers, they've got their hands around each other's throats, so to speak, or at least that's the case in one direction. So it's a, it's a story. The first two human beings engage in a fratricidal struggle that ends in the death of the best. One of them. That's the story of human beings in history and that man, if that doesn't give you nightmares, you didn't understand the damn story. Now in in these hostile brothers stories which are very, very common, often the older brother Cain is used and this is very true in the Bible, but it's true in all sorts of folk tales and all sorts of stories

Speaker 3:          01:03:21       of all sorts for that matter. See, the older brother has some advantages. He's the older brother and in a agricultural community, the older brother generally inherited the land, not the younger brothers, and the reason for that was is that, well, let's say you have like eight sons and you have enough land to support a bit of a family and you divided among your eight sons than they have eight sons and they divided among the eight sounds. It's like soon everyone has a little postage stamp that they can stand on and starve to death on and so that just doesn't work. So you, you, you, you, you hand the land down in a piece to the eldest son and that's just how it is. It's tough luck for the rest of them, but at least they know they're going to have to go and make their own way.

Speaker 3:          01:04:03       It's not fair, but there's no way of making it fair. Well, so the oldest son has some, you might say he has an additional stake in the stability and the stability of the current hierarchy. He has more of a stake in the status quo, so that makes them more of an emblematic representative, representative of the status quo and perhaps more likely to be blind in it's favor. It's something like that, so that motif creeps up very frequently in the hostel. Brothers archetipal struggle. So Kane fits this. The story of Cain and Abel fits this pattern because Cain is the one who won't budge who won't move. He's stubborn. Whereas the younger son who is able is often the one who's more, not so much of a revolutionary, but perhaps more of a balance between the revolutionary and the traditionalist, something like that. Whereas the older son tends to be more traditionalist authoritarian, at least in these metaphorical representations. And Adam knew eve, his wife, and she conceived and Bare Cain and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. So there's the first human being cane. It's like I told you that the Mesopotamians thought that mankind

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       was made out of the blood of the worst demon. That the great goddess of chaos could imagine. Well, the first human being is a murderer and not only a murderer, murder of his own brother. And so, you know, Old Testament, that's a hell of a harsh book and you might think, well maybe that's a little bit too much to bear and then you might think, yeah, and maybe it's true too. So that's something to think about. I mean, I, human beings, you know, like they're amazing creatures and to think about us as a plague on the planet is its own kind of bloody catastrophe, malevolent, low genocidal metaphor. But that doesn't mean that we're not without our problems. And the fact that this book that sets sits at the cornerstone of our culture would present the first man that was a murder of his brother is something that should really set you back on your heels.

Speaker 1:          01:06:23       And again, she bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. There you see a very old representation there is able there and he's got his sheep up on the altar and Cain is bringing a Sheaf of wheat. And I don't know exactly what's happening here with the blood but or it's a re perhaps it's something like that. But the overall impression of the images that something transcendent is communicating with this sacrifice. And you see that. So you think, oh, how primitive, you know, how primitive these people were sacrificing to their god. It's like, you know, those people weren't stupid and this is not primitive. Whatever it is, it's not primitive. It's sophisticated beyond belief. Because the idea, as I already pointed out, is that you could sacrifice something of value in that that would have transcendent utility. And that is by no means an unsophisticated idea. In fact, it might be the greatest I did the human beings ever came up with.

Speaker 1:          01:07:28       It's an answer to the problem that's put forward in the story of Adam and Eve, right? Because we became self conscious and then we discovered the future and then we knew we were going to die and then we knew we were vulnerable and then we became ashamed and then we develop the knowledge of good and evil. And then we got thrown out of paradise. It's like, that's a big problem. So what the hell are you going to do about it? While I will sacrifice, that's the hypothesis. Well, that's a hell of a hypothesis, man. That's what we're doing. You've made plenty of sacrifices even to sit in this theater and many people may plenty of sacrifices. To have a theater like this exist in many people made sacrifices so that we can actually freely engage in the dialogue that we're engaging in in a theater like this. And so it's like all of this is built on sacrifice and sacrifice. Bloody well better work because we do not have a better idea sacrifice, what's the counter position? Murder and theft. So let's go with sacrifice shall we, and perhaps we won't consider it so damn primitive, you know, because it's not so primitive. And again she bare. His brother Abel enabled was a keeper of sheep and Cain was a tiller of the ground.

Speaker 1:          01:08:41       Now some people have read into this eternal battle between herdsmen and agriculturalists, which raged in the American West for example, because the herdsmen like to have their herds, sheep, cattle go wherever they were going to go. And of course the agriculture, the farmers like to have things fenced off and so. And the agriculturalists actually won in the final analysis. But anyways, Abel is a keeper of sheep. And that's interesting because that makes them a shepherd. And I think that's part of the critical issue here because a shepherd. I talked a little bit about shepherds before. You know, if you look at Michelangelo Statue of David, of David, which is another staggering work mean that David, he's no trivial figure and of course steven do slight slays Goliath and Goliath is like

Speaker 1:          01:09:39       the giant of the patriarchal enemy. It's something like that and you know, Middle Eastern shepherds, they had to kick take care of sheep and they're edible and the lambs are very vulnerable and there were lots of wild animals around. It wasn't like England in the 16th century. It was like the reliance, you know, and you had a slingshot or a stick or some damn thing. And so your job was to keep the sheep organized and not let them beat by the lions alone. And so you had to have a clue and be tough and self reliant and all of those things. You have to be tough and self reliance. You have to be able to take care of a lot of vulnerable things, able to do it on your own. And so that's how are built into the shepherd metaphor. And it's, you know, it's a tough thing for.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       It's not a great metaphor for modern people because we tend to think of the shepherd is someone like little Lord Fauntleroy, you know, like some little, certainly not a lion killing hypermasculine lion killing monster that's not a shepherd. A shepherd sort of dances around and you know, it's not. That's not the metaphor here. That's, that's, that's not the metaphor here. So Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground, an offering unto the Lord. Okay, so he's participating in this sacrificial ritual, unable. He brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. Now you don't know why that is. And this is a built in ambiguity.

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       I think now I think there's textual hints, but I'm not sure.

Speaker 4:          01:11:19       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:11:21       Abel brought the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. Okay, so, so what does that mean? Well, he brought high quite so high quality sacrifice you don't know. That enables sacrifices, low quality. Because it doesn't say, you know, Abel brought God some wilted lettuce and then Burton, he doesn't say that but, but there isn't a sentence there that talks about how high quality cane sacrifices, but in any case the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering. So there's a hint that ables putting a little bit more into the whole sacrificial thing then then cane, but there's also a hint that maybe God is just like liking you a little better than these likened him. And that's I think useful from a literary perspective because there is that arbitrary ness about life, you know, with my own children, for example, one of them has had, I would say

Speaker 4:          01:12:18       he

Speaker 5:          01:12:19       things come easy to him. He's lucky, fortunate, however you want to put it. He seems to be that sort of person. Whereas my other child is like, it's just like one horrible job, like catastrophe after another. And it's so strange to see that because as far as I can tell, there's the character. Logical differences are certainly not accounting for the, for the, for the difference in destiny. You know, my one, the one child who's had so much trouble, I mean as a child was just a wonderful child, so amazingly happy and easy to get along with and fun and they have a terrible time of it, so who knows what God's up to, but distributing fate equally certainly isn't one of them, and the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering, but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth angry. Roth is a tough word and and these are translated many times. It's hard to get the full flavor of the words, but wroth and his countenance fell well. To have your countenance fell at. This is sort of up to fall, is to, to have it be heavy. Depressed for sure. Angry for sure. Resentful. Probably Roth. That's anger. So Kane is not happy clam that his hard work is being rejected by God. Now that's worth thinking about really, because you think about how

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       human that story is. You know, you're out there. Well, we can say you might be useless character and you know, you're whining about how catastrophic your life isn't. It's pretty much obvious to everyone around you and you that it's your fault. You just don't try. You don't wake up in the morning, you don't get a job, you don't engage in things. You're cynical and you're bitter and you're angry and you don't try to help the people near you and you don't try to fix up your own life and you don't take care of yourself and you know, and then things go wrong and it's like hell freely. What do you expect? But then, but that's, I mean, that doesn't mean someone in that situation. We'll just say, well, that's okay. I deserve it. Then there'll be happy about it. They won't, they'll be absolutely bitter about it and angry. But, you know, put that aside for a moment. There are people who seem to struggle very forthrightly, let's say, and still have one catastrophe after another happen to them. And so it's, there's no easy answer in this, in this story. It's like you can fall, fall afoul of God because your sacrifice is our second rate. Or you can just fall, uh, fall of God and you don't know why. Well, tough luck for you, and then what happens in either case is exactly this. Almost inevitably

Speaker 3:          01:15:36       cain was wrong in his countenance fell well. You know, you meet an I. people like this, right? To me all the time, I've seen many, many of them as clients, you know, they say they're 20, not so often. 30 more commonly, sometimes 40. Their lives haven't gone well, you know, they're in a pit of despair of one form or another and not only are they in a pit of despair, but they're extraordinarily angry about it and god only knows what they would do with that anger if they had the opportunity to give it full voice. Right? You know, one of the things I've always thought about Hitler is that, you know, people, you have to admire Hitler. That's the thing, because he was an organizational genius. You know the thing that doesn't stop people from being Hitler. The thing people don't. People don't

Speaker 3:          01:16:27       refused the ambition to become Hitler because they don't have the genocidal motivation. They don't follow that pathway because they don't have the organizational genius. They've got the damn motivation. And you know, if you take 100 people randomly and you talk to them and you really talked to them, you'll find that five percent of them would take their vengeful thoughts pretty damn far if they were just given the opportunity and in fact they do because they make life miserable for themselves and often for their family and sometimes for anybody they can come near and then maybe another 20 percent of people have that bubble up in them on a pretty damn

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       regular basis. So you can have some

Speaker 3:          01:17:15       the thief for cane. If you don't have any sympathy for cane, then you're not. See Cain and Abel also, they don't just represent to our architectural types of being. They represent

Speaker 3:          01:17:26       so it's not like you're a cane and you're able to near cane and you're able. It's like you're half and half and your half and half and your half and half at something like this. This is two different potential patterns of destiny and you don't manifest one purely in the other zero. It's like you're. It's like the line between good and evil that runs down the human heart. It's exactly the same idea and maybe you're more like canes or maybe you're more like Abel, but there's still a little cane in you, no matter how able you are and maybe more than a little and probably more than literally little, and if you watch your fantasies, which I would very much recommend you will find that they

Speaker 1:          01:18:04       show you dark things about you that will shock you if you allow yourself to be conscious of what you're thinking. So it's a good time when you're having an argument with someone, especially someone that you love, to just watch the pictures that flash in the back of your mind. That's part of let's say coming into contact with what Carl Jung called the shadow and the shadow is the manifestation of cane. That's a perfect way of thinking about it and one of the things that young said about the shadow [inaudible] young was not someone you mess around with lightly. He said, human shadow has roots that reach all the way to hell and young meant that that's no metaphor for him. Now he might not have meant it in the same way that a fundamentalist Christian from from the southern us might mean it, but I would say that young men to in a way that's far more terrifying and also far more true so and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell, so there's able burning is offering away there at least in this sort of relationship with, let's call them the archetypical figure of culture, the archetypical father, and it's something he respects. That's the thing. It's an indication that the postures and the indication of respect

Speaker 1:          01:19:34       and then there's cane in the background and you see his face is in shadow and he's. He's jealous of what's happening here and he's going through the motions perhaps and maybe God just doesn't like them. We don't know, but he's going through the motions and he's not very happy about it and you know that that's actually a phrase that you could. You could carve into many people's tombstones as an epitaph for their life, which would be went through the motions but wasn't very happy about it.

Speaker 1:          01:20:11       This is really an interesting one. I think. I mean, so I don't know what God's doing here exactly, but he's helping ignite the sacrificial flame and that's kind of an interesting idea I think because you know, let's say that you have an impulse to make a sacrifice. You think, well, I should change this about my life. What? What's like? Where does that come from? That impulse is just, well just manifests itself out of nothing. So what word you came up with it? Well, you might want to stop thinking about that thinking so surely that you come up with your own thoughts. You don't come up with your damn dreams, do you? They just happen and God only knows where they come from. They come from your brain. Oh boy, that's a sophisticated answer. They come from your unconscious. Well, that's not much better. At least it's somewhat better, but there are those matt, amazing dramas take place in the theater of your imagination at night. You don't even understand what they are and yet they occur night after night and those things, dreams. They can contain wisdom that it just, well, it just staggers the person who has the dream. Once they get the key to the dream, once they remembered, it's like, oh look, you just revealed a bunch of wisdom to yourself that you didn't know what. Where'd that come from? Well, you don't know. How in the world can you dream up things that you don't know. That's a tough one. Maybe we'll talk about that at some point in this lecture series because there are some reasonable things that can be said about that, but you know the idea of that

Speaker 1:          01:21:42       there's something that's not you. You would call it the self. Carl Jung would call it the self, which he thought of it as the totality of your being across time and space. It's something like that and that you know, each second that you exist is a slice of the self manifesting itself across time and space and he thought of the self is partly the voice of conscience. Whatever that is that helps guide you when you have to make a difficult decision and a difficult decision might be, well, what do I need to sacrifice? What is, how do I need to discipline myself? Right? What do I need to for go, well, how do you figure those things out? Well, you know, we'll just picture is trying to put forth the idea that perhaps if you would establish the proper relationship with God the father and we've talked about what that might mean, then he would help figure out how to get this sacrificial fires burning so that you could stay in a proper relationship with him across time. Well, if that's such an unreasonable proposition, what's the alternative proposition? Well, this isn't working out very well, that's for sure. You know, Kate seems to be doing it. I don't know what it is. It's like he says, if he thinks he can only do it himself or maybe he wants only to take credit for it or something like that, he's not in this

Speaker 1:          01:22:59       grateful, let's say, and inquiring grateful and inquiring posture because

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       that's what a prayer for posture should be. It should be grateful and inquiring and grateful is, thank God things aren't worse for me than they are, and you shouldn't be grateful about that because they could be a lot worse than they are mad. They can be so bad and inquiring would be, well, I don't really know how I could make it better, but I'm. I'm open to suggestions, man, if I can figure out how to do it all, try it. That's the. That's the humility and the inquiry. That's a humble inquiry. How could I make things better? It's something like that and that's what sacrifices do I need to make in order to make things better. That's a good question to ask yourself. You could ask yourself that every morning, what sacrifice do I have to make to make things better? You can decide what constitutes better.

Speaker 3:          01:23:52       How about that? Then it's not even as if it's being imposed on you come up with your own notion of what constitutes better. You know, we try to make it sophisticated. Should just be better for you because that isn't going to work very well. Right? You're, you're just gonna fall down stairs. If you do that because you have to live with other people and besides stupid anyways, what are you going to do like can't even just nothing you could even say about that. It's so that that's the. That's the attitude of a very badly behaved hyper aggressive two year old and I mean that technically and so you could. You could ask yourself, well, how I have this day that lays itself out in front of me? What thing could I let go of that's impeding my progress that if I let go of would make my life better, my family's life better, my culture is life better, my being better, and then that would give you something to do for the day, wouldn't it into justify your miserable life because you need that.

Speaker 3:          01:24:52       That's the whole point of the first story of Adam and eve. What do you have? A miserable life? Okay, what am I going to do about that? Well, if you just have a miserable life, you're just going to suffer stupidly and get bitter about it. That's what happens to cane. It's like, well, how about not doing that? Because that seems to just take a bad deal and make it worse. How about making a sacrifice and seeing if you can please God and put being on track? God, that'd be something to do. What could be better than that? What could possibly be better than that? Well, that's why it's archetipal ban because nothing's better than that. That's where it tops out. So when you can do that, you could do that every day. You'd have to do it in a little way because like what good are you? You know you're not going to go and bring this socialist utopia and to being in one fell swoop. You might also think that one of the things came mind figure out here. There's a couple of things that just aren't going right for him, downwind of the fire, not the right place to blow from, and the fact that he's in hen galloped in Hayes and smoke and breathing it in and the fire isn't burning, might be an indication that he's doing something wrong or he could be wiping his eyes and say, Jesus, what kind of stupid bloody universe would produce smoke like this? It's like, yes, well that's the more likely outcome,

Speaker 5:          01:26:33       and the Lord said unto Cain, why Art Thou wroth and why is they countenance fallen if they'll do as well shalt thou not be accepted. Now that's an interesting line because, and I've looked at a variety of different translations of. This is seventh verse here, like a bunch of them because the translation for that, that's a critical line and the translation really matters and so I'll tell you what I think the story is what I've been able to figure out, and I'm sure I haven't got it completely right, but it's

Speaker 3:          01:27:09       so he asks, God says to him, if you do well, won't you be accepted? There's a hint there, right? It's something like, well, things aren't going so well for you, so the first thing you might think is you're not doing well. What does that mean? You're not doing good? Does that not mean you're not acting properly means it's the hint because the is suggesting that if you are doing properly, you would be

Speaker 5:          01:27:36       successful. I had a friend at one point who was a very bitter person and he had a bunch of problems and some of them were self inflicted and some of them were fate I suppose, and he had. He was, he had become very, very destructive, murderously, destructive, genocidally destructive. I would say. You could see it in his dreams and, and he lived with me for awhile and I knew him very well. He was a friend of mine from the time I was 12 until the time he committed suicide when he was about 40 and when he lived with me I was trying to help him get on his feet, which was why he had come to live with me because he thought maybe I could help him get up on his feet

Speaker 3:          01:28:18       and he could only take relatively low level jobs. You know, like he had some mechanical ability, didn't, he didn't get educated. Although he's a very, very smart person. He probably had an Iq of about 135 or something like that. He's very smart and so he was bitter too because he hadn't educated themselves to the level that is, as you know, it's intellectual, abandoned. So we had to take jobs that were beneath him intellectually and he had a real. He had that real intellectual arrogance, you know, because he was smart and really smart people often come to believe that only smart matters and if they're smart and all that and all that matters is smart and then the world isn't sort of laying itself at their feet and they've been terribly betrayed and, and then they cling to their intelligence, which is more like a talent or a gift.

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       Like it's like it's an idol, you know, a false idol, which is exactly what it is in a very dangerous one. And get cynical about the stupidity of the world and the fact that there are talents weren't properly recognized and that's just not that helpful, you know, because smart is a good thing. But I'll tell you, if you don't use it properly, it will devour you just like all arbitrarily assigned. Tell it right. So you might have a talent, but it's your friend. If you use it properly and do misuse it, it will be your enemy and maybe that's how God keeps the cosmic scales adjusted. But anyhow, my friend was a very smart person, although not as smart as he thought he was unfortunately and but he hadn't done what would have been necessary with that intelligence to make it manifest itself properly in the world and that also embittered him because he also knew that there was more that he could have done if he would have done it and perhaps more that he could still do what I was suggesting to him while he was living with us because he was two levels from homeless by that point was that he should find a job that he could find working in a garage, working in a shop, something like that because he had some mechanical ability and that he should do.

Speaker 3:          01:30:14       He should separate himself from the arrogance that made him presume that such a job would be beneath him. Because at that point no job was beneath him. And, but more importantly, it's not so obvious that jobs are beneath people. You know, because even if you're a, even if imagine you have a job as a checkout person in a, in a grocery store, you know, as a fairly unskilled job, you can be some miserable, resentful, horrid bastard doing that job. Boy, you know, you can come in there and just exuding resentment and bitterness and making mistakes and making sure that every customer that passes by you has a slightly worse day than they need to write and, and you know, pilfering time and perhaps pilfering goods and being resentful about the people who, who gave you the position because they are above you in the dominance hierarchy and talking, you know, bad things.

Speaker 3:          01:31:10       Gossiping behind the back of your coworkers is like, you can take your menial position self described and turn that into a very nice little slice of hell. That's for sure. And you know, you go into places like that. I always think of the archetypical diner in that way. You know, you guys have been in this diner. There's a really good opposite diner and there's a great video on youtube. It's Tom waits reading, reading a poem by Makowsky. And I think it's called Nirvana and it's about a good diner that he happened to visit because he happened to visit when he was on a bus when he was, when he was a kid, a diner where everything was going well. And you could listen to that. It's great. I think it's great. But this is the opposite diner I'm thinking about. So you'll go into a diner, right?

Speaker 3:          01:31:55       It's 7:00 in the morning and you order some bacon and eggs and some toast and then you look around in the diner and you think it was 1975 when the windows were last washed and there's this kind of thick coating of who gives a damn grease on the walls, you know, and, and the floor to has got that sort of stickiness that you really have to work out to develop over years, you know, and the waitress is, she's not happy to be there and the guy behind the counter isn't happy that, that happens to be the waitress that he's working with. And then, you know, you walk down the stairs maybe to the washroom and now it's its own little trip and so you come back and you order your damn eggs and your order, your toast in the order your bacon, and then it comes in like the eggs are too cooked on the bottom.

Speaker 3:          01:32:44       So they're kind of brown and then they're kind of raw on top and they're called in the middle, which is, you really have to work their cooking an egg like that man. But you can master that with like 10 years of bitterness. You teach how to cook an egg like that. And then the toast, here's what you do at the toast, right? You put, you take, you take the white bread, you know the priestly based stuff that no one should ever eat. And then you put that in the toaster and you overcook it and then you wait and then you pop it out of the toaster. And then because it's overcooked, you scrape it off and you knock off the crumbs so it doesn't look too bird. And then you wait until it's cold and then you put cold margin on it because if you put cold, first of all, not butter, but if you put cold margin or you can also kind of tear holes in it so that then it has lumps of margarine in it and it's really dry except where it's too greasy. So that's like it's own little work of art man. And then you put that on the side with the, with the, with the eggs and then you have the potatoes and this is how you cook the potatoes properly.

Speaker 3:          01:33:49       So their leftover potatoes and you keep dumping new leftover potatoes into the old leftover potatoes over weeks. And so some of the potatoes, if they're no longer potatoes, right? They've have returned to mother earth. Then you flop them on the grill and you sort of know, you burden them a bit I guess. And then you slap them on the plate and Jesus, you don't want to throw those man, that's for sure. And that's the point. And then you have the bake and then you want to make sure you buy the lowest possible quality bacon. Not that that's how you start and then you throw it on the grill and you don't. Your grill has to be overheated to do this, you have to cook the Bacon so that it's raw in places and burned in other places and it has that delightful. Like older. They'd only really cheap, badly cooked bacon can provide or maybe you use those little breakfast sausages that no one in their bloody right mind would let within 15 feet of anything living, you know, and then you serve that right and you serve it with the kind of orange juice

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       that is only orange in color and with coffee, that's. What would you say it was started too early in the morning. That's the first thing. Bad quality coffee started too early in the morning. God called once or twice. It has been reheated and then you serve that with whitener. It's like, here's your breakfast. It's like, no man, that's not breakfast. That's Hell

Speaker 2:          01:35:38       No.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       And you created it and then what you do if you have a diner like that is because you have a miserable life. If you have a diner like that and you've really worked on achieving that is every night you go home and you curse your wife and you curse your kids and you fucking well curse God to for producing a universe where a diner like yours is allowed to exist and that's your bloody life so well, so that's what God's trying to point out here is if thou shalt thou not be accepted, and if they'll do a snort, well then sin lies at your door. Well, so what? I looked at lots of translations for this and actually the next line is an unto these unto thee shall be his desire. Yes. What God actually says. It's something like this is like,

Speaker 1:          01:36:42       you know things aren't going so well for you, but if you were behaving properly they would, but instead, this is what you've done. Sin came to your door and send means to pull your Arrow back into miss the target. Sin came to your door, but he uses a metaphor and the metaphor is something like sin came to your door like this sexually aroused Cap Predator thing and you invited to Dan first and then you let it have its way with you. It's like you entered into a creative. He uses a sexual metaphor. You entered into a creative exchange with it and gave birth to something as a consequence in that what you gave birth to you, that that's your life and and you knew it. Your self conscious. After all, you knew you were doing this and you

Speaker 1:          01:37:32       conspired with this thing to produce the situation that you're in. You said something about this, similar about the Ed Mother's situation. It was very politically incorrect. What he said, of course, every single thing that you wrote was politically incorrect, so just how you could tell he was a thinker by the way. He talked about the unholy alliance between hyper dependent children and their mothers and he said, well, it's actually because you. Freud thought about it as a, as a maternal thing. I'm not putting fried down. Freud mapped out the whole situation brilliantly. I'm not putting four down, but you know, young was taking the ideas and expanding them outward. You know, he said that there was an actually an unholy alliance between a hyper dependent child and uh, and they need to pull over dependent mother. And the alliance was the mother would always offer. So maybe the kid is supposed to go off and do something that would require a little bit of courage and effort

Speaker 5:          01:38:35       and the mother says,

Speaker 1:          01:38:41       well, are you sure you're feeling well enough to do it?

Speaker 5:          01:38:44       And then the child could say yes

Speaker 1:          01:38:49       or the child could say no and then

Speaker 5:          01:38:51       he put in bed and

Speaker 1:          01:38:53       baby did all of that. And. But the thing is the child made the damn decision to. And you might think, well that's pretty harsh, but just because children are little doesn't mean they're stupid and you don't know children if you don't know how children know how to manipulate because they are staggeringly good at that because they're studying you nonstop trying to figure out a what you're up to and B, how they can get what they want in the way that they wanted. And so they can play a manipulative game, no problem, especially if they're well schooled in it. And so it's sort of like that. It's like maybe the mother is a little too, a little timid and a little inclined to overprotect and maybe the child is little manipulative and a little willing to not take that courageous step out in the world and to regress into infantiles dependency instead. And then you get a terrible dynamic building across time that is like a vicious circle, you know, or like a positive feedback loop. It just expands and expands and expands because sometimes in families you see a hyper dependent child and a perfectly independent child in st mother. So obviously same author I mother is very complex and mother for child a and mother for child b are not the same mother. Even if they happen to be the same human being. That literature's quite clear on that, but you get my point, but God's idea was

Speaker 1:          01:40:13       not only are you not doing well because

Speaker 1:          01:40:17       you're not doing well, but you're not doing well because you've actually really spent a lot of work figuring out how to not do well. This is like creative effort on your part and if you read about truly malevolent people and you could start with the columbine killers because they left some very interesting diaries behind, so I would recommend them. If you. There's plenty of serial killers you could read about in the people who've really gone out and done dark things and I've read more than my fair share of that sort of thing and understand it quite well. If you really want to have your countenance fall and be wroth 10 years of brooding on your own catastrophe sort of alone and letting your fantasies take shape and and, and egging them on and and allowing them to flourish and let's say take possession of you because that's exactly the right way to think about it. That'll get you somewhere like this and there are more people who are like that. Then you think and your more like that than you think. Well, so Kane, he's obviously not very happy about this whole answer obviously, because the last thing you want to hear, if your life is turned into a catastrophe and you take God to task for creating a universe where that sort of thing was allowed is that it's your own damn fault and you should straighten up and fly, right, so to speak, and you shouldn't be complaining about the nature of being,

Speaker 1:          01:41:48       but that is the answer he gets. And so then what happens? Well, we have to infer that if cain was angry before that, he's a lot more angry now, and of course that's exactly what the story reveals, and Cain talked with Abel, his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him.

Speaker 1:          01:42:16       I'm going to read you something else now. This is foreshadowing again, this is from the same chapter by the way, do what is meaningful, not what is expedient. Jesus was led into the wilderness according to the story to be tempted by the devil. Matthew four, one prior to his crucifixion, this is the story of Cain restated abstractly, cane as far from happy as we have seen. He's working hard or so, he thinks, but God is not pleased. Meanwhile, able is dancing away in the daisies. His crops flourish. Women love him. First of all, he's a pretty good guy. Everyone knows it. He deserves his good fortune. All the more reason to hate him. I used to joke when I. I used to teach at Harvard now and then my wife would have some of the undergraduates over. We used to joke afterwards because some of them were very.

Speaker 1:          01:43:04       Many of them were very remarkable kids, you know, like they, they were super smart. They were athletic or they had some dramatic ability or they were musicians or they done some spectacular charitable work because he basically to get accepted into Harvard, you had to be top of your damn school and then you had to have at least two other outstanding things going for you, you know, and what was so annoying about most of these kids, this was our joke, was you really both liked them and respected them. It's like, wow. My joke was you'd think they would have had the good graces to be like dislikable sons of bitches, at least with all the, all those other great things going for them. They had to add like respectability and likability to it as well. So you thought, well, you know, it really couldn't happen to a better person. It's like, good God. Well that's, that's, that's able to situation,

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       you know, it's like, and you know, the funny thing too is that that's an ideal. That's the ideal, right? Because an ideal person, let's say, would be someone who you would want to be like and someone who is operating in the world like you would want to operate. And someone who fortune was smiling on and someone who was making the right sacrifices. It's really what you would want to be. And so cain kills that,

Speaker 3:          01:44:19       right? So it's a psychological story too, and you see this in the cynicism that people have about people who have done well in the world. They're always looking for some reason why they've done while they must be crooked or they must be. It must be conniving, or they must be arrogant or they must be psychopathic or and, and of course all of those things exist, but it's very bad trick to play on yourself, to make the proposition that the person in the world who represents your own ideal is that ideal because of despicable reasons, because what you do is train yourself that the ideal that you should pursue can only exist if it's motivated by despicable reasons. And then what? Not only is Abel your brother, dad as your brother in the field, in reality, but you've also slaughtered your own ideal. Well then what the hell are you going to work for? Well, how are you going to live then? Well, bitterly and miserably. That's for sure, bitterly, miserably and hopelessly. That's how you're going to live and it's so rare that I see, especially publicly that people honestly admit with sports figures, they'll do it. That's the one place where that seems to happen, but it's so uncommon for expressions of admiration and gratitude to manifest themselves in any public communication of any sort. Newspapers, TV, youtube, twitter. It's almost always

Speaker 3:          01:45:51       undermining and backbiting and criticism and very often directed to people who who have often done little else, but bringing good things into the world for other people, and that's part of why this is such a profound story. He's a pretty good guy. Everyone knows that. He deserves his good fortune. All the more reason to hate him, that's for sure. Cane bruise on his misfortune like a vulture on an egg. He enters the desert wilderness of his own mind. He obsesses over his ill fortune and betrayal. He nourishes his resentment. Indulges in evermore elaborate fantasies of revenge. His arrogance grows to Luciferian proportions. I'm ill, used and oppressed. He thinks this is a stupid bloody planet. It can go to hell. And with that, he encountered

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       Satan in the Wilderness and falls prey to his temptations, and he does what he can. And John Milton's unforgettable words to confound the race of mankind in the first route and mingle and involve earth with hell done all to spite the great creator. He turns to evil, to obtain what good forbade him. And he does it voluntarily, self consciously and with malice. Let Him who has ears here. So that's the first two human beings. They're resentful, bitter failure, taking an ax to the admirable success. And the Lord said Unto Cain, where is Abel die brother? And he said, I know not am I my brother's keeper.

Speaker 4:          01:47:53       And

Speaker 5:          01:47:55       he said, what has he done? The Voice of your brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.

Speaker 4:          01:48:01       Okay,

Speaker 5:          01:48:04       now are they'll curse from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. You know, if you want to understand that, which I would recommend, he could read Dostoyevsky's

Speaker 5:          01:48:20       crime and punishment. How it's a great, it's a great novel. I think it might be the greatest novel ever written because I haven't read every novel, but in my experience it's the greatest novel and it is exactly this. It, it, it, it says what happens psychologically if you commit the ultimate crime, it's amazing. It's absolutely amazing. It's, it's, it's, there's, there's no psychologist like Dostoevsky when now tell us the ground. It shall not hence forth yield unto the her strength of fugitive in a vagabond shell. There'll be in the earth and Cain said unto the Lord, my punishment is greater than I can bear. Now, one of the things that's interesting about this is that, you know what? I think the punishment that God lays on cane is. It's like the inevitable consequences of keynes action. It's something like that. It's like, well, he killed his brother. There's no going back from that man. Like good luck. Forgiving yourself for that. Especially if he was an ideal, especially if he was your ideal because you haven't just killed your brother and of course tortured your parents and the rest of your family. You've deprived the community of someone who is upstanding and you did it for the worst possible motivations. It's like

Speaker 5:          01:49:41       there's no up from there, right? That's, that's as close hell as you could manage

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       on earth, I would say, and Cain said unto the Lord, my punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall I be hid. That too. It's like there's also no turning back to God, let's say after an error like that because well, you've done everything you possibly could to spite God, assuming he exists and the probability that you're going to be able to mend that relationship in your now broken state. When you couldn't mend it to begin with before you did something so terrible, starts to move towards zero and it shall come to pass that everyone that find it to me shall slay me, and the Lord said unto him there for whosoever Slayeth, Kelly Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him. Seven fold and the Lord said to mark opponent cane list.

Speaker 1:          01:50:40       Any finding him should kill him. That's an interesting thing. I wondered about that for a long time because you might think, well why would god take cane under his wing so to speak, given what's already happened and I think it has something to do with the emergence of the idea that it was necessary to prevent tit for tat revenge slayings. It's something like that, you know, and there's hints of that later in the text because you know, it's like, well I kill your brother and then you killed two of my brothers and then I kill your whole family and then you kill my whole town and then I kill your whole country. And then we blow up the world. It's like, that's probably not a very intelligent solution to the initial problem. Even though the initial problem, which might be a murder is not an easy thing to solve. But I think it's something like that. And then the last part of the story is that's William Blake. So Adam and eve have discovered their dead son and Kane has become cognizant, I would say, of what he did and what he is. Right? So it's another entrance into a form of self consciousness. It's, it's, you know, the self consciousness that Adam and eve developed was painful enough. They become aware of their own vulnerability and their nakedness and perhaps even their capacity for evil, but cain becomes aware of his

Speaker 1:          01:52:07       voluntary engagement with evil itself and sees that as a crucial human capability. And that's something modern people, you know, it's no wonder we don't take it seriously like I know in the academy, in and among intellectual circles for decades, the idea of evil has been like, what are you medieval or something, you know, the whole idea of evil. You don't. That's a nonstarter as an intellectual starting place as a, as a topic. And that's something that I've just been unable to understand because I cannot understand how you could possibly have more than a cursory knowledge of the history of the 20th century. Much, much less a deep knowledge of the history of the 20th century and to walk away with any other conclusion then well good might not exist but evil. Hey, the evidence for that is so overwhelming that that only willful blindness could possibly explain denying its existence,

Speaker 1:          01:53:22       and that was actually a useful little discovery for me because I also concluded perhaps that if it was true, evil existed, then it was true by inference that it's opposite existed because the opposite of evil. Let's say the evil of the concentration camp, let's say, or we could get more specific about it. We could say there's this one thing that used to happen in Auschwitz where they would take people off the incoming trains. Those who lived that weren't stacked around the outside of the train train cars and froze to death because it was too cold. You know those who only had to be stuck in the middle where it was warm enough so that maybe the old people died because they suffocated, but at least some of them were alive when they made it to Auschwitz and then they took those poor people out. One of the tricks that the guards used to play on them was to have the, the newly arrived prisoners hoist like 100 pound sacks of wet salt and carry them from one side of the compound and these compounds were big.

Speaker 1:          01:54:29       This was a city. It wasn't like a gymnasium. It was like a city. There were tens of thousands of people there. They'd have them carry the sack of salt from one side of the compound to the other and then back. Right, and that was to make a mockery out of the notion that work would set you free. It's like, no, no, you work here, but there's nothing productive about it. The whole point, it's exactly the opposite of sacrifice. In some sense. It's so we're going to make you act out working, but all it will do is speed your demise and maybe we can decorate it up a little bit because not only will it speed up your demise, it will do it in a very painful way while simultaneously increasing the probability that other people's demises will be painful and sped up. It's a work of art, that's for sure. And to to to know about that sort of thing and not to not regard it as evil means while you can figure out what it means for yourself and Kane wind out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of Eden

Speaker 1:          01:55:32       and Cain knew his wife and she conceived, you know, in one of the critics that criticism is a fairly common criticism of these biblical stories as well. If cain and Abel were the only two people and from Adam and eve, it's like, where did all these other people come from? And doesn't that make the story like simple minded? It's like, no, that makes the reader simple minded. I mean really that's the best criticism of this. You're going to come up with being. You might say, Oh, you missed the point that that would be the right response. You missed the point. And cain knew his wife and she conceived and Bare Enoch and he built it, the city. And so it's cane that builds the cities and starts the civilization and called. That's pretty rough too, right? So it's the first fratricidal murderer who builds the cities after the name of his son, Enoch, and onto enoch was born Erad, et Cetera, et Cetera, going through the generations.

Speaker 1:          01:56:26       And lamach took unto him two wives. The name of the one was done in the name of the other Zilla. So this is, uh, an attempt to flesh out the genealogy and to describe how culture started in some sense and these tribal communities and Ada rebel, and he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have such as have cattle. And his brother's name was Jubal and he was the father of all is such handle the heart bend, Oregon, and Zillah. She also bear Tubal, an instructor of error. Every artificer and brass and iron and Tubal cane traditionally is the first person who makes weapons of war. And lamech back to Mac. Descendant of Cain said unto his wives, Ada and Zillah hear my voice. See Wives of Lamech Hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt. If cane be avenged, sevenfold truly lamach 77.

Speaker 1:          01:57:29       Well, what I see in that is this proclivity of this murderous capacity of cane as it manifests itself as society develops to to a murderous intent that transcends the mere killing of a brother. You hurt me, I hurt you back. It's no you heard me, I, I kill you, and six other people and that thing that happens after that is to not make it seven people, but to make it 70 people. And so there's this idea that once that that first murderous seed is sown, it has this proclivity to manifest itself exponentially and that's a warning and that's also why I think Tubal Kane who was one of keynes descendants was the first person who made weapons of war and that's pretty much the story of Cain and Abel and it's a hell of a story as far as I can tell, and I think it's worth thinking about pretty much forever because

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       there are so many. It's so many. It has so many facets, you know, and I think the most usefully revealing of those facets is the potential for this story. Once understood, to shed light on not your own failure. Not even on your rejection by being, let's say, but by the but on the proclivity to murder the best and the best in you for revenge upon that violation, because what that means and we know that knowledge of good and evil into the world, so to speak, with Adam and Eve's transgression, is that now not only does humanity have to contend with tragedy and suffering and even the unharvested fruits of proper sacrifice, but with the introduction of real malevolence into the world, so there's the fall into history and then there's the discovery of sacrifice as a medication for the fall and then there's a counter position which is the emergence of malevolence as the enemy of proper sacrifice and that's where we're left at the end of Cain and Abel and that's the end of that lecture. Thank you. All right.

Speaker 6:          02:00:28       Okay. So you've said that one of your moral axioms is that pain is bad and so we should work to eliminate unnecessary suffering. Isn't this the basis for a secular morality like utilitarianism and can we therefore be moral without religion?

Speaker 5:          02:00:51       Well, I don't think that it's. First of all, probably two, the first question, but that's also that derivation is predicated on the idea that that's the only idea you know, that I'm putting forward as our ethical idea and it's not. If that was the only idea, well then you could derive from that if fairly straightforward brand of utility utilitarianism, but then also I think to push the argument in that direction also necessitates that reduction of what might constitute pain to something to unidimensional because I think suffering is a better term than pain. All the pain in some senses at the core of suffering, suffering is a multidimensional phenomena and I don't think that you can draw a simple utilitarian argument from that.

Speaker 5:          02:02:00       Either the existence of suffering or the observation that it's the reduction of unnecessary suffering might be a good thing. So I'm also leery of those c, it's not reasonable in some sense to reduce a complex set of ideas to a single proposition and then say the ideas that I've been putting forward and then to reduce another complex philosophical set of ideas to a single proposition and then say aren't those two things the same? And they are to reduce them to the two simple axioms, or you could argue that they're the same but. But you. But I would say there's a tremendous amount left out in the telling and that what's left out is relevant. It kind of reminds me of those. It was philosophical games that psychologists often play. It's like, well, if there was, I think one of. What's the one, I don't know if I can recall this properly.

Speaker 5:          02:03:03       It's the trolley cart problem. Something like, you know, if there was a train that was out of control and it was going towards six people on one track, would you flip a switch? So it's switched tracks and only killed one person. Would you do that? And I read a question like that and I think that's a stupid question. And the reason I think that is because you can't take a situation like that and render it properly by reducing it to that question. And then you also can't assume that the person who answers that question would in fact act in the way they answered. You can't presume any of that. It's like because in a situation like that in a high stress situation like that, the devil is in the details and I've dealt with situations like that a number of times and know perfectly well that the devil's in the details, so I think that there's a.

Speaker 5:          02:04:01       there's an intellectual reduction to make a philosophical point that doesn't give the complexity of the topic justice and then there was a second part to that which was and therefore can't we be moral without religion? Well, I would say that question also suffers in some sense from the same problem of formulation. I I'm very hesitant ever to answer a question of the form is a merely a manifestation of be when and b are very complex things because the answer to that is it depends on what you mean by moral and what you mean by religious. Because see there's an underlying intellectual maneuver in a question like that and the underlying maneuver is the a priori assumption that something as complex as religion or as complex as morality can be reduced to an object with a name and then two objects reduced to their name can be assessed simultaneously. And I don't think that that's the case. I think you can say something like, is a triangle a square? I think you can say that, but I don't think you can say is it possible to have morality without religion? I don't think you can have that question because it has to be expanded out. So it's like, what do you mean by morality exactly. And what do you mean by religion? Because maybe and maybe not. And so

Speaker 5:          02:05:41       and so the answer to that question is decomposed the question.

Speaker 4:          02:06:02       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:06:07       I don't want my young children indoctrinated with dangerous ideas. Um, and as time marches on, I trust public education less and less. I know that you have strong thoughts on the danger of the devouring oedipal mother who harms your child by protecting them. Um, and that's certainly not what I aspire to. I wonder if in spite of your idea that kids need to become tough and learn to slay dragons, if you have anything good to say about the idea of homeschooling.

Speaker 5:          02:06:35       Well, I don't have anything bad to say about it. I do know that the government has recently taken moves to make it much more difficult for people to homeschool their children and it's not like five years. I mean, 15 years ago I would have presumed that the vast majority of people who are home schooling their children were to be viewed with skepticism. Initially. I'm not so sure about that anymore. Um, you know, for example, I was sent a poster today. Someone sent me this link that they found in the local junior high school and one of the media pieces that were recommended on this poster was a movie called Hedwig and the angry inch now already thought that was a terrible movie even though I'm perfectly capable of enjoying bizarre movies, but. So it's a bizarre movie, that's for sure. But I also thought it was a terrible bitter movie. Terrible

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       and bitter. Those are separate. A movie can be bitter and be quite great, but it was a terrible movie and it was a bitter movie, but I can tell you one bloody thing about that movie. It's not required viewing for 12 year old kids, that's for sure. So I think you have increasing reason to be skeptical of the public education system. I also looked at the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario's guidelines for education from kindergarten to grade eight and what that is in essence, and I think I will do a video about it in the relatively near future, is a blueprint for transforming children into social justice warriors had basically says that it's like you don't have to be a conspiracy theory to read that. I mean we have social justice tribunals in Ontario and so the idea is, well, if you're going to get your children, if you're going to get people to, what would you say favor, equity properly will then you better start teaching them while they're young.

Speaker 1:          02:08:33       It's like maybe not. So now you. You asked that question properly because you say, well to terrible education system, the wonderful mother homeschooling, right? That's the danger. It's like, no because it might not be the wonderful mother homeschooling, it might be the pathological mother using the pathology of the education system as an excuse to get her talons into her children. Right? Because that certainly equally possible or perhaps even more possible because at least in the public education system, there's some necessity for consensus. So that's something that you have to be very aware of and work to prevent. Right. And so I would say if you're going to do that, probably best not to do it on your own and you need. It's like you need a board of advisors or something like that and so maybe it can't just be you and you have to figure out, well what, what is they aim and how are you going to manage that and what makes you think you can do it even if it's being done badly publicly, what makes you think you could do it better?

Speaker 1:          02:09:38       I mean, my general advice is, and people have asked me this, in fact, I had a conversation with the guy who was tiling my backyard this morning about something his son had said to him that he was taught at school recently, which really made the tyler who had come from a rather authoritarian country, step back on his heels and think, I'm not so sure I should be sending my kid to public school anymore and maybe I shouldn't be living in Toronto even you know, but my general advice is keep an eye on your kids and discuss with them what they're learning and and help equip them with the tools to not only to articulate their own viewpoint in response to what they're being taught. Now the problem is you might not have the time nor the ability to do that. That's no simple thing and increasingly if you're unwilling to have your children participate in what is increasingly indoctrination and not education, thanks to in no small part to the Ontario Institute of the studies on Education, which is an institution that I particularly despise. Because I think that all it does is almost all it does now is produce indoctrinate of children. It's not an easy, it's not an easily easy problem to solve, so more more power to you wanting to

Speaker 1:          02:11:04       put your children in a situation where they're not being indoctrinated, but the alternative is very, very complicated and difficult.

Speaker 4:          02:11:13       So yeah. Thank you. I was wondering, is likely,

Speaker 1:          02:11:34       you know, I would say generally speaking, there's a shamonic basis, two to almost old the religious traditions because that's the mill you out of which the religious traditions emerged. Now I can't say much more than that because I don't know and no one does that. The particularities. I mean you might say, well, is there an illusion to the ingestion of psychoactive chemicals in the Adam and Eve story? And people have made that case and there's been powerful cases made. So there's a book, for example, I think it's called Soma by a guy named Gordon West Saul, who was the first person, an amateur psychologist who was the first person to propose that the Soma of the Hindus was we're at emoney to miscarry mushrooms, which is actually a. those are the red mushrooms with the white dots that you always see on fairy tales. You know the cute ones, toadstools flies like to eat them.

Speaker 1:          02:12:33       They're called fly a garrick. Also lie seem to like getting stoned. I know that's weird. I know that's weird thing to say, but there's a good book on animal use of psychedelics and more animals use them then you might think. But anyways, there is some evidence that you know of use of, of the ingest node, let's say metaphorically speaking as an aid to the transformation of consciousness that goes back so far that well forever as far as human beings are concerned. But to specifically tie that to the Adam and Eve story, I haven't been able to see any evidence that would definitively linkedin. You know, there's, there's been a lot of interesting books written about that. There's one that was quite a kind of a weird hit and I think in the early, late sixties might've been early seventies. It sort of got brushed off as a hippie book, but it really wasn't. It's called the sacred mushroom and the cross. That's really, that's the sort of book you read and you think, Huh?

Speaker 5:          02:13:33       I don't know. I don't know what to do about that. I have no idea what to do about that look. So that's all I can say about that.

Speaker 2:          02:13:41       Yup.

Speaker 7:          02:13:49       My is about martyrdom. So, um, what do you think murdered him or the willingness to suffer and die for what you believe, if anything says of the convictions and what do you think is the benefit for the murder which is at least traditionally in immaterial and transcendent? Good compared to the regular sacrifice or practical sacrifice which is ordered to the future material, psychological or economic good

Speaker 5:          02:14:18       man. You guys really come up with some wicked question. I think it depends to some degree on how you define martyrdom. You know, cause you could, you could define a dose.

Speaker 2:          02:14:36       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:14:38       The tendency to pathologically self aggrandize yourself on public display, or you could say it's the decision to be immovable about a set of principles. Right. So let's go with that one. Forget about the first one. Well, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Right. Get in some sense. It's, it's. Hmm. That's a really tough one.

Speaker 5:          02:15:08       People asked me. I'll make it personal. I suppose people asked me when I first got involved in all this political controversy back in September, October. Well, they asked me a couple of things. They, they asked me if this was the hill that I really would choose to die on, like pronouns and the transgender issue. Yeah. Well it's not what I want. I would have picked and. But I mean it was about language, you know, and that, that makes it nontrivial. And Bill [inaudible] was passed this week as you know, when. One of the things that was quite interesting about that, and I will answer your question, was that Brenda Cossman, who was the woman that I debated, I think it's

Speaker 5:          02:15:46       one of the persons that I debate. It didn't like to be referred to as a woman, but I didn't think it was Brenda. Anyways, she wrote an ipad and I believe it was in the globe and Mail, but it might've been the national post saying as I knew, she would say that bill [inaudible] was just the beginning. We have plenty of work left to do and yes you can bloody well be sure that we have plenty of work left to do. Anyways. I was asked during that period of time whether or not I was being a martyr, you know, and I thought, well it's not really one of my ambitions. You know, it's like that sort of torn to the lions thing doesn't sound like exactly something you might aim for. But I think,

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       well sometimes you find out in your life may be that there's something you won't do and one thing and then maybe you just don't do it no matter what the consequences. Maybe how I don't know because you know, I haven't been pushed to that point, but there have been people who have been pushed to that point in history and they basically said, I don't care why you do to me, I'm not doing that, and you know, maybe some of them were suicidal and some of them are psychotic and some of them had whatever other problems that people might have, but yeah, I do have this suspicion now and then some of them were just kind of serious about saying no and there's some utility in being serious about saying no and that sort of revealed itself to me, I suppose to some degree, back in September when I read a piece of legislation that said I would have to use some words that were legislated by the government and I thought, there's no god damn way. I'm going to do that under any conditions that I can imagine. Now. There are conditions and I have a pretty good imagination for unimaginable conditions. I couldn't see it because I thought that if I did that I would break through whatever would be left of me after having done that would no longer be me and

Speaker 1:          02:17:44       I'm not interested in that. I know what that would be like. I actually do know what that would be like and I'm not interested in that. I would rather have whatever else happens happens and people have said to me, well, you're so courageous for taking this stand. It's like, yeah, well I'm not going to claim any sort of other world courage. I can tell you that, but I can see, but one thing I do know the difference between these different forms of hell, let's put it that way and there's the hell that maybe I might be dragged through if I don't

Speaker 1:          02:18:15       agree, don't act in accordance with this law and there's the hell that I would be dragged through if I did act in accordance with the law and I would vastly prefer the first hell to the second, and the isn't clear to me that that actually constitutes courage. Is it useful? Because that's also the question about martyrdom. I think it's very useful for people to see that someone will say there's no way, there's no conceivable way that you can get me to do that, and, and I've thought long and hard about such things too because I've taught very many people to negotiate and one of the things I always teach them is you don't know, you negotiate from a position of weakness because you lose. And so if I say no to something and I mean no, I mean no, I bloody well won't do it.

Speaker 1:          02:19:07       And I think that if there are people who also agreed that such things aren't appropriate to have the example of someone who says no and means it actually turns out to be useful and so then I would say, well that's an inclination in the potential direction of martyrdom and but I don't see how to distinguish that from actually just having the courage of your convictions. And so sometimes you might say, well, a person who has sufficient courage in their convictions will sometimes be put to death. Well, if that's the definition of a martyr, then sometimes, but not all, always. That's a really good thing and one of the things I really liked about Social Nixon's book, the Gulag Archipelago, which is an I refer to it often, is an absolutely staggering book, is that he put in many, many stories of people who were in the Gulag and they were often religious believers, which was a shock to him because he was an atheistic communist.

Speaker 1:          02:20:04       When when he first entered the camps, they were often religious believers and they were people who said no. There were things they would not do. They would not participate in what the regime was asking them to do and he. You have to read it because the devil's in the stories, right? The details in the stories, but soldier Nixon in the camps grew to have tremendous admiration for such people and actually viewed them as exemplars of the mode of being that was necessary for him to escape both the communist propaganda that had shaped him as an individual and also the terrible bitterness and sorrow and anger that he experienced as a consequence of being flung into the terrible concentration camp conditions of the Gulag archipelago. So

Speaker 2:          02:20:56       Yep.

Speaker 6:          02:21:04       Hey Doc. Thanks for staying alive and potentially saving humanity. So yeah, that's good stuff. Uh, wondering about a couple of things. Firstly, who won that childhood fight? Yukata. Let that, let that just slide. So I'm thinking it's a big l.

Speaker 1:          02:21:21       well, I can tell you because he was a tough little kid. See, I don't remember what happened, but my, my remembrance of him was that he could eat, pound me out pretty pretty effectively. So, uh, yeah, yeah. His name was vernon switching enoch. Yeah. He was a really good friend of mine and I think, I think Vernon's still lives in fairview. So if, if, uh, if, if he hears of this then maybe he'll remember that too. And, and uh, uh, you know, so probably he would have won. I didn't win that many physical fights when I was a kid. So.

Speaker 6:          02:21:56       Okay. That's not the only questions anyway. Cool. Uh, I'm not sure if you've, if you've actually been asked this before, I've missed the last two lectures, but I'm wondering what your thoughts are on, on token jr token and uh, his work, not just lord of the rings, but the silmarillion, which is basically like I'm, I'm seeing all this and I'm thinking it's like the modern Bible in a way. It's got the weird names like to ball cane and all that stuff. And then specifically when were talking about Caine just now and how he was things just moving and when he was talking about, uh, how he felt like betrayed by God and he spent his whole life working a, it's a spite him essentially. And he kind of set the path for, for the darkness in humanity that's almost exactly melcor which was in the similar really. And basically what's would spawn everything evil in middle earth and more door and whatnot. And I don't even know as much as go on talking.

Speaker 5:          02:22:55       Was it a student of mythology and you know, the, the, um, the, the, uh, the story of the Hobbit is a retelling of Beowulf in large part. And that's a dragon slaying myth. And and so the, the reason that Tolkien and rolling for that matter are so popular is because they've done a very good job of making the old myths new and, and well, look what's happened with the marvel series. It's the same thing with star wars and all of that is that you can't not respond to these stories. Now you're gonna find them in one form or another in sometimes well with the biblical stories. For example, the mythological, the meaning of the mythological content has become invisible. That's partly the death of God that Nisha was referring to, but that doesn't mean that the stories themselves vanished because people have an eternal hunger for them.

Speaker 5:          02:23:51       Now, the problem with them emerging in let's say, more literary or less sophisticated form, let's take the marvel movies as an example, is that they're not surrounded by an articulated culture the same way the biblical stories are. So for example, they're not surrounded by something like paradise lost by John Milton, which or, or Dante, oh, inferno, which are works of ill, unlimited depth. And so you throw away something of great value and reacquire it in a different place with less value perhaps, but more comprehensive ability. It's not a, it's not a great trait that is not a critique of talking and it's not a critique of anybody who's drawing on mythological stories for their narratives. You have to do that to be a good storyteller. But it's nice to go as close to the source as you can as well. So. Yep. And the overlaps that you described while. Yeah, it's exactly what you'd expect because if you deal with great mythological themes, you start to get the archetypes are at the bottom of stories. And so if, if the story goes down far enough, it runs into the archetypes. And that was the youngest claim. And I think he got that exactly right. So,

Speaker 2:          02:25:06       okay,

Speaker 6:          02:25:11       last one, uh, there's a passage in paradise lost were the demons are building pandemonium under mammon's sort of guidance and they crack open the what's not really earth but hell. And they take out the gold and they build pandemonium, which is the most sophisticated architectural wonder of all time in, in Milton's language, and, and this, this conception of taking material and turning it into a, a temple to oneself, um, was interpreted by Humphrey Jennings, who was the founder of the mass observation movement. And if anyone saw the opening to the Britains 2012 games, the history of the industrial revolution, he said, was encapsulated by this passage in Milton where you have demons building a temple for themselves out of matter and that mankind in Milton's language was, was taught to do this or that they learned it first by this example. And he says, let not envy the devils have riches and hell.

Speaker 6:          02:26:21       Um, and I see things in this one, the, the gnostic idea that somehow the world itself that we inhabit as hell. And then that matter is not our true place of, of existence, but somewhere sort of platonic and also the festie and sort of bargain that people made around 16, 66 two to get a world of stuff and things and possessions by losing the soul or what existed before that. And I, I wonder if that, I play with that a lot in my own thought and I wonder if that's something that you found in Milton and, and what you think of that passage in particular.

Speaker 5:          02:26:59       Well, Milton was definitely a prophetic voice, right? And I. and I think that that's, that's a perfectly reasonable retelling of that section. It's also very much a kin to the story of the Tower of Babel. We'll talk about next week. Um,

Speaker 4:          02:27:19       no.

Speaker 5:          02:27:22       See the problem with the problem. God, it's so complicated. See what one of the things that young said about the transformation of the first millennium of Christianity into let's say, the second millennium of Christianity, is that Christianity had promised something like redemption, universal redemption from suffering maybe in the afterlife. But that was kind of a cop out, let's say, because it didn't really solve the problem of suffering here and now, and you believe that as people had. Although although it did, many did many positive things, let's not, let's not forget that it's civilized people in a way that they hadn't been before or you could make that case, but then there was this underground.

Speaker 5:          02:28:05       At the same time, there's this denial of the utility of material reality that went along with the spiritualization of mankind in that in that first in the Christian millennium, there was value left in material because it had been ignored and so young believer that the, the, the collective unconscious, broadly speaking, began to be attracted to the, to what had been rejected by the hyper spiritualization and started to question whether or not additional value could be extracted from the material. Maybe as a adjunct to the spiritual because maybe true redemption was something like a proper meeting of the spiritual and the material, which wasn't something that seemed to be part and parcel of Christian Christian doctrine. Up to that point. Now maybe what Milton was warning against was a swing too far, right, and I think Milton's point is well taken because one of the things that's worth noting is that you can be perfectly miserable in a house of gold, right?

Speaker 5:          02:29:07       I mean, I've known very many wealthy people, very, very wealthy people, and the problem. See, the thing is is that money just doesn't solve that many problems that people have. People wish it would. People who want to be rich think it will and the people who want to redistribute money, you think it will, and I know that there's nothing to be said for abject poverty, but the problem is that there are many serious problems that human beings have that matter. Material Comfort alone does nothing to address or almost nothing. You can be perfectly. You can have a perfectly miserable family life and $20, million dollars and the buffer that the $20,000,000 puts between you and the misery is sometimes it's not even a buffer. It's a magnifier. So Milton would warn against the creation of even the idea of a material utopia. Even in principle, something Dostoevsky also recognized is an error, you cannot solve the problem in that manner and maybe the demonic idea is that is propaganda that you could now maybe, maybe there is a balance of some sort because I don't understand if we were going to build the city of God, let's say, well a huge part of the endeavor would have to be spiritual and to me that a huge part of that would be, it would have to be something predicated if not on truth, at least not at least on the willingness of people not to lie to one another.

Speaker 5:          02:30:49       Without that, all the material wellbeing in the world is, it's a facade. It's like gilding a corpse. Right. And, and I think that's partly what Melton was warning against. I mean Milton was doing many more things than he knew of course, because he was a poetic genius of incalculable genius. Right, right, right, right. So, well you've obviously thought about such things very much. So that was a very good question. So. All right everyone. Good.

Speaker 2:          02:31:22       Thanks.
