1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Hello everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you again for showing up.</v>

3
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 2>tonight we're going to finish off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story of Noah and also the story of the </v>

5
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Tower of Babel and I don't think that'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>take very long and then we're going to </v>

6
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 2>turn to the abrahamic stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

7
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.820
<v Speaker 2>there are very complex set of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sit between the earliest stories in</v>

8
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 2>genesis that I would say end with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tower of Babel.</v>

9
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:01.791
<v Speaker 2>And then the stories of Moses which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily well developed or the </v>

10
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 2>abrahamic stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole sequence of them,</v>

11
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 2>multiple stories conjoined together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

12
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 2>there I found them very daunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very difficult to understand and</v>

13
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to stumble through them the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best that I can.</v>

14
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's probably the best way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think about this because they,</v>

15
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

16
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 2>they have a narrative content that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite strange.</v>

17
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading a book while doing this </v>

18
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 2>called the disappearance of God that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>found quite helpful.</v>

19
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 2>And the author of that book argues that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happens in the </v>

20
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:51.081
<v Speaker 2>old testament is that God is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest at the beginning in terms of </v>

21
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:57.321
<v Speaker 2>personal appearances even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that proclivity fades away as </v>

22
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 2>the old testament develops and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>parallel development that it's mainly </v>

23
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe causally linked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure how to </v>

24
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it appears to be causally linked.</v>

25
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:15.891
<v Speaker 2>Is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stories about individuals become </v>

26
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.620
<v Speaker 2>more and more well developed so it's as </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's as if as God fades away so to </v>

27
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:26.691
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual becomes more and more </v>

28
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:29.511
<v Speaker 2>manifest and there's a statement in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Old Testament,</v>

29
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.820
<v Speaker 2>the location of which I don't recall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you about it in future </v>

30
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.531
<v Speaker 2>lectures were God essentially tells </v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever he's speaking with and I don't </v>

31
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:44.250
<v Speaker 2>remember who that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's going to disappear and let man</v>

32
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 2>essentially go his own way and see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

33
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Not a complete disappearance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe a transformation to something </v>

34
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.191
<v Speaker 2>that modern people regard more as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological phenomena rather than the </v>

35
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.730
<v Speaker 2>sort of objective entity that God to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning of the biblical </v>

36
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.571
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've been wrestling with that a </v>

37
00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:09.511
<v Speaker 2>lot because the notion that God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God appears to Abraham Multiple Times,</v>

38
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.910
<v Speaker 2>and that's not a concept that's easy for</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern people to to grasp in.</v>

39
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 2>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

40
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 2>apart from say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues of faith.</v>

41
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.240
<v Speaker 2>God isn't some thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who makes himself personally </v>

42
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 2>manifest in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't appear to us.</v>

43
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.580
<v Speaker 2>That's I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the question of belief is so </v>

44
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.041
<v Speaker 2>paramount for modern people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I presume that if God had was in the </v>

45
00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:48.121
<v Speaker 2>habit of appearing to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you likely wouldn't have a problem with </v>

46
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might be more complicated than</v>

47
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's how it seems to me.</v>

48
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And so when we read stories about God </v>
<v Speaker 2>making himself manifest either to a </v>

49
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:03.151
<v Speaker 2>nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in the case of Israel or to </v>

50
00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 2>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to understand.</v>

51
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to understand why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would write stories like that if they </v>

52
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.471
<v Speaker 2>thought like we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean really it wasn't that long </v>

53
00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 2>ago that the Bible was written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say from a biological perspective,</v>

54
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 2>it's really only yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a couple of thousand years,</v>

55
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 2>say 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

56
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:23.341
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not very long ago from a </v>

57
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:23.341
<v Speaker 2>biological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

58
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.530
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I tried to do is to </v>

59
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 2>see if I could figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that.</v>

60
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 2>And so I'll start the lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once we finished the,</v>

61
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.140
<v Speaker 2>the remains of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the story of Noah,</v>

62
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I'll start the lecture with a d with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt to situate the abrahamic stories</v>

63
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 2>in a context that might make them more </v>
<v Speaker 2>accessible.</v>

64
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 2>These two contexts that worked for me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them more accessible.</v>

65
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Let's conclude the newest story first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

66
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.420
<v Speaker 2>when we ended last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the art had come to its resting place </v>

67
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:09.841
<v Speaker 2>and Noah and his family had debarked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

68
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.070
<v Speaker 2>and so this is the stories of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurs immediately after afterwards.</v>

69
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a very short story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's very relevant for both </v>

70
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:25.060
<v Speaker 2>of these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Tower of Babel as well,</v>

71
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:30.061
<v Speaker 2>very relevant for our current times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the sons of Noah that went forth of </v>

72
00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:34.651
<v Speaker 2>the Ark were shem and ham and Japheth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ham is the father of Canaan.</v>

73
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 2>These are the three sons of Noah and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them was the whole Earth overspread.</v>

74
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.480
<v Speaker 2>And Noah began to be a hud husbands men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he planted a vineyard and he drank </v>

75
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 2>of the wine and was drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was uncovered within his tent and</v>

76
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:55.561
<v Speaker 2>Ham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The father of Canaan saw the nakedness </v>

77
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:58.171
<v Speaker 2>of his father and told his two brethren </v>
<v Speaker 2>without and Shem and Japheth took a </v>

78
00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:04.101
<v Speaker 2>garment and laid upon both their </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders and went backward and covered </v>

79
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.701
<v Speaker 2>the nakedness of their father and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>faces were backward and they saw not </v>

80
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.421
<v Speaker 2>their father's nakedness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Noah awoke from his wine and knew </v>

81
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.080
<v Speaker 2>what his younger son had done unto him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

82
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.750
<v Speaker 2>curse it to be Canaan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a servant of servants,</v>

83
00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:17.850
<v Speaker 2>shall he be unto his brethren.</v>

84
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.840
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blessed shall be the Lord God of </v>

85
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 2>chairman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canaan shall be his servant and God </v>

86
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.071
<v Speaker 2>shall enlarge Japheth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem </v>

87
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 2>and Canaan shall be his servant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Noah lived after the flood,</v>

88
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:35.740
<v Speaker 2>350 years and all the days of Noah were </v>
<v Speaker 2>950 years.</v>

89
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:40.741
<v Speaker 2>And he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole earth was of one language </v>

90
00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:41.310
<v Speaker 2>and of one speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

91
00:06:41.311 --> 00:06:46.311
<v Speaker 2>so I remember thinking about this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be 30 years ago</v>

92
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 2>and I think the meaning of the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>stood out for me.</v>

93
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when you read complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>material,</v>

94
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:04.931
<v Speaker 2>sometimes a piece of it will stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for some reason it's like it </v>

95
00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:08.790
<v Speaker 2>glitters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that might be one way of </v>

96
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.790
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's it,</v>

97
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 2>it you're in sync with it and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what it means.</v>

98
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I've really experienced that reading the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tao Te Ching,</v>

99
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.810
<v Speaker 2>which is document I would really like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a lecture on at some point because </v>

100
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.951
<v Speaker 2>some of the verses I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but others stand right out and I can </v>

101
00:07:22.951 --> 00:07:23.800
<v Speaker 2>understand them and I think I understood</v>
<v Speaker 2>what this part of the story of.</v>

102
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 2>No Amanda and I think it means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.680
<v Speaker 2>we talked a little bit about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>nakedness meant in the story of Adam and</v>

104
00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:34.681
<v Speaker 2>eve and the idea essentially was that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know yourself naked is to become aware </v>

105
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:38.650
<v Speaker 2>of your vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the physical,</v>

106
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.580
<v Speaker 2>your physical boundaries in time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>space and your,</v>

107
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.970
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your physiological,</v>

108
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.480
<v Speaker 2>your fundamental physiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>insufficiencies as they make might be </v>

109
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.480
<v Speaker 2>judged by others.</v>

110
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.190
<v Speaker 2>So there's biological insufficiency that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of built into you because you're a </v>

111
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.731
<v Speaker 2>fragile mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable half insane creature and </v>

112
00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:03.360
<v Speaker 2>that's that's just an existential truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course even merely as a </v>

113
00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:06.070
<v Speaker 2>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with all those faults,</v>

114
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.100
<v Speaker 2>there are faults that you have that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular to you that might be judged </v>

115
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.391
<v Speaker 2>harshly by the group while might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll definitely be judged harshly by </v>

116
00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:16.810
<v Speaker 2>the group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to become aware of your nakedness</v>

117
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:19.120
<v Speaker 2>is to become self conscious and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to,</v>

118
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:24.150
<v Speaker 2>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know your limits and to know your </v>

119
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.921
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what is revealed to him when </v>

120
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:29.160
<v Speaker 2>he comes across his father naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

121
00:08:29.161 --> 00:08:34.161
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to see your father </v>

122
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 2>naked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me,</v>

123
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:37.120
<v Speaker 2>and especially in an inappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner like this,</v>

124
00:08:37.121 --> 00:08:37.510
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

125
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.620
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

126
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

127
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:40.690
<v Speaker 2>it's as if</v>

128
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.160
<v Speaker 3>ham,</v>

129
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 2>he does the same thing that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mesopotamian creation myth.</v>

130
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.230
<v Speaker 2>When when timeout an absolute give rise </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the first God's there,</v>

131
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 2>they're the father of the eventual</v>

132
00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.060
<v Speaker 4>Deity of redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Martech there are very careless and </v>

133
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.511
<v Speaker 4>noisy and they kill app sue their father</v>
<v Speaker 4>and attempt to inhabit his corpse and </v>

134
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:11.030
<v Speaker 4>that makes timeout enraged and so she </v>
<v Speaker 4>bursts forth from the darkness to do the</v>

135
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a precursor to the flood story</v>

136
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.400
<v Speaker 4>or an analog to the flood story and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>see the same thing happening here with </v>

137
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.121
<v Speaker 4>him is that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's insufficiently respectful of his </v>

138
00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:27.171
<v Speaker 4>father and and the question is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 4>what does the farther represent and you </v>

139
00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:27.171
<v Speaker 4>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's,</v>

140
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.450
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the father that you have and </v>

141
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:32.450
<v Speaker 4>that's a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

142
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 4>that's a man like other men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a man among men,</v>

143
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.380
<v Speaker 4>but then there's the father as such and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the spirit of the father and </v>

144
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 4>insofar as you have a father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have both at the same time.</v>

145
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:46.701
<v Speaker 4>You have the personal father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a man among other men just like </v>

146
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 4>anyone out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his father,</v>

147
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 4>but in so far as that man is your </v>
<v Speaker 4>father.</v>

148
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 4>That means that he's something different</v>
<v Speaker 4>than just another person.</v>

149
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 4>And what he is is the incarnation of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>spirit of the father.</v>

150
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.400
<v Speaker 4>And to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take it to what to disrespect that </v>

151
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.570
<v Speaker 4>carelessly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe even like,</v>

152
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes a mistake,</v>

153
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:12.681
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He produces wine and gets himself drunk </v>

154
00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 4>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

155
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he sprawled out there for everyone to</v>

156
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:20.451
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hardly hams fault if he stumbles </v>

157
00:10:20.451 --> 00:10:22.371
<v Speaker 4>across it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the book is laying out a danger and </v>

158
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 4>the danger is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

159
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.300
<v Speaker 4>maybe you catch your father at his most </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable moment and if you're </v>

160
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.530
<v Speaker 4>disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you transgress against the spirit </v>

161
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.821
<v Speaker 4>of the father and if you transgress </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the spirit of father and lose </v>

162
00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 4>the spirit of the father and lose </v>
<v Speaker 4>respect for the spirit of the father,</v>

163
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 4>then that is likely to transform you </v>
<v Speaker 4>into a slave.</v>

164
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.450
<v Speaker 4>That's a very interesting idea and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's particularly interesting.</v>

165
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not particularly interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

166
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.490
<v Speaker 4>It's particularly Germane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

167
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:58.491
<v Speaker 4>to our current cultural situation </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think that were pushed </v>

168
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.790
<v Speaker 4>constantly to see the nakedness of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>father,</v>

169
00:11:00.791 --> 00:11:05.791
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because of the intense criticism that's </v>

170
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.470
<v Speaker 4>directed towards our culture and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchal culture,</v>

171
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're constantly exposing its weaknesses</v>

172
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:19.221
<v Speaker 4>and vulnerabilities and let's say </v>
<v Speaker 4>nakedness and there's nothing wrong with</v>

173
00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:24.351
<v Speaker 4>criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing about criticism is the </v>

174
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:24.960
<v Speaker 4>purpose of criticism is to separate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wheat from the chaff.</v>

175
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.300
<v Speaker 4>It's not the burn everything to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground,</v>

176
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to say,</v>

177
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to carefully look at this.</v>

178
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:36.231
<v Speaker 4>We're going to carefully differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to keep what's good and </v>

179
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:36.231
<v Speaker 4>we're going to move away from what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad,</v>

180
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 4>but the point of the criticism isn't to </v>
<v Speaker 4>identify everything is bad.</v>

181
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:44.241
<v Speaker 4>It's two separate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's good from what's bad so that you </v>

182
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:47.421
<v Speaker 4>can retain what's good and move towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and to be careless at that is deadly </v>

183
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Speaker 4>because you inhabited by the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the father,</v>

184
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 4>right in so far as you're a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>construction,</v>

185
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.640
<v Speaker 5>which of course is something that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>the postmodern neo Marxists are </v>

186
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.980
<v Speaker 5>absolutely in phatic about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a cultural construction in so far</v>

187
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 5>as you're a cultural construction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then your inhabited by the spirit of the</v>

188
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:11.161
<v Speaker 5>father and to be disrespectful towards </v>
<v Speaker 5>that means to undermine the very </v>

189
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 5>structure that makes you not all of what</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are.</v>

190
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 5>Certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>certainly not all of what you are,</v>

191
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:21.481
<v Speaker 5>but a good portion of what you are in so</v>
<v Speaker 5>far as you're a socialized cultural </v>

192
00:12:21.481 --> 00:12:25.891
<v Speaker 5>entity and if you pull out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you pull the foundation out from </v>

193
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 5>underneath that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you have left?</v>

194
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.500
<v Speaker 5>You can hardly manage on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

195
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 5>it's just not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a cultural</v>

196
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.440
<v Speaker 2>creation and so hamm makes this </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperate error and is careless about </v>

197
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.960
<v Speaker 2>exposing himself to the vulnerability of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father.</v>

198
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does it without sufficient respect </v>

199
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.650
<v Speaker 2>and the judgment is that not only will </v>
<v Speaker 2>he be a slave,</v>

200
00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:57.651
<v Speaker 2>but so will all of his descendants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's contrasted with the other two sons </v>

201
00:12:57.651 --> 00:13:01.680
<v Speaker 2>who I suppose are willing to give their </v>
<v Speaker 2>father the benefit of the doubt,</v>

202
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:06.681
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when they see him in a </v>

203
00:13:06.681 --> 00:13:08.340
<v Speaker 2>compromising position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they handle it with respect and,</v>

204
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.730
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't capitalize on it.</v>

205
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.080
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that makes them strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it seems to me.</v>

206
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.750
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that's what that story </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

207
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.950
<v Speaker 2>It has something to do with respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

208
00:13:24.951 --> 00:13:27.950
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing about having respect</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your culture,</v>

209
00:13:27.951 --> 00:13:30.290
<v Speaker 2>and I suppose that's partly why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the biblical stories,</v>

210
00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:33.470
<v Speaker 2>is because they're part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're part of my culture.</v>

211
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.970
<v Speaker 2>They're part of our culture perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're certainly part of my culture</v>

212
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.910
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to me that</v>

213
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:47.690
<v Speaker 5>it's worthwhile to treat that with </v>
<v Speaker 5>respect to see what you can glean from </v>

214
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.690
<v Speaker 5>it</v>

215
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.240
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not kick it when it's down,</v>

216
00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:52.700
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

217
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.160
<v Speaker 2>And so that's how the story of no ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

218
00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:07.161
<v Speaker 2>And the thing too is Noah is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty decent incarnation of the spirit </v>

219
00:14:08.821 --> 00:14:13.821
<v Speaker 2>of the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That which I suppose is one of the </v>

220
00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:15.921
<v Speaker 2>things that makes Hams misstep more </v>
<v Speaker 2>egregious is that,</v>

221
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Noah just built an ark and God everybody</v>

222
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:20.310
<v Speaker 2>through the flood man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:25.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not so bad in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe the fact that he happened to </v>

224
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.320
<v Speaker 2>drink too much wine one day wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to justify humiliating him.</v>

225
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.340
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's pushing the limits of</v>

226
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:37.370
<v Speaker 2>symbolic interpretation to note on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>daily basis that were all contained in </v>

227
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.790
<v Speaker 2>an arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

228
00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:43.791
<v Speaker 2>And that's the arc that you could think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that as the arc that's been </v>

229
00:14:43.791 --> 00:14:47.181
<v Speaker 2>bequeathed to us by our forefathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the tremendous infrastructure </v>

230
00:14:47.181 --> 00:14:52.131
<v Speaker 2>that we inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we take for granted because it </v>

231
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:52.131
<v Speaker 2>works so well.</v>

232
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 2>That protects us from things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even imagine.</v>

233
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 2>And we don't have to imagine because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so well protected.</v>

234
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>struck me hard,</v>

235
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.370
<v Speaker 2>I would say about the disintegration and</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption of the universities is the </v>

236
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.540
<v Speaker 2>absolute in gratitude that goes along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

237
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

238
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:16.601
<v Speaker 2>is for fine thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's done in the spirit in a proper </v>

239
00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 2>spirit and that's the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>separating the wheat from the chaff.</v>

240
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.260
<v Speaker 2>But it needs to be accompanied by </v>
<v Speaker 2>gratitude.</v>

241
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.820
<v Speaker 2>And it does seem to me that anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives in in the west,</v>

242
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:31.170
<v Speaker 2>in the western culture at this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in history and in this place and who </v>

243
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:36.760
<v Speaker 2>isn't simultaneously grateful for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is is,</v>

244
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 2>is half blind at least because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>never been better than this.</v>

245
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:47.410
<v Speaker 2>And it could be so much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's highly likely that it will be </v>

246
00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.830
<v Speaker 2>so much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because for most of human history,</v>

247
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 2>so much worse is the norm.</v>

248
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:53.760
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

249
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:03.810
<v Speaker 2>then there's this little story that </v>
<v Speaker 2>crops up that seems in some ways </v>

250
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.220
<v Speaker 2>unrelated to everything that's gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it,</v>

251
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.430
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's also an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>profound little story.</v>

252
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.120
<v Speaker 2>It took me a long time to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the tower of Babel and it came to </v>

253
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:21.631
<v Speaker 2>pass as they journeyed from the east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they found a plain in the land of </v>

254
00:16:21.631 --> 00:16:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Shinar and dwelt there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Noah's descendants.</v>

255
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.880
<v Speaker 2>And the whole earth was of one language </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of one speech and it came to pass as</v>

256
00:16:27.881 --> 00:16:32.881
<v Speaker 2>they journeyed from the east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they found a plain in the land of </v>

257
00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Shinar and they dwelt there and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said to one another,</v>

258
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.760
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let us make brick and burn them </v>

259
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.471
<v Speaker 2>thoroughly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they had brick for stone and slime </v>

260
00:16:40.471 --> 00:16:42.550
<v Speaker 2>they had for mortar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're establishing a city.</v>

261
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.320
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

262
00:16:44.321 --> 00:16:49.321
<v Speaker 2>Let us build a city and a tower whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>top may reach unto heaven and let us </v>

263
00:16:49.661 --> 00:16:53.650
<v Speaker 2>make a name lest we be scattered abroad </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon the face of the earth.</v>

264
00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:01.230
<v Speaker 2>And the Lord came down to see the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the tower which the children of men </v>

265
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.610
<v Speaker 2>built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Lord said,</v>

266
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.790
<v Speaker 2>behold the people is one and they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>have one language and now this they </v>

267
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:12.201
<v Speaker 2>begin to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now nothing will be restrained from </v>

268
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:12.201
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they have imagined to do.</v>

269
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Go to let us go down and there confound </v>
<v Speaker 2>their language that they may not </v>

270
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.901
<v Speaker 2>understand one another's speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the Lord scattered them abroad from </v>

271
00:17:21.901 --> 00:17:25.540
<v Speaker 2>thence upon the face of all the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they left off to build the city,</v>

272
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:32.100
<v Speaker 2>therefore is the name of it called Babel</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the Lord did there confound the </v>

273
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.511
<v Speaker 2>language of all the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from thence did the Lord scatter </v>

274
00:17:36.511 --> 00:17:39.571
<v Speaker 2>them abroad upon the face of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult story to understand.</v>

275
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:46.030
<v Speaker 2>It's on the face of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to show God in a very </v>

276
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.141
<v Speaker 2>good light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although that happens fairly frequently </v>

277
00:17:49.141 --> 00:17:49.141
<v Speaker 2>in the old testament as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>

278
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

279
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.490
<v Speaker 2>you know the thing to do if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading in the spirit of the text,</v>

280
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to remember that it's God that you're</v>

281
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:04.461
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even though you might think that </v>

282
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.280
<v Speaker 2>he's appearing in a bad light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your duty as a reader,</v>

283
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.330
<v Speaker 2>I suppose is to assume that you're wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that what he did was right,</v>

284
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 2>and then you're supposed to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

285
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:18.591
<v Speaker 2>how could it possibly be right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the axiomatic presupposition is </v>

286
00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:19.410
<v Speaker 2>that it's God and whatever he does is </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

287
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 2>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

288
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:25.701
<v Speaker 2>you can disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also the case that some of the </v>

289
00:18:25.701 --> 00:18:27.360
<v Speaker 2>people that God talks to in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament actually disagree with him and</v>

290
00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:32.361
<v Speaker 2>convince him to alter his actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point still remains that it's </v>

291
00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:32.880
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he's doing it,</v>

292
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 2>then by definition there's a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

293
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.880
<v Speaker 2>There's an idea of much later that John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Melton develops in in paradise lost,</v>

294
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.480
<v Speaker 2>which is an amazing home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

295
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

296
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:57.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a profound enough poems so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost been incorporated into the </v>

297
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.470
<v Speaker 2>biblical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

298
00:18:57.471 --> 00:19:02.471
<v Speaker 2>So the Corpus of Christianity Post </v>
<v Speaker 2>Milton was saturated by the mill tonic </v>

299
00:19:07.101 --> 00:19:09.610
<v Speaker 2>stories of Satan's rebellion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that's in the,</v>

300
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:15.050
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the biblical texts or it's only </v>

301
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.771
<v Speaker 2>hinted at in very brief passages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Milton wrote his poem to justify the</v>

302
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.870
<v Speaker 2>ways of God to man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite an ambition,</v>

303
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.690
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing,</v>

304
00:19:26.691 --> 00:19:31.691
<v Speaker 2>profound ambition to try to produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to produce a literary work </v>

305
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.130
<v Speaker 2>that justifies being to human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what Milton was trying to</v>

306
00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:37.790
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>

307
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.820
<v Speaker 2>One of my readers here sent me a link </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day or our viewers to a work </v>

308
00:19:43.611 --> 00:19:48.611
<v Speaker 2>of philosophy by an Australian </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher whose name I don't remember </v>

309
00:19:48.611 --> 00:19:53.590
<v Speaker 2>who basically wrote a book saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>being as such human experience is so </v>

310
00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:58.901
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and so permeated by suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would be better if it had never </v>

311
00:19:58.901 --> 00:20:03.641
<v Speaker 2>existed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of the ultimate expression of </v>

312
00:20:03.641 --> 00:20:06.641
<v Speaker 2>nihilism and Gertha in faust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His mephistopheles who's Santana </v>

313
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.880
<v Speaker 2>character obviously has that as a credo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Satan's fundamental motivation is</v>

314
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:20.290
<v Speaker 2>his objection to creation itself is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>creation is so flawed and so rife with </v>

315
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.730
<v Speaker 2>suffering that it would be better if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>had never existed at all,</v>

316
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
<v Speaker 2>and so that's his motivation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting to continue to destroy it in </v>

317
00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:34.451
<v Speaker 2>Milton's Paradise Lost Satan as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual figure and you see that </v>

318
00:20:34.521 --> 00:20:38.690
<v Speaker 2>motif emerged very frequently by the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>in popular culture.</v>

319
00:20:38.691 --> 00:20:40.640
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the lion king,</v>

320
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:46.030
<v Speaker 2>the figure of scar who's a satanic </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure is also hyper intellectual and </v>

321
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:51.310
<v Speaker 2>that's very common that you know it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the evil scientist Motif or the or the </v>

322
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 2>evil advisor to the king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same motif.</v>

323
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:57.380
<v Speaker 2>It encapsulate something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality and what it seems to </v>

324
00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.361
<v Speaker 2>encapsulate as the idea that rationality</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Satan is the highest angel in God's</v>

325
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:03.910
<v Speaker 2>heavenly kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a psychological idea.</v>

326
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:08.911
<v Speaker 2>You know that the most powerful sub </v>
<v Speaker 2>element of the human psyche is the </v>

327
00:21:08.911 --> 00:21:13.681
<v Speaker 2>intellect and it's the thing that shines</v>
<v Speaker 2>out above all within the domain of </v>

328
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 2>humanity and maybe across the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life itself.</v>

329
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:24.090
<v Speaker 2>The human intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something absolutely remarkable </v>

330
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.251
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has a flaw and the floor is that </v>

331
00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:28.681
<v Speaker 2>it tends to fall in love with its own </v>
<v Speaker 2>productions and to assume that their </v>

332
00:21:28.681 --> 00:21:32.761
<v Speaker 2>total solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was writing the Gulag </v>

333
00:21:32.761 --> 00:21:35.431
<v Speaker 2>archipelago had a warning about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to totalitarian ideology </v>

334
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.240
<v Speaker 2>and he said that the price of selling </v>
<v Speaker 2>your God given sole to the entrapments </v>

335
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:46.420
<v Speaker 2>of of human dogma was slavery and death </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

336
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:52.690
<v Speaker 2>and Satan in May in Milton's paradise </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>

337
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Satan decides that he can do without the</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent.</v>

338
00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:01.620
<v Speaker 2>He can do without God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why foment rebellion.</v>

339
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.540
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of that.</v>

340
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:10.110
<v Speaker 2>The immediate consequence from Milton's </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective was that as soon as Satan </v>

341
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.790
<v Speaker 2>decided that what he knew was sufficient</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that he could do without the </v>

342
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:20.521
<v Speaker 2>transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you might think about as the </v>

343
00:22:20.521 --> 00:22:20.830
<v Speaker 2>domain outside of what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

344
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Immediately he was inhale and when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>read paradise lost,</v>

345
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I was studying totalitarianism and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

346
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poet,</v>

347
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:35.730
<v Speaker 2>the true poet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a prophet is someone who has </v>

348
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:40.381
<v Speaker 2>intimations of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's because the poetic </v>

349
00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the philosophical or prophetic mind is a</v>

350
00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:47.401
<v Speaker 2>pattern detector and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are people who can detect the </v>

351
00:22:47.401 --> 00:22:48.940
<v Speaker 2>underlying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the melody of nation,</v>

352
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.540
<v Speaker 2>melody in Song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the song of a nation and could see how </v>

353
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:54.540
<v Speaker 2>it's going to develop across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>centuries.</v>

354
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.320
<v Speaker 2>You see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that nature because nature,</v>

355
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mid,</v>

356
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 2>around 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 or so,</v>

357
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 2>and he prophesied what was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen in the 20th century.</v>

358
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:08.101
<v Speaker 2>He said that he said specifically that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the specter of communism would kill </v>

359
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.680
<v Speaker 2>millions of people in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing prophecy.</v>

360
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:17.010
<v Speaker 2>He said that in the notes that became </v>
<v Speaker 2>will to power and Dostoevsky was of the </v>

361
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 2>same sort of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who was in touch enough with the</v>

362
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:22.580
<v Speaker 2>fundamental patterns of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

363
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:27.790
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of human movement that they could </v>

364
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 2>extrapolate out into the future and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was coming.</v>

365
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:33.450
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are very good at detecting </v>

366
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:33.450
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

367
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:33.450
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

368
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Milton I think was of that sort and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think he had intimations of what was </v>

369
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:44.521
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As human rationality became more and </v>

370
00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:47.041
<v Speaker 2>more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technology became more and more </v>

371
00:23:47.041 --> 00:23:47.041
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the intimation</v>

372
00:23:47.041 --> 00:23:49.160
<v Speaker 4>was that we would produce systems that </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispensed with God,</v>

373
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.120
<v Speaker 4>that we're completely rational and </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely total that would immediately </v>

374
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.991
<v Speaker 4>turn everything they touched into </v>
<v Speaker 4>something indistinguishable from hell.</v>

375
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.280
<v Speaker 4>And in Milton's warning was embodied in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the poem,</v>

376
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:08.310
<v Speaker 4>is that the rational mind that generates</v>
<v Speaker 4>a production and then worships it as if </v>

377
00:24:10.421 --> 00:24:15.421
<v Speaker 4>it's absolute immediately occupies hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what does that have to do with the </v>

378
00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.890
<v Speaker 4>Tower of Babel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

379
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.980
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back in 2008,</v>

380
00:24:22.981 --> 00:24:24.760
<v Speaker 4>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

381
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:29.810
<v Speaker 4>when we had that economic collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the strange idea emerged politically and</v>

382
00:24:30.451 --> 00:24:34.920
<v Speaker 4>that was the idea of too big to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought about that idea for a long</v>

383
00:24:34.921 --> 00:24:39.921
<v Speaker 4>time because I thought there's something</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply wrong with that is one of the </v>

384
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:44.631
<v Speaker 4>things that made marks wrong was Marx </v>
<v Speaker 4>believed that capital would flow into </v>

385
00:24:47.911 --> 00:24:52.911
<v Speaker 4>the hands of fewer and fewer people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the dissociation between the rich </v>

386
00:24:53.251 --> 00:24:55.800
<v Speaker 4>and the poor would become more extreme </v>
<v Speaker 4>as capitalism developed.</v>

387
00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.480
<v Speaker 4>And like so many things that mark said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of true.</v>

388
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.500
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of true in that</v>

389
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 4>the distribution of wealth and in fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>the distribution of anything that's </v>

390
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.390
<v Speaker 4>produced follows a peritoneal pattern </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the prieto pattern basically is that</v>

391
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:20.750
<v Speaker 4>a small proportion of people end up with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bulk of the goods and it isn't just </v>

392
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.750
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

393
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:25.410
<v Speaker 4>it's anything that people produce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>creatively ends up in that distribution </v>

394
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.450
<v Speaker 4>and that's actually the economists </v>
<v Speaker 4>called up the matthew principle and they</v>

395
00:25:30.451 --> 00:25:35.451
<v Speaker 4>take that from US statement in the New </v>
<v Speaker 4>Testament and the statement is to those </v>

396
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:36.960
<v Speaker 4>who have everything more will be given </v>
<v Speaker 4>and from those who have nothing.</v>

397
00:25:36.961 --> 00:25:41.961
<v Speaker 4>Everything will be taken and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a map of the manner in which the </v>

398
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:46.881
<v Speaker 4>world manifests itself where human </v>
<v Speaker 4>creative production is involved and the </v>

399
00:25:46.881 --> 00:25:49.740
<v Speaker 4>map seems to indicate that as you start </v>
<v Speaker 4>to produce and you're successful,</v>

400
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:54.060
<v Speaker 4>the probability that you will continue </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be successful or accelerate increases</v>

401
00:25:54.061 --> 00:25:56.410
<v Speaker 4>as you're successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as you fail.</v>

402
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.770
<v Speaker 4>The probability that you will fail </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts to accelerate.</v>

403
00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:03.780
<v Speaker 4>So in your progress through life looks </v>
<v Speaker 4>like this or like this.</v>

404
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.080
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason that Marx was right was </v>

405
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.660
<v Speaker 4>because he noted that as a feature of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the capitalist system,</v>

406
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.870
<v Speaker 4>the reason that he was wrong is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a feature that's specific to a </v>

407
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.831
<v Speaker 4>capitalist system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a feature that's general to all </v>

408
00:26:21.831 --> 00:26:24.810
<v Speaker 4>systems of creative production that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>known and so it's like a natural law and</v>

409
00:26:24.811 --> 00:26:29.811
<v Speaker 4>it's enough of a natural law by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the distribution of wealth can be </v>

410
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:34.611
<v Speaker 4>modeled by physical models using the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same equations that govern the </v>

411
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:35.910
<v Speaker 4>distribution of gas molecules in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>vacuum.</v>

412
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:41.330
<v Speaker 4>So it's a really profound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fundamentally profound </v>

413
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:45.201
<v Speaker 4>observation about the way the world lays</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself out and it's problematic because </v>

414
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:50.270
<v Speaker 4>if resources accrue unfairly to a small </v>
<v Speaker 4>minority of people and there's a natural</v>

415
00:26:55.051 --> 00:27:00.051
<v Speaker 4>law like element to that that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealt with from a social perspective </v>

416
00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:03.180
<v Speaker 4>because if the inequality becomes too </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme,</v>

417
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.360
<v Speaker 4>then the whole system will destabilize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you can have an intelligent </v>

418
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.890
<v Speaker 4>discussion about how to mitigate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>effects of the transfer of creative </v>

419
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.370
<v Speaker 4>production into the hands of a small </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of people.</v>

420
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other reason,</v>

421
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.790
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having said that,</v>

422
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.550
<v Speaker 4>the other reason that Marx was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a number of them.</v>

423
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.610
<v Speaker 4>One is that even though</v>

424
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 4>creative products end up in the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a small number of people,</v>

425
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 4>it's not the same people consistently </v>
<v Speaker 4>across time.</v>

426
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.040
<v Speaker 4>It's the same proportion of people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the same thing.</v>

427
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like imagine that there's water going </v>

428
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:46.640
<v Speaker 4>down a drain and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

429
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 4>look at the spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's permanent.</v>

430
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.180
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

431
00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 4>the spirals permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the water molecules aren't.</v>

432
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:55.461
<v Speaker 4>They're moving through it and it's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same in some sense with the prieto </v>

433
00:27:55.461 --> 00:27:58.791
<v Speaker 4>distribution is that there's a one </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent and there's always a one </v>

434
00:27:58.791 --> 00:27:58.980
<v Speaker 4>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not the same people.</v>

435
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.280
<v Speaker 4>It's the stability of it differs from </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture to culture,</v>

436
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of movement in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>upper one percent,</v>

437
00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:11.790
<v Speaker 4>a tremendous amount of movement and one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the reasons for that movement is that</v>

438
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:16.830
<v Speaker 4>things get large and then they get too </v>
<v Speaker 4>large and then they collapse.</v>

439
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.940
<v Speaker 4>And so in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the politicians said too big to </v>

440
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.961
<v Speaker 4>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got something truly backwards as </v>

441
00:28:26.961 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 4>far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

442
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.310
<v Speaker 4>it was a reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The statement was reversed.</v>

443
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.100
<v Speaker 4>It should have been so big it had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fail.</v>

444
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.120
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I think the story of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tower of Babel is about.</v>

445
00:28:40.121 --> 00:28:45.121
<v Speaker 4>It's a warning against the expansion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the system</v>

446
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.740
<v Speaker 4>until it encompasses everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a warning against totalitarian </v>

447
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.530
<v Speaker 4>presumption.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens,</v>

448
00:28:53.531 --> 00:28:58.531
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people set out to build the Tower </v>

449
00:28:58.531 --> 00:29:01.740
<v Speaker 4>of Babel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is they want to build a structure that </v>

450
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.170
<v Speaker 4>reaches to have it right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is that it can,</v>

451
00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.690
<v Speaker 4>it can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can replace,</v>

452
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.430
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can replace the role of God.</v>

453
00:29:06.431 --> 00:29:11.431
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can erase the distinction between </v>

454
00:29:11.431 --> 00:29:15.420
<v Speaker 4>Earth and heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there's a utopian kind of vision </v>

455
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.971
<v Speaker 4>there as well as we can build a </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure that's so large and </v>

456
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:18.610
<v Speaker 4>encompassing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

457
00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:24.210
<v Speaker 4>that it can replace heaven itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting.</v>

458
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.920
<v Speaker 4>The fact that that doesn't work and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>God objects to it is also </v>

459
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.591
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily interesting and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>indication to me of the unbelievable </v>

460
00:29:32.591 --> 00:29:36.731
<v Speaker 4>profundity of these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I think one thing we should </v>

461
00:29:36.731 --> 00:29:40.381
<v Speaker 4>have learned from the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of course didn't was that there's </v>

462
00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 4>something extraordinary dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarian,</v>

463
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.160
<v Speaker 2>utopian visions at something Dostoevsky </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote about,</v>

464
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:48.430
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his great book notes from underground</v>

465
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:53.460
<v Speaker 2>because Dostoevsky had figured out by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the early 19 hundreds that there was </v>

466
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.320
<v Speaker 2>something very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very pathological about a utopian vision</v>

467
00:29:56.321 --> 00:30:01.321
<v Speaker 2>of perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was profoundly anti human and </v>

468
00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:04.220
<v Speaker 2>and notes and notes from underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He demolishes the notion of Utopia.</v>

469
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.730
<v Speaker 2>One of the things he says that I loved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so brilliant,</v>

470
00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:11.860
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you brought the socialist </v>

471
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.851
<v Speaker 2>utopia into being and dusty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Esq says that human beings had nothing </v>

472
00:30:14.851 --> 00:30:15.970
<v Speaker 2>to do except</v>

473
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.070
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink,</v>

474
00:30:20.071 --> 00:30:23.070
<v Speaker 2>and busy themselves with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuation of the species.</v>

475
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:29.390
<v Speaker 2>He said that the first thing that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen under circumstances like that </v>

476
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:33.270
<v Speaker 2>would be that human beings would go mad </v>
<v Speaker 2>and break the system,</v>

477
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:38.450
<v Speaker 2>smash it just so that something </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected and crazy could happen </v>

478
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.880
<v Speaker 2>because human beings don't want Utopian </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort and certainty.</v>

479
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.450
<v Speaker 2>They want adventure and chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty,</v>

480
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:51.110
<v Speaker 2>and so that the very notion of a utopia </v>
<v Speaker 2>was anti human because we're not built </v>

481
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:55.131
<v Speaker 2>for static utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're built for a dynamic situation </v>

482
00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:02.570
<v Speaker 2>where there's demands placed on us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's the optimal amount of </v>

483
00:31:03.961 --> 00:31:07.380
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

484
00:31:07.381 --> 00:31:12.381
<v Speaker 2>we know what happened in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century as a consequence of the </v>

485
00:31:12.381 --> 00:31:15.681
<v Speaker 2>widespread promulgation of Utopian </v>
<v Speaker 2>schemes and what happened was a ham on a</v>

486
00:31:17.371 --> 00:31:22.371
<v Speaker 2>scale that had never been matched in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire history of humanity and that's </v>

487
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.820
<v Speaker 2>really saying something because</v>

488
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.050
<v Speaker 2>there was plenty of mayhem before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century.</v>

489
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.880
<v Speaker 2>I guess there wasn't as much industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>clout behind it and so,</v>

490
00:31:33.881 --> 00:31:38.470
<v Speaker 2>so early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See so early in the biblical narrative,</v>

491
00:31:38.471 --> 00:31:43.471
<v Speaker 2>you have a warning against Hubris and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some indication that properly </v>

492
00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 2>functioning systems have an appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>scale.</v>

493
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:55.020
<v Speaker 2>I read an article in the Economist </v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine this week about the rise of </v>

494
00:31:55.541 --> 00:32:00.541
<v Speaker 2>nationalist movements all over the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a counterbalance to globalization.</v>

495
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:06.300
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's most market with the European</v>
<v Speaker 2>Economic Community and the economist </v>

496
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.820
<v Speaker 2>writers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're curious about why that counter </v>

497
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.001
<v Speaker 2>movement has been developing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that it's also a </v>

498
00:32:15.001 --> 00:32:19.021
<v Speaker 2>tower of Babel phenomena is that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is most evident in the European </v>

499
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Economic Community to bring all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiplicity under the,</v>

500
00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:34.180
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the umbrella of a single unity is </v>

501
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.320
<v Speaker 2>to similar caneously erect a system </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the top is so far from the bottom </v>

502
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.770
<v Speaker 2>that the bottom has no connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The top,</v>

503
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

504
00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.860
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your social systems have to be large </v>

505
00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.541
<v Speaker 2>enough so they protect you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but small enough so that you have a </v>

506
00:32:49.541 --> 00:32:52.841
<v Speaker 2>place in them and it seems to me perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's happened in places like </v>

507
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:56.810
<v Speaker 2>the EEC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the distance between the typical</v>

508
00:32:56.811 --> 00:33:01.811
<v Speaker 2>citizen and the bureaucracy that runs </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire structure has got so great </v>

509
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:08.350
<v Speaker 2>that it's an element of destabilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and of itself,</v>

510
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:13.361
<v Speaker 2>and so people revert back to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalistic identities because it's </v>

511
00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:19.181
<v Speaker 2>something that they can relate to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

512
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.630
<v Speaker 2>There's a history there and a shared </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>

513
00:33:21.631 --> 00:33:25.710
<v Speaker 2>a genuine identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an identity of language and tradition.</v>

514
00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 2>That's not an artificial imposition from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top and artificial abstract </v>

515
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.791
<v Speaker 2>imposition in in the Egyptian creation </v>
<v Speaker 2>myth.</v>

516
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:48.270
<v Speaker 2>The version I'm familiar most familiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>with in the previous creation myth,</v>

517
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.130
<v Speaker 2>the older one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>

518
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.110
<v Speaker 2>mostly what you see menacing humanity is</v>
<v Speaker 2>tie matt.</v>

519
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.960
<v Speaker 2>She's the dragon of chaos and so that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

520
00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.540
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really mother nature,</v>

521
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:07.110
<v Speaker 2>red in tooth and claw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by the time the Egyptians come </v>

522
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.110
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>

523
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.840
<v Speaker 2>it isn't only nature that threatens </v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

524
00:34:12.841 --> 00:34:17.841
<v Speaker 2>It's the social structure itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the Egyptians had two daddies </v>

525
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:20.220
<v Speaker 2>that represented the social structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one was,</v>

526
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.000
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cyrus,</v>

527
00:34:21.001 --> 00:34:26.001
<v Speaker 2>who was like the spirit of the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a great hero who established </v>

528
00:34:26.001 --> 00:34:30.291
<v Speaker 2>Egypt but became old and and willfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind and and,</v>

529
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.330
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and senile,</v>

530
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:39.020
<v Speaker 2>and he had an evil brother named seth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Seth was always conspiring to </v>

531
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:44.090
<v Speaker 2>overthrow him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because Cyrus ignored him long </v>

532
00:34:44.461 --> 00:34:49.461
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seth did overthrow chopped up into </v>

533
00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:51.570
<v Speaker 2>pieces and distributed all around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom on his son.</v>

534
00:34:51.571 --> 00:34:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Horace had to come back and fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

535
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus's son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horace had to come back and defeat seth </v>

536
00:34:59.090 --> 00:34:59.970
<v Speaker 2>to take the kingdom back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how that story ends.</v>

537
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:05.120
<v Speaker 2>But the Egyptian seem to have realized </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe because they had become </v>

538
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.490
<v Speaker 2>bureaucratized to quite a substantial </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

539
00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:09.600
<v Speaker 2>that it wasn't only nature that </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened humankind.</v>

540
00:35:09.601 --> 00:35:14.520
<v Speaker 2>It was also the proclivity of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations to become too large,</v>

541
00:35:14.521 --> 00:35:19.521
<v Speaker 2>too unwieldy to deceitful and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>willfully blind and therefore liable to </v>

542
00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:22.260
<v Speaker 2>collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

543
00:35:22.261 --> 00:35:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I see echoes of that in this story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Tower of Babel.</v>

544
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's a calling for I kind of humility</v>
<v Speaker 2>of social engineering.</v>

545
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 2>One of the other things I've learned as</v>

546
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.090
<v Speaker 6>a social scientist,</v>

547
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.500
<v Speaker 2>and I've been warned about this by I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say great social scientists,</v>

548
00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:51.070
<v Speaker 2>that you want to be very careful about </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing large scale experimentation with </v>

549
00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:57.851
<v Speaker 2>large scale systems because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that if you implement a </v>

550
00:35:57.861 --> 00:36:02.861
<v Speaker 2>scheme in a large scale social system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that scheme will have the result </v>

551
00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:07.151
<v Speaker 2>you intended is negligible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What will happen will be something that </v>

552
00:36:07.151 --> 00:36:11.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't intend and even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that works at counter purposes</v>

553
00:36:11.001 --> 00:36:15.950
<v Speaker 2>to your original intent and so and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

554
00:36:15.951 --> 00:36:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Because if you have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complex system and you perturb it,</v>

555
00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:26.320
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you can predict the</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of the perturbation is </v>

556
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.570
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously if the system works though,</v>

557
00:36:29.571 --> 00:36:33.470
<v Speaker 2>you think you understand it because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>works and so you think it's simpler than</v>

558
00:36:33.471 --> 00:36:38.471
<v Speaker 2>it actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then you think that you're more </v>

559
00:36:38.471 --> 00:36:38.471
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is correct,</v>

560
00:36:38.471 --> 00:36:42.020
<v Speaker 2>and then you think that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulation of the model which produces</v>

561
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:47.410
<v Speaker 2>the outcome new model will be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome that's actually produced in the </v>

562
00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:48.500
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't work at all.</v>

563
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:55.450
<v Speaker 2>I thought about that an awful lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about how to remediate social </v>

564
00:36:55.450 --> 00:37:00.221
<v Speaker 2>systems because obviously they need </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful attention and adjustment and it </v>

565
00:37:01.221 --> 00:37:02.720
<v Speaker 2>struck me that the proper</v>

566
00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:11.590
<v Speaker 2>strategy for implementing social change </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to stay within your domain of </v>

567
00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:16.571
<v Speaker 2>competence and that requires humility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a virtue that is never</v>

568
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.900
<v Speaker 2>promoted in modern culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's.</v>

569
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:26.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a virtue that you can hardly even </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about,</v>

570
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:31.710
<v Speaker 2>but humility means you probably not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart as you think you are and you </v>

571
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.970
<v Speaker 2>should be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the question might be,</v>

572
00:37:33.971 --> 00:37:34.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

573
00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:38.230
<v Speaker 2>you should be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps you still want to do good,</v>

574
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.740
<v Speaker 2>you want to make some positive changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you be careful and do good?</v>

575
00:37:41.741 --> 00:37:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

576
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you try not to step outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries of your competence and you </v>

577
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.811
<v Speaker 2>start small and you start with things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you actually could adjust that you </v>

578
00:37:51.811 --> 00:37:53.200
<v Speaker 2>actually do understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you actually could fix.</v>

579
00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:58.540
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned to you at one point that one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things Carl Jung said was that </v>

580
00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.030
<v Speaker 2>modern men don't see God because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't look low enough.</v>

581
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:06.620
<v Speaker 2>So very interesting phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that I've been </v>

582
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:11.490
<v Speaker 2>promoting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose online is the idea that you </v>

583
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:16.291
<v Speaker 2>should restrict your attempts to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to what's at hand.</v>

584
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.900
<v Speaker 2>So there's probably things about you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could fix,</v>

585
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that you know that aren't right,</v>

586
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.480
<v Speaker 2>not anyone else's opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own opinion that aren't right.</v>

587
00:38:28.481 --> 00:38:30.400
<v Speaker 2>You can fix them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's some things that you could</v>

588
00:38:30.401 --> 00:38:32.590
<v Speaker 2>adjust in your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although that gets hard.</v>

589
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:38.100
<v Speaker 2>You have to have your act together a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you can to adjust your family </v>

590
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 2>because things can kick back on you </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard and you think,</v>

591
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:40.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to put yourself together.</v>

592
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to put your family </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

593
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Why the hell do you think you can put </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world together?</v>

594
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously the world is more </v>

595
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.030
<v Speaker 2>complicated than you and your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you.</v>

596
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.980
<v Speaker 2>If you're stymied in your attempts even </v>
<v Speaker 2>to set your own house in order,</v>

597
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:59.100
<v Speaker 2>which of course you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you would think that what that </v>

598
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.951
<v Speaker 2>would do would be to make you very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very leery about announcing your broad </v>

599
00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 2>scale plans for social revolution.</v>

600
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a peculiar thing because that isn't</v>

601
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:12.481
<v Speaker 2>how it works because people are much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more likely to announce their plans for </v>

602
00:39:12.481 --> 00:39:15.010
<v Speaker 2>broad scale social revolution than they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are to try to set themselves straight or</v>

603
00:39:15.011 --> 00:39:20.011
<v Speaker 2>to set their family's straight and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the reason for that is that as </v>

604
00:39:20.011 --> 00:39:20.950
<v Speaker 2>soon as they tried to set themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight or their families,</v>

605
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.090
<v Speaker 2>the system immediately kicks back at </v>
<v Speaker 2>them right instantly.</v>

606
00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if they announced their plans </v>
<v Speaker 2>for large scale social revolution,</v>

607
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:34.530
<v Speaker 2>the lag between the announcement and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickback is so long that they don't </v>

608
00:39:35.351 --> 00:39:38.570
<v Speaker 2>recognize that there's any error there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you know,</v>

609
00:39:38.571 --> 00:39:41.020
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with being wrong if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

610
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.340
<v Speaker 2>if nothing falls on you for a while and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

611
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:50.290
<v Speaker 2>and it's also an incitement to hubris </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can now see your,</v>

612
00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:55.980
<v Speaker 2>your plans for large scale social </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution and stand back and you don't </v>

613
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.350
<v Speaker 2>get hit by lightning and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

614
00:39:56.351 --> 00:39:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I might be right even though you're not.</v>

615
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.840
<v Speaker 2>You're seriously not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be right.</v>

616
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:02.890
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

617
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:08.310
<v Speaker 2>how wonderful is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you could do it without </v>

618
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:09.340
<v Speaker 2>any real effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really do think fundamentally,</v>

619
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that's what universities </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach students now.</v>

620
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:17.670
<v Speaker 2>That's what they teach them to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that and I think it's </v>

621
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:21.421
<v Speaker 2>absolutely appalling and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>horribly dangerous because it's not that</v>

622
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:26.290
<v Speaker 2>easy to fix things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you don't.</v>

623
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're not committed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

624
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're committed because what you try</v>

625
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:35.800
<v Speaker 2>to do is you try to straighten out your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own life first and that's enough.</v>

626
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a statement in the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>testament that it's.</v>

627
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in the new testament that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more difficult to rule yourself </v>

628
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 2>than to rule the city and that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphor.</v>

629
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like all of you who've made </v>
<v Speaker 2>announcements to yourself about changing</v>

630
00:40:51.371 --> 00:40:55.240
<v Speaker 2>your diet and going to the gym every </v>
<v Speaker 2>January know perfectly well.</v>

631
00:40:55.241 --> 00:41:00.241
<v Speaker 2>How difficult it is to regulate your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulses and to bring yourself under the</v>

632
00:41:00.641 --> 00:41:04.240
<v Speaker 2>control of some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say?</v>

633
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Well structured and ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attentive structure of values.</v>

634
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:18.750
<v Speaker 2>It's extraordinarily difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people don't do it and instead </v>

635
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:21.811
<v Speaker 2>they wander off and I think they create </v>
<v Speaker 2>towers of Babel and the story indicates,</v>

636
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:28.050
<v Speaker 2>well those things collapse under their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own weight and everyone goes their own </v>

637
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:28.050
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

638
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I think I see that happening with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lgbt community.</v>

639
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I think because one of the things I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed,</v>

640
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:42.311
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community is in some sense it's not a </v>

641
00:41:42.311 --> 00:41:42.620
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

642
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 2>that's a technical error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

643
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:49.250
<v Speaker 2>It's composed of outsiders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

644
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:55.330
<v Speaker 2>and what you notice across the decades </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the acronym list keeps growing </v>

645
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:01.270
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's because there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite number of ways to be an </v>

646
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:04.361
<v Speaker 2>outsider and so once you open the door </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the construction of a group that's </v>

647
00:42:04.941 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 2>characterized by failing to fit into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

648
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:15.310
<v Speaker 2>then you immediately create a category </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's infinitely expandable and so I </v>

649
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:17.810
<v Speaker 2>don't know how long the acronym list is </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

650
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 2>It depends on which acronym list you </v>
<v Speaker 2>consult,</v>

651
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:25.240
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen lists of 10 or more </v>
<v Speaker 2>acronyms and one of the things that's </v>

652
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:31.031
<v Speaker 2>happening is that the community is </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to fragment in its in its </v>

653
00:42:32.211 --> 00:42:37.211
<v Speaker 2>interior because there is no unity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you put a sufficient plurality </v>

654
00:42:37.941 --> 00:42:42.941
<v Speaker 2>under the sheltering structure of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single umbrella,</v>

655
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:47.330
<v Speaker 2>say the disunity starts to appear </v>
<v Speaker 2>within,</v>

656
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:53.020
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's also a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a manifestation of the same issue </v>

657
00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.440
<v Speaker 2>that this particular story is dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

658
00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.140
<v Speaker 2>So that ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

659
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:07.280
<v Speaker 2>the most archaic stories in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the flood story </v>

660
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:12.570
<v Speaker 2>and and also the Tower of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they outline the two fundamental</v>

661
00:43:12.571 --> 00:43:17.040
<v Speaker 2>dangers that be set mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the probability that</v>

662
00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.350
<v Speaker 2>blindness and sin will produce a natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe or entice one.</v>

663
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.190
<v Speaker 2>That's something modern people are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of in principle,</v>

664
00:43:26.191 --> 00:43:31.191
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're all hyper concerned about </v>

665
00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:33.021
<v Speaker 2>environmental degradation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe and so that's the continual </v>

666
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.450
<v Speaker 2>reactivation of an architectural idea in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

667
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:41.990
<v Speaker 2>in our unconscious minds that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about the way we're living </v>

668
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:45.260
<v Speaker 2>that's unsustainable and that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>create a catastrophe and so interesting </v>

669
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.821
<v Speaker 2>because people believe that firmly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply and but they don't see the </v>

670
00:43:49.921 --> 00:43:53.280
<v Speaker 2>relationship between that and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal stories because it's the same</v>

671
00:43:53.281 --> 00:43:57.090
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Overconsumption greed,</v>

672
00:43:57.091 --> 00:44:02.091
<v Speaker 2>all of that is producing an unstable </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and nature will rebel and take us </v>

673
00:44:02.161 --> 00:44:03.030
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

674
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.870
<v Speaker 2>You hear that every day in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspaper and every TV station.</v>

675
00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.310
<v Speaker 2>It's broadcast to you constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that idea is presented in,</v>

676
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:13.620
<v Speaker 2>in Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the story of Noah,</v>

677
00:44:13.621 --> 00:44:17.850
<v Speaker 2>and then the other warning that exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the stories.</v>

678
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 2>One is beware of natural catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's produced as a consequence of </v>

679
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.541
<v Speaker 2>blindness and greed will say the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>is be aware of social structures.</v>

680
00:44:29.051 --> 00:44:34.051
<v Speaker 2>That overreach because it'll also </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce fragmentation and </v>

681
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:35.720
<v Speaker 2>disintegration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's quite remarkable.</v>

682
00:44:35.721 --> 00:44:40.721
<v Speaker 2>I think that that with at the close of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of the Tower of Babel,</v>

683
00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.960
<v Speaker 2>we've got both of the permanent </v>
<v Speaker 2>existential dangers that present </v>

684
00:44:48.261 --> 00:44:51.230
<v Speaker 2>themselves to humanity already </v>
<v Speaker 2>identified</v>

685
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.260
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the story of Adam and eve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a fall into history,</v>

686
00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:07.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in one way history begins with the </v>

687
00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:07.090
<v Speaker 2>fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's like a second fall,</v>

688
00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I think with the flood in the Tower of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Babel and history in even more real </v>

689
00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:16.791
<v Speaker 2>sense begins now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It begins with the story of Abraham and </v>

690
00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:17.220
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

691
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:21.420
<v Speaker 2>We're no longer precisely in the realm </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the purely mythical.</v>

692
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 2>That would be another way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

693
00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.060
<v Speaker 2>We have identifiable person who's part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an identifiable tribe,</v>

694
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:32.061
<v Speaker 2>who's doing identifiable things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in the realm of history and so </v>

695
00:45:32.061 --> 00:45:32.970
<v Speaker 2>history begins twice in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament.</v>

696
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it begins again after Moses as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

697
00:45:36.361 --> 00:45:41.361
<v Speaker 2>but we've moved out of the domain of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>purely mythical into the realm of </v>

698
00:45:41.361 --> 00:45:44.460
<v Speaker 2>history with the emergence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories about Abraham.</v>

699
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:51.020
<v Speaker 2>This is from Elvis Huxley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing that that I want to </v>

700
00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.931
<v Speaker 2>talk about in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abrahamic stories is this idea of the </v>

701
00:45:53.931 --> 00:45:55.440
<v Speaker 2>experience of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Abraham,</v>

702
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:59.280
<v Speaker 2>although quite identifiable as an actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

703
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:05.660
<v Speaker 2>is also characterized by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>peculiarity and the peculiarity is that </v>

704
00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.920
<v Speaker 2>God manifests himself to Abraham.</v>

705
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Both has a voice and but also as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>presence.</v>

706
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:17.210
<v Speaker 2>The story is never described exactly how</v>
<v Speaker 2>God manifests himself except now and </v>

707
00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 2>then he comes in the form of an angel </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fairly concrete,</v>

708
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's a funny thing that the author </v>
<v Speaker 2>of or authors of the Abrahamic stories </v>

709
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:31.250
<v Speaker 2>seems to take the idea that God would </v>
<v Speaker 2>make an appearance more or less for </v>

710
00:46:32.551 --> 00:46:36.300
<v Speaker 2>granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's very.</v>

711
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I think the part of the reason that I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggled so much with the abrahamic </v>

712
00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.201
<v Speaker 2>stories is because it's so hard to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>handle on that and to understand what </v>

713
00:46:45.201 --> 00:46:48.351
<v Speaker 2>that might mean and so I'm going to hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>it from a bunch of different </v>

714
00:46:48.351 --> 00:46:51.681
<v Speaker 2>perspectives and we'll see if we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with some understanding of it.</v>

715
00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:58.730
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I'll do is tell you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story about female neurologist whose </v>

716
00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:05.301
<v Speaker 2>name escapes me at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wrote a book called my stroke of </v>

717
00:47:05.301 --> 00:47:05.970
<v Speaker 2>insight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jill bolte a I think is her name,</v>

718
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:10.680
<v Speaker 2>and she was a harvard trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was.</v>

719
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.430
<v Speaker 2>She had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had medical training from Harvard in</v>

720
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.700
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological function and knew a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot about hemispheric specialization.</v>

721
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 2>We talked a little bit about hemispheric</v>
<v Speaker 2>specialization before.</v>

722
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:26.390
<v Speaker 2>One of the ways of conceptualizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between the two hemispheres </v>

723
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:30.771
<v Speaker 2>is that the left hemisphere operates in </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown territory and the right </v>

724
00:47:30.771 --> 00:47:30.771
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere operates in unknown</v>

725
00:47:30.771 --> 00:47:35.250
<v Speaker 4>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one way of thinking about or the </v>

726
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:35.530
<v Speaker 4>left hemisphere operates in the orderly </v>
<v Speaker 4>domain.</v>

727
00:47:35.531 --> 00:47:40.531
<v Speaker 4>In the right hemisphere operates in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaotic domain or the left hemisphere </v>

728
00:47:40.531 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 4>operates in the domain of detail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the right hemisphere operates in the</v>

729
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:47.290
<v Speaker 4>domain of the large picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>

730
00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.780
<v Speaker 4>Now people differ in their neurological </v>
<v Speaker 4>wiring,</v>

731
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:53.320
<v Speaker 4>so those are over generalizations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's okay.</v>

732
00:47:53.321 --> 00:47:55.030
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll live with that for the time being.</v>

733
00:47:55.180 --> 00:48:00.180
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly not an overgeneralization</v>
<v Speaker 4>to point out that you do in fact have </v>

734
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 4>two hemispheres and that their </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures differ and if the connections</v>

735
00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:03.880
<v Speaker 4>between the market which could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

736
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:05.830
<v Speaker 4>if you had surgery for intractable </v>
<v Speaker 4>epilepsy,</v>

737
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:11.040
<v Speaker 4>that each hemisphere would be capable of</v>
<v Speaker 4>housing its own consciousness that's </v>

738
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.271
<v Speaker 4>been well documented by a neural neural </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurologist named [inaudible] who did </v>

739
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.620
<v Speaker 4>and Sperry who did split brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiments must be 30 years ago now,</v>

740
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:26.580
<v Speaker 4>so and we know that the right and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>left hemisphere are specialized for </v>

741
00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:26.950
<v Speaker 4>different functions.</v>

742
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 4>The Right Hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

743
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 4>seems to be more involved in </v>
<v Speaker 4>degeneration of negative emotion and the</v>

744
00:48:31.391 --> 00:48:36.391
<v Speaker 4>left hemisphere more involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>generation of positive emotion and </v>

745
00:48:36.391 --> 00:48:36.940
<v Speaker 4>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the right hemisphere stops you in the</v>

746
00:48:36.941 --> 00:48:38.350
<v Speaker 4>left hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moves you forward.</v>

747
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:42.130
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jill Bolty,</v>

748
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:48.030
<v Speaker 4>I hope I've got that right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had a stroke and maintained </v>

749
00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:52.981
<v Speaker 4>consciousness during the stroke and </v>
<v Speaker 4>analyzed it while it was happening and </v>

750
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:54.490
<v Speaker 4>she was able.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

751
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:59.491
<v Speaker 4>it was happening to hypothesize about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what part of her brain was being </v>

752
00:48:59.491 --> 00:49:03.991
<v Speaker 4>destroyed and what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she had a congenital blood vessel </v>

753
00:49:03.991 --> 00:49:07.840
<v Speaker 4>malformation and had an aneurysm and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>just about killed her.</v>

754
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.520
<v Speaker 4>But she said that it affected her left </v>
<v Speaker 4>hemisphere and she said that she </v>

755
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:21.121
<v Speaker 4>experienced a sense of divine unity as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>consequence of the stroke because the </v>

756
00:49:21.761 --> 00:49:26.761
<v Speaker 4>left hemisphere function was disrupted </v>
<v Speaker 4>and destroyed and so she became a right </v>

757
00:49:26.761 --> 00:49:31.051
<v Speaker 4>hemisphere dominant and her experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that was the disillusion of the </v>

758
00:49:31.051 --> 00:49:35.020
<v Speaker 4>specific ego into the into absolute </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>

759
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

760
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:41.550
<v Speaker 4>Now that's only a case study and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to make too much of case </v>

761
00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:45.511
<v Speaker 4>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is an overwhelming amount of </v>

762
00:49:45.511 --> 00:49:47.860
<v Speaker 4>evidence that those two kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness exist.</v>

763
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:53.520
<v Speaker 4>One being your consciousness of you as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>localized and specified being and the </v>

764
00:49:55.541 --> 00:50:00.541
<v Speaker 4>other being this capacity to experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>oceanic disillusion and the sense of the</v>

765
00:50:03.521 --> 00:50:08.521
<v Speaker 4>cosmos being one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now why we have those capacities for </v>

766
00:50:09.281 --> 00:50:14.281
<v Speaker 4>different conscious experiences is very </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult to understand.</v>

767
00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:19.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of me thinks that maybe we have a </v>

768
00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:23.011
<v Speaker 4>generic human brain that's the brain of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the species and allied with that.</v>

769
00:50:24.791 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 4>We have a specific individual brain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>one is the left hemisphere and the other</v>

770
00:50:29.181 --> 00:50:34.181
<v Speaker 4>is the right hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the left hemisphere of being the </v>

771
00:50:34.181 --> 00:50:35.981
<v Speaker 4>specific individual brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and usually it's on and working because </v>

772
00:50:35.981 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 4>you obviously have to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself as a specific entity and not as</v>

773
00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:41.570
<v Speaker 4>a generalized cosmic phenomena.</v>

774
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:46.160
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to dice salary when you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>generalized cosmic phenomena,</v>

775
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:51.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to be more pointed than </v>

776
00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:51.730
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

777
00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:51.730
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's make no mistake about it.</v>

778
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:56.870
<v Speaker 4>The fact that those different states of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness exist is not disputable.</v>

779
00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:00.530
<v Speaker 4>They can be elicited in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways,</v>

780
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:06.370
<v Speaker 4>and so I'm going to read you something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Elvis Huxley wrote about this back </v>

781
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:10.750
<v Speaker 4>I think in 1956.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was after he started his </v>

782
00:51:12.531 --> 00:51:17.531
<v Speaker 4>experimentation with masculine because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychedelics were introduced into </v>

783
00:51:17.531 --> 00:51:20.330
<v Speaker 4>Western culture in the 19 fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole bunch of different ways.</v>

784
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Siliciden mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lsd was discovered right at the end of </v>

785
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:29.471
<v Speaker 4>World War II was discovered by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually Laboratory sandow was labs.</v>

786
00:51:29.811 --> 00:51:34.811
<v Speaker 4>The guy who discovered it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Albert Hoffman had spilled some on his </v>

787
00:51:34.811 --> 00:51:34.910
<v Speaker 4>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can absorb it through your skin,</v>

788
00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.960
<v Speaker 4>and he was biking home and had the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world's first LSD trip,</v>

789
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:43.280
<v Speaker 4>which was somewhat of a shock to him and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then to the entire world.</v>

790
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.820
<v Speaker 4>Huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a great literary figure,</v>

791
00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:51.840
<v Speaker 4>a real genius.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm experimented with masculine in the </v>

792
00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.811
<v Speaker 4>late fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he wrote a book called the doors of </v>

793
00:51:55.811 --> 00:51:58.931
<v Speaker 4>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which had a huge impact on the emerging </v>

794
00:51:58.931 --> 00:51:59.560
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both on the east coast,</v>

795
00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:03.300
<v Speaker 4>at Harvard and on the West Coast with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ken keyes.</v>

796
00:52:03.301 --> 00:52:05.960
<v Speaker 4>He and his merry pranksters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who popularized lsd.</v>

797
00:52:05.961 --> 00:52:08.840
<v Speaker 4>That's all documented in a book called </v>
<v Speaker 4>the electric koolaid acid test,</v>

798
00:52:08.841 --> 00:52:11.510
<v Speaker 4>which I would highly recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Tom Wolf.</v>

799
00:52:11.511 --> 00:52:13.820
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliant book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on east coast.</v>

800
00:52:13.821 --> 00:52:18.821
<v Speaker 4>It was timothy leary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had timothy leary's old job at </v>

801
00:52:18.821 --> 00:52:19.910
<v Speaker 4>Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that was kind of cool,</v>

802
00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:21.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>warped way.</v>

803
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:26.650
<v Speaker 4>So I met people there who knew him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who didn't think much of them also,</v>

804
00:52:26.691 --> 00:52:31.100
<v Speaker 4>but who did know him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Huxley had this masculine experience</v>

805
00:52:31.101 --> 00:52:35.510
<v Speaker 4>and it transported him to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>alternative consciousness.</v>

806
00:52:35.511 --> 00:52:40.511
<v Speaker 4>And he said that during his masculine </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience that the entire world glowed </v>

807
00:52:40.511 --> 00:52:40.730
<v Speaker 4>from within.</v>

808
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:43.880
<v Speaker 4>Like if there was an inner light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a paradisical inner light,</v>

809
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:49.180
<v Speaker 4>and then everything was deeply </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningful and symbolically suggestive </v>

810
00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.530
<v Speaker 4>and overwhelming and beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 4>timeless,</v>

811
00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.860
<v Speaker 4>so he had an experience of divine </v>
<v Speaker 4>eternity,</v>

812
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:59.420
<v Speaker 4>I suppose is this most straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 4>way to to put that and we know perfectly</v>

813
00:52:59.421 --> 00:53:03.950
<v Speaker 4>well that the psychedelic drugs that all</v>
<v Speaker 4>share the same chemical structure,</v>

814
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:06.530
<v Speaker 4>they interact with the brain chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>called Serotonin,</v>

815
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.200
<v Speaker 4>which is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very fundamental neurotransmitter.</v>

816
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:13.550
<v Speaker 4>They all have approximately the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>range of effects,</v>

817
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:19.510
<v Speaker 4>although those effects are very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a very large multitude of </v>

818
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:21.350
<v Speaker 4>effects that that sort of exists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Underneath that umbrella.</v>

819
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.080
<v Speaker 4>Huxley was</v>

820
00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:30.170
<v Speaker 4>staggered by his masculine experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

821
00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:35.320
<v Speaker 4>he didn't really know what to make of it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that that's the common </v>

822
00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 4>experience of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 4>exceptionally profound psychedelic </v>

823
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.970
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'll,</v>

824
00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:45.060
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you some documentation about </v>

825
00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:45.940
<v Speaker 4>that in a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he spent quite a long time trying to</v>

826
00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:49.480
<v Speaker 4>come to grips with what this might mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>from an intellectual perspective.</v>

827
00:53:49.481 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 4>And Huxley had a great brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

828
00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.740
<v Speaker 4>if someone was going to wrestle with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem like that,</v>

829
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.950
<v Speaker 4>he was a good candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He must've had a verbal Iq of 180,</v>

830
00:53:56.951 --> 00:54:00.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His books are incredibly literate,</v>

831
00:54:00.551 --> 00:54:05.551
<v Speaker 4>incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible mastery of language and </v>

832
00:54:05.551 --> 00:54:07.030
<v Speaker 4>complexity of characterization and and </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual discourse.</v>

833
00:54:07.031 --> 00:54:12.031
<v Speaker 4>Really remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is what Huxley had to say after </v>

834
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:16.741
<v Speaker 4>his masculine experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He talked about heaven and hell and he </v>

835
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:20.281
<v Speaker 4>talked about that in reference to bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>trips essentially because it was known </v>

836
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:25.170
<v Speaker 4>by that point that a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience could transport you to an </v>

837
00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:29.881
<v Speaker 4>ecstatic domain of divine revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but could take you to the worst </v>

838
00:54:29.881 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 4>imaginable place as well.</v>

839
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:35.660
<v Speaker 4>And Huxley was very interested in why </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would even have the capacity for </v>

840
00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:39.901
<v Speaker 4>experiences like that and which I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a very good question and it's </v>

841
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:40.230
<v Speaker 4>completely unanswered question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

842
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:45.330
<v Speaker 4>we don't know much about consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we know even less about </v>

843
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.481
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say they are an absolute </v>

844
00:54:48.481 --> 00:54:51.481
<v Speaker 4>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we understand them in the </v>

845
00:54:51.481 --> 00:54:54.151
<v Speaker 4>least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huxley did a good job of starting to at </v>

846
00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:54.850
<v Speaker 4>least map out the mysteries of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrain.</v>

847
00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:59.940
<v Speaker 4>He said like the earth of 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our minds still has its darkest </v>

848
00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:00.010
<v Speaker 4>Africa's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's unmapped,</v>

849
00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:05.070
<v Speaker 4>bordeauxs and Amazonian basins in </v>
<v Speaker 4>relation to the fauna of these regions.</v>

850
00:55:05.711 --> 00:55:10.711
<v Speaker 4>We are not yet zoologists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are mere naturalists and collectors </v>

851
00:55:10.711 --> 00:55:12.040
<v Speaker 4>of specimens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact is unfortunate,</v>

852
00:55:12.041 --> 00:55:14.680
<v Speaker 4>but we have to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to make the best of it.</v>

853
00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:20.730
<v Speaker 4>However lowly the work of the collector </v>
<v Speaker 4>must be done before we can proceed to </v>

854
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:22.030
<v Speaker 4>the higher scientific tasks of </v>
<v Speaker 4>classification,</v>

855
00:55:22.031 --> 00:55:27.031
<v Speaker 4>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment and theory making like the </v>

856
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:27.031
<v Speaker 4>giraffe and the duck billed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Platypus.</v>

857
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:31.830
<v Speaker 4>The creatures inhabiting these remoter </v>
<v Speaker 4>regions of the mind are exceedingly </v>

858
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:33.070
<v Speaker 4>improbable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nevertheless,</v>

859
00:55:33.071 --> 00:55:38.071
<v Speaker 4>the exists they're facts of observation </v>
<v Speaker 4>and as such they cannot be ignored by </v>

860
00:55:38.071 --> 00:55:40.840
<v Speaker 4>anyone who was honestly trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand the world in which he lives.</v>

861
00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:51.310
<v Speaker 4>When psychiatrist started to study lsd </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was mostly in the late fifties and </v>

862
00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:56.420
<v Speaker 4>running forward from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they thought about the drug has a </v>

863
00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.500
<v Speaker 4>psychotomimetic which was a chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>substance that would induce psychosis,</v>

864
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:06.130
<v Speaker 4>but that turned out to not be true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not with the psychedelics because </v>

865
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:11.500
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia were given lsd and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia reported that while the </v>

866
00:56:12.771 --> 00:56:16.730
<v Speaker 4>experience experience with certainly </v>
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily strange,</v>

867
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:21.890
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like being schizophrenia and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then it was found later that if you gave</v>

868
00:56:21.891 --> 00:56:24.790
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia amphetamines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that made them worse.</v>

869
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:29.410
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can induce a paranoid psychosis in a</v>

870
00:56:29.411 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 4>normal person by overdosing them with </v>
<v Speaker 4>amphetamines,</v>

871
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.320
<v Speaker 4>so whatever the hallucinogens or </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics are doing,</v>

872
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:40.740
<v Speaker 4>it's not the same thing as mania and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the same thing as </v>

873
00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:40.740
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia.</v>

874
00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

875
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:55.290
<v Speaker 4>so you can't just write the experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>off as and induced psychosis,</v>

876
00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:02.040
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>independent of its utility or lack </v>

877
00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:02.040
<v Speaker 4>thereof.</v>

878
00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:03.270
<v Speaker 3>It's not that</v>

879
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:09.260
<v Speaker 4>now it can be induced by drugs can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>induced by deprivation,</v>

880
00:57:09.261 --> 00:57:09.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

881
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.240
<v Speaker 4>there are accounts throughout history of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people putting themselves in the extreme</v>

882
00:57:14.241 --> 00:57:18.920
<v Speaker 4>physiological situations in order to </v>
<v Speaker 4>induce transformations of consciousness.</v>

883
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:21.530
<v Speaker 4>Fasting is one of the routes to doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

884
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:26.660
<v Speaker 4>Dancing is another root isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prolonged periods of isolation will also</v>

885
00:57:26.661 --> 00:57:30.470
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you could say that exposing yourself</v>

886
00:57:30.471 --> 00:57:35.471
<v Speaker 4>to any of those nxs produces a state </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's in distinguishable from illness </v>

887
00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:42.100
<v Speaker 4>and that there's no reason to assume </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the phenomena that are associated </v>

888
00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.410
<v Speaker 4>with illness have any utility </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever.</v>

889
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.870
<v Speaker 4>Although it's interesting to me that</v>

890
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:55.260
<v Speaker 4>a disrupted consciousness can produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>coherent experiences.</v>

891
00:57:55.261 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 4>It's not exactly what you'd expect if it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was just an illness.</v>

892
00:57:57.491 --> 00:57:58.440
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you develop,</v>

893
00:57:58.441 --> 00:58:03.441
<v Speaker 4>say a high fever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your experience isn't transcendent and </v>

894
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:09.421
<v Speaker 4>coherent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fragmented in pathologized and and </v>

895
00:58:09.421 --> 00:58:10.590
<v Speaker 4>the difference I think is quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinct.</v>

896
00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:16.280
<v Speaker 4>Although we don't only.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to only speculate about </v>

897
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.621
<v Speaker 4>that because there's been enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>experimental work done now with with </v>

898
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:20.400
<v Speaker 4>hallucinogens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelics to indicate that the notion</v>

899
00:58:20.401 --> 00:58:25.401
<v Speaker 4>that what they produce is something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's only akin to pathology is wrong </v>

900
00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:30.220
<v Speaker 4>because it's not a matter of opinion at </v>
<v Speaker 4>this point in the sequence of scientific</v>

901
00:58:30.871 --> 00:58:32.610
<v Speaker 4>and historical investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

902
00:58:32.611 --> 00:58:35.730
<v Speaker 4>there was a large scale study done 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>

903
00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:38.640
<v Speaker 4>five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of 200,000</v>

904
00:58:38.641 --> 00:58:43.641
<v Speaker 4>people who had experimented with </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics and they were mentally and </v>

905
00:58:43.641 --> 00:58:46.170
<v Speaker 4>physically healthier than people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>hadn't on virtually every parameter.</v>

906
00:58:46.171 --> 00:58:50.280
<v Speaker 4>They examined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact the rate of flashbacks.</v>

907
00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:54.360
<v Speaker 4>You heard of LSD flashbacks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that mostly a hypothetical phenomena,</v>

908
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:59.630
<v Speaker 4>but the rate of self reported flashbacks</v>
<v Speaker 4>was higher among the non psychedelic </v>

909
00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:02.940
<v Speaker 4>users that among the psychedelic users,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that was very interesting.</v>

910
00:59:02.941 --> 00:59:04.620
<v Speaker 4>It was a huge study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it might be,</v>

911
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:09.680
<v Speaker 4>you could say that those who had </v>
<v Speaker 4>experimented with psychedelics were </v>

912
00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:13.551
<v Speaker 4>prone to be healthier to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that still contradicts the pathology</v>

913
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:16.200
<v Speaker 4>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't matter either way.</v>

914
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.690
<v Speaker 4>The pathology argument is contradicted</v>

915
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:19.990
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

916
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't put that in.</v>

917
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:28.160
<v Speaker 2>It was Dr Jill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jill Bolte Taylor.</v>

918
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.880
<v Speaker 2>This is what she said about her stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that first day of the stroke </v>

919
00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.930
<v Speaker 2>with terrific bittersweetness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the absence of the normal functioning</v>

920
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:41.080
<v Speaker 2>of my left orientation association area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my perception of my physical boundaries </v>

921
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.220
<v Speaker 2>was no longer limited to where my skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>met air.</v>

922
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 2>I felt like a genie liberated from its </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle.</v>

923
00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:51.780
<v Speaker 2>It's a good metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The energy of my spirit seemed to flow </v>

924
00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.870
<v Speaker 2>like a great whale gliding through a sea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of silent euphoria.</v>

925
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:59.050
<v Speaker 2>The absence of physical boundary was one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of glorious bliss recently.</v>

926
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.860
<v Speaker 2>It's Dr Roland Griffith.</v>

927
01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:11.880
<v Speaker 2>I met him once at a conference in San </v>
<v Speaker 2>Francisco.</v>

928
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise.</v>

929
01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I conference on awe and this was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was embarking on his experiments</v>

930
01:00:18.571 --> 01:00:23.571
<v Speaker 2>with Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were the first experiments on </v>

931
01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:26.451
<v Speaker 2>hallucinogens that were permitted by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Institute of Mental Health in </v>

932
01:00:26.551 --> 01:00:28.440
<v Speaker 2>some three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four decades.</v>

933
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:31.770
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had to be very careful to lay out the</v>

934
01:00:31.771 --> 01:00:36.090
<v Speaker 2>scientific protocols so that the ethics </v>
<v Speaker 2>committees would approve the experiments</v>

935
01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:41.091
<v Speaker 2>and so that the federal funding agencies</v>
<v Speaker 2>would also allow the experiments to go </v>

936
01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:45.531
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started to experiment with silicide </v>

937
01:00:45.531 --> 01:00:49.150
<v Speaker 2>man and he's found a number of and </v>
<v Speaker 2>published a number of very interesting </v>

938
01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:55.010
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was that a single siliciden trip and</v>

939
01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:03.170
<v Speaker 2>I specify trip because sometimes when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people take psilocybin at the doses that</v>

940
01:01:03.601 --> 01:01:08.601
<v Speaker 2>griffith uses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a psychedelic </v>

941
01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:09.210
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people who take the dose do,</v>

942
01:01:09.211 --> 01:01:14.211
<v Speaker 2>but not everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those who take the dos and don't have </v>

943
01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:17.541
<v Speaker 2>the mystical experience don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced the consequences of taking </v>

944
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:20.480
<v Speaker 2>the drug and the consequences can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite profound,</v>

945
01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.840
<v Speaker 2>so one consequence is that if you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mystical experience that's </v>

946
01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.850
<v Speaker 2>associated with suicide than ingestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're liable to</v>

947
01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:34.970
<v Speaker 2>represent that to others and yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the two or three most important </v>

948
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:39.471
<v Speaker 2>experiences of your entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would be at the same level as </v>

949
01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.790
<v Speaker 2>the birth of your child or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage,</v>

950
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:45.120
<v Speaker 2>let's say assuming that those were </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent experiences,</v>

951
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:46.140
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

952
01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:52.790
<v Speaker 2>but that's how people describe them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's very interesting in and of </v>

953
01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:56.121
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the next thing that griffith,</v>

954
01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:01.700
<v Speaker 2>another thing that Griffith reported was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one year after a silicide than dose</v>

955
01:02:03.031 --> 01:02:06.660
<v Speaker 2>a single psilocybin dose profound enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>to induce a mystical experience,</v>

956
01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:12.110
<v Speaker 2>that trait openness of the participants </v>
<v Speaker 2>had increased one standard deviation,</v>

957
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:17.870
<v Speaker 2>which is a tremendous amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it looked like one dose produced </v>

958
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:18.720
<v Speaker 2>a permanent neurological and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological.</v>

959
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm not saying that that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

960
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that openness is a n troubled </v>

961
01:02:29.601 --> 01:02:34.601
<v Speaker 2>blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly a testament to the </v>

962
01:02:34.601 --> 01:02:35.480
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable potency of the of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

963
01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:38.780
<v Speaker 2>There's about a 10 percent chance by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

964
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:41.570
<v Speaker 2>with suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ingestion of a trip to hell,</v>

965
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:46.870
<v Speaker 2>and so that's certainly something very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much worth considering when you're </v>

966
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:50.690
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the potential effects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of experience.</v>

967
01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.680
<v Speaker 2>So the mystical experience produced by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Psilocybin is rated by people as the </v>

968
01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.121
<v Speaker 2>most profound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among the most profound experience of </v>

969
01:03:04.121 --> 01:03:06.191
<v Speaker 2>their life as life changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It produces permanent personality </v>

970
01:03:06.191 --> 01:03:09.350
<v Speaker 2>transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 five percent success in smoking </v>

971
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:10.310
<v Speaker 2>cessation with a single dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

972
01:03:10.311 --> 01:03:12.380
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that griffiths </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated.</v>

973
01:03:12.381 --> 01:03:17.381
<v Speaker 2>Now that is mind boggling because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are chemical treatments for smoking </v>

974
01:03:17.381 --> 01:03:21.170
<v Speaker 2>cessation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buproprion is one.</v>

975
01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:27.220
<v Speaker 2>It reduces craving to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's success rate is nowhere near 85</v>

976
01:03:29.301 --> 01:03:32.510
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly not with a single dose,</v>

977
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:38.000
<v Speaker 2>and so we don't understand how it can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that occurs,</v>

978
01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:43.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's nicely documented by Griffith </v>
<v Speaker 2>team in this experiment he gave </v>

979
01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Psilocybin to people who are dying of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

980
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Cancer patients often develop chronic </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinically significant symptoms of </v>

981
01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.401
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Previous study suggested Siliciden may </v>

982
01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.760
<v Speaker 2>decrease depression and anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer patients.</v>

983
01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.760
<v Speaker 2>Aldous Huxley took Lsd on his death bed </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

984
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:08.630
<v Speaker 2>so the idea that there was something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about psychedelic substances that could </v>

985
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:17.090
<v Speaker 2>buffer people against the catastrophes </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mortality is an idea that's as old as</v>

986
01:04:18.091 --> 01:04:22.980
<v Speaker 2>experimentation with the drug itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The effects of Siliciden were studied in</v>

987
01:04:22.981 --> 01:04:27.740
<v Speaker 2>51 cancer patients with life threatening</v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosis and symptoms of depression and</v>

988
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 2>or anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unsurprisingly,</v>

989
01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know if it's reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>to describe the emotional state of </v>

990
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:43.681
<v Speaker 2>people diagnosed with cancer of </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertain prognosis or mortal </v>

991
01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:47.170
<v Speaker 2>significance as depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>

992
01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:52.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean is that if you go </v>

993
01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:53.710
<v Speaker 2>to the doctor and he tells you that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have intractable fatal cancer,</v>

994
01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:57.910
<v Speaker 2>the normative response is to be rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset and anxious about that,</v>

995
01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:03.420
<v Speaker 2>and so it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that bothers me about </v>

996
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.721
<v Speaker 2>clinical psychiatry and clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology is the automatic </v>

997
01:05:06.721 --> 01:05:09.451
<v Speaker 2>presupposition that even overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 2>states of negative emotion are properly </v>

998
01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:13.411
<v Speaker 2>categorized as depression because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think you're depressed when you </v>

999
01:05:13.411 --> 01:05:16.831
<v Speaker 2>get a cancer diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the right way to </v>

1000
01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you have a big and</v>

1001
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 4>it's not surprising that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>overwhelmed by negative emotion and to </v>

1002
01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:23.920
<v Speaker 4>think about that as a psychiatric </v>
<v Speaker 4>malfunction is a major error,</v>

1003
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.520
<v Speaker 4>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a side issue with regards to this </v>

1004
01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.001
<v Speaker 4>study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The effects of Psilocybin were studied </v>

1005
01:05:33.001 --> 01:05:37.441
<v Speaker 4>in 51 cancer patients with life </v>
<v Speaker 4>threatening diagnosis and symptoms of </v>

1006
01:05:37.441 --> 01:05:40.891
<v Speaker 4>depression and or anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cannot imagine how they got this </v>

1007
01:05:40.891 --> 01:05:43.000
<v Speaker 4>through an ethics committee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just we're going to take people who</v>

1008
01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:48.001
<v Speaker 4>have uncertain diagnosis of cancer that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are potentially life threatening and </v>

1009
01:05:48.001 --> 01:05:48.940
<v Speaker 4>we're going to give them psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1010
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.390
<v Speaker 4>but they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did it and I think it's a testament</v>

1011
01:05:52.391 --> 01:05:57.340
<v Speaker 4>to griffiths stature as a researcher </v>
<v Speaker 4>that that that was allowable.</v>

1012
01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.580
<v Speaker 4>This was a randomized double blind </v>
<v Speaker 4>crossover trial.</v>

1013
01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 4>Very carefully designed clinical </v>
<v Speaker 4>investigation.</v>

1014
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:09.300
<v Speaker 4>People were assigned to the treatment </v>
<v Speaker 4>group or the drug group or the non drug </v>

1015
01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.051
<v Speaker 4>group randomly blindly and investigated </v>
<v Speaker 4>the effects of the drug.</v>

1016
01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:19.830
<v Speaker 4>Also with different doses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is another hallmark of a well </v>

1017
01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:22.241
<v Speaker 4>designed pharmacological study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very low placebo like dos one or three </v>

1018
01:06:22.271 --> 01:06:27.271
<v Speaker 4>milligrams per 70 kilograms of body </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight versus a high dose 22 or 30 </v>

1019
01:06:27.271 --> 01:06:31.621
<v Speaker 4>milligrams per 70 kilograms of of </v>
<v Speaker 4>siliciden chemical psilocybin </v>

1020
01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:36.810
<v Speaker 4>administered and counterbalance sequence</v>
<v Speaker 4>with five weeks between sessions in a </v>

1021
01:06:36.810 --> 01:06:40.291
<v Speaker 4>six month follow up instruction to </v>
<v Speaker 4>participants and staff minimized the </v>

1022
01:06:41.471 --> 01:06:44.770
<v Speaker 4>effects of expectancy participants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>staff and community observers,</v>

1023
01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:49.771
<v Speaker 4>rated participant moods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>attitudes and behaviors throughout the </v>

1024
01:06:49.771 --> 01:06:52.951
<v Speaker 4>study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's also the hallmark of a well </v>

1025
01:06:52.951 --> 01:06:55.321
<v Speaker 4>designed study because they didn't rely </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a single source of information for </v>

1026
01:06:55.321 --> 01:06:55.420
<v Speaker 4>the outcome data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1027
01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:56.950
<v Speaker 4>They got self reports,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fine,</v>

1028
01:06:56.951 --> 01:07:01.951
<v Speaker 4>but they had relatively objective </v>
<v Speaker 4>observers also gather data at the same </v>

1029
01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:06.241
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high dose psilocybin produced large </v>

1030
01:07:06.241 --> 01:07:09.721
<v Speaker 4>decreases in clinician and self related </v>
<v Speaker 4>measures of depressed mood and anxiety </v>

1031
01:07:09.721 --> 01:07:13.950
<v Speaker 4>along with increases in quality of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life meaning and optimism and decreases </v>

1032
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:16.780
<v Speaker 4>in death anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting.</v>

1033
01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:20.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a subtle and scientifically spar </v>
<v Speaker 4>statement,</v>

1034
01:07:20.651 --> 01:07:25.651
<v Speaker 4>but it's a very interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the in there's a.</v>

1035
01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:28.630
<v Speaker 4>there's an intimation of a causal </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship here,</v>

1036
01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.740
<v Speaker 4>increases in quality of life life </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning and decreases in death,</v>

1037
01:07:32.741 --> 01:07:33.400
<v Speaker 4>anxiety.</v>

1038
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:41.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the intimation there is that one of the </v>

1039
01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:42.580
<v Speaker 4>ways of decreasing your anxiety about </v>
<v Speaker 4>death is to increase the felt meaning in</v>

1040
01:07:42.581 --> 01:07:46.990
<v Speaker 4>your life and the psilocybin dose just </v>
<v Speaker 4>potentiate that,</v>

1041
01:07:46.991 --> 01:07:51.991
<v Speaker 4>but it's a good thing to know in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>general manner if it happens to be a </v>

1042
01:07:51.991 --> 01:07:52.000
<v Speaker 4>generalizable truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1043
01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:55.480
<v Speaker 4>If you're terrified of mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrified of vulnerability,</v>

1044
01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:01.260
<v Speaker 4>there's always the possibility that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>life path that you're following isn't </v>

1045
01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.490
<v Speaker 4>rich enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the buffer you against the negative </v>

1046
01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:09.720
<v Speaker 4>element of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a reasonable hypothesis and an </v>

1047
01:08:09.821 --> 01:08:14.821
<v Speaker 4>optimistic one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think although a difficult one at six </v>

1048
01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:17.611
<v Speaker 4>month followup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these changes were sustained with about </v>

1049
01:08:17.611 --> 01:08:19.850
<v Speaker 4>80 percent of participants continuing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>show clinically significant decreases in</v>

1050
01:08:19.851 --> 01:08:24.851
<v Speaker 4>depressed mood and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stephen Ross commenting about this,</v>

1051
01:08:25.371 --> 01:08:30.371
<v Speaker 4>he was a co investigator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>said it is simply unprecedented in </v>

1052
01:08:30.371 --> 01:08:33.221
<v Speaker 4>psychiatry that a single dose of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>medicine produces these kinds of </v>

1053
01:08:33.221 --> 01:08:33.780
<v Speaker 4>dramatic and enduring results,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1054
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 4>Which means we have no idea why this </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

1055
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:45.110
<v Speaker 4>Participants in attributed improvements </v>
<v Speaker 4>and attitudes about life slash self,</v>

1056
01:08:45.111 --> 01:08:46.100
<v Speaker 4>mood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships,</v>

1057
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:51.400
<v Speaker 4>and spirituality to the high dose </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience with more than 80 percent </v>

1058
01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:56.021
<v Speaker 4>endorsing moderately or greater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>increased wellbeing in life </v>

1059
01:08:56.021 --> 01:08:57.290
<v Speaker 4>satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Community observers showed corresponding</v>

1060
01:08:57.291 --> 01:09:02.291
<v Speaker 4>changes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mystical type silent psilocybin </v>

1061
01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:05.840
<v Speaker 4>experience on session day mediated the </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect of Psilocybin dose on therapeutic</v>

1062
01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.610
<v Speaker 4>outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that means is that,</v>

1063
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:13.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when researchers were trying to look at </v>

1064
01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:14.690
<v Speaker 4>a causal relationship between drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>ingestion and the positive outcome,</v>

1065
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.080
<v Speaker 4>the causal relationship was drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>ingestion,</v>

1066
01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:19.910
<v Speaker 4>mystical experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive outcome.</v>

1067
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.370
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't drug ingestion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive outcome.</v>

1068
01:09:22.371 --> 01:09:27.020
<v Speaker 4>There had to be the experience produced </v>
<v Speaker 4>by the pharmaceutical agent in order for</v>

1069
01:09:27.021 --> 01:09:29.960
<v Speaker 4>the pharmaceutical agent to have had its</v>
<v Speaker 4>effect.</v>

1070
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:31.520
<v Speaker 4>Now we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1071
01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:34.730
<v Speaker 4>we don't know why that is either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe some people needed a higher dose.</v>

1072
01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Who knows because people vary </v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendously in their sensitivity to </v>

1073
01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.370
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical substances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1074
01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.780
<v Speaker 4>why am I telling you all this?</v>

1075
01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:47.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you for a variety of </v>

1076
01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.331
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is the first is make no mistake </v>

1077
01:09:49.331 --> 01:09:52.370
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human beings have the capacity for forms</v>

1078
01:09:52.371 --> 01:09:57.371
<v Speaker 4>of consciousness that are radically </v>
<v Speaker 4>unlike our normative forms of </v>

1079
01:09:57.371 --> 01:10:00.671
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and the evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>those alternative forms of consciousness</v>

1080
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.360
<v Speaker 4>are purely pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the simplest explanation,</v>

1081
01:10:05.361 --> 01:10:10.361
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You perturb the system produces </v>

1082
01:10:10.361 --> 01:10:10.361
<v Speaker 4>pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's negative.</v>

1083
01:10:10.361 --> 01:10:14.150
<v Speaker 4>That is the simplest explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The evidence for that is weak at best.</v>

1084
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Leaving out the bad trip issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which which is non trivial,</v>

1085
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:23.530
<v Speaker 4>the empirical evidence as it accrues in </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact seems to suggest that the </v>

1086
01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:27.290
<v Speaker 4>consequence of mystical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive mystical experiences associated</v>

1087
01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:30.830
<v Speaker 4>with psychedelic intake is </v>
<v Speaker 4>overwhelmingly positive.</v>

1088
01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:35.831
<v Speaker 4>Even in extreme situations and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>really can't find a more extreme </v>

1089
01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:39.041
<v Speaker 4>situation than uncertain cancer </v>
<v Speaker 4>diagnosis with concomitant and </v>

1090
01:10:40.281 --> 01:10:41.520
<v Speaker 4>depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like.</v>

1091
01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's not as bad as it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it gets kind of in the ballpark.</v>

1092
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:48.230
<v Speaker 4>And so the fact that even under </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances like that,</v>

1093
01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:53.620
<v Speaker 4>there was the overwhelming probability </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the experience would be positive </v>

1094
01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.170
<v Speaker 4>because that's another thing you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't expect.</v>

1095
01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:59.171
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even from some of the earlier earliest </v>

1096
01:10:59.171 --> 01:10:59.900
<v Speaker 4>discussions about psychedelic use that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were put forth by people,</v>

1097
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:04.340
<v Speaker 4>including Timothy leary describing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>importance of set.</v>

1098
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:09.370
<v Speaker 4>Right so that the early experimenters </v>
<v Speaker 4>noted that if you had a psychedelic </v>

1099
01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:13.620
<v Speaker 4>experience and you were in a bad state </v>
<v Speaker 4>or in a bad place,</v>

1100
01:11:13.621 --> 01:11:16.530
<v Speaker 4>that that was one of the precursors to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad trip.</v>

1101
01:11:16.531 --> 01:11:21.531
<v Speaker 4>That the negative emotion that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>entered the experience with could be </v>

1102
01:11:21.531 --> 01:11:25.170
<v Speaker 4>magnified tremendously by the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the chemical substances.</v>

1103
01:11:25.171 --> 01:11:28.500
<v Speaker 4>So that it was necessary to be somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>safe.</v>

1104
01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 4>To be around people that you trust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be in a familiar environment,</v>

1105
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:36.210
<v Speaker 4>to get all the variables that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't control under control,</v>

1106
01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:41.540
<v Speaker 4>but here's a situation where that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's happening at all because people </v>

1107
01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:45.201
<v Speaker 4>have this cancer diagnosis of a cancer </v>
<v Speaker 4>diagnosis of unspecified outcome and </v>

1108
01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 4>they still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the vast majority of them had a positive</v>

1109
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:52.221
<v Speaker 4>experience and the positive experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience had long lasting positive </v>

1110
01:11:52.221 --> 01:11:52.680
<v Speaker 4>consequences.</v>

1111
01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:58.340
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the case that the transcendent </v>

1112
01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 4>experience is not real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's wrong.</v>

1113
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:08.390
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we don't know what that means </v>

1114
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:11.510
<v Speaker 4>because it actually challenges to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree our concepts of what constitutes </v>

1115
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:14.721
<v Speaker 4>real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it certainly well within the realm </v>

1116
01:12:14.721 --> 01:12:16.710
<v Speaker 4>of normative human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's part of the human capacity.</v>

1117
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:21.980
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there there's been other neurological </v>

1118
01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:21.980
<v Speaker 4>experiments to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1119
01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.260
<v Speaker 4>there's a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadian researcher,</v>

1120
01:12:22.261 --> 01:12:23.940
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who invented something.</v>

1121
01:12:23.941 --> 01:12:28.941
<v Speaker 4>He called the God helmet and it used </v>
<v Speaker 4>electromagnetic stimulation,</v>

1122
01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:32.850
<v Speaker 4>brain stimulation to induce mystical </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>

1123
01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:38.180
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what part of the brain </v>

1124
01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:38.180
<v Speaker 4>he was shutting off or activating with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that particular gadget,</v>

1125
01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:41.100
<v Speaker 4>but and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1126
01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:41.720
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1127
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:46.830
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of other indications </v>

1128
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:49.911
<v Speaker 4>of this sort of thing that have cropped </v>
<v Speaker 4>up in other domains of the neurological </v>

1129
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:51.810
<v Speaker 4>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example.</v>

1130
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.560
<v Speaker 4>It's very common for people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>epileptic to have religious experiences </v>

1131
01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:01.170
<v Speaker 4>as part of the prodromal to the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>seizure.</v>

1132
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.480
<v Speaker 4>That was the case with Dostoyevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1133
01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:08.810
<v Speaker 4>who had incredibly intense religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences that would culminate an </v>

1134
01:13:08.881 --> 01:13:13.320
<v Speaker 4>epileptic seizure and he said that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were of sufficient quality that he would</v>

1135
01:13:13.321 --> 01:13:18.321
<v Speaker 4>give up his whole life to have had the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the funny thing too is that in my </v>

1136
01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:23.451
<v Speaker 4>reading of Dostoevsky at least is that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that epileptic seizures and the </v>

1137
01:13:23.581 --> 01:13:28.581
<v Speaker 4>associated mystical experiences were </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of what made him a transcendently </v>

1138
01:13:28.581 --> 01:13:32.721
<v Speaker 4>brilliant author.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that he would have broken </v>

1139
01:13:32.721 --> 01:13:35.151
<v Speaker 4>through into the domains of insight that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he possessed without those strange </v>

1140
01:13:35.151 --> 01:13:39.711
<v Speaker 4>neurological experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was certainly not the case that </v>

1141
01:13:39.711 --> 01:13:43.281
<v Speaker 4>his epilepsy or the experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were associated with it produced what </v>

1142
01:13:43.501 --> 01:13:48.501
<v Speaker 4>you might describe as an impairment in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his cognitive function is quite the </v>

1143
01:13:48.501 --> 01:13:48.840
<v Speaker 4>contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least that's how it looks to me.</v>

1144
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.400
<v Speaker 4>Here's another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's another something worth </v>

1145
01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:58.560
<v Speaker 4>considering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how important it is,</v>

1146
01:13:58.561 --> 01:14:02.400
<v Speaker 4>but it might be really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It depends on how important this is.</v>

1147
01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:05.670
<v Speaker 4>Something that Carl Jung said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it depends on how important youngest,</v>

1148
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:11.570
<v Speaker 4>now Freud established the field of </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalysis and with an </v>

1149
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:17.370
<v Speaker 4>investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say rigorous investigation into </v>

1150
01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:21.691
<v Speaker 4>the contents of the unconscious and </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern psychologists and psychiatrists </v>

1151
01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:21.691
<v Speaker 4>like to.</v>

1152
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.220
<v Speaker 4>What would you say denigrate Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1153
01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:30.260
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that Freud's fundamental </v>

1154
01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:33.101
<v Speaker 4>insights were so profound and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>valuable that they got immediately </v>

1155
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.460
<v Speaker 4>absorbed into our culture and now they </v>
<v Speaker 4>seem self evident.</v>

1156
01:14:34.461 --> 01:14:35.960
<v Speaker 4>And so that all that's left of Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

1157
01:14:35.961 --> 01:14:37.660
<v Speaker 4>his errors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1158
01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:42.661
<v Speaker 4>because we believe everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We believe all the profound things he </v>

1159
01:14:42.661 --> 01:14:42.770
<v Speaker 4>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just take them for granted.</v>

1160
01:14:42.771 --> 01:14:46.310
<v Speaker 4>And so we don't believe the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he said that weren't quite on the money.</v>

1161
01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:49.160
<v Speaker 4>And that's all we credit with him with </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

1162
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:54.430
<v Speaker 4>but he was certainly the first person </v>
<v Speaker 4>who brought up the idea of the </v>

1163
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:58.240
<v Speaker 4>unconscious in a in a rigorous manner,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was the first person to do a </v>

1164
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:02.471
<v Speaker 4>rigorous examination of dreams because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the interpretation of dreams is a great </v>

1165
01:15:02.471 --> 01:15:02.840
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's well worth reading,</v>

1166
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:08.500
<v Speaker 4>and he was the first person to note that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were in some sense inhabited by </v>

1167
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:12.671
<v Speaker 4>subpersonalities that had a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree of autonomy and independent life.</v>

1168
01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Brilliant observation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cognitive psychologists haven't </v>

1169
01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:20.621
<v Speaker 4>caught up with that at all yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ewan was profoundly affected by Freud.</v>

1170
01:15:23.231 --> 01:15:25.780
<v Speaker 4>Jung was profoundly affected by nature </v>
<v Speaker 4>and by Freud.</v>

1171
01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:29.950
<v Speaker 4>Those were his two main intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 4>influences.</v>

1172
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:35.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't think one more than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He split with Freud on the religious </v>

1173
01:15:36.821 --> 01:15:41.821
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was what caused the disruption in </v>

1174
01:15:41.821 --> 01:15:44.551
<v Speaker 4>their relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's an extremely </v>

1175
01:15:44.551 --> 01:15:46.480
<v Speaker 4>interesting historical occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be a profound significance.</v>

1176
01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Freud believed that the fundamental myth</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the human being was the Eda Pole </v>

1177
01:15:52.290 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Speaker 4>myth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the myth</v>

1178
01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.800
<v Speaker 4>from a broader perspective is a failed </v>
<v Speaker 4>hero's story.</v>

1179
01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:03.230
<v Speaker 4>So the eatable myth is the myth of a man</v>
<v Speaker 4>who develops who grows up,</v>

1180
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:07.700
<v Speaker 4>but then accidentally becomes too close </v>
<v Speaker 4>to his mother,</v>

1181
01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.130
<v Speaker 4>sleeps with her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't know who she is,</v>

1182
01:16:10.131 --> 01:16:13.670
<v Speaker 4>and as a consequence blinds himself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1183
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:19.450
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a warning about human </v>

1184
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.301
<v Speaker 4>development gone wrong in that story and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that Freud put his finger on it </v>

1185
01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:26.440
<v Speaker 4>extraordinarily well because human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings have a very long period of </v>

1186
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.850
<v Speaker 4>dependency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that you do see in</v>

1187
01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:33.851
<v Speaker 4>clinical practice is that many people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems are associated with their </v>

1188
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000
<v Speaker 4>inability to break free of their family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they're consumed by the family </v>

1189
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:40.160
<v Speaker 4>drama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1190
01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:43.400
<v Speaker 4>They can't get beyond what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in their family.</v>

1191
01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.610
<v Speaker 4>They're stuck in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1192
01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:48.650
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's equivalent symbolically speaking,</v>

1193
01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.950
<v Speaker 4>you might say to the idea of being too </v>
<v Speaker 4>close to your mother of,</v>

1194
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:57.070
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the boundaries being improperly </v>

1195
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.070
<v Speaker 4>specified.</v>

1196
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:58.820
<v Speaker 4>And that happens far more often than </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone would like to think.</v>

1197
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:02.150
<v Speaker 4>As I said for I thought it was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>universal,</v>

1198
01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:07.880
<v Speaker 4>but you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a different idea and his idea was</v>

1199
01:17:07.881 --> 01:17:11.660
<v Speaker 4>that it wasn't the hero story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the universal human myth.</v>

1200
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:16.010
<v Speaker 4>It was the successful hero's story and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big difference.</v>

1201
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:21.370
<v Speaker 4>I could seriously a big difference </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the successful hero story is </v>

1202
01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.720
<v Speaker 4>your member in sleeping beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You may remember this in the Disney </v>

1203
01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.271
<v Speaker 4>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the evil queen traps the prince in a </v>

1204
01:17:31.271 --> 01:17:31.760
<v Speaker 4>dungeon and she's not going to let them </v>
<v Speaker 4>out till he's old.</v>

1205
01:17:31.761 --> 01:17:36.761
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there's this comical scene where </v>

1206
01:17:36.761 --> 01:17:37.520
<v Speaker 4>she's down in the dungeon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's all in chains and she's laughing at</v>

1207
01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:42.521
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>telling him what his future is going to </v>

1208
01:17:42.521 --> 01:17:42.950
<v Speaker 4>be like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's quite evil and you know,</v>

1209
01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.290
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she paints this wonderful picture of him</v>

1210
01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:48.700
<v Speaker 4>being freed in like 80 years and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hobbling out of the castle on his,</v>

1211
01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.920
<v Speaker 4>his horse that's so old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can barely stand up and him with gray</v>

1212
01:17:51.921 --> 01:17:52.250
<v Speaker 4>hair.</v>

1213
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:53.340
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1214
01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:58.380
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she recites this story of his eventual </v>

1215
01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.640
<v Speaker 4>triumphant departure from the castle as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a old and decrepit man.</v>

1216
01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:03.950
<v Speaker 4>And she has a great laugh about it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nice,</v>

1217
01:18:03.951 --> 01:18:05.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real punchy story.</v>

1218
01:18:05.301 --> 01:18:07.370
<v Speaker 4>It's really something wonderful for </v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

1219
01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:12.670
<v Speaker 4>That story and he gets free of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shackles and the things that freedom our</v>

1220
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:21.020
<v Speaker 4>three little female ferries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the positive aspect of the feminine that</v>

1221
01:18:21.021 --> 01:18:26.021
<v Speaker 4>frees him from the dungeon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's very interesting and very </v>

1222
01:18:26.021 --> 01:18:26.360
<v Speaker 4>accurate from a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

1223
01:18:26.361 --> 01:18:31.361
<v Speaker 4>It's the negative element of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>feminine that encapsulates him in the </v>

1224
01:18:31.361 --> 01:18:33.740
<v Speaker 4>dungeon and it's the positive element of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the feminine and that frees him and then</v>

1225
01:18:33.741 --> 01:18:35.450
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has a queen.</v>

1226
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.150
<v Speaker 4>The Evil Queen is not very happy when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>escapes.</v>

1227
01:18:38.151 --> 01:18:43.151
<v Speaker 4>You may remember that she stands on top </v>
<v Speaker 4>of her castle tower and starts to spin </v>

1228
01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:44.600
<v Speaker 4>off cosmic sparks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1229
01:18:44.601 --> 01:18:49.601
<v Speaker 4>she's quite the creature enveloped in </v>
<v Speaker 4>flame and then she turns into a dragon </v>

1230
01:18:49.601 --> 01:18:54.130
<v Speaker 4>and she then the prince has to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>with her in order to make contact with </v>

1231
01:18:55.041 --> 01:19:00.041
<v Speaker 4>sleeping beauty and an awakened her from</v>
<v Speaker 4>her comatose existence as her </v>

1232
01:19:00.981 --> 01:19:05.981
<v Speaker 4>unconscious existence and wants a </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant.</v>

1233
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:10.850
<v Speaker 4>It's a brilliant representation of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful hero myth.</v>

1234
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:16.180
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't end up staying in an unholy </v>

1235
01:19:17.091 --> 01:19:22.091
<v Speaker 4>relationship with his mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say he escapes and then conquers </v>

1236
01:19:23.931 --> 01:19:28.931
<v Speaker 4>the worst thing that can be imagined and</v>
<v Speaker 4>is ennobled by that and that as a </v>

1237
01:19:29.211 --> 01:19:34.211
<v Speaker 4>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's able to wake the slumbering </v>

1238
01:19:34.211 --> 01:19:37.211
<v Speaker 4>feminine from its coma and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>union story and that's the story that he</v>

1239
01:19:38.181 --> 01:19:42.620
<v Speaker 4>juxtaposed against Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See Freud thought of religious phenomena</v>

1240
01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:46.220
<v Speaker 4>as part of an old tide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be,</v>

1241
01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:47.780
<v Speaker 4>that would drown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rationality,</v>

1242
01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.840
<v Speaker 4>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why Freud was so vehemently anti </v>

1243
01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.260
<v Speaker 4>religious and you thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1244
01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:00.280
<v Speaker 4>it's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're throwing the baby out with the </v>

1245
01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.441
<v Speaker 4>bathwater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something profound and central </v>

1246
01:20:02.441 --> 01:20:07.000
<v Speaker 4>to the hero myth and union clinical work</v>
<v Speaker 4>is essentially the awakening of the hero</v>

1247
01:20:09.091 --> 01:20:13.380
<v Speaker 4>myth in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the analysis and in the client or the</v>

1248
01:20:13.381 --> 01:20:18.381
<v Speaker 4>patient to conceptualize yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 4>that which can confront chaos and </v>

1249
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:23.661
<v Speaker 4>triumph and that that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>an ennobling of the of consciousness and</v>

1250
01:20:24.241 --> 01:20:25.800
<v Speaker 4>the establishment of pop.</v>

1251
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Proper positive relationships between </v>
<v Speaker 4>male and female.</v>

1252
01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:32.670
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a skeptical person.</v>

1253
01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:38.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very skeptical person and I've tried </v>

1254
01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:42.491
<v Speaker 4>with every trick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to put a lever underneath young </v>

1255
01:20:42.491 --> 01:20:45.680
<v Speaker 4>story and lifted up and disrupt it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1256
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:50.880
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was right and that Freud was </v>

1257
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:50.880
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1258
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.801
<v Speaker 4>I have great respect for Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he got the progam problem </v>

1259
01:20:54.801 --> 01:20:57.861
<v Speaker 4>diagnosed very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very nicely and in my clinical work I </v>

1260
01:20:57.861 --> 01:21:00.210
<v Speaker 4>see the phenomena that Freud described </v>
<v Speaker 4>emerged continually,</v>

1261
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.510
<v Speaker 4>constantly the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're interested in that,</v>

1262
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:06.510
<v Speaker 4>there's a documentary you should watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I may have mentioned it before.</v>

1263
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.460
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the best documentary ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>made.</v>

1264
01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:13.530
<v Speaker 4>Certainly the best one I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called crumb and it's about a </v>

1265
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:15.030
<v Speaker 4>underground cartoonists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robert Crumb,</v>

1266
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:17.730
<v Speaker 4>who who is part of the hippie movement </v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1267
01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:22.880
<v Speaker 4>although he hated hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was part of the hippie movement in </v>

1268
01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.540
<v Speaker 4>the sixties in San Francisco and started</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire underground comic.</v>

1269
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:30.900
<v Speaker 4>What culture that that manifested itself</v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually in graphic novels,</v>

1270
01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:36.170
<v Speaker 4>there's quite a significant figure from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the perspective of popular art and a </v>

1271
01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:41.421
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very intelligent man and also I would </v>

1272
01:21:41.421 --> 01:21:44.121
<v Speaker 4>say a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although a very bent and depraved and </v>

1273
01:21:44.121 --> 01:21:47.331
<v Speaker 4>warped one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone very acutely aware of his own </v>

1274
01:21:47.331 --> 01:21:50.811
<v Speaker 4>shadow and the documentary outlines his </v>
<v Speaker 4>attempts to escape from his absolutely </v>

1275
01:21:52.651 --> 01:21:57.651
<v Speaker 4>dreadful mother and the failure of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>two brothers to do the same thing.</v>

1276
01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.770
<v Speaker 4>One of whom ended up as a street beggar </v>
<v Speaker 4>in San Francisco and the other who drank</v>

1277
01:22:01.771 --> 01:22:04.890
<v Speaker 4>furniture Polish and died six months </v>
<v Speaker 4>after the documentary was produced.</v>

1278
01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.830
<v Speaker 4>It's an unbelievably shocking </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary.</v>

1279
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:13.010
<v Speaker 4>It's the only piece of film that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever seen that captures Friday and </v>

1280
01:22:14.851 --> 01:22:19.851
<v Speaker 4>pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anything because he </v>

1281
01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:20.670
<v Speaker 4>can't see it generally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you're in a clinical situation,</v>

1282
01:22:20.671 --> 01:22:22.770
<v Speaker 4>unless you know the details of someone's</v>
<v Speaker 4>lives,</v>

1283
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.890
<v Speaker 4>the personal intimate details,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cannot communicate it,</v>

1284
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:30.360
<v Speaker 4>but the documentary as who made the film</v>
<v Speaker 4>was Robert Ziegler off,</v>

1285
01:22:30.361 --> 01:22:33.780
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a friend of the crumbs and so he got</v>

1286
01:22:33.781 --> 01:22:38.781
<v Speaker 4>access in a way that no one else would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have and they were also very forthright </v>

1287
01:22:38.781 --> 01:22:39.360
<v Speaker 4>and forthcoming about their situation.</v>

1288
01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.810
<v Speaker 4>In general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would highly recommend that it's.</v>

1289
01:22:42.010 --> 01:22:45.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a real punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to know how a rapist thinks,</v>

1290
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:49.920
<v Speaker 4>like if you actually want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because maybe you don't want to know.</v>

1291
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.540
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably don't want to know,</v>

1292
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:54.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because do you really want to know that?</v>

1293
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:59.870
<v Speaker 4>Because to understand that means to put </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself in that position and to </v>

1294
01:22:59.870 --> 01:23:02.631
<v Speaker 4>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you really want to know how a serial </v>

1295
01:23:02.631 --> 01:23:05.361
<v Speaker 4>sexual Predator thinks and why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you watch crum and pay attention,</v>

1296
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 4>you'll know and that's only a tiny bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what the film has to offer.</v>

1297
01:23:11.650 --> 01:23:12.970
<v Speaker 4>It's really quite remarkable.</v>

1298
01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

1299
01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:24.240
<v Speaker 4>young split with Freud on the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the oedipal story as the fundamental </v>

1300
01:23:26.081 --> 01:23:31.081
<v Speaker 4>myth of humankind and on the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the validity of the religious viewpoint </v>

1301
01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:38.130
<v Speaker 4>and young came down heavily on the side </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the validity of the religious </v>

1302
01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:42.001
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint and he established that in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>book called symbols of transformation </v>

1303
01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:44.440
<v Speaker 4>which was written in 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the book that broke,</v>

1304
01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:48.280
<v Speaker 4>that produced the break permanent split </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Freud and that book,</v>

1305
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 4>I would say that books actually been </v>
<v Speaker 4>written three times.</v>

1306
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:58.410
<v Speaker 4>It was written as symbols of trip four </v>
<v Speaker 4>times written as symbols of </v>

1307
01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:01.081
<v Speaker 4>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which young extensively revised when he </v>

1308
01:24:01.081 --> 01:24:03.481
<v Speaker 4>was old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it was rewritten in is in a </v>

1309
01:24:03.481 --> 01:24:04.840
<v Speaker 4>sense by a student of Yoga called Eric </v>
<v Speaker 4>Norman,</v>

1310
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:07.930
<v Speaker 4>who is also something someone I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>really recommend.</v>

1311
01:24:07.931 --> 01:24:10.480
<v Speaker 4>Eric Norman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is [inaudible] greatest student,</v>

1312
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:16.470
<v Speaker 4>and he wrote two books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote one called the origins and </v>

1313
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:19.561
<v Speaker 4>history of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a description of the </v>

1314
01:24:19.561 --> 01:24:19.990
<v Speaker 4>development of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of unconsciousness,</v>

1315
01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:23.870
<v Speaker 4>using the hero myth as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an as a,</v>

1316
01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:24.890
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

1317
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.800
<v Speaker 4>what would you say as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an interpretive skeleton,</v>

1318
01:24:27.810 --> 01:24:32.810
<v Speaker 4>so Newman viewed the hero myth as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dramatized story of the emergence of </v>

1319
01:24:34.331 --> 01:24:39.331
<v Speaker 4>human consciousness out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounding unconsciousness in which it </v>

1320
01:24:39.331 --> 01:24:40.420
<v Speaker 4>was embedded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the struggle for consciousness,</v>

1321
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:43.090
<v Speaker 4>the struggle of consciousness upward </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards the light,</v>

1322
01:24:43.091 --> 01:24:48.091
<v Speaker 4>like a lotus flower struggles up through</v>
<v Speaker 4>the muck and they and the water to to </v>

1323
01:24:48.091 --> 01:24:51.850
<v Speaker 4>lay itself on the surface of the water </v>
<v Speaker 4>and and bloom and reveal the Buddha,</v>

1324
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:57.090
<v Speaker 4>which is of course what the lotus flower</v>
<v Speaker 4>does from a symbolic perspective and </v>

1325
01:24:57.090 --> 01:24:57.090
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for for Norman.</v>

1326
01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:00.140
<v Speaker 4>The hero's story was the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>development,</v>

1327
01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:05.150
<v Speaker 4>the successful development of </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and the origins of </v>

1328
01:25:05.150 --> 01:25:05.560
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The origins and history of consciousness</v>

1329
01:25:05.561 --> 01:25:08.230
<v Speaker 4>is a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interestingly,</v>

1330
01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:13.580
<v Speaker 4>Camille Paglia row read the origins and </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of consciousness.</v>

1331
01:25:13.581 --> 01:25:18.290
<v Speaker 4>She's one of the few mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectuals that I've ever encountered</v>

1332
01:25:18.291 --> 01:25:23.291
<v Speaker 4>who read that and commented on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she believed that it would be </v>

1333
01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:27.461
<v Speaker 4>sufficient antidote to postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 4>denigration of literature.</v>

1334
01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.990
<v Speaker 4>She thought it was that powerful work </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I believe that.</v>

1335
01:25:32.991 --> 01:25:37.991
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a remarkable book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carl Jung wrote the foreword to that </v>

1336
01:25:37.991 --> 01:25:42.401
<v Speaker 4>book and he said in the forward that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was the book that he wished he would </v>

1337
01:25:42.401 --> 01:25:42.920
<v Speaker 4>have written,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's sort of like young.</v>

1338
01:25:42.921 --> 01:25:44.990
<v Speaker 4>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember how many volumes,</v>

1339
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:49.890
<v Speaker 4>dozens of very thick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult volumes was.</v>

1340
01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Norman was able to</v>

1341
01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:58.610
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Distill those into a single volume </v>

1342
01:25:58.610 --> 01:26:02.211
<v Speaker 4>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I would also say if you're </v>

1343
01:26:02.211 --> 01:26:02.211
<v Speaker 4>interested in young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best book to read is the origins and</v>

1344
01:26:02.211 --> 01:26:07.011
<v Speaker 4>history of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the best intro into into the union </v>

1345
01:26:07.011 --> 01:26:07.011
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Soon,</v>

1346
01:26:07.011 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very difficult to understand.</v>

1347
01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:14.660
<v Speaker 4>It requires a real shift of perspective </v>
<v Speaker 4>in order to understand what he's talking</v>

1348
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:17.690
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Norman wrote another book called the</v>

1349
01:26:17.691 --> 01:26:22.691
<v Speaker 4>great mother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a little bit more specialized </v>

1350
01:26:22.691 --> 01:26:26.591
<v Speaker 4>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also extremely interesting </v>

1351
01:26:26.591 --> 01:26:28.631
<v Speaker 4>because it fleshes out the archetype of </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos and its representation as feminine</v>

1352
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:34.990
<v Speaker 4>and it's a brilliant book as well and </v>
<v Speaker 4>highly highly worth reading both those </v>

1353
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:37.160
<v Speaker 4>books.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

1354
01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:44.020
<v Speaker 4>young was a very strange person and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>visionary and and so that's kept them </v>

1355
01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:47.390
<v Speaker 4>outside of the academic realm almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>entirely.</v>

1356
01:26:47.391 --> 01:26:52.391
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was constantly warned as an </v>

1357
01:26:52.391 --> 01:26:54.401
<v Speaker 4>undergraduate and then a graduate </v>
<v Speaker 4>student and then a professor against </v>

1358
01:26:54.401 --> 01:26:57.320
<v Speaker 4>ever talking about young in any way </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever.</v>

1359
01:26:57.710 --> 01:26:59.990
<v Speaker 4>When I went on the job market,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was at mcgill,</v>

1360
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:05.410
<v Speaker 4>when I had graduated from mcgill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had done my scientific research and </v>

1361
01:27:05.410 --> 01:27:07.010
<v Speaker 4>analysis a holism and I had a fairly </v>
<v Speaker 4>lengthy publication record that was pure</v>

1362
01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:12.011
<v Speaker 4>empirical research and really neuro </v>
<v Speaker 4>physiological research into the </v>

1363
01:27:13.191 --> 01:27:18.191
<v Speaker 4>pharmacology of alcoholism and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>established a reasonably solid dossier </v>

1364
01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:25.530
<v Speaker 4>publications,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time I was writing this </v>

1365
01:27:25.530 --> 01:27:28.001
<v Speaker 4>book that became maps of meaning and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd split my time in graduate student </v>

1366
01:27:28.001 --> 01:27:28.700
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Between these two endeavors.</v>

1367
01:27:28.701 --> 01:27:33.701
<v Speaker 4>One very specifically neurological and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmacological and really biologically </v>

1368
01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:37.970
<v Speaker 4>based and the other very abstract </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious,</v>

1369
01:27:37.971 --> 01:27:39.410
<v Speaker 4>symbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalytic,</v>

1370
01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:45.190
<v Speaker 4>the complete opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could see that the two things </v>

1371
01:27:45.190 --> 01:27:48.520
<v Speaker 4>overlapped really nicely and there was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>number of scientists at the time that </v>

1372
01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.631
<v Speaker 4>we're also drawing the same conclusions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same relationship between the </v>

1373
01:27:52.631 --> 01:27:57.371
<v Speaker 4>biology and the psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jaak Panksepp who wrote a book called </v>

1374
01:27:57.371 --> 01:27:58.730
<v Speaker 4>affective neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a great classic,</v>

1375
01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:04.120
<v Speaker 4>is one of those people who who saw the </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between the neurobiology of</v>

1376
01:28:04.401 --> 01:28:09.401
<v Speaker 4>emotion and motivation and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalytic insights never became a </v>

1377
01:28:09.401 --> 01:28:10.940
<v Speaker 4>mainstream view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's too complex.</v>

1378
01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:15.940
<v Speaker 4>I think that bridging the gap between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the biology and the and the symbolic is </v>

1379
01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:17.660
<v Speaker 4>too much for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Generally speaking,</v>

1380
01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:22.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was certainly virtually too much for </v>

1381
01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:22.690
<v Speaker 4>me because I got quite ill when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>graduate student.</v>

1382
01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:27.670
<v Speaker 4>I think for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also would go out and party three </v>

1383
01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:28.340
<v Speaker 4>nights a week and so that probably had </v>
<v Speaker 4>something to do with it,</v>

1384
01:28:28.341 --> 01:28:33.341
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but working on those two things </v>

1385
01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:34.760
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously was also rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>exhausting.</v>

1386
01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:40.150
<v Speaker 4>Now you was a tremendously insightful </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinician and he was a strange person,</v>

1387
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:42.170
<v Speaker 4>introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>visionary,</v>

1388
01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:44.300
<v Speaker 4>high and introversion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1389
01:28:44.301 --> 01:28:44.930
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1390
01:28:44.931 --> 01:28:46.490
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very high in openness,</v>

1391
01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:50.240
<v Speaker 4>like off the charts and also God only </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows what his Iq was.</v>

1392
01:28:50.241 --> 01:28:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time I read young,</v>

1393
01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.530
<v Speaker 4>it's like reading Nietzsche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's terrifying because you know,</v>

1394
01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:59.540
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's so damn smart that he can think up </v>

1395
01:28:59.540 --> 01:28:59.600
<v Speaker 4>answers to questions that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even.</v>

1396
01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.560
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>answers.</v>

1397
01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:06.561
<v Speaker 4>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never conceptualized the damn </v>

1398
01:29:06.561 --> 01:29:06.561
<v Speaker 4>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really something to read.</v>

1399
01:29:06.561 --> 01:29:06.600
<v Speaker 4>Someone like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1400
01:29:06.601 --> 01:29:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Who says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1401
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 4>here's a mystery and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1402
01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:11.880
<v Speaker 4>I'd never thought of that is a mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and here's the solution.</v>

1403
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:13.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1404
01:29:13.141 --> 01:29:13.990
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1405
01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:20.340
<v Speaker 4>that's something you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he could read Greek and he could </v>

1406
01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:20.940
<v Speaker 4>read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He read all the ancient.</v>

1407
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:25.410
<v Speaker 4>He read a very large variety of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 4>languages and was very familiar with the</v>

1408
01:29:25.411 --> 01:29:30.411
<v Speaker 4>entire corpus of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of astrological thought and of l </v>

1409
01:29:30.411 --> 01:29:34.821
<v Speaker 4>chemical thought and of classic </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature and Biblical stories.</v>

1410
01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:39.750
<v Speaker 4>And I mean educated in a way that no one</v>
<v Speaker 4>is educated now,</v>

1411
01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:44.280
<v Speaker 4>and so he's very daunting person to </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter and terrifying.</v>

1412
01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:47.700
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His Book Ion,</v>

1413
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:52.290
<v Speaker 4>which is the second volume of the second</v>
<v Speaker 4>volume of volume nine,</v>

1414
01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:54.210
<v Speaker 4>which is the archetypes of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>collective unconscious.</v>

1415
01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.180
<v Speaker 4>That damn book has just absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying because young,</v>

1416
01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:01.770
<v Speaker 4>he's one of these visionaries who can </v>
<v Speaker 4>see way underneath the social structures</v>

1417
01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:06.771
<v Speaker 4>and look at patterns that are developing</v>
<v Speaker 4>across for you in young's case across </v>

1418
01:30:06.771 --> 01:30:09.060
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years and lays them out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's a really.</v>

1419
01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:13.260
<v Speaker 4>That's really something to to encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ion is a terrifying book.</v>

1420
01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:17.970
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one question might be,</v>

1421
01:30:17.971 --> 01:30:19.190
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I read the organ,</v>

1422
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.850
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the hell did he know these things?</v>

1423
01:30:20.851 --> 01:30:24.270
<v Speaker 4>How could he figure these things out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't understand how he could possibly</v>

1424
01:30:24.271 --> 01:30:26.610
<v Speaker 4>know these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1425
01:30:26.611 --> 01:30:31.611
<v Speaker 4>here's a partial answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Young was a visionary,</v>

1426
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:34.470
<v Speaker 4>and so what that means as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell,</v>

1427
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.430
<v Speaker 4>and we could do a little quick survey </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1428
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:42.350
<v Speaker 4>How many of you think you think in words</v>
<v Speaker 4>and put up your hand.</v>

1429
01:30:42.351 --> 01:30:43.410
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think in words?</v>

1430
01:30:45.230 --> 01:30:46.250
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it looks like.</v>

1431
01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.680
<v Speaker 4>What about pictures?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of you think in pictures?</v>

1432
01:30:50.230 --> 01:30:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's interesting.</v>

1433
01:30:51.311 --> 01:30:53.440
<v Speaker 4>How many of you think that's about half </v>
<v Speaker 4>and half by the way?</v>

1434
01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:58.560
<v Speaker 4>Probably have fewer on the word side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of you think in pictures and </v>

1435
01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:58.560
<v Speaker 4>words?</v>

1436
01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:00.100
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all right,</v>

1437
01:31:00.101 --> 01:31:02.380
<v Speaker 4>so it was roughly a third in each </v>
<v Speaker 4>category,</v>

1438
01:31:02.381 --> 01:31:07.381
<v Speaker 4>but that's also something that I really </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't encountered any research on from</v>

1439
01:31:07.841 --> 01:31:09.880
<v Speaker 4>the neuropsychological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1440
01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:12.130
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think in pictures or do you think</v>

1441
01:31:12.131 --> 01:31:17.131
<v Speaker 4>it words and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is that actually a reliable </v>

1442
01:31:17.131 --> 01:31:19.711
<v Speaker 4>distinction?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I think in words most of the </v>

1443
01:31:19.711 --> 01:31:23.341
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can think in pictures like if I'm </v>

1444
01:31:23.341 --> 01:31:25.891
<v Speaker 4>trying to build something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can think in pictures very almost </v>

1445
01:31:25.891 --> 01:31:28.921
<v Speaker 4>instantaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't my natural mode of </v>

1446
01:31:28.921 --> 01:31:31.081
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hyperverbal and so my natural mode </v>

1447
01:31:31.081 --> 01:31:31.081
<v Speaker 4>of thinking is to think everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>through in words,</v>

1448
01:31:31.450 --> 01:31:36.450
<v Speaker 4>but I know my wife doesn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She thinks in images and then has to </v>

1449
01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:38.530
<v Speaker 4>translate them into words and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>

1450
01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.320
<v Speaker 4>you was very literate and he could </v>
<v Speaker 4>really think in words,</v>

1451
01:31:41.321 --> 01:31:46.321
<v Speaker 4>but he could really think in images.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also talking to my wife quite </v>

1452
01:31:46.321 --> 01:31:50.011
<v Speaker 4>extensively like her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the intensity of her visualization </v>

1453
01:31:50.011 --> 01:31:51.190
<v Speaker 4>vastly exceeds mine.</v>

1454
01:31:51.370 --> 01:31:56.370
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I close my eyes and then try to </v>

1455
01:31:56.370 --> 01:31:58.381
<v Speaker 4>imagine the crowd in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty low resolution and vague and</v>

1456
01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.890
<v Speaker 4>brilliantly colored and vivid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what it's.</v>

1457
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:04.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm seeing through a glass </v>
<v Speaker 4>darkly,</v>

1458
01:32:04.721 --> 01:32:08.620
<v Speaker 4>let's say I can't bring images to mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that with spectacular clarity,</v>

1459
01:32:08.621 --> 01:32:13.621
<v Speaker 4>but my wife is very good at that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>young seem to be absolutely a genius at </v>

1460
01:32:14.651 --> 01:32:19.651
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thinking and he had a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of visionaries in his family history as </v>

1461
01:32:19.651 --> 01:32:20.590
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know to what degree there's a</v>

1462
01:32:20.591 --> 01:32:24.270
<v Speaker 4>hereditary component of that and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>know to what degree that's actually like</v>

1463
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:29.340
<v Speaker 4>a neurological specialization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I presume that would be associated with </v>

1464
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:32.260
<v Speaker 4>the trade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Openness distinguishes itself,</v>

1465
01:32:32.261 --> 01:32:35.620
<v Speaker 4>differentiates itself into interest in </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas and interest in in statics.</v>

1466
01:32:35.621 --> 01:32:40.621
<v Speaker 4>And my suspicion are is that the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are more interested in aesthetics </v>

1467
01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.600
<v Speaker 4>are the visionary types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ones that think in images anyways.</v>

1468
01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:46.720
<v Speaker 4>You could really think in images and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could imagine beings.</v>

1469
01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:52.320
<v Speaker 4>And I had a client once who was a lucid </v>
<v Speaker 4>dreamer and how many of you have had a </v>

1470
01:32:53.111 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 4>lucid dream?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

1471
01:32:54.161 --> 01:32:59.161
<v Speaker 4>you're dreaming while you're many that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that phenomena wasn't really even even </v>

1472
01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:03.970
<v Speaker 4>identified as a phenomenon until the end</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the 19th century.</v>

1473
01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:09.060
<v Speaker 4>There was a book written about it that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Freud tried to get his hands on but </v>

1474
01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:09.310
<v Speaker 4>couldn't because it was a very rare </v>
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

1475
01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:14.490
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a researcher about 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago who started to study lucid </v>

1476
01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:15.100
<v Speaker 4>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

1477
01:33:15.101 --> 01:33:20.101
<v Speaker 4>I had a client who was a lucid dreamer </v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things she could do was </v>

1478
01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:25.200
<v Speaker 4>ask her dream characters what </v>
<v Speaker 4>information they were trying to convey </v>

1479
01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:30.360
<v Speaker 4>and they would tell her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was very interesting and one of </v>

1480
01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:34.951
<v Speaker 4>the consequences of that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't have the story completely </v>

1481
01:33:34.951 --> 01:33:35.320
<v Speaker 4>right in my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's close enough.</v>

1482
01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.890
<v Speaker 4>She was afraid of a very large number of</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1483
01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:44.400
<v Speaker 4>And in her dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a gypsy standing by a </v>

1484
01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:48.360
<v Speaker 4>wagon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>told her that if she was going to be </v>

1485
01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.891
<v Speaker 4>successful in university,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she would have to visit a </v>

1486
01:33:52.891 --> 01:33:57.181
<v Speaker 4>slaughterhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was something that was way </v>

1487
01:33:57.181 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 4>beyond her capacity to tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was a vegetarian.</v>

1488
01:33:58.961 --> 01:34:00.970
<v Speaker 4>She couldn't stand the sight of raw meat</v>
<v Speaker 4>even.</v>

1489
01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:04.840
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she was very oppressed and depressed</v>

1490
01:34:04.841 --> 01:34:08.590
<v Speaker 4>and anxious because of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>slaughterhouse nature of existence.</v>

1491
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:13.950
<v Speaker 4>And so her dream focused on that and one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the consequences of that,</v>

1492
01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:18.040
<v Speaker 4>because the slaughter house was out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the question as a clinical intervention,</v>

1493
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:20.920
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took her to an embalming,</v>

1494
01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:23.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>

1495
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:25.060
<v Speaker 4>because I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked her what,</v>

1496
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:28.150
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what might be equivalent to that.</v>

1497
01:34:28.151 --> 01:34:31.030
<v Speaker 4>And so she suggested that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1498
01:34:31.031 --> 01:34:33.760
<v Speaker 4>exposure therapy is a hallmark of </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinical psychology,</v>

1499
01:34:33.761 --> 01:34:34.030
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1500
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:38.110
<v Speaker 4>One of the things you do with people as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a clinician is you find out what they're</v>

1501
01:34:38.111 --> 01:34:42.460
<v Speaker 4>afraid of and you gradually and </v>
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily expose them to that.</v>

1502
01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:47.640
<v Speaker 4>And that cures them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's associated with the hero </v>

1503
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:47.640
<v Speaker 4>myth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1504
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.761
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's a dragon and it's </v>

1505
01:34:50.761 --> 01:34:51.280
<v Speaker 4>stopping you because there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dragons.</v>

1506
01:34:51.281 --> 01:34:53.380
<v Speaker 4>Most of them aren't stopping you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can ignore them.</v>

1507
01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.150
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1508
01:34:55.450 --> 01:35:00.450
<v Speaker 4>slash away at randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to be fighting </v>

1509
01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:01.310
<v Speaker 4>dragons that aren't in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if they are in your way,</v>

1510
01:35:01.311 --> 01:35:06.311
<v Speaker 4>you can't ignore them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you decompose them into sub </v>

1511
01:35:06.311 --> 01:35:08.510
<v Speaker 4>dragons and you have people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take them on and as they take them on,</v>

1512
01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.680
<v Speaker 4>they dispense with the dragon and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>gain the power of the drag.</v>

1513
01:35:11.681 --> 01:35:13.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

1514
01:35:13.911 --> 01:35:15.260
<v Speaker 4>A video game is like that.</v>

1515
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:17.690
<v Speaker 4>That's why people like the video games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's right,</v>

1516
01:35:17.691 --> 01:35:20.510
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason that you absorbed power</v>

1517
01:35:20.511 --> 01:35:22.760
<v Speaker 4>when you overcome things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you play a video game.</v>

1518
01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:26.150
<v Speaker 4>It's not like that's intrinsic to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>video game structure.</v>

1519
01:35:26.151 --> 01:35:28.580
<v Speaker 4>That's an archetypal idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

1520
01:35:28.581 --> 01:35:33.581
<v Speaker 4>we went and saw an embalming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was a very interesting experience </v>

1521
01:35:33.581 --> 01:35:36.620
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and quite,</v>

1522
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:42.070
<v Speaker 4>quite useful for her because she knew </v>
<v Speaker 4>what she could tolerate after that and </v>

1523
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:43.160
<v Speaker 4>it was a hell of a lot more than she </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought she could tolerate.</v>

1524
01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:47.690
<v Speaker 4>And so that's very useful to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back to you.</v>

1525
01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:52.130
<v Speaker 4>He's a visionary thinker now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My client,</v>

1526
01:35:52.131 --> 01:35:57.131
<v Speaker 4>I said she could lucid dream and she </v>
<v Speaker 4>could ask her dream characters what they</v>

1527
01:35:59.001 --> 01:36:01.340
<v Speaker 4>wanted and what they were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate to her.</v>

1528
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 4>So that was pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That happened.</v>

1529
01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Spontaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had nothing to do with me.</v>

1530
01:36:05.890 --> 01:36:10.890
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm interested in dreams in any of my </v>

1531
01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:12.491
<v Speaker 4>clients are great dreamers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the creative ones because I </v>

1532
01:36:12.491 --> 01:36:15.851
<v Speaker 4>think it's a hallmark of creativity to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have vivid dreams and to be able to </v>

1533
01:36:15.851 --> 01:36:18.971
<v Speaker 4>remember them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was a faculty that was natural </v>

1534
01:36:18.971 --> 01:36:23.921
<v Speaker 4>to her young had this other client at </v>
<v Speaker 4>one time.</v>

1535
01:36:24.710 --> 01:36:29.710
<v Speaker 4>At one point she had a variety of fears </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she had this dream that she told me </v>

1536
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:33.950
<v Speaker 4>and she was walking down a beach and on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the side of the beach,</v>

1537
01:36:33.951 --> 01:36:35.690
<v Speaker 4>up a dune,</v>
<v Speaker 4>small noon.</v>

1538
01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:38.840
<v Speaker 4>There was this old man with a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big python,</v>

1539
01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.450
<v Speaker 4>and there's a crowd around him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1540
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:47.110
<v Speaker 4>she was walking by the snake handler and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the snake and the crowd and she didn't </v>

1541
01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:51.731
<v Speaker 4>want to have anything to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was sort of showing people this </v>

1542
01:36:51.731 --> 01:36:54.211
<v Speaker 4>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she told me that dream and I </v>

1543
01:36:54.211 --> 01:36:54.211
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1544
01:36:54.211 --> 01:36:54.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably need to go see that snake.</v>

1545
01:36:55.900 --> 01:37:00.000
<v Speaker 4>And so I relaxed or quasi hypnotic </v>
<v Speaker 4>technique,</v>

1546
01:37:00.001 --> 01:37:05.001
<v Speaker 4>and it's very straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hypnosis is generally nothing but </v>

1547
01:37:05.001 --> 01:37:09.370
<v Speaker 4>pronounced relaxation low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be susceptible to hypnosis </v>

1548
01:37:09.370 --> 01:37:12.791
<v Speaker 4>to actually fall into a hypnotic trance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a consequence of being relaxed or </v>

1549
01:37:12.791 --> 01:37:16.361
<v Speaker 4>just relaxed her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had her breathe deeply and pay </v>

1550
01:37:16.361 --> 01:37:19.781
<v Speaker 4>attention to different parts of her body</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just relax her muscles one by one </v>

1551
01:37:19.781 --> 01:37:23.321
<v Speaker 4>essentially so that she could </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate and then I told her we play </v>

1552
01:37:23.321 --> 01:37:25.250
<v Speaker 4>with the dream a little bit and say </v>
<v Speaker 4>union technique.</v>

1553
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:26.210
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1554
01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:29.180
<v Speaker 4>so called the dream image to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which she could do quite well.</v>

1555
01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:29.930
<v Speaker 4>Said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1556
01:37:29.931 --> 01:37:31.670
<v Speaker 4>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's explore it.</v>

1557
01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.600
<v Speaker 4>So like pretend it's like pretend play </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1558
01:37:34.690 --> 01:37:36.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a kid in your pretend playing,</v>

1559
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:39.610
<v Speaker 4>you don't exactly direct the game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right you,</v>

1560
01:37:39.611 --> 01:37:41.330
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you play the game.</v>

1561
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:45.230
<v Speaker 4>So it's partly your direction obviously </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're the player,</v>

1562
01:37:45.231 --> 01:37:50.231
<v Speaker 4>but the thing also happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>spontaneously of its own accord and you </v>

1563
01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:54.191
<v Speaker 4>can think about that as a dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the conscious mind and the </v>

1564
01:37:54.191 --> 01:37:54.191
<v Speaker 4>unconscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In some sense,</v>

1565
01:37:54.191 --> 01:37:58.401
<v Speaker 4>it's developmental dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a fun game if you just direct </v>

1566
01:37:58.401 --> 01:37:58.410
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only a fun game.</v>

1567
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:02.420
<v Speaker 4>If you're inviting in something is </v>
<v Speaker 4>welling up as a consequences.</v>

1568
01:38:02.421 --> 01:38:03.950
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing that happens when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>

1569
01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.770
<v Speaker 4>You're engaged in some kind of artistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>or literary production.</v>

1570
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:10.100
<v Speaker 4>If it's all top down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1571
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:12.660
<v Speaker 4>if you're forcing it then it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda,</v>

1572
01:38:12.661 --> 01:38:13.230
<v Speaker 4>it's empty.</v>

1573
01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:18.530
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to sort of put yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a receptive state of mind in an </v>

1574
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:21.651
<v Speaker 4>imaginative state of mind and it's sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of half you and half nature itself </v>

1575
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.080
<v Speaker 4>manifesting itself in your creative </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagination.</v>

1576
01:38:25.081 --> 01:38:29.190
<v Speaker 4>And that was the sort of state that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were striving for and she,</v>

1577
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.910
<v Speaker 4>I asked her when she was in relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1578
01:38:32.911 --> 01:38:37.911
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about the snake </v>

1579
01:38:37.911 --> 01:38:37.911
<v Speaker 4>handler?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>

1580
01:38:37.911 --> 01:38:39.951
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's probably a charlatan and he's just </v>

1581
01:38:39.951 --> 01:38:39.951
<v Speaker 4>there trying to impress the crowd and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>show off.</v>

1582
01:38:39.951 --> 01:38:43.971
<v Speaker 4>And she was afraid to go up there </v>
<v Speaker 4>because she thought people would push </v>

1583
01:38:43.971 --> 01:38:43.971
<v Speaker 4>her towards the snake and she'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>touch it.</v>

1584
01:38:43.971 --> 01:38:46.200
<v Speaker 4>And so there was a fear of the crowd </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue going on there too.</v>

1585
01:38:46.201 --> 01:38:47.920
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well just look,</v>

1586
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:53.090
<v Speaker 4>go up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do it under these conditions is </v>

1587
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.090
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1588
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.910
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if people get pushy,</v>

1589
01:38:53.911 --> 01:38:54.750
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to tell them?</v>

1590
01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.580
<v Speaker 4>And so we figured out something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1591
01:38:56.581 --> 01:38:59.660
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just tell them that you know,</v>

1592
01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:04.740
<v Speaker 4>you want to look at the snake at your </v>
<v Speaker 4>own pace and that you don't need any </v>

1593
01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:07.290
<v Speaker 4>encouragement or help and it would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>good if you were just left alone,</v>

1594
01:39:07.291 --> 01:39:12.291
<v Speaker 4>so that enabled her to defend herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she was afraid that the crowd would </v>

1595
01:39:12.291 --> 01:39:13.260
<v Speaker 4>push her to do something that she didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to do.</v>

1596
01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:15.900
<v Speaker 4>That was part of the theme of the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

1597
01:39:15.901 --> 01:39:20.901
<v Speaker 4>she eventually climbed the Dune in her </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagination and went into the crowd and </v>

1598
01:39:20.901 --> 01:39:22.770
<v Speaker 4>the crowd turned out to be quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>welcoming and not hostile and not pushy,</v>

1599
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:24.510
<v Speaker 4>which isn't what you'd expect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1600
01:39:24.511 --> 01:39:29.511
<v Speaker 4>Because you'd think the crowd would have</v>
<v Speaker 4>reacted in accordance with their fears </v>

1601
01:39:29.511 --> 01:39:32.730
<v Speaker 4>since it was her fantasy that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing about fantasies.</v>

1602
01:39:32.731 --> 01:39:37.731
<v Speaker 4>They have this autonomous quality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the crowd was welcoming and not </v>

1603
01:39:37.731 --> 01:39:39.630
<v Speaker 4>hostile and it turned out that the snake</v>
<v Speaker 4>handler wasn't a charlatan.</v>

1604
01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:45.260
<v Speaker 4>He was just an old guy who had this </v>
<v Speaker 4>snake and he was out there just showing </v>

1605
01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:48.540
<v Speaker 4>it to people because he thought it was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool thing and and and that maybe it was</v>

1606
01:39:48.541 --> 01:39:52.080
<v Speaker 4>good for people to come and look at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>snake and so she got close enough to the</v>

1607
01:39:52.081 --> 01:39:53.670
<v Speaker 4>snake to touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so.</v>

1608
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:59.530
<v Speaker 4>So I'm telling you that because I want </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to understand a bit more about what </v>

1609
01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:00.930
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] was trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he wrote these books,</v>

1610
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:06.810
<v Speaker 4>notebooks that haven't been published </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet called the block books and the black</v>

1611
01:40:06.811 --> 01:40:11.811
<v Speaker 4>books are the documentation of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiments with his imagination and </v>

1612
01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:16.620
<v Speaker 4>what he would do is daydream like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a child daydreams.</v>

1613
01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:21.980
<v Speaker 4>He regained that faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although I think with us it was a </v>

1614
01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:21.980
<v Speaker 4>faculty that has never really </v>
<v Speaker 4>disappeared.</v>

1615
01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:27.110
<v Speaker 4>And he had figures of imagination that </v>
<v Speaker 4>came to him that he could speak with.</v>

1616
01:40:28.650 --> 01:40:33.650
<v Speaker 4>And he spoke with these figures of </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagination and documented that over a </v>

1617
01:40:33.650 --> 01:40:35.550
<v Speaker 4>very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was originally.</v>

1618
01:40:35.670 --> 01:40:40.670
<v Speaker 4>That was eventually distilled into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>book called the Red Book,</v>

1619
01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.820
<v Speaker 4>which was published about three or four </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1620
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:50.270
<v Speaker 4>And it was a book that young regarded as</v>
<v Speaker 4>the central source from which all his </v>

1621
01:40:52.021 --> 01:40:57.021
<v Speaker 4>inspiration emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of the way it looks to me is that </v>

1622
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:02.050
<v Speaker 4>we embody a lot of information in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>action,</v>

1623
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:07.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And our action has developed as a </v>

1624
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:11.221
<v Speaker 4>consequence of imitating other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not only the people or the people </v>

1625
01:41:11.221 --> 01:41:15.781
<v Speaker 4>around us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of course the people around us </v>

1626
01:41:15.781 --> 01:41:17.461
<v Speaker 4>imitated the people who came before them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and those people in mutated the people </v>

1627
01:41:17.461 --> 01:41:20.941
<v Speaker 4>who came before them and so on so far </v>
<v Speaker 4>back that it's as far back as you can </v>

1628
01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:25.591
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you embody these patterns of </v>

1629
01:41:25.591 --> 01:41:26.950
<v Speaker 4>behavior that are extremely informative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you don't understand,</v>

1630
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.040
<v Speaker 4>that are consequences of collective </v>
<v Speaker 4>imitation across the centuries.</v>

1631
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:35.050
<v Speaker 4>And then those patterns can become </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifest as figures of the imagination.</v>

1632
01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:41.350
<v Speaker 4>And those figures of imagination are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>distillations of patterns of behavior.</v>

1633
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:45.910
<v Speaker 4>And so as the distillations of patterns </v>
<v Speaker 4>of behavior,</v>

1634
01:41:45.911 --> 01:41:49.060
<v Speaker 4>they have content and it's not you that </v>
<v Speaker 4>content.</v>

1635
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:52.210
<v Speaker 4>It's you could even think about it as </v>
<v Speaker 4>content that's evolved.</v>

1636
01:41:52.211 --> 01:41:56.200
<v Speaker 4>Although it's culturally transmitted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's content that's evolved and so these</v>

1637
01:41:56.201 --> 01:42:01.201
<v Speaker 4>figures of the imagination can reveal </v>
<v Speaker 4>the structure of reality to you and </v>

1638
01:42:01.721 --> 01:42:04.540
<v Speaker 4>that's what happened with young and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what he described in the red book</v>

1639
01:42:04.541 --> 01:42:07.810
<v Speaker 4>and that was what permeated his </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology,</v>

1640
01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:13.590
<v Speaker 4>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was based on the presupposition </v>

1641
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:15.640
<v Speaker 4>that the fundamental architectural </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures of religious belief.</v>

1642
01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 4>We're not pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not deceitful,</v>

1643
01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:24.100
<v Speaker 4>not protective in some delusional sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the fear of death,</v>

1644
01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:29.340
<v Speaker 4>but quite the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the very stories that enabled us to move</v>

1645
01:42:29.801 --> 01:42:34.801
<v Speaker 4>forward as confident human beings in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>face of chaos itself and it's </v>

1646
01:42:36.641 --> 01:42:41.641
<v Speaker 4>conceivable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think perhaps probable that nothing </v>

1647
01:42:41.951 --> 01:42:46.951
<v Speaker 4>more important conceptually happened in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 20th century than that because it </v>

1648
01:42:48.851 --> 01:42:53.851
<v Speaker 4>was the first time post enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 4>that ever prashant between the intellect</v>

1649
01:42:55.871 --> 01:43:00.850
<v Speaker 4>and the underlying religious archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 4>substructure occurred.</v>

1650
01:43:01.210 --> 01:43:06.210
<v Speaker 4>You have in the capacious intellect of </v>
<v Speaker 4>young and the same thing happened to </v>

1651
01:43:06.210 --> 01:43:10.051
<v Speaker 4>some degree with piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The religious domain and the factual </v>

1652
01:43:10.051 --> 01:43:14.371
<v Speaker 4>domain were brought back together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact of young's enduring and </v>

1653
01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:18.070
<v Speaker 4>increasing popularity and influence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

1654
01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:20.950
<v Speaker 4>is a direct consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1655
01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:29.250
<v Speaker 4>Some of his work was spun off into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>new age and and the new age is a very </v>

1656
01:43:29.381 --> 01:43:34.381
<v Speaker 4>optimistic and naive movement is </v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated on the idea that you can do </v>

1657
01:43:34.381 --> 01:43:36.670
<v Speaker 4>nothing say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but follow your bliss and that will take</v>

1658
01:43:36.671 --> 01:43:41.671
<v Speaker 4>you ever hire to enlightenment and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the union idea at all.</v>

1659
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:48.510
<v Speaker 4>The union idea is that what you most </v>
<v Speaker 4>need will be found where you least want </v>

1660
01:43:49.061 --> 01:43:51.830
<v Speaker 4>to look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this story,</v>

1661
01:43:51.831 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 4>King</v>

1662
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.690
<v Speaker 5>Arthur,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the story of King Arthur,</v>

1663
01:43:53.691 --> 01:43:55.310
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all in a round table,</v>

1664
01:43:55.311 --> 01:43:56.960
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>King Arthur and his knights,</v>

1665
01:43:56.961 --> 01:43:59.290
<v Speaker 5>they're all equals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all super ordinate,</v>

1666
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:02.150
<v Speaker 5>but they're all equals and they go off </v>
<v Speaker 5>to look for the holy grail.</v>

1667
01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:07.430
<v Speaker 5>The holy grail is the container of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>redemptive substance,</v>

1668
01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:12.470
<v Speaker 5>whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>might be the cup that Christ used at the</v>

1669
01:44:12.471 --> 01:44:17.471
<v Speaker 5>last supper might be jealous that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>used to capture his blood on the cross,</v>

1670
01:44:17.721 --> 01:44:20.690
<v Speaker 5>right when he was pierced by a sword.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The stories differ,</v>

1671
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:23.210
<v Speaker 5>but that's the holy grail and the holy </v>
<v Speaker 5>grail is lost.</v>

1672
01:44:23.211 --> 01:44:28.211
<v Speaker 5>That's the redemptive substance and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>knights of King Arthur go off to search </v>

1673
01:44:28.211 --> 01:44:30.020
<v Speaker 5>for the holy grail and but they don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know where to look,</v>

1674
01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:35.560
<v Speaker 5>so where do you look when you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 5>where to look for something you need </v>

1675
01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:38.080
<v Speaker 5>desperately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've lost.</v>

1676
01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:43.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>each of the nights goes into the forest </v>

1677
01:44:43.890 --> 01:44:45.751
<v Speaker 5>at the point that looks darkest to him </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's union psychoanalysis in a </v>

1678
01:44:46.061 --> 01:44:51.061
<v Speaker 5>nutshell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like that which you fear and avoid </v>

1679
01:44:51.061 --> 01:44:54.781
<v Speaker 5>that which you hold in contempt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that which disgusts you and that you </v>

1680
01:44:54.781 --> 01:44:59.011
<v Speaker 5>avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the gateway to what you need to </v>

1681
01:44:59.011 --> 01:45:00.130
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing new agey about that.</v>

1682
01:45:00.670 --> 01:45:03.610
<v Speaker 5>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1683
01:45:03.611 --> 01:45:05.260
<v Speaker 5>young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he started this endeavor,</v>

1684
01:45:06.190 --> 01:45:11.190
<v Speaker 5>we started with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is part of the notebooks from the </v>

1685
01:45:11.190 --> 01:45:11.190
<v Speaker 5>block book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said</v>

1686
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:15.500
<v Speaker 5>he wrote my soul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my soul.</v>

1687
01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:17.030
<v Speaker 5>Where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you hear me?</v>

1688
01:45:17.031 --> 01:45:18.740
<v Speaker 5>I speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I call you.</v>

1689
01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.890
<v Speaker 5>Are you there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've returned.</v>

1690
01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:27.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm here again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've shaken the dust of all the lands </v>

1691
01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:29.360
<v Speaker 5>from my feet and I've come to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm with you.</v>

1692
01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:35.200
<v Speaker 5>After long years of long wandering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have come to you again for the unions.</v>

1693
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:42.070
<v Speaker 5>The Hero's journey is a journey within </v>
<v Speaker 5>and and I think that that's probably the</v>

1694
01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:49.240
<v Speaker 5>bias of introverts to believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hero's journey isn't only an inward </v>

1695
01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:54.041
<v Speaker 5>journey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that it can be an outward </v>

1696
01:45:54.041 --> 01:45:54.920
<v Speaker 5>journey too because I don't think it </v>
<v Speaker 5>matters where you confront the unknown,</v>

1697
01:45:54.921 --> 01:45:59.921
<v Speaker 5>whether it's within her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without what matters is whether or not </v>

1698
01:45:59.921 --> 01:46:01.900
<v Speaker 5>you confront the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what matters,</v>

1699
01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:12.720
<v Speaker 5>but he found that what he had ignored </v>
<v Speaker 5>was an undiscovered part of themselves,</v>

1700
01:46:13.141 --> 01:46:18.070
<v Speaker 5>so that might be something that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>equivalent to Huxley's notion that there</v>

1701
01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:23.071
<v Speaker 5>were tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tremendous potential breadth in the </v>

1702
01:46:23.071 --> 01:46:26.371
<v Speaker 5>realm of human conscious experience and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Huxley was influenced to some degree by </v>

1703
01:46:26.371 --> 01:46:30.181
<v Speaker 5>Yung.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now Yung knew of Huxley's experiments </v>

1704
01:46:30.181 --> 01:46:33.490
<v Speaker 5>and had commented on psychedelic use and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said something like,</v>

1705
01:46:33.670 --> 01:46:35.830
<v Speaker 5>beware of wisdom you did not earn.</v>

1706
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:40.640
<v Speaker 5>And Don was very good at stating things </v>
<v Speaker 5>very profoundly,</v>

1707
01:46:40.641 --> 01:46:45.641
<v Speaker 5>very simply.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a very intelligent piece of </v>

1708
01:46:45.641 --> 01:46:45.770
<v Speaker 5>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Be Aware of wisdom you did not earn.</v>

1709
01:46:45.771 --> 01:46:49.410
<v Speaker 5>He wrote a paper if you're interested in</v>
<v Speaker 5>this sort thing.</v>

1710
01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:53.910
<v Speaker 5>He wrote a paper called the relations </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the ego and the unconscious,</v>

1711
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:59.300
<v Speaker 5>which is an absolute master work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but completely incomprehensible unless </v>

1712
01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:00.990
<v Speaker 5>you know what it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you know what it's about and what</v>

1713
01:47:00.991 --> 01:47:04.620
<v Speaker 5>it's about is the danger of what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>called ego inflation,</v>

1714
01:47:04.621 --> 01:47:09.621
<v Speaker 5>and so one of the things that can happen</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a consequence of a revelatory </v>

1715
01:47:09.621 --> 01:47:12.621
<v Speaker 5>experience is that the division between </v>
<v Speaker 5>the individual ego and and the and what </v>

1716
01:47:15.961 --> 01:47:20.961
<v Speaker 5>would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so hard to come up with a word that </v>

1717
01:47:20.961 --> 01:47:23.841
<v Speaker 5>isn't somehow naive or or or cliched,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to erase the relationship,</v>

1718
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:31.550
<v Speaker 5>the boundary between the specific </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness of the ego and the more </v>

1719
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:35.721
<v Speaker 5>generalized consciousness and more </v>
<v Speaker 5>generalized consciousness as such,</v>

1720
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:42.300
<v Speaker 5>is a dangerous thing to do because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can start to equate yourself,</v>

1721
01:47:42.301 --> 01:47:46.440
<v Speaker 5>your specific self with that more </v>
<v Speaker 5>generalized consciousness as such,</v>

1722
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:51.950
<v Speaker 5>and you thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it something akin to a psychotic </v>

1723
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:55.281
<v Speaker 5>inflation and the paper relations </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the ego and the unconscious is a</v>

1724
01:47:56.221 --> 01:47:58.590
<v Speaker 5>document that tells you how to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1725
01:47:59.190 --> 01:47:59.970
<v Speaker 5>If you're</v>

1726
01:48:02.890 --> 01:48:07.890
<v Speaker 5>playing in this kind of realm and one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the injunctions is to keep your feet on </v>

1727
01:48:09.431 --> 01:48:14.431
<v Speaker 5>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He thought that was what partly what </v>

1728
01:48:14.431 --> 01:48:16.300
<v Speaker 5>happened to Nisha was that Nina wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>grounded enough in life.</v>

1729
01:48:16.301 --> 01:48:20.560
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't grounded enough in day to day </v>
<v Speaker 5>rituals and routines and the mundane.</v>

1730
01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:23.830
<v Speaker 5>Now you can debate whether or not that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>the case,</v>

1731
01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.510
<v Speaker 5>whether or not that's a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument,</v>

1732
01:48:25.511 --> 01:48:29.410
<v Speaker 5>but that was still what you unbelieved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1733
01:48:29.411 --> 01:48:34.411
<v Speaker 5>so why am I telling you all this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll finish with this from December 19,</v>

1734
01:48:35.681 --> 01:48:40.681
<v Speaker 5>13 onward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Young Carrie going in the same </v>

1735
01:48:40.681 --> 01:48:42.811
<v Speaker 5>procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deliberately evoking a fantasy in a </v>

1736
01:48:42.811 --> 01:48:43.150
<v Speaker 5>waking state and then entering into it </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a drama.</v>

1737
01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:48.420
<v Speaker 5>These fantasies may be understood as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>type of dramatize thinking in pictorial </v>

1738
01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:49.030
<v Speaker 5>form.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In retrospect,</v>

1739
01:48:49.031 --> 01:48:54.031
<v Speaker 5>he recalled that his scientific question</v>
<v Speaker 5>was to see what took place when he </v>

1740
01:48:54.031 --> 01:48:57.631
<v Speaker 5>switched off consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The example of dreams indicated the </v>

1741
01:48:57.631 --> 01:49:01.531
<v Speaker 5>existence of background activity and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to give this a possibility of </v>

1742
01:49:01.531 --> 01:49:02.830
<v Speaker 5>emerging just as one does when taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>masculine.</v>

1743
01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:05.320
<v Speaker 5>These journals are youngest </v>
<v Speaker 5>contemporary,</v>

1744
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:10.350
<v Speaker 5>contemporaneous clinical ledger to his </v>
<v Speaker 5>most difficult experiment or what he </v>

1745
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:13.720
<v Speaker 5>later describes as a voyage of discovery</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the other pole of the world,</v>

1746
01:49:14.410 --> 01:49:16.330
<v Speaker 5>young unbelief that we were dreaming all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>

1747
01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:22.320
<v Speaker 5>but that during waking life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that pressure of external images was </v>

1748
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:26.260
<v Speaker 5>such that the unconscious fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagery was,</v>

1749
01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.610
<v Speaker 5>or that the fantasy imagery was of </v>
<v Speaker 5>insufficient magnitude to be conscious,</v>

1750
01:49:30.611 --> 01:49:34.420
<v Speaker 5>but that we were always situated in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>dream in relationship to the world.</v>

1751
01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:35.780
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

1752
01:49:44.490 --> 01:49:49.490
<v Speaker 5>when we started talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>creation of the universe at the </v>

1753
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:54.401
<v Speaker 5>beginning of the genesis stories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I spent quite a long time setting the </v>

1754
01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:55.530
<v Speaker 5>stage for the stories because</v>

1755
01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:02.040
<v Speaker 5>there's no point in having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation about the God who gives </v>

1756
01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:05.371
<v Speaker 5>rise to being unless you have some sense</v>
<v Speaker 5>of what that might conceivably mean to </v>

1757
01:50:05.371 --> 01:50:10.351
<v Speaker 5>the modern mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I felt the same way about </v>

1758
01:50:10.351 --> 01:50:13.860
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood Amec stories is I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>get a handle on them until I could </v>

1759
01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:17.890
<v Speaker 5>understand and articulate more clearly </v>
<v Speaker 5>what it might mean.</v>

1760
01:50:18.730 --> 01:50:22.880
<v Speaker 5>How a modern person might understand a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1761
01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:26.740
<v Speaker 5>a direct experience of God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the first question would be,</v>

1762
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:32.550
<v Speaker 5>is such a thing possible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer that seems to be a </v>

1763
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:33.280
<v Speaker 5>qualified yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1764
01:50:33.281 --> 01:50:36.100
<v Speaker 5>it's a universal human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a very strange thing.</v>

1765
01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:41.520
<v Speaker 5>It's not something that people have made</v>
<v Speaker 5>up as Freud might have it as a defense </v>

1766
01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:43.750
<v Speaker 5>against death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a tenable hypothesis.</v>

1767
01:50:44.110 --> 01:50:49.110
<v Speaker 5>It's a realm of potential experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that experience doesn't necessarily </v>

1768
01:50:49.211 --> 01:50:52.450
<v Speaker 5>have to have the Judeo Christian content</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we've been discussing.</v>

1769
01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.450
<v Speaker 5>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are manifestations of this,</v>

1770
01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:00.800
<v Speaker 5>these alternative forms of consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 5>all over the world that take on their </v>

1771
01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:01.810
<v Speaker 5>own peculiar forms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although their pattern to some degree,</v>

1772
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.430
<v Speaker 5>that's like the hero myth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1773
01:51:03.431 --> 01:51:08.431
<v Speaker 5>of myth of the fight against the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 5>seems to be unbelievably widespread and </v>

1774
01:51:08.431 --> 01:51:09.730
<v Speaker 5>so it's not as if it's random.</v>

1775
01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:15.230
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should just see what time it is here,</v>

1776
01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:26.380
<v Speaker 5>but there's not much point in having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion about what happens to Abraham</v>

1777
01:51:27.010 --> 01:51:32.010
<v Speaker 5>unless you can conceptualize it in terms</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are amenable to modern skeptical </v>

1778
01:51:32.231 --> 01:51:37.231
<v Speaker 5>consciousness so we can establish the </v>
<v Speaker 5>proposition that mystical experience is </v>

1779
01:51:37.231 --> 01:51:41.521
<v Speaker 5>not only possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's quite common and it's inducible in </v>

1780
01:51:41.521 --> 01:51:44.701
<v Speaker 5>a variety of ways and the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 5>which it's inducible is reliable and </v>

1781
01:51:44.701 --> 01:51:49.141
<v Speaker 5>there's no evidence as well that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>pathological in in fact there's a fair </v>

1782
01:51:49.141 --> 01:51:52.441
<v Speaker 5>bit of evidence that the patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior that are associated with the </v>

1783
01:51:52.441 --> 01:51:55.480
<v Speaker 5>mystical experience are core elements of</v>
<v Speaker 5>proper human adaptation in the world.</v>

1784
01:52:19.670 --> 01:52:22.310
<v Speaker 5>The Abrahamic stories open up with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>manifest God.</v>

1785
01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:27.340
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm going to read you some things </v>
<v Speaker 5>from Friedman who wrote the </v>

1786
01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:27.340
<v Speaker 5>disappearance of God.</v>

1787
01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:31.140
<v Speaker 5>He was trying to look at the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure of the stories.</v>

1788
01:52:31.141 --> 01:52:36.141
<v Speaker 5>Now no freedom and noted that the books </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Old Testament were written by a </v>

1789
01:52:36.141 --> 01:52:41.011
<v Speaker 5>lot of different people at very </v>
<v Speaker 5>different times and then they were </v>

1790
01:52:41.011 --> 01:52:45.271
<v Speaker 5>sequenced by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For reasons that we don't exactly </v>

1791
01:52:45.271 --> 01:52:49.531
<v Speaker 5>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's still an underlying </v>

1792
01:52:49.531 --> 01:52:53.561
<v Speaker 5>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's multiple underlying narrative </v>

1793
01:52:53.561 --> 01:52:56.351
<v Speaker 5>unity's despite the fact of that rather </v>
<v Speaker 5>arbitrary sequencing and that's a </v>

1794
01:52:56.351 --> 01:52:57.430
<v Speaker 5>strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1795
01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:01.130
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could say if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>collection of ancient books and you were</v>

1796
01:53:01.131 --> 01:53:03.830
<v Speaker 5>trying to put them together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you try to put them together in some way</v>

1797
01:53:03.831 --> 01:53:05.970
<v Speaker 5>that made sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1798
01:53:05.971 --> 01:53:10.971
<v Speaker 5>and it wouldn't make sense unless you </v>
<v Speaker 5>stumbled across some kind of underlying </v>

1799
01:53:10.971 --> 01:53:11.480
<v Speaker 5>narrative that allowed you to order </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

1800
01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:17.160
<v Speaker 5>and so it's not entirely surprising that</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are ordered in a manner that's </v>

1801
01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:21.191
<v Speaker 5>comprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Friedman's comments on the </v>

1802
01:53:21.191 --> 01:53:23.150
<v Speaker 5>underlying narrative structure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of it was,</v>

1803
01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:25.070
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll go through this.</v>

1804
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:30.250
<v Speaker 5>The books of the Old Testament were </v>
<v Speaker 5>composed by a great many authors </v>

1805
01:53:30.250 --> 01:53:31.130
<v Speaker 5>according to both traditional religious </v>
<v Speaker 5>views in modern critical scholarship,</v>

1806
01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:36.610
<v Speaker 5>the phenomenon of the diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparent presence of God across so many </v>

1807
01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:40.151
<v Speaker 5>stories through so many books by so many</v>
<v Speaker 5>authors spread over so many centuries is</v>

1808
01:53:40.161 --> 01:53:44.060
<v Speaker 5>consistent enough to be striking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>impressive and ultimately mysterious,</v>

1809
01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:48.890
<v Speaker 5>but the hiding of the divine phase is </v>
<v Speaker 5>only half the story.</v>

1810
01:53:48.891 --> 01:53:53.891
<v Speaker 5>There's another development also </v>
<v Speaker 5>extending across the course of the </v>

1811
01:53:53.891 --> 01:53:55.190
<v Speaker 5>entire narrative of the Hebrew Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we must see before.</v>

1812
01:53:55.191 --> 01:54:00.191
<v Speaker 5>We can appreciate the full force of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomena and before we can pose the </v>

1813
01:54:00.191 --> 01:54:01.400
<v Speaker 5>solution to the mystery of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of how this happened,</v>

1814
01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:04.040
<v Speaker 5>gradually from genesis to Ezra,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an estimate,</v>

1815
01:54:04.090 --> 01:54:08.450
<v Speaker 5>there is a transition from divine to </v>
<v Speaker 5>human responsibility for life on earth.</v>

1816
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:13.490
<v Speaker 5>The story begins in genesis with God in </v>
<v Speaker 5>complete control of the creation,</v>

1817
01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:18.670
<v Speaker 5>but by the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>humans have arrived at a stage at which </v>

1818
01:54:18.670 --> 01:54:19.490
<v Speaker 5>in all apparent ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have responsibility for the fate of</v>

1819
01:54:19.491 --> 01:54:22.310
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first two human beings,</v>

1820
01:54:24.570 --> 01:54:27.000
<v Speaker 5>Adam and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take little responsibility themselves.</v>

1821
01:54:27.690 --> 01:54:32.690
<v Speaker 5>They do not be design or build anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they're embarrassed over their </v>

1822
01:54:32.690 --> 01:54:32.690
<v Speaker 5>nudity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do not make clothes.</v>

1823
01:54:32.850 --> 01:54:37.850
<v Speaker 5>They cover themselves with leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's God who makes their first clothing </v>

1824
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:37.850
<v Speaker 5>for them.</v>

1825
01:54:38.610 --> 01:54:43.610
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm by no means a fully developed </v>

1826
01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:43.610
<v Speaker 5>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1827
01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:44.460
<v Speaker 5>it is not an every man either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Broadly speaking,</v>

1828
01:54:44.461 --> 01:54:48.150
<v Speaker 5>he reflects a step beyond Adam and eve </v>
<v Speaker 5>and human character and responsibility.</v>

1829
01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:54.380
<v Speaker 5>Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 5>beyond that counts of divine commands </v>

1830
01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:56.310
<v Speaker 5>that Abraham does carry out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The narrative also includes a variety of</v>

1831
01:54:56.311 --> 01:54:59.100
<v Speaker 5>stories in which Abraham acts on his own</v>
<v Speaker 5>initiative.</v>

1832
01:54:59.250 --> 01:55:02.070
<v Speaker 5>He divides land with his nephew lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He battles kings.</v>

1833
01:55:02.071 --> 01:55:04.950
<v Speaker 5>He takes concubines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he argues with his wife Sarah,</v>

1834
01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:07.140
<v Speaker 5>on two occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he tells kings that Sarah,</v>

1835
01:55:07.190 --> 01:55:08.790
<v Speaker 5>his sister,</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of fear,</v>

1836
01:55:08.791 --> 01:55:13.791
<v Speaker 5>that they will kill him to get his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he arranges his son's marriage in </v>

1837
01:55:13.791 --> 01:55:15.120
<v Speaker 5>the place of the single story of Noah's </v>
<v Speaker 5>drunkenness.</v>

1838
01:55:15.121 --> 01:55:20.121
<v Speaker 5>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the case of Abraham the stories of </v>

1839
01:55:20.121 --> 01:55:22.281
<v Speaker 5>man's life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Abraham section thus develops the </v>

1840
01:55:22.281 --> 01:55:25.581
<v Speaker 5>personality and character of a man of </v>
<v Speaker 5>man to a new degree in biblical </v>

1841
01:55:25.581 --> 01:55:27.150
<v Speaker 5>narrative will picturing and him a new </v>
<v Speaker 5>degree of responsibility.</v>

1842
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:29.970
<v Speaker 5>It is not just that Abraham has kindler </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinder,</v>

1843
01:55:29.971 --> 01:55:31.200
<v Speaker 5>gentler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more intrepid,</v>

1844
01:55:31.201 --> 01:55:36.201
<v Speaker 5>more ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or a better debater than his ancestor </v>

1845
01:55:36.201 --> 01:55:36.201
<v Speaker 5>noah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rather.</v>

1846
01:55:36.201 --> 01:55:40.281
<v Speaker 5>Both the Noah and Abraham stories or </v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces of a development of an </v>

1847
01:55:40.281 --> 01:55:41.610
<v Speaker 5>increasingly stronger stance of humans </v>
<v Speaker 5>relative to the deity.</v>

1848
01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.670
<v Speaker 5>Before the story is over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>humans will become a great deal,</v>

1849
01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:46.500
<v Speaker 5>stronger and bolder than Abraham.</v>

1850
01:55:55.650 --> 01:55:57.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1851
01:55:59.310 --> 01:56:02.070
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it isn't.</v>

1852
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:07.380
<v Speaker 5>It is certainly the case that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual exists in the modern world,</v>

1853
01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:10.710
<v Speaker 5>the differentiated self aware,</v>
<v Speaker 5>self conscious individual,</v>

1854
01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:15.860
<v Speaker 5>and it's certainly the case that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't the case at some point in the </v>

1855
01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:17.460
<v Speaker 5>past and so it's the case that there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>been a development.</v>

1856
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you could call it a </v>
<v Speaker 5>progression,</v>

1857
01:56:19.531 --> 01:56:24.531
<v Speaker 5>but a development of the autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual over some span of historical </v>

1858
01:56:24.721 --> 01:56:26.790
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we don't know how long that's been,</v>

1859
01:56:26.791 --> 01:56:29.640
<v Speaker 5>but my suspicions are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't been that long.</v>

1860
01:56:29.641 --> 01:56:31.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean</v>

1861
01:56:34.170 --> 01:56:39.170
<v Speaker 5>I read once about a Neolithic ceremony </v>
<v Speaker 5>that involve the particular placement of</v>

1862
01:56:40.021 --> 01:56:45.021
<v Speaker 5>a bear skull in a cave and then I read </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and they had found these placements</v>

1863
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:52.790
<v Speaker 5>in caves that were at least 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years old and then I read that they </v>

1864
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:56.421
<v Speaker 5>found caves in Japan among the Ainu who </v>
<v Speaker 5>were the indigenous inhabitants of </v>

1865
01:56:56.421 --> 01:57:01.071
<v Speaker 5>Japanese territory and rather archaic </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who had the same ceremony with </v>

1866
01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:05.940
<v Speaker 5>the bear and that put the skull in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same orientation and place in caves.</v>

1867
01:57:06.150 --> 01:57:09.720
<v Speaker 5>And that that tradition remained </v>
<v Speaker 5>unbroken for about 25,000</v>

1868
01:57:09.721 --> 01:57:11.310
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you think it will.</v>

1869
01:57:11.311 --> 01:57:16.311
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible for an oral or ritual </v>
<v Speaker 5>tradition to remain unbroken for spans </v>

1870
01:57:16.311 --> 01:57:19.050
<v Speaker 5>of tens of thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the answer to that is not only is it</v>

1871
01:57:19.051 --> 01:57:22.170
<v Speaker 5>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's actually the norm because like</v>

1872
01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.660
<v Speaker 5>one chimpanzee is like the next </v>
<v Speaker 5>chimpanzee,</v>

1873
01:57:25.690 --> 01:57:27.340
<v Speaker 5>right in the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the progression,</v>

1874
01:57:27.341 --> 01:57:32.341
<v Speaker 5>in the biological progression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you took a chimpanzee troop now and </v>

1875
01:57:32.341 --> 01:57:35.971
<v Speaker 5>you went back 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years and you looked at a chimpanzee </v>

1876
01:57:35.971 --> 01:57:35.971
<v Speaker 5>troop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'd be the same thing.</v>

1877
01:57:35.971 --> 01:57:39.811
<v Speaker 5>There's no historical progression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how you can tell the chimps </v>

1878
01:57:39.811 --> 01:57:41.920
<v Speaker 5>really don't have culture because if </v>
<v Speaker 5>they could even accrete one,</v>

1879
01:57:41.921 --> 01:57:46.450
<v Speaker 5>1000th of a percent of culture </v>
<v Speaker 5>transmissible culture progeneration,</v>

1880
01:57:46.690 --> 01:57:49.570
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't take more than about a </v>
<v Speaker 5>million years before they'd have a whole</v>

1881
01:57:49.571 --> 01:57:53.980
<v Speaker 5>civilization and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're the same as they were and so the</v>

1882
01:57:53.981 --> 01:57:58.981
<v Speaker 5>continuity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stability and unchanging nature of </v>

1883
01:57:58.981 --> 01:58:02.461
<v Speaker 5>his species,</v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially speaking is the rule that </v>

1884
01:58:02.461 --> 01:58:06.990
<v Speaker 5>the variant is us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like what the hell happened after </v>

1885
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:07.990
<v Speaker 5>the last ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15,000</v>

1886
01:58:07.991 --> 01:58:12.991
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we went from tribal uniform stable to </v>

1887
01:58:13.151 --> 01:58:18.151
<v Speaker 5>whatever the hell we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this transition from generic too </v>

1888
01:58:19.101 --> 01:58:24.101
<v Speaker 5>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that and I can't </v>

1889
01:58:24.101 --> 01:58:26.021
<v Speaker 5>help but think that that's reflected in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this text and it has something to do </v>

1890
01:58:26.021 --> 01:58:27.440
<v Speaker 5>with this transition of consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>

1891
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:32.690
<v Speaker 5>from what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>From possession by the generic divine to</v>

1892
01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.020
<v Speaker 5>dominance by this specific individual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If something like that,</v>

1893
01:58:36.021 --> 01:58:40.800
<v Speaker 5>is that a neurological transformation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what this is a record of being?</v>

1894
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>

1895
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:47.010
<v Speaker 4>One of the things you said about God </v>
<v Speaker 4>because young's relationship with God as</v>

1896
01:58:47.291 --> 01:58:52.291
<v Speaker 4>an object of belief is very complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hidden in his technical writing,</v>

1897
01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:55.870
<v Speaker 4>he always talks about the image of God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never talks about God.</v>

1898
01:58:55.871 --> 01:59:00.871
<v Speaker 4>He talks about the image of God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that the image of God dwells </v>

1899
01:59:00.871 --> 01:59:04.321
<v Speaker 4>within us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the same thing as God dwelling </v>

1900
01:59:04.321 --> 01:59:04.321
<v Speaker 4>within.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1901
01:59:04.321 --> 01:59:07.810
<v Speaker 4>Because we could mean all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>capacities that we have for transcendent</v>

1902
01:59:07.811 --> 01:59:10.540
<v Speaker 4>consciousness could be a byproduct of </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological evolution.</v>

1903
01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:15.160
<v Speaker 4>They could have no reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can have no relationship whatsoever</v>

1904
01:59:15.161 --> 01:59:20.161
<v Speaker 4>to an actual transcendent reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way of telling the </v>

1905
01:59:20.161 --> 01:59:22.120
<v Speaker 4>transcendent reality seems to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself as an element of experience,</v>

1906
01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:23.800
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that it has in </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality,</v>

1907
01:59:23.801 --> 01:59:27.580
<v Speaker 4>outside of this objective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's even if it exists as it is,</v>

1908
01:59:27.581 --> 01:59:29.370
<v Speaker 4>it clearly does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1909
01:59:41.150 --> 01:59:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Friedman suggests that what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the biblical narrative is the </v>

1910
01:59:46.150 --> 01:59:50.111
<v Speaker 4>sequential emergence of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a redemptive force and that the old </v>

1911
01:59:51.351 --> 01:59:56.351
<v Speaker 4>testament documents that implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unconsciously as a consequence of </v>

1912
01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:02.440
<v Speaker 4>descriptive fantasy and that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on in the book and that so </v>

1913
02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:08.600
<v Speaker 4>the Cosmos is under the control of </v>
<v Speaker 4>generic daddy to begin with,</v>

1914
02:00:08.601 --> 02:00:13.601
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then that controls shifts to </v>

1915
02:00:13.601 --> 02:00:15.230
<v Speaker 4>localized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>identifiable,</v>

1916
02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 4>increasingly personal and detailed </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals and you see that in Noah and</v>

1917
02:00:21.381 --> 02:00:26.381
<v Speaker 4>then you see the neighborhood and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you see it in Moses and then there's </v>

1918
02:00:26.381 --> 02:00:30.400
<v Speaker 4>this working out of what it would mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a fully developed individual and </v>

1919
02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.450
<v Speaker 4>that's what these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're there,</v>

1920
02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:33.830
<v Speaker 4>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like prototypes.</v>

1921
02:00:33.831 --> 02:00:38.831
<v Speaker 4>There are attempts to to to bring about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the proper motive being right and so </v>

1922
02:00:39.441 --> 02:00:44.441
<v Speaker 4>Abraham is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a manifestation of that because he </v>

1923
02:00:44.441 --> 02:00:44.441
<v Speaker 4>enters into a covenant with God.</v>

1924
02:00:44.441 --> 02:00:46.100
<v Speaker 4>He's selected by God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interest into a partnership with God.</v>

1925
02:00:46.101 --> 02:00:51.101
<v Speaker 4>It's not exactly obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God provides him with forward motion and</v>

1926
02:00:51.891 --> 02:00:56.891
<v Speaker 4>intuition and leads them towards a </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful mode of being and it's </v>

1927
02:00:57.561 --> 02:00:59.630
<v Speaker 4>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful mode being because Abraham is</v>

1928
02:00:59.631 --> 02:01:02.060
<v Speaker 4>a very complex life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty of ups and downs,</v>

1929
02:01:02.061 --> 02:01:07.061
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not unbroken purity of being </v>

1930
02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:11.090
<v Speaker 4>towards a divine hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham lies and cheats and deceives and</v>

1931
02:01:11.091 --> 02:01:16.040
<v Speaker 4>does all sorts of things that that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>real person would do and and Moses,</v>

1932
02:01:16.041 --> 02:01:21.041
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kill someone and so these people that </v>

1933
02:01:21.041 --> 02:01:22.220
<v Speaker 4>the biblical people are very genuine </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals,</v>

1934
02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:24.860
<v Speaker 4>but they're given with all their faults,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1935
02:01:24.861 --> 02:01:26.600
<v Speaker 4>with all their sins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with all their deceit,</v>

1936
02:01:26.601 --> 02:01:31.601
<v Speaker 4>they're still put forth as potential </v>
<v Speaker 4>modes of proper models of potential </v>

1937
02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:37.240
<v Speaker 4>proper being in the world and the entire</v>
<v Speaker 4>Corpus of the Bible seems to be nothing </v>

1938
02:01:37.641 --> 02:01:40.580
<v Speaker 4>but an attempt to keep up variance</v>

1939
02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:45.580
<v Speaker 5>of the personality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to experiment to find out what </v>

1940
02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:49.160
<v Speaker 5>personality works in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>

1941
02:01:49.161 --> 02:01:54.161
<v Speaker 5>from a Christian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that culminates in the figure of Christ </v>

1942
02:01:54.161 --> 02:01:56.300
<v Speaker 5>as the redemptive word and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated as we've already talked about</v>

1943
02:01:56.301 --> 02:02:00.680
<v Speaker 5>with the force that brought order out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>chaos.</v>

1944
02:02:00.681 --> 02:02:05.681
<v Speaker 5>At the beginning of time and so well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's my attempt to provide proper </v>

1945
02:02:09.891 --> 02:02:14.891
<v Speaker 5>context for the understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Abrahamic stories and so hopefully with </v>

1946
02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:20.800
<v Speaker 5>that context we can move forward being </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to swallow the camel so to speak,</v>

1947
02:02:23.001 --> 02:02:28.001
<v Speaker 5>of the initial presence of God in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories and so we'll return to all of </v>

1948
02:02:29.211 --> 02:02:30.860
<v Speaker 5>that next week.</v>

1949
02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1950
02:02:48.850 --> 02:02:53.850
<v Speaker 5>Let's wait one second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Until people have an opportunity to </v>

1951
02:02:53.850 --> 02:02:55.900
<v Speaker 5>leave,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would very much like to ask the people</v>

1952
02:02:55.901 --> 02:03:00.901
<v Speaker 5>who are asking the questions to take a </v>
<v Speaker 5>few seconds before they asked the </v>

1953
02:03:00.901 --> 02:03:04.150
<v Speaker 5>question and make sure that the mic is </v>
<v Speaker 5>positioned properly so that everyone can</v>

1954
02:03:04.151 --> 02:03:09.151
<v Speaker 5>hear you because people keep writing and</v>
<v Speaker 5>complaining that while they're very </v>

1955
02:03:09.151 --> 02:03:13.261
<v Speaker 5>happy with the questions and I would say</v>
<v Speaker 5>the questions have been a very high </v>

1956
02:03:13.261 --> 02:03:16.411
<v Speaker 5>caliber so far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not very happy that they </v>

1957
02:03:16.411 --> 02:03:18.871
<v Speaker 5>can't hear them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I know that you're obviously nervous </v>

1958
02:03:18.871 --> 02:03:19.960
<v Speaker 5>and in a hurry when you want to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 5>a question,</v>

1959
02:03:19.961 --> 02:03:24.961
<v Speaker 5>but take a second or two to set the mic </v>
<v Speaker 5>up properly and make sure that everyone </v>

1960
02:03:24.961 --> 02:03:27.970
<v Speaker 5>can hear you and so have a way out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It blew Dr.</v>

1961
02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:28.750
<v Speaker 5>Peter says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1962
02:03:28.751 --> 02:03:31.910
<v Speaker 5>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to ask you</v>

1963
02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:34.230
<v Speaker 7>about two different psychological </v>
<v Speaker 7>disorders.</v>

1964
02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:37.020
<v Speaker 7>The first being borderline personality </v>
<v Speaker 7>disorder,</v>

1965
02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:42.380
<v Speaker 7>so two lectures ago,</v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody asks you about it and you gave </v>

1966
02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:45.720
<v Speaker 7>a very sparse answer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't remember exactly what you said,</v>

1967
02:03:45.721 --> 02:03:50.721
<v Speaker 7>but it seemed like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was too much complexity to just </v>

1968
02:03:51.931 --> 02:03:54.270
<v Speaker 7>answer it right there and then.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then somebody else.</v>

1969
02:03:54.271 --> 02:03:59.271
<v Speaker 7>All Cox asked you about the same </v>
<v Speaker 7>disorder in your Patriot on live stream </v>

1970
02:03:59.271 --> 02:04:02.970
<v Speaker 7>recently and when they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when they asked you that you kind of,</v>

1971
02:04:03.450 --> 02:04:06.510
<v Speaker 7>you kind of stopped for a moment and </v>
<v Speaker 7>something I don't know,</v>

1972
02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:11.640
<v Speaker 7>something kind of flicked on in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>head and it seemed like in you and you </v>

1973
02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:12.930
<v Speaker 7>thought for a couple seconds and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>you said,</v>

1974
02:04:12.931 --> 02:04:17.931
<v Speaker 7>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that I can answer that </v>

1975
02:04:17.931 --> 02:04:18.990
<v Speaker 7>right now because it's just too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just too bloody complex.</v>

1976
02:04:19.290 --> 02:04:24.290
<v Speaker 7>And I was wondering just like many young</v>
<v Speaker 7>men have gravitated towards your </v>

1977
02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:30.591
<v Speaker 7>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you think that there's something </v>

1978
02:04:30.591 --> 02:04:32.301
<v Speaker 7>about this particular disorder that a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's something about people with this</v>

1979
02:04:33.481 --> 02:04:36.810
<v Speaker 7>particular disorder that might gravitate</v>
<v Speaker 7>to your insights and your.</v>

1980
02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1981
02:04:38.881 --> 02:04:41.910
<v Speaker 2>so now I would say probably no to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second one,</v>

1982
02:04:42.150 --> 02:04:44.970
<v Speaker 2>but I could comment more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>borderline personality disorder.</v>

1983
02:04:44.971 --> 02:04:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I think I have enough mental energy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that tonight.</v>

1984
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:52.790
<v Speaker 2>So technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's often considered the female variant</v>

1985
02:04:53.941 --> 02:04:57.350
<v Speaker 2>of anti social personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1986
02:04:57.351 --> 02:04:58.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1987
02:04:58.110 --> 02:05:01.570
<v Speaker 2>it's classified or it's classified in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1988
02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.780
<v Speaker 2>in the domain of externalizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorders,</v>

1989
02:05:03.781 --> 02:05:07.560
<v Speaker 2>acting out disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what happens,</v>

1990
02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:13.520
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand borderline </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality disorder very well and it's </v>

1991
02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:15.360
<v Speaker 2>characterized by tremendous impulsivity,</v>

1992
02:05:18.670 --> 02:05:22.080
<v Speaker 2>radical confusion of identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1993
02:05:22.450 --> 02:05:25.140
<v Speaker 2>and then this pattern of idealization </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1994
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:30.430
<v Speaker 2>of people with whom the person afflicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the disorder is associated with </v>

1995
02:05:32.351 --> 02:05:36.250
<v Speaker 2>radical idealization of those people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then radical devaluation of them.</v>

1996
02:05:37.150 --> 02:05:39.670
<v Speaker 2>And then there's another theme that sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of weaves along with it,</v>

1997
02:05:39.671 --> 02:05:44.671
<v Speaker 2>which is the proclivity of people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>borderline personality disorder to </v>

1998
02:05:45.101 --> 02:05:50.101
<v Speaker 2>presume that they will be abandoned and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then to act in a manner that makes such </v>

1999
02:05:50.501 --> 02:05:52.120
<v Speaker 2>a bad admin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually certain.</v>

2000
02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:58.560
<v Speaker 2>And so it's very complicated disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that I think gets at the crux of it.</v>

2001
02:06:01.930 --> 02:06:05.620
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about people with borderline personality</v>

2002
02:06:05.621 --> 02:06:10.621
<v Speaker 2>disorder in my experience is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're often quite intelligent and you </v>

2003
02:06:11.890 --> 02:06:15.130
<v Speaker 2>see in the person with borderline </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality disorder,</v>

2004
02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:20.340
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the waste or the squandering of </v>

2005
02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:22.951
<v Speaker 2>tremendous potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem capable of thinking through </v>

2006
02:06:23.561 --> 02:06:27.070
<v Speaker 2>the nature of their problems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>analyzing them and discussing it,</v>

2007
02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:30.640
<v Speaker 2>but not capable whatsoever of </v>
<v Speaker 2>implementing any solutions</v>

2008
02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:32.180
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

2009
02:06:41.610 --> 02:06:45.480
<v Speaker 2>technically there's no relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Iq and conscientiousness.</v>

2010
02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:51.680
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird because if you read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological literature and you </v>

2011
02:06:52.861 --> 02:06:54.870
<v Speaker 2>read about the functions of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal Cortex,</v>

2012
02:06:54.871 --> 02:06:59.871
<v Speaker 2>they're usually conceptualized in </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual terms and they're </v>

2013
02:06:59.871 --> 02:07:01.530
<v Speaker 2>associated with planning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategizing and so forth,</v>

2014
02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:07.250
<v Speaker 2>and that's what conscientiousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is planning and strategizing and </v>

2015
02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:13.080
<v Speaker 2>implementation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the correlation between Iq and </v>

2016
02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:15.931
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is zero and so as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlation between working memory and </v>

2017
02:07:15.931 --> 02:07:20.080
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is zero and zero is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very low correlation.</v>

2018
02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really,</v>

2019
02:07:21.731 --> 02:07:25.180
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to find things in psychology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are correlated at zero.</v>

2020
02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Things tend to be correlated to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

2021
02:07:28.151 --> 02:07:33.151
<v Speaker 2>They tend to be interrelated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The borderline seems to be able to </v>

2022
02:07:33.161 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 2>strategize the abstract</v>

2023
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:40.730
<v Speaker 5>but not to be able to implement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so this,</v>

2024
02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:44.200
<v Speaker 5>the intellect per se seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>functional,</v>

2025
02:07:44.201 --> 02:07:49.060
<v Speaker 5>but it's not embodied in action.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very.</v>

2026
02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:54.061
<v Speaker 5>So it can be frustrating to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with someone who has </v>

2027
02:07:54.061 --> 02:07:57.661
<v Speaker 5>borderline personality disorder because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can tell you what the problem is </v>

2028
02:07:57.661 --> 02:07:58.720
<v Speaker 5>and even tell you what the solution </v>
<v Speaker 5>might be,</v>

2029
02:07:58.721 --> 02:08:00.580
<v Speaker 5>but there's no implementation.</v>

2030
02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:06.020
<v Speaker 5>So maybe something went wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>developmentally.</v>

2031
02:08:06.110 --> 02:08:08.510
<v Speaker 5>We don't know exactly how these sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 5>things come about.</v>

2032
02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:12.020
<v Speaker 5>The other thing that seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>characteristic of borderline people with</v>

2033
02:08:12.021 --> 02:08:17.021
<v Speaker 5>borderline personality disorder is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they remind me very much of people who </v>

2034
02:08:17.021 --> 02:08:21.581
<v Speaker 5>are two years old and in some manner </v>
<v Speaker 5>like people with borderline personality </v>

2035
02:08:22.251 --> 02:08:24.350
<v Speaker 5>disorder can have temper tantrums.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2036
02:08:24.351 --> 02:08:29.351
<v Speaker 5>they often do and you know now and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you see a temper tantrum and they're </v>

2037
02:08:29.351 --> 02:08:30.200
<v Speaker 5>usually thrown by two year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2038
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:33.470
<v Speaker 5>Most people grow out of temper tantrums </v>
<v Speaker 5>by the time they were about three.</v>

2039
02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:36.290
<v Speaker 5>They're very rare at four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a good thing because if they're</v>

2040
02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:39.770
<v Speaker 5>still there at four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is not a good diagnostic predictor.</v>

2041
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:44.840
<v Speaker 5>That's a good diagnostic predictor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not the kind that you want.</v>

2042
02:08:45.710 --> 02:08:50.710
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny the way that we respond to </v>

2043
02:08:50.710 --> 02:08:53.681
<v Speaker 5>two year old temper tantrums because the</v>
<v Speaker 5>two year old will throw themselves on </v>

2044
02:08:53.681 --> 02:08:56.981
<v Speaker 5>the ground and eat their hands and their</v>
<v Speaker 5>legs on the floor and scream and yell </v>

2045
02:08:56.981 --> 02:08:57.740
<v Speaker 5>and turn red or even blue.</v>

2046
02:08:57.740 --> 02:09:02.740
<v Speaker 5>I saw a child once who was capable of </v>
<v Speaker 5>holding his breath during a temper </v>

2047
02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:04.580
<v Speaker 5>tantrum until he turned blue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was really an impressive feat.</v>

2048
02:09:04.730 --> 02:09:05.780
<v Speaker 5>You should try that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2049
02:09:05.781 --> 02:09:08.420
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You really have to work at it.</v>

2050
02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:12.770
<v Speaker 5>And you see that in adult borderlines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll have temper tantrums.</v>

2051
02:09:12.771 --> 02:09:14.810
<v Speaker 5>And the funny thing is when a two year </v>
<v Speaker 5>old does it,</v>

2052
02:09:14.811 --> 02:09:15.800
<v Speaker 5>it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2053
02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:19.880
<v Speaker 5>it's a little off putting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when an adult does it,</v>

2054
02:09:20.150 --> 02:09:25.150
<v Speaker 5>it's completely bloody terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it happens very frequently with </v>

2055
02:09:25.150 --> 02:09:27.620
<v Speaker 5>borderlines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I would also say to some degree,</v>

2056
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:33.370
<v Speaker 5>they didn't get properly socialized </v>
<v Speaker 5>between that critical period of </v>

2057
02:09:33.370 --> 02:09:36.251
<v Speaker 5>development between two and four.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you see the same thing with adult </v>

2058
02:09:36.251 --> 02:09:39.791
<v Speaker 5>males who grow up to be antisocial </v>
<v Speaker 5>because a large proportion of adult </v>

2059
02:09:39.791 --> 02:09:42.080
<v Speaker 5>males who grow up to be anti social are </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggressive as children,</v>

2060
02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:43.220
<v Speaker 5>as two year olds.</v>

2061
02:09:44.050 --> 02:09:46.550
<v Speaker 5>So there's a small proportion of two </v>
<v Speaker 5>year olds who are quite aggressive,</v>

2062
02:09:46.551 --> 02:09:51.551
<v Speaker 5>they'll kick and hit and bite and steal </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you put them with other two year </v>

2063
02:09:51.551 --> 02:09:51.551
<v Speaker 5>olds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about five percent of the,</v>

2064
02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:53.990
<v Speaker 5>of the males,</v>
<v Speaker 5>smaller fraction of the females,</v>

2065
02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:56.840
<v Speaker 5>but most of them are socialized by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time they're four,</v>

2066
02:09:57.110 --> 02:10:02.110
<v Speaker 5>but there's a small percentage who </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't and they tend to stay antisocial </v>

2067
02:10:02.110 --> 02:10:03.460
<v Speaker 5>and they tend to turn into longterm </v>
<v Speaker 5>offenders and,</v>

2068
02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:05.660
<v Speaker 5>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the develop that critical period for</v>

2069
02:10:05.661 --> 02:10:10.661
<v Speaker 5>socialization development seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>between two and four and it seems to be </v>

2070
02:10:10.661 --> 02:10:13.991
<v Speaker 5>mediated by pretend play in rough and </v>
<v Speaker 5>tumble play in those sorts of </v>

2071
02:10:13.991 --> 02:10:17.471
<v Speaker 5>mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if it isn't instantiated by the age </v>

2072
02:10:17.471 --> 02:10:20.050
<v Speaker 5>of four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't happen and it doesn't look </v>

2073
02:10:20.050 --> 02:10:20.420
<v Speaker 5>like it's addressable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2074
02:10:20.750 --> 02:10:25.100
<v Speaker 5>there are dialectic behavioral therapies</v>
<v Speaker 5>that have been developed for people with</v>

2075
02:10:25.101 --> 02:10:28.790
<v Speaker 5>borderline personality disorder and </v>
<v Speaker 5>their purported to be successful.</v>

2076
02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:29.840
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

2077
02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:32.550
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>

2078
02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:33.600
<v Speaker 5>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2079
02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:34.490
<v Speaker 5>severe second,</v>

2080
02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:38.180
<v Speaker 7>a psychological disorder I wanted to ask</v>
<v Speaker 7>you about is a psychopathy.</v>

2081
02:10:38.570 --> 02:10:43.570
<v Speaker 7>So you've mentioned that a psychopaths </v>
<v Speaker 7>tend to switch from dominance hierarchy </v>

2082
02:10:43.570 --> 02:10:46.080
<v Speaker 7>to dominance hierarchy because people </v>
<v Speaker 7>get tired of their shenanigans.</v>

2083
02:10:46.081 --> 02:10:47.720
<v Speaker 7>And they have to be volunteer fresh </v>
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

2084
02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:51.530
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and psychopaths also tend to be very low</v>

2085
02:10:51.531 --> 02:10:56.531
<v Speaker 7>in conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you said that when you see some of </v>

2086
02:10:56.531 --> 02:10:59.801
<v Speaker 7>these protesters at your speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of the men in particular,</v>

2087
02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:00.830
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your,</v>

2088
02:11:01.010 --> 02:11:06.010
<v Speaker 7>you're a clinical intuition tells you </v>
<v Speaker 7>that there's something seriously </v>

2089
02:11:06.010 --> 02:11:07.340
<v Speaker 7>pathological about them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2090
02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:12.400
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was wondering if you would suspect </v>

2091
02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:12.400
<v Speaker 7>that some of these men might be </v>
<v Speaker 7>psychopathic</v>

2092
02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:13.850
<v Speaker 5>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them likely are,</v>

2093
02:11:13.851 --> 02:11:18.851
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if a higher proportion </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the ones who show up at protests and </v>

2094
02:11:18.851 --> 02:11:20.270
<v Speaker 5>sort of creeped me out or I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2095
02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:23.720
<v Speaker 5>if there's a higher proportion of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that at the protests are not.</v>

2096
02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:29.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suspect in general that regardless of </v>

2097
02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:32.441
<v Speaker 5>the protest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the proportion of people who have </v>

2098
02:11:32.441 --> 02:11:35.441
<v Speaker 5>personality disorders among protestors </v>
<v Speaker 5>is higher than the proportion of people </v>

2099
02:11:35.441 --> 02:11:39.311
<v Speaker 5>who have personality disorders in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>general population because you just </v>

2100
02:11:39.311 --> 02:11:41.240
<v Speaker 5>expect that you just expect that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>acting out behavior.</v>

2101
02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe me,</v>

2102
02:11:42.291 --> 02:11:45.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that all protest is </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with personality disorder.</v>

2103
02:11:45.411 --> 02:11:48.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's plenty of reason for protest,</v>

2104
02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:52.430
<v Speaker 5>but some of the reason for protests are </v>
<v Speaker 5>credible reasons and some of them aren't</v>

2105
02:11:52.431 --> 02:11:53.090
<v Speaker 5>credible reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

2106
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:56.900
<v Speaker 7>seeing that like the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 7>hierarchy,</v>

2107
02:11:56.901 --> 02:12:01.901
<v Speaker 7>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 7>would be one of the last that these </v>

2108
02:12:01.901 --> 02:12:01.901
<v Speaker 7>confused</v>

2109
02:12:01.901 --> 02:12:01.901
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2110
02:12:01.901 --> 02:12:04.240
<v Speaker 5>that's a different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know there are,</v>

2111
02:12:05.290 --> 02:12:08.080
<v Speaker 5>there are analysis of the dangers of </v>
<v Speaker 5>agreeableness,</v>

2112
02:12:08.590 --> 02:12:13.590
<v Speaker 5>so agreeableness is a personality trait </v>
<v Speaker 5>that underlies the radical egalitarian </v>

2113
02:12:13.590 --> 02:12:17.230
<v Speaker 5>ethos because agreeable people want </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything to be shared equally and it's</v>

2114
02:12:17.231 --> 02:12:22.231
<v Speaker 5>a good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a good ethos for a small </v>

2115
02:12:22.231 --> 02:12:25.141
<v Speaker 5>group for a family because family is </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of a communist system in some </v>

2116
02:12:25.141 --> 02:12:25.141
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2117
02:12:25.141 --> 02:12:29.611
<v Speaker 5>It's like you want the food to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>divided up equally among the children </v>

2118
02:12:29.611 --> 02:12:33.330
<v Speaker 5>clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you want all the children sort of </v>

2119
02:12:33.330 --> 02:12:35.131
<v Speaker 5>regardless of their inherent abilities </v>
<v Speaker 5>to have the same opportunities and </v>

2120
02:12:35.131 --> 02:12:39.511
<v Speaker 5>perhaps even the same outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think agreeableness which is </v>

2121
02:12:39.511 --> 02:12:41.200
<v Speaker 5>associated at least in part with </v>
<v Speaker 5>maternal maternal,</v>

2122
02:12:41.590 --> 02:12:44.440
<v Speaker 5>the maternal instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say maternal patterns of behavior.</v>

2123
02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:49.800
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a good first pass motivational </v>

2124
02:12:50.171 --> 02:12:53.530
<v Speaker 5>approximation to a localized familial </v>
<v Speaker 5>ethic.</v>

2125
02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:56.110
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a catastrophe at larger </v>
<v Speaker 5>scales.</v>

2126
02:12:56.590 --> 02:13:01.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it scales at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually think that's why we evolve </v>

2127
02:13:01.590 --> 02:13:04.921
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because conscientiousness is the </v>

2128
02:13:04.921 --> 02:13:06.130
<v Speaker 5>principle that allows larger scale </v>
<v Speaker 5>organizations to exist.</v>

2129
02:13:06.490 --> 02:13:10.930
<v Speaker 5>Agreeableness won't do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Conscientiousness is a mystery,</v>

2130
02:13:10.990 --> 02:13:13.150
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't have a neurological model.</v>

2131
02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:17.560
<v Speaker 5>We don't have a conceptual model.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't have an animal model,</v>

2132
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:22.830
<v Speaker 5>we don't have a pharmacological model,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we really only have one way of </v>

2133
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:25.720
<v Speaker 5>assessing which is self and other </v>
<v Speaker 5>reports of personality proclivity.</v>

2134
02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:31.650
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem with agreeableness,</v>

2135
02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:36.660
<v Speaker 5>this has been modeled by game theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that a population of cooperative </v>

2136
02:13:37.261 --> 02:13:41.040
<v Speaker 5>people can be dominated by a single </v>
<v Speaker 5>shark,</v>

2137
02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:48.240
<v Speaker 5>so agreeableness is insufficient as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>principal because it opens itself up to,</v>

2138
02:13:52.170 --> 02:13:57.170
<v Speaker 5>what do you call that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Manipulation and manipulation.</v>

2139
02:14:02.581 --> 02:14:04.840
<v Speaker 5>Let's let's leave it at that to </v>
<v Speaker 5>manipulation and,</v>

2140
02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:05.470
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2141
02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:08.340
<v Speaker 5>and exploitation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing.</v>

2142
02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:11.100
<v Speaker 5>Exploitation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2143
02:14:13.170 --> 02:14:13.560
<v Speaker 6>thank you.</v>

2144
02:14:19.170 --> 02:14:20.010
<v Speaker 8>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dr Peterson.</v>

2145
02:14:20.011 --> 02:14:25.011
<v Speaker 8>I had one quick comment and aggression </v>
<v Speaker 8>of somebody's comments was about your </v>

2146
02:14:25.011 --> 02:14:27.420
<v Speaker 8>idea of subpersonalities is one nine </v>
<v Speaker 8>monsters.</v>

2147
02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:32.800
<v Speaker 8>Now there's the idea of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 8>personality or split personality </v>

2148
02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:36.201
<v Speaker 8>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's controversial as to whether or not </v>

2149
02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:38.661
<v Speaker 8>it exists,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but there's some recent research that </v>

2150
02:14:38.661 --> 02:14:41.451
<v Speaker 8>suggests that you may actually have </v>
<v Speaker 8>multiple personalities that use </v>

2151
02:14:41.911 --> 02:14:46.911
<v Speaker 8>different parts of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so they have differential access to the </v>

2152
02:14:46.911 --> 02:14:49.191
<v Speaker 8>hippocampus.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They have their own memories and they </v>

2153
02:14:49.191 --> 02:14:49.191
<v Speaker 8>can,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2154
02:14:49.191 --> 02:14:53.700
<v Speaker 8>they use their brain differently,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that seems to be an exaggeration of </v>

2155
02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:56.670
<v Speaker 8>some personalities to me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is quite interesting.</v>

2156
02:14:57.630 --> 02:14:59.790
<v Speaker 8>The question I had was about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2157
02:15:00.150 --> 02:15:05.150
<v Speaker 8>so you talked about young and how um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you should confront that which you don't</v>

2158
02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:08.980
<v Speaker 8>want to confront the most or you're most</v>
<v Speaker 8>afraid of,</v>

2159
02:15:08.981 --> 02:15:11.170
<v Speaker 8>are disgusted by that you have the most </v>
<v Speaker 8>resistance to,</v>

2160
02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:12.600
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so,</v>

2161
02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:15.010
<v Speaker 8>but we were talking about psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 8>and uh,</v>

2162
02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.440
<v Speaker 8>and the experience of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

2163
02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:22.180
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>at least some of the people I've talked </v>

2164
02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:22.350
<v Speaker 8>to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're described negative trip says I'm</v>

2165
02:15:22.530 --> 02:15:26.670
<v Speaker 8>an experience of a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of constant fear,</v>

2166
02:15:26.730 --> 02:15:28.570
<v Speaker 8>prolonged fear,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and um,</v>

2167
02:15:28.650 --> 02:15:33.650
<v Speaker 8>some of the most dramatic and </v>
<v Speaker 8>personalized that they've ever </v>

2168
02:15:33.661 --> 02:15:38.661
<v Speaker 8>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So shouldn't a negative psychedelic </v>

2169
02:15:38.661 --> 02:15:42.230
<v Speaker 8>trips elicit the kind of concentration </v>
<v Speaker 8>that a young thought you should engage </v>

2170
02:15:42.930 --> 02:15:43.110
<v Speaker 8>in?</v>

2171
02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:47.640
<v Speaker 5>Could be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could well be it?</v>

2172
02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:54.480
<v Speaker 5>It's conceivable that I read this </v>
<v Speaker 5>strange book once that made the claim </v>

2173
02:15:59.221 --> 02:16:04.221
<v Speaker 5>that what was in the Ark of the covenant</v>
<v Speaker 5>was a mixture that was made from am </v>

2174
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:06.330
<v Speaker 5>Anita Mascara,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms,</v>

2175
02:16:07.590 --> 02:16:12.590
<v Speaker 5>and that's not as far fetched as you </v>
<v Speaker 5>might think because there was a </v>

2176
02:16:12.590 --> 02:16:16.251
<v Speaker 5>mycologist in amateur knit mycologist </v>
<v Speaker 5>named Gordon West saw who established </v>

2177
02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:22.340
<v Speaker 5>credibly the notion that it was an Itam </v>
<v Speaker 5>is scarier potions that was the Soma of </v>

2178
02:16:24.691 --> 02:16:28.980
<v Speaker 5>the rig Veda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so it's a strange idea,</v>

2179
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.380
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

2180
02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:35.940
<v Speaker 2>it's not an idea that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of the realm of possibility and </v>

2181
02:16:38.051 --> 02:16:41.520
<v Speaker 2>the Amanitas must carry out the Flyer </v>
<v Speaker 2>Erik,</v>

2182
02:16:41.890 --> 02:16:46.890
<v Speaker 2>the red mushroom with white dots and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's used in shamanic rituals in cross </v>

2183
02:16:46.890 --> 02:16:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Asia and it's apparently not toxic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dried form.</v>

2184
02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Although that is not a recommendation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2185
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:59.910
<v Speaker 2>this is serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious and dangerous speculation and </v>

2186
02:16:59.951 --> 02:17:04.951
<v Speaker 2>material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that the priests had </v>

2187
02:17:04.951 --> 02:17:09.751
<v Speaker 2>to do before they communed with what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever in the Ark of the covenant was </v>

2188
02:17:10.841 --> 02:17:15.841
<v Speaker 2>purified themselves and so one </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility is that the bad psychedelic </v>

2189
02:17:18.611 --> 02:17:23.611
<v Speaker 2>experience is a involuntary </v>
<v Speaker 2>confrontation with what you'd describe </v>

2190
02:17:24.551 --> 02:17:29.551
<v Speaker 2>as the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so be aware of experimenting with </v>

2191
02:17:32.670 --> 02:17:37.020
<v Speaker 2>substances that produce divine </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelations if you're in a serious state</v>

2192
02:17:37.021 --> 02:17:42.021
<v Speaker 2>of disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do think that is what happens to </v>

2193
02:17:42.021 --> 02:17:45.411
<v Speaker 2>people is that they encounter everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>about them that's chaotic and out of </v>

2194
02:17:46.411 --> 02:17:51.411
<v Speaker 2>place and some people get trapped in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and they can't get beyond it and </v>

2195
02:17:51.411 --> 02:17:52.620
<v Speaker 2>that's because there's so much of it</v>

2196
02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:57.080
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know enough to know.</v>

2197
02:17:58.970 --> 02:18:03.970
<v Speaker 1>So thanks.</v>

2198
02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:17.720
<v Speaker 9>So you a son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 9>How are you?</v>

2199
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got a question?</v>

2200
02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:27.080
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've got a real question.</v>

2201
02:18:27.081 --> 02:18:28.910
<v Speaker 9>I got a question.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're going to like this one.</v>

2202
02:18:29.010 --> 02:18:34.010
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's about inspiration because you talk </v>

2203
02:18:34.010 --> 02:18:35.891
<v Speaker 9>about inspiration quite a bit in this </v>
<v Speaker 9>lecture series and also I wanted to </v>

2204
02:18:35.891 --> 02:18:39.491
<v Speaker 9>point out you have a I guess a 45 minute</v>
<v Speaker 9>armchair discussion which you have a </v>

2205
02:18:40.251 --> 02:18:45.251
<v Speaker 9>video of of one paragraph of Nietzsche's</v>
<v Speaker 9>beyond good and evil just posted and it </v>

2206
02:18:45.381 --> 02:18:50.381
<v Speaker 9>seems like you're awestruck at the </v>
<v Speaker 9>structure and the choices and I guess </v>

2207
02:18:51.620 --> 02:18:56.620
<v Speaker 9>the ideas contained in various layers of</v>
<v Speaker 9>this paragraph and you're inspired and </v>

2208
02:18:57.411 --> 02:19:00.560
<v Speaker 9>that inspires you to I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 9>do your work that you do.</v>

2209
02:19:01.130 --> 02:19:06.130
<v Speaker 9>I encountered I guess a similar </v>
<v Speaker 9>phenomenon here with one sentence </v>

2210
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:11.950
<v Speaker 9>written by the Great Joseph Cardinal </v>
<v Speaker 9>Ratzinger and I mean this one sentence </v>

2211
02:19:13.191 --> 02:19:18.191
<v Speaker 9>answers the question,</v>
<v Speaker 9>why do people search for God and if you </v>

2212
02:19:18.191 --> 02:19:19.360
<v Speaker 9>could read it out and then </v>
<v Speaker 9>deconstructed.</v>

2213
02:19:19.370 --> 02:19:24.370
<v Speaker 9>It's once.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's at the end of page one.</v>

2214
02:19:27.141 --> 02:19:27.650
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>five.</v>

2215
02:19:27.651 --> 02:19:29.570
<v Speaker 9>If you want to read it from the book or </v>
<v Speaker 9>I just.</v>

2216
02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:34.640
<v Speaker 5>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That human existence not only poses but </v>

2217
02:19:35.311 --> 02:19:39.150
<v Speaker 5>itself is the inconclusiveness inherent </v>
<v Speaker 5>in it.</v>

2218
02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:43.440
<v Speaker 5>The bounds it comes up against and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>yet urine for the unbounded,</v>

2219
02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:48.740
<v Speaker 5>more or less in the sense of niches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>assertion that all pleasure yearns for </v>

2220
02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:49.950
<v Speaker 5>eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It experiences itself as a moment.</v>

2221
02:19:50.430 --> 02:19:55.430
<v Speaker 5>This simultaneity of being limited and </v>
<v Speaker 5>of yearning for the unbounded and open </v>

2222
02:19:55.430 --> 02:19:59.870
<v Speaker 5>has always presented,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man from resting and himself made him </v>

2223
02:19:59.870 --> 02:20:03.441
<v Speaker 5>sense that he is not self sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but only comes to himself by going </v>

2224
02:20:03.441 --> 02:20:05.910
<v Speaker 5>outside himself and moving toward the </v>
<v Speaker 5>entirely other.</v>

2225
02:20:05.911 --> 02:20:10.050
<v Speaker 5>An infinitely greater well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a hell of a sentence.</v>

2226
02:20:11.380 --> 02:20:16.380
<v Speaker 9>When I read that sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I decided I wanted to write like Joseph </v>

2227
02:20:16.930 --> 02:20:21.930
<v Speaker 9>Cardinal Ratzinger.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I had a very similar experience when I </v>

2228
02:20:21.930 --> 02:20:21.930
<v Speaker 9>watched the Joe Rogan podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Eight 77.</v>

2229
02:20:21.930 --> 02:20:24.260
<v Speaker 9>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I want to speak like Jordan Peterson.</v>

2230
02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:26.570
<v Speaker 9>That's what I wanted to do.</v>

2231
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:31.670
<v Speaker 5>So I had this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had this discussion with a patron and </v>

2232
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:36.621
<v Speaker 5>supporter this week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a young guy from Australia and and he </v>

2233
02:20:36.991 --> 02:20:40.290
<v Speaker 5>said something very interesting that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>related to this and it's,</v>

2234
02:20:40.530 --> 02:20:42.960
<v Speaker 5>it's something that's very profound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2235
02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:48.020
<v Speaker 5>I think there's this idea in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity that we've discussed </v>

2236
02:20:48.361 --> 02:20:52.350
<v Speaker 5>briefly that the judge and the redeemer </v>
<v Speaker 5>are the same figure.</v>

2237
02:20:52.980 --> 02:20:54.450
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know in the book of revelation,</v>

2238
02:20:54.451 --> 02:20:59.451
<v Speaker 5>you may know this and you may not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Christ comes back as a judge and he has </v>

2239
02:21:00.331 --> 02:21:04.110
<v Speaker 5>a sword coming into.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a revelatory vision that that book,</v>

2240
02:21:04.111 --> 02:21:07.800
<v Speaker 5>it's a very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the last thing you'd expect.</v>

2241
02:21:07.801 --> 02:21:10.230
<v Speaker 5>Conservative Christian is to believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe me,</v>

2242
02:21:10.470 --> 02:21:13.680
<v Speaker 5>it's such a visionary hallucination,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the book of revelation,</v>

2243
02:21:13.681 --> 02:21:18.681
<v Speaker 5>but Christ comes back with a sword </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming out of his mouth and he comes </v>

2244
02:21:18.681 --> 02:21:22.041
<v Speaker 5>back as a judge and he divides the </v>
<v Speaker 5>damned from the redeemed and most are </v>

2245
02:21:22.041 --> 02:21:24.660
<v Speaker 5>damned in some are redeemed who's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very harsh.</v>

2246
02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:29.900
<v Speaker 5>A young believer that the figure of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christ in the Gospels was too agreeable </v>

2247
02:21:30.030 --> 02:21:35.030
<v Speaker 5>to merciful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to tilted towards mercy and that that </v>

2248
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:37.940
<v Speaker 5>called out for a counter position and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was the counter position of </v>

2249
02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:39.240
<v Speaker 5>judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very interesting hypothesis,</v>

2250
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:42.480
<v Speaker 5>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there's this melding of the two</v>

2251
02:21:42.481 --> 02:21:45.210
<v Speaker 5>ideas that the judge and the redeemer </v>
<v Speaker 5>are the same thing.</v>

2252
02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:48.120
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2253
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:53.870
<v Speaker 5>this young man told me that his life </v>
<v Speaker 5>lacked purpose and direction and meaning</v>

2254
02:21:54.481 --> 02:21:57.510
<v Speaker 5>and that he was nihilistic until he </v>
<v Speaker 5>started.</v>

2255
02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:00.390
<v Speaker 5>He read Zen and the art of motorcycle </v>
<v Speaker 5>maintenance,</v>

2256
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:02.670
<v Speaker 5>which is a book I actually liked quite a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bit.</v>

2257
02:22:02.671 --> 02:22:05.880
<v Speaker 5>I've read it three times at different </v>
<v Speaker 5>decades of my life and one of the things</v>

2258
02:22:05.881 --> 02:22:10.881
<v Speaker 5>that's very interesting about that book </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that it's an examination of the idea </v>

2259
02:22:10.881 --> 02:22:14.061
<v Speaker 5>of quality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the idea that there are qualitative </v>

2260
02:22:14.061 --> 02:22:17.751
<v Speaker 5>distinctions between things and that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>have an instinct to make qualitative </v>

2261
02:22:17.751 --> 02:22:22.251
<v Speaker 5>distinctions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so a qualitative distinction is </v>

2262
02:22:22.251 --> 02:22:23.910
<v Speaker 5>simply this is better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a judgment.</v>

2263
02:22:24.750 --> 02:22:29.750
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What ratzinger is hypothesizing is that </v>

2264
02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:31.860
<v Speaker 5>the person ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2265
02:22:31.861 --> 02:22:35.010
<v Speaker 5>how the idea of the modern ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to accept yourself.</v>

2266
02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:37.200
<v Speaker 5>I think that's an insane idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way.</v>

2267
02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:38.190
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

2268
02:22:38.191 --> 02:22:42.480
<v Speaker 5>I can't think of a more nihilistic idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>then that you're already okay.</v>

2269
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:43.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2270
02:22:43.381 --> 02:22:48.381
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the reason you're not is could be </v>

2271
02:22:48.381 --> 02:22:48.381
<v Speaker 5>way more than you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so what do you want to be?</v>

2272
02:22:48.381 --> 02:22:52.440
<v Speaker 5>You want to be okay as you are or do you</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to strive towards what's better?</v>

2273
02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:55.140
<v Speaker 5>And this young man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this Australia,</v>

2274
02:22:55.141 --> 02:23:00.141
<v Speaker 5>and he said that the reason that Zen and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the art of motorcycle maintenance had </v>

2275
02:23:00.141 --> 02:23:03.591
<v Speaker 5>such an impact on him was because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't happy with his current mode of </v>

2276
02:23:03.591 --> 02:23:07.911
<v Speaker 5>being right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't consider the manner in which </v>

2277
02:23:07.911 --> 02:23:11.721
<v Speaker 5>he conducted themselves sufficient and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that the author of Zen and laid</v>

2278
02:23:14.461 --> 02:23:17.440
<v Speaker 5>out the notion that you could make </v>
<v Speaker 5>qualitative distinctions in there.</v>

2279
02:23:17.470 --> 02:23:22.470
<v Speaker 5>There really was a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 5>good things and bad things are great </v>

2280
02:23:22.470 --> 02:23:23.280
<v Speaker 5>things and evil things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gives you direction.</v>

2281
02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:29.030
<v Speaker 5>It gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gives you the possibility of moving </v>

2282
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:32.181
<v Speaker 5>upward and and ratzinger is pointing out</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least to some degree that human </v>

2283
02:23:32.181 --> 02:23:36.060
<v Speaker 5>beings are insufficient in and of </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves and need the movement upward.</v>

2284
02:23:36.061 --> 02:23:39.360
<v Speaker 5>And so they need to conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like the highest good.</v>

2285
02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:44.070
<v Speaker 5>And then to strive for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is is that there isn't any</v>

2286
02:23:44.071 --> 02:23:48.990
<v Speaker 5>difference between conceptualizing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>good and being judged.</v>

2287
02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:51.800
<v Speaker 5>Because if you're going to conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 5>the good and move towards it,</v>

2288
02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:54.150
<v Speaker 5>what you have to do is separate from </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

2289
02:23:54.151 --> 02:23:57.870
<v Speaker 5>All those things that aren't good and </v>
<v Speaker 5>leave them behind.</v>

2290
02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:00.780
<v Speaker 5>And that's why the redeemer and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>judge or the same thing,</v>

2291
02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:03.510
<v Speaker 5>and one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>appalling,</v>

2292
02:24:03.511 --> 02:24:08.511
<v Speaker 5>I think about our modern world is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're rejecting the notion of </v>

2293
02:24:08.511 --> 02:24:08.910
<v Speaker 5>qualitative distinctions.</v>

2294
02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:09.540
<v Speaker 5>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2295
02:24:09.541 --> 02:24:14.541
<v Speaker 5>we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings</v>
<v Speaker 5>by saying that one thing is better than </v>

2296
02:24:14.541 --> 02:24:14.541
<v Speaker 5>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2297
02:24:14.541 --> 02:24:15.180
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fair enough.</v>

2298
02:24:15.181 --> 02:24:19.050
<v Speaker 5>It's not fun to be cast off with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>damned,</v>

2299
02:24:19.260 --> 02:24:24.260
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if people are in fact insufficient </v>

2300
02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:27.390
<v Speaker 5>in an in their present condition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which seems to be the case,</v>

2301
02:24:27.570 --> 02:24:32.570
<v Speaker 5>we try finding someone who isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then if you deny the possibility of </v>

2302
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:37.770
<v Speaker 5>qualitative distinction because you want</v>
<v Speaker 5>to promote a radical egalitarianism,</v>

2303
02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:42.980
<v Speaker 5>then you remove the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 5>redemption because there's no movement </v>

2304
02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:46.551
<v Speaker 5>towards the good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it seems to me that it's a </v>

2305
02:24:46.551 --> 02:24:48.830
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe to sacrifice the good for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2306
02:24:48.930 --> 02:24:53.930
<v Speaker 5>it's a catastrophe to sacrifice the good</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the equal because for us to be </v>

2307
02:24:53.930 --> 02:24:58.131
<v Speaker 5>equal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would be mean as far as I can tell </v>

2308
02:24:58.131 --> 02:24:58.830
<v Speaker 5>that we would all be equally unredeemed </v>
<v Speaker 5>and miserable.</v>

2309
02:24:59.580 --> 02:25:04.580
<v Speaker 5>And so you also mentioned in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>previous paragraph,</v>

2310
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:14.000
<v Speaker 9>I believe that even in the case when you</v>
<v Speaker 9>experienced the human life at its </v>

2311
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:18.381
<v Speaker 9>fullest,</v>
<v Speaker 9>at its most beautiful as it's most </v>

2312
02:25:18.381 --> 02:25:18.381
<v Speaker 9>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you have a deep,</v>

2313
02:25:18.381 --> 02:25:22.080
<v Speaker 9>I guess understanding that you have </v>
<v Speaker 9>something to be thankful for you.</v>

2314
02:25:22.081 --> 02:25:24.030
<v Speaker 9>You need to thank somebody for that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's not</v>

2315
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:28.210
<v Speaker 4>based entirely on your own merit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that points you toward something else.</v>

2316
02:25:28.211 --> 02:25:33.130
<v Speaker 4>And also in that you can have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>profoundly positive experience,</v>

2317
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:39.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the best sense without that </v>

2318
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:39.000
<v Speaker 4>accompanying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a feeling of being blessed.</v>

2319
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:43.691
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also I'd like to wait,</v>

2320
02:25:44.470 --> 02:25:46.090
<v Speaker 4>hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to stop you.</v>

2321
02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:48.310
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm going to ask this person,</v>

2322
02:25:48.430 --> 02:25:52.360
<v Speaker 4>but I would like to say that those were </v>
<v Speaker 4>remarkably good questions.</v>

2323
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:58.030
<v Speaker 2>So the experience and thank you for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful lecturer.</v>

2324
02:26:03.850 --> 02:26:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving you a working definition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and say within the Abrahamic </v>

2325
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:15.190
<v Speaker 2>religious tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you say that the more perhaps </v>

2326
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:19.180
<v Speaker 2>mystical sects and denominations which </v>
<v Speaker 2>play place more emphasis on the </v>

2327
02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:25.210
<v Speaker 2>transcendental experience of God or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience as opposed to the more </v>

2328
02:26:26.571 --> 02:26:31.571
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist Orthodox literalist which</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps emphasize the,</v>

2329
02:26:32.330 --> 02:26:34.660
<v Speaker 2>what I've noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2330
02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:40.420
<v Speaker 2>moral policing of behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you say that the former is more </v>

2331
02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:43.280
<v Speaker 2>true than the latter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No and no.</v>

2332
02:26:43.350 --> 02:26:45.980
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it continues to be.</v>

2333
02:26:46.210 --> 02:26:51.210
<v Speaker 2>We could former in some way serve as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidote to extremist literalism </v>

2334
02:26:52.250 --> 02:26:54.410
<v Speaker 2>jihadism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalism.</v>

2335
02:26:54.450 --> 02:26:54.810
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2336
02:26:54.811 --> 02:26:57.810
<v Speaker 4>yes to the second part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the first part,</v>

2337
02:26:57.970 --> 02:27:00.080
<v Speaker 4>it's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do.</v>

2338
02:27:00.310 --> 02:27:04.980
<v Speaker 4>We did some research on this awhile back</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we were looking at the different</v>

2339
02:27:04.981 --> 02:27:08.970
<v Speaker 4>religious proclivities of liberals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives and liberals.</v>

2340
02:27:08.971 --> 02:27:13.971
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're liberal it means you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>high in openness and low in </v>

2341
02:27:13.971 --> 02:27:16.131
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservative than your high in </v>

2342
02:27:16.131 --> 02:27:18.921
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness and low in openness </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that the liberals are spiritual and </v>

2343
02:27:18.921 --> 02:27:22.941
<v Speaker 4>the conservatives are dogmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's best to think of those as </v>

2344
02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:24.570
<v Speaker 4>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2345
02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:29.600
<v Speaker 4>Because the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the spiritual mystical end is where the </v>

2346
02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:33.771
<v Speaker 4>revelations emerge and the renewal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's where there's chaos and </v>

2347
02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:39.380
<v Speaker 4>discord as well because what's new </v>
<v Speaker 4>disrupts what stable and so what's new </v>

2348
02:27:39.901 --> 02:27:43.230
<v Speaker 4>has to be turned into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be integrated into what stable</v>

2349
02:27:43.231 --> 02:27:48.231
<v Speaker 4>and so you need both those poles and of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course if the dogmatist get the upper </v>

2350
02:27:48.231 --> 02:27:51.591
<v Speaker 4>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then everything turns into a tyranny of </v>

2351
02:27:51.591 --> 02:27:52.080
<v Speaker 4>stone that that's Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Egypt in the Old Testament.</v>

2352
02:27:52.350 --> 02:27:53.820
<v Speaker 4>But if the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the.</v>

2353
02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:59.180
<v Speaker 4>If the mystics get the upper hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then everything floats off the earth </v>

2354
02:27:59.180 --> 02:28:02.610
<v Speaker 4>into some impractical ether.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is equally counterproductive.</v>

2355
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:06.420
<v Speaker 4>And so there has to be a dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 4>between those different polls.</v>

2356
02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:09.420
<v Speaker 4>And I think you see that in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>distribution of human temperament.</v>

2357
02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:12.270
<v Speaker 4>You know the conscientious types,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they tend to be orderly.</v>

2358
02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:17.420
<v Speaker 4>The orderly types tend to tend towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>the kind of a right wing </v>

2359
02:28:17.420 --> 02:28:18.810
<v Speaker 4>totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's their proclivity when they.</v>

2360
02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:19.650
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they.</v>

2361
02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:22.250
<v Speaker 4>When things get out of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're low in openness,</v>

2362
02:28:22.430 --> 02:28:27.430
<v Speaker 5>that's a danger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you see the same thing with the </v>

2363
02:28:27.430 --> 02:28:29.840
<v Speaker 5>people who are too open and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientious at all.</v>

2364
02:28:29.930 --> 02:28:32.780
<v Speaker 5>They're dreaming all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they never do anything.</v>

2365
02:28:32.781 --> 02:28:35.030
<v Speaker 5>There's never anything implemented and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's a bad.</v>

2366
02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:40.360
<v Speaker 5>That's a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I don't think that you can say that </v>

2367
02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:44.160
<v Speaker 5>like the dogmatic structure is necessary</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that perpetuates the system and </v>

2368
02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:48.341
<v Speaker 5>the revelatory elements is necessary </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that renews it when renewal is </v>

2369
02:28:48.341 --> 02:28:51.581
<v Speaker 5>necessary and there has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>continual dialogue between those </v>

2370
02:28:51.581 --> 02:28:54.641
<v Speaker 5>elements so that neither of them fall </v>
<v Speaker 5>prey to their own particular form of </v>

2371
02:28:54.641 --> 02:28:59.080
<v Speaker 5>pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the problems with the </v>

2372
02:28:59.080 --> 02:28:59.510
<v Speaker 5>current political.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would you call it,</v>

2373
02:29:00.470 --> 02:29:03.080
<v Speaker 5>polarization that's occurring across the</v>
<v Speaker 5>West,</v>

2374
02:29:03.081 --> 02:29:06.170
<v Speaker 5>is that the right and the left are not </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to each other anymore and it's a</v>

2375
02:29:06.171 --> 02:29:11.171
<v Speaker 5>very bad thing because the left will </v>
<v Speaker 5>wander into a pit and fail without </v>

2376
02:29:12.530 --> 02:29:13.250
<v Speaker 5>boundaries.</v>

2377
02:29:13.370 --> 02:29:18.370
<v Speaker 5>And the right will enclose itself in </v>
<v Speaker 5>smaller and smaller spaces until it </v>

2378
02:29:18.370 --> 02:29:22.451
<v Speaker 5>can't move without the left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the reasons that democracy </v>

2379
02:29:22.451 --> 02:29:24.470
<v Speaker 5>works is because it makes people talk or</v>
<v Speaker 5>allows them to talk.</v>

2380
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:27.330
<v Speaker 5>You can have it either way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>

2381
02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:28.000
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2382
02:29:28.090 --> 02:29:32.750
<v Speaker 5>it's because every virtue has its vice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2383
02:29:32.751 --> 02:29:33.960
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2384
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:38.990
<v Speaker 5>met a virtue is something like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>amalgamation of singular virtues into </v>

2385
02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:42.911
<v Speaker 5>something that's a transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 5>structures that has more to do with the </v>

2386
02:29:42.911 --> 02:29:44.270
<v Speaker 5>harmony of virtues rather than with any </v>
<v Speaker 5>given virtue,</v>

2387
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:49.750
<v Speaker 5>even though I think that free freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 5>speech is the clearest manifestation of </v>

2388
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:51.140
<v Speaker 5>that harmony of virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2389
02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:55.700
<v Speaker 5>And so all could be a lubricant for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning of this discussion.</v>

2390
02:29:56.240 --> 02:29:59.290
<v Speaker 5>Do you think between the Liberals and </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservatives?</v>

2391
02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:09.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to answer that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't follow immediately from your,</v>

2392
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:16.670
<v Speaker 5>from your initial presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the ar experience is a different </v>

2393
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:18.210
<v Speaker 5>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2394
02:30:18.211 --> 02:30:20.880
<v Speaker 5>Well the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2395
02:30:20.910 --> 02:30:24.760
<v Speaker 5>At least exposing conservatives to some </v>
<v Speaker 5>form of that experience because it,</v>

2396
02:30:24.810 --> 02:30:28.200
<v Speaker 5>could it be a prerequisite for more </v>
<v Speaker 5>productive dialogue?</v>

2397
02:30:31.390 --> 02:30:32.420
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean in,</v>

2398
02:30:32.430 --> 02:30:33.000
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2399
02:30:33.020 --> 02:30:34.120
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the church,</v>

2400
02:30:34.121 --> 02:30:36.880
<v Speaker 5>in a church ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say a classical church ceremony,</v>

2401
02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:39.130
<v Speaker 5>there's some intermingling of both,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2402
02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:44.280
<v Speaker 5>You mean you think about a church </v>
<v Speaker 5>ceremony that takes place in a gothic </v>

2403
02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:44.280
<v Speaker 5>cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We started,</v>

2404
02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:47.800
<v Speaker 5>got the dogma and the and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the relatively rigid rule structure,</v>

2405
02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:53.040
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time that's aligned with</v>
<v Speaker 5>intense beauty in the architectural </v>

2406
02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:53.320
<v Speaker 5>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the,</v>

2407
02:30:53.321 --> 02:30:58.321
<v Speaker 5>in the light streaming in through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stained glass windows and the music and </v>

2408
02:30:58.321 --> 02:30:59.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Gothic cathedral is a forest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2409
02:30:59.891 --> 02:31:04.891
<v Speaker 5>It's a stone forest with sunlight </v>
<v Speaker 5>streaming in through the trees and </v>

2410
02:31:04.891 --> 02:31:09.570
<v Speaker 5>instead it's a balance between structure</v>
<v Speaker 5>light there absolutely unbelievable </v>

2411
02:31:09.570 --> 02:31:11.920
<v Speaker 5>structures and then they speak of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>transcendent but it.</v>

2412
02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:17.100
<v Speaker 5>But inside that there's a structure and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so it seems that in order for the </v>

2413
02:31:17.100 --> 02:31:18.190
<v Speaker 5>religious impulse to be balanced </v>
<v Speaker 5>property,</v>

2414
02:31:18.191 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 5>there has to be a reasonable</v>

2415
02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:25.940
<v Speaker 2>dialog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in practice between the mystical </v>

2416
02:31:25.940 --> 02:31:25.940
<v Speaker 2>are inspiring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent,</v>

2417
02:31:25.940 --> 02:31:26.910
<v Speaker 2>and the dogmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2418
02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Either of those can go as either of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those goes to straight without the </v>

2419
02:31:32.240 --> 02:31:32.580
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're too dogmatic,</v>

2420
02:31:32.581 --> 02:31:37.380
<v Speaker 2>do you need all likely?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2421
02:31:37.381 --> 02:31:42.381
<v Speaker 2>Because that would show you that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something beyond your own </v>

2422
02:31:42.381 --> 02:31:42.381
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2423
02:31:43.530 --> 02:31:45.720
<v Speaker 2>so all I should tell you something </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about,</v>

2424
02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:46.500
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

2425
02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:51.860
<v Speaker 2>as a physiological phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how you're listening to music </v>

2426
02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:55.011
<v Speaker 2>and you get chills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people experienced that more than </v>

2427
02:31:55.011 --> 02:31:55.170
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Open people experienced that more.</v>

2428
02:31:55.171 --> 02:32:00.171
<v Speaker 2>Or music is a pretty reliable solicitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have chills.</v>

2429
02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:06.090
<v Speaker 2>That's Palo erection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your hair standing on end.</v>

2430
02:32:06.510 --> 02:32:09.600
<v Speaker 2>You see a cat when it sees a dog puffs </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2431
02:32:09.780 --> 02:32:13.370
<v Speaker 2>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing like that.</v>

2432
02:32:13.371 --> 02:32:16.320
<v Speaker 2>That chill is your hair standing on end </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the.</v>

2433
02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:21.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the sensation you get in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presence of a predator.</v>

2434
02:32:21.150 --> 02:32:24.750
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there are experiences.</v>

2435
02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:30.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously it's become very </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitively and emotionally complex and </v>

2436
02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:34.671
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's fundamental evolutionary </v>

2437
02:32:34.671 --> 02:32:37.640
<v Speaker 2>underpinning is the instantaneous pilot </v>
<v Speaker 2>erection that you see in prey animals </v>

2438
02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:39.990
<v Speaker 2>when they're confronted by a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course that would be,</v>

2439
02:32:40.170 --> 02:32:45.170
<v Speaker 2>if you are a rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can bloody well believed that you </v>

2440
02:32:45.170 --> 02:32:45.540
<v Speaker 2>see a wolf and it would inspire all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

2441
02:32:45.541 --> 02:32:50.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a wolf that was 20 feet high came </v>

2442
02:32:50.541 --> 02:32:50.541
<v Speaker 2>bounding in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2443
02:32:50.541 --> 02:32:54.920
<v Speaker 2>you'd feel off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now that will convince you that </v>

2444
02:32:54.920 --> 02:32:55.890
<v Speaker 2>there's something that you still need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

2445
02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last question,</v>

2446
02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:03.710
<v Speaker 7>perfect timing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hi Dr.</v>

2447
02:33:03.711 --> 02:33:08.711
<v Speaker 7>Beard Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My name is Gary and I'm a clinical and </v>

2448
02:33:08.711 --> 02:33:10.901
<v Speaker 7>counseling master's student right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so one of the key ideas that's been </v>

2449
02:33:10.901 --> 02:33:15.041
<v Speaker 7>surfacing time and time again in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>lecturers is the idea that phenomenology</v>

2450
02:33:15.470 --> 02:33:20.470
<v Speaker 7>is structured and flows mythologically </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the way that plays out as I'm </v>

2451
02:33:23.870 --> 02:33:28.870
<v Speaker 7>supposing effectively just pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 7>to what comes up kind of naturally and </v>

2452
02:33:29.661 --> 02:33:34.661
<v Speaker 7>you can locate the cow elements and your</v>
<v Speaker 7>experience and product them with </v>

2453
02:33:34.661 --> 02:33:39.460
<v Speaker 7>whatever degree of necessity you think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I'm trying to situate this within the</v>

2454
02:33:39.561 --> 02:33:44.561
<v Speaker 7>clinical context.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We can conceptualize psychotherapy as a </v>

2455
02:33:46.941 --> 02:33:51.941
<v Speaker 7>kind of guided journey just as you </v>
<v Speaker 7>touched on in this lecture where it's </v>

2456
02:33:52.491 --> 02:33:55.190
<v Speaker 7>more of a metal journey in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a meadow heroic journey,</v>

2457
02:33:55.191 --> 02:33:56.450
<v Speaker 7>but I know how you want to think about </v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

2458
02:33:56.780 --> 02:34:01.780
<v Speaker 7>but just for those of us who are </v>
<v Speaker 7>interested in kind of grounding and </v>

2459
02:34:01.851 --> 02:34:05.510
<v Speaker 7>implementing these ideas within </v>
<v Speaker 7>psychotherapeutic practice,</v>

2460
02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:08.900
<v Speaker 7>what should we watch out for in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>process itself?</v>

2461
02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:11.720
<v Speaker 7>What comes up?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What should we be afraid of,</v>

2462
02:34:11.721 --> 02:34:14.990
<v Speaker 7>were fearful of or cautious about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or what should we tend towards?</v>

2463
02:34:15.170 --> 02:34:15.890
<v Speaker 7>That's my question.</v>

2464
02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:20.120
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the,</v>

2465
02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:26.760
<v Speaker 5>one of the people who I've read that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>had the biggest impact on me as a </v>

2466
02:34:27.101 --> 02:34:30.390
<v Speaker 5>clinician was Carl Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2467
02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:36.060
<v Speaker 5>and the reason for that is that Carl </v>
<v Speaker 5>Rogers put tremendous emphasis on </v>

2468
02:34:36.060 --> 02:34:39.301
<v Speaker 5>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's almost impossible to </v>

2469
02:34:39.301 --> 02:34:40.540
<v Speaker 5>overestimate how useful it is to listen </v>
<v Speaker 5>to your clients.</v>

2470
02:34:40.710 --> 02:34:45.710
<v Speaker 5>Like you need a Meta scheme in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense and the metal scheme I think is </v>

2471
02:34:47.081 --> 02:34:52.081
<v Speaker 5>laid out in the sermon on the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something like Orient Yourself and </v>

2472
02:34:52.961 --> 02:34:57.961
<v Speaker 5>your client towards the good that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>client has to conceptualize what that </v>

2473
02:34:59.051 --> 02:35:00.940
<v Speaker 5>might be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can serve as a guide,</v>

2474
02:35:00.941 --> 02:35:05.941
<v Speaker 5>but it has to come from that person </v>
<v Speaker 5>because one of the things that you want </v>

2475
02:35:05.941 --> 02:35:09.721
<v Speaker 5>to find out from your client is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's wrong they have to tell you and </v>

2476
02:35:11.050 --> 02:35:13.990
<v Speaker 5>what would not having something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>look like,</v>

2477
02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:19.220
<v Speaker 5>like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you could have what you wanted and </v>

2478
02:35:19.220 --> 02:35:19.510
<v Speaker 5>that and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be good.</v>

2479
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:21.140
<v Speaker 5>What would that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2480
02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:23.260
<v Speaker 5>So that establishes your star,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2481
02:35:23.261 --> 02:35:28.261
<v Speaker 5>It's like Japan establishing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship with the Star at the </v>

2482
02:35:28.261 --> 02:35:28.630
<v Speaker 5>beginning of Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's what we're aiming at.</v>

2483
02:35:29.230 --> 02:35:30.760
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so now you've got that Schema.</v>

2484
02:35:30.761 --> 02:35:34.000
<v Speaker 5>Here's what we're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you might say you might think,</v>

2485
02:35:34.001 --> 02:35:39.001
<v Speaker 5>well now what happens to the client as </v>
<v Speaker 5>they meet their dragons along the way </v>

2486
02:35:39.001 --> 02:35:43.140
<v Speaker 5>and their dragons would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well now you know what you want and </v>

2487
02:35:43.140 --> 02:35:44.470
<v Speaker 5>there are things in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and some of those things might.</v>

2488
02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:47.320
<v Speaker 5>Many of those things are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>intensely practical,</v>

2489
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:49.720
<v Speaker 5>but they're practical slash </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological,</v>

2490
02:35:49.721 --> 02:35:54.721
<v Speaker 5>so like so maybe someone is has a job </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they would like to move forward in </v>

2491
02:35:54.721 --> 02:35:58.891
<v Speaker 5>their job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're terrified of speaking in </v>

2492
02:35:58.891 --> 02:35:58.891
<v Speaker 5>public.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2493
02:35:58.891 --> 02:36:01.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that a psychological problem or a </v>

2494
02:36:01.831 --> 02:36:01.831
<v Speaker 5>practical problem?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's both.</v>

2495
02:36:01.831 --> 02:36:03.430
<v Speaker 5>It's also a real problem in many </v>
<v Speaker 5>positions.</v>

2496
02:36:03.430 --> 02:36:08.350
<v Speaker 5>Unless you can speak fluently publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to hit a ceiling and you're</v>

2497
02:36:08.351 --> 02:36:13.351
<v Speaker 5>not going to go anywhere and so for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person to move towards that goal,</v>

2498
02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:20.160
<v Speaker 5>then they have to confront the obstacles</v>
<v Speaker 5>that manifest themselves within that </v>

2499
02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:24.721
<v Speaker 5>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And part of your job as a clinician is </v>

2500
02:36:24.721 --> 02:36:26.290
<v Speaker 5>to identify the obstacles and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>discriminate them from things they don't</v>

2501
02:36:26.291 --> 02:36:27.690
<v Speaker 5>have to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2502
02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:29.620
<v Speaker 5>Part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2503
02:36:29.621 --> 02:36:34.240
<v Speaker 5>you can't just run around and try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>combat all of the chaos in the world.</v>

2504
02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:36.820
<v Speaker 5>Some of it is your chaos and a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it isn't,</v>

2505
02:36:37.210 --> 02:36:42.210
<v Speaker 5>and the chaos that's yours is the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 5>that emerges as you move towards a </v>

2506
02:36:42.210 --> 02:36:45.551
<v Speaker 5>necessary goal and so partly what you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing by listening to your client is to </v>

2507
02:36:45.551 --> 02:36:47.020
<v Speaker 5>help them cut their dragons down to </v>
<v Speaker 5>size.</v>

2508
02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:52.280
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because what'll happen if you start to </v>

2509
02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:52.280
<v Speaker 5>talk to somebody about public speaking </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you really talked to them,</v>

2510
02:36:52.310 --> 02:36:57.310
<v Speaker 5>is that you decompose the problem into a</v>
<v Speaker 5>set of maybe 20 sub problems like,</v>

2511
02:36:57.640 --> 02:37:02.640
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know exactly how to give a </v>

2512
02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:02.640
<v Speaker 5>speech?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what's your theory of,</v>

2513
02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:03.400
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of public speaking?</v>

2514
02:37:04.030 --> 02:37:06.010
<v Speaker 5>You know how to look at people when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking.</v>

2515
02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:09.250
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how to speak loudly enough </v>
<v Speaker 5>so that people can hear you?</v>

2516
02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:12.940
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a philosophy of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of public speaking?</v>

2517
02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:15.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean all those things are necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In order to do it properly,</v>

2518
02:37:15.441 --> 02:37:16.400
<v Speaker 5>you need to decompose</v>

2519
02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:19.430
<v Speaker 5>that with the client and then to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>those problems,</v>

2520
02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:24.520
<v Speaker 5>you have to decompose them to the point </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they can be met by a practical </v>

2521
02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:27.140
<v Speaker 5>solution and then you have to guide the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person through the implementation of the</v>

2522
02:37:27.141 --> 02:37:32.141
<v Speaker 5>practical solution and mostly you do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that by listening.</v>

2523
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:37.870
<v Speaker 5>It's like what you need to be is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person who helps the person that you're </v>

2524
02:37:37.870 --> 02:37:39.650
<v Speaker 5>working with orient themselves towards a</v>
<v Speaker 5>better future.</v>

2525
02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:43.460
<v Speaker 5>That's the compact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You and I are in this space at this time</v>

2526
02:37:43.850 --> 02:37:46.670
<v Speaker 5>to make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

2527
02:37:46.671 --> 02:37:51.671
<v Speaker 5>we have to decide what better would look</v>
<v Speaker 5>like and second we need a strategy and </v>

2528
02:37:51.671 --> 02:37:53.210
<v Speaker 5>third we need to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once we have that,</v>

2529
02:37:53.211 --> 02:37:58.211
<v Speaker 5>we're going to see the obstacles and </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of those are going to be </v>

2530
02:37:58.211 --> 02:38:00.581
<v Speaker 5>psychological and some of them are going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be practical and we're going to </v>

2531
02:38:00.581 --> 02:38:03.191
<v Speaker 5>engage in joint problem solving of </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever sort is necessary in order to </v>

2532
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:09.550
<v Speaker 5>minimize the impact of those problems or</v>
<v Speaker 5>to gain from the problems in dream </v>

2533
02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:10.430
<v Speaker 5>analysis can be extremely useful for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2534
02:38:10.430 --> 02:38:15.430
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's even more useful for helping the </v>

2535
02:38:15.430 --> 02:38:17.090
<v Speaker 5>person identify what the goal is because</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's often difficult for people,</v>

2536
02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:17.600
<v Speaker 5>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2537
02:38:17.601 --> 02:38:19.970
<v Speaker 5>I know that something's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know what I want.</v>

2538
02:38:20.390 --> 02:38:22.790
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes people get so stuck there that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just can't get.</v>

2539
02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:25.760
<v Speaker 5>They just can't get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

2540
02:38:25.761 --> 02:38:30.761
<v Speaker 5>And then what would you watch out for </v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomenal phenomenologically?</v>

2541
02:38:31.610 --> 02:38:33.320
<v Speaker 5>The way it shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way it's experienced?</v>

2542
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:36.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say as a clinician,</v>

2543
02:38:36.261 --> 02:38:38.750
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that you should watch </v>
<v Speaker 5>out for is resentment.</v>

2544
02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:44.680
<v Speaker 5>So there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a couple of rules of thumb I </v>

2545
02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:47.421
<v Speaker 5>that I think are useful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't do anything for your clients that </v>

2546
02:38:47.421 --> 02:38:48.020
<v Speaker 5>they can do for themselves and don't do </v>
<v Speaker 5>them any favors.</v>

2547
02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:54.100
<v Speaker 5>Now I think you can step beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 5>confines of your role carefully now and </v>

2548
02:38:56.931 --> 02:39:01.931
<v Speaker 5>then to show that there's a more human </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection than the merely contractual.</v>

2549
02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:11.020
<v Speaker 5>I think that's very useful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but their problems are not your </v>

2550
02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:15.671
<v Speaker 5>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do not have any right to their </v>

2551
02:39:15.671 --> 02:39:17.501
<v Speaker 5>problems and so you have to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 5>that detachment because otherwise you </v>

2552
02:39:17.501 --> 02:39:21.041
<v Speaker 5>can steal their destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to be the person that </v>

2553
02:39:21.041 --> 02:39:21.680
<v Speaker 5>solves their problems because you steal </v>
<v Speaker 5>their destiny.</v>

2554
02:39:21.681 --> 02:39:26.681
<v Speaker 5>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to be someone with whom they </v>

2555
02:39:26.681 --> 02:39:27.950
<v Speaker 5>can figure things out for themself and </v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's.</v>

2556
02:39:27.980 --> 02:39:30.890
<v Speaker 5>There can be hubris and being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>clinician because you can be the problem</v>

2557
02:39:30.891 --> 02:39:32.870
<v Speaker 5>solver and that elevates you to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

2558
02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:36.170
<v Speaker 5>You elevate yourself to that position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll fall flat on your face,</v>

2559
02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:38.660
<v Speaker 5>you'll hurt your clients and things will</v>
<v Speaker 5>kick back on you very,</v>

2560
02:39:38.661 --> 02:39:41.120
<v Speaker 5>very hard because what the hell do you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know?</v>

2561
02:39:41.860 --> 02:39:46.860
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing because that person is very </v>

2562
02:39:46.860 --> 02:39:49.070
<v Speaker 5>complicated and they need to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need to sort themselves out and.</v>

2563
02:39:49.071 --> 02:39:54.071
<v Speaker 5>But you can be a facilitator for that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's all you should be and so you </v>

2564
02:39:54.071 --> 02:39:54.170
<v Speaker 5>have to watch that.</v>

2565
02:39:54.170 --> 02:39:57.680
<v Speaker 5>You have to watch over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Becoming over entail really entangled,</v>

2566
02:39:57.681 --> 02:40:02.681
<v Speaker 5>so you have to maintain your detachment </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the best sense and you have to not </v>

2567
02:40:02.681 --> 02:40:06.821
<v Speaker 5>overstep your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's easy to become hubris stick when </v>

2568
02:40:06.821 --> 02:40:07.370
<v Speaker 5>the person is looking to you for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>answers.</v>

2569
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:10.250
<v Speaker 5>It's like you might.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have the answers,</v>

2570
02:40:10.251 --> 02:40:13.860
<v Speaker 5>although you might be able to find,</v>
<v Speaker 5>help the person find their way.</v>

2571
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:16.420
<v Speaker 5>That's what you do with everyone you </v>
<v Speaker 5>love to write.</v>

2572
02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:21.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean you don't provide them with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>answers because then they become little </v>

2573
02:40:21.571 --> 02:40:24.540
<v Speaker 5>clones of you and unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bitter,</v>

2574
02:40:24.541 --> 02:40:29.541
<v Speaker 5>resentful and angry little clones of </v>
<v Speaker 5>view because you usurped their destiny.</v>

2575
02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:35.960
<v Speaker 5>And so the same thing applies within </v>
<v Speaker 5>familiar arrangements or friendships,</v>

2576
02:40:36.571 --> 02:40:38.670
<v Speaker 5>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2577
02:40:40.810 --> 02:40:45.270
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
