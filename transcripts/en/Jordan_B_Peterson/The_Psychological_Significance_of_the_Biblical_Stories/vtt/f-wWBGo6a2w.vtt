1
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 2>well thank you all very much for coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really shocking to me that you </v>

3
00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 2>don't have anything better to do on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday.</v>

4
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously though.</v>

5
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:41.170
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

7
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many of you here to listen to</v>

8
00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:52.801
<v Speaker 2>a sequence of psych,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of lectures on the psychological </v>

9
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 2>significance of the biblical stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't something I've wanted to do for</v>

10
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:58.621
<v Speaker 2>a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it still does surprise me that </v>

11
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a ready audience for it and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

12
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 2>so that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see how it goes.</v>

13
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll start with this because this is the</v>

14
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:15.391
<v Speaker 2>right question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The right question is why bother doing </v>

15
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.151
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean why should I bother </v>

16
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 2>doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my own reasons for doing it,</v>

17
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 2>but you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

18
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.800
<v Speaker 2>why bother with this stranger will book </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

19
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

20
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a contradictory</v>

21
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 2>document that's been cobbled together </v>
<v Speaker 2>over thousands of years.</v>

22
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>It's outlasted kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this many,</v>

23
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 2>many kingdoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

24
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.770
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting that it turns </v>

25
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 2>out that a book is more durable than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stone.</v>

26
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:51.110
<v Speaker 2>It's more durable than a castle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more durable than an empire,</v>

27
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that.</v>

28
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 2>It's something in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so evanescent can be so long living,</v>

29
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 2>so there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of a mystery.</v>

30
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm approaching this whole scenario.</v>

31
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:11.531
<v Speaker 2>This is the biblical stories as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a mystery fundamentally because </v>

32
00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:16.271
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot we don't understand about </v>

33
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand how they came about.</v>

34
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 2>We don't really understand how they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>put together.</v>

35
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand why they had such an</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable impact on civilization.</v>

36
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand how people could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have believed them.</v>

37
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand what it means that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't believe them now or or even </v>

38
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.690
<v Speaker 2>what it would mean if we didn't believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>them there.</v>

39
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 2>There's and then on top of all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the additional problem,</v>

40
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 2>which isn't specific to me but is </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly relevant to me that no matter </v>

41
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.231
<v Speaker 2>how educated you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not educated enough to discuss </v>

42
00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 2>the psychological significance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical stories,</v>

43
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.180
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to do my best and partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I want to learn more about and </v>

44
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>one of</v>

45
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 3>the things I've learned is that the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to learn about something is to talk </v>

46
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 3>about it and when I'm lecturing I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

47
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to tell you what I know </v>

48
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.540
<v Speaker 3>for sure to be the case because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of things I don't know for sure to </v>

49
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 3>be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to make sense out of this and</v>

50
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 3>I have been doing this for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

51
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Know you may know you may.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I'm an admirer of Nisha.</v>

52
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Nisha was a devastating critic of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say dogmatic Christianity.</v>

53
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Christianity as it was instantiated in </v>
<v Speaker 3>institutions,</v>

54
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.670
<v Speaker 3>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although he.</v>

55
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 3>He's a very paradoxical thinker because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

56
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:45.901
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you said was that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't believe that the scientific </v>

57
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:50.670
<v Speaker 3>revolution would have ever got off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground if it hadn't been for </v>

58
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Christianity and more specifically for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholicism because he believed that </v>

59
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 3>over the course of really a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

60
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 3>the European mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

61
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.130
<v Speaker 3>had to train itself to interpret </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that was known within a </v>

62
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 3>single coherent framework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coherent.</v>

63
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 3>If you accept the initial axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a single coherent framework and so neat,</v>

64
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.760
<v Speaker 3>you believe that that catholicized of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

65
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.190
<v Speaker 3>of the phenomena of life and of history </v>
<v Speaker 3>produced the kind of mind that was then </v>

66
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:31.561
<v Speaker 3>capable of transcending that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>dogmatic foundations and then </v>

67
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:36.181
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on something else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in this particular case happened </v>

68
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 3>to be the natural world and so need you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to believe that in some sense,</v>

69
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:43.231
<v Speaker 3>Christianity died at its own hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had spent a very long period of time </v>

70
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 3>trying to attune people to the necessity</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the truth.</v>

71
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absent the corruption and all of that,</v>

72
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 3>that's always part of any human </v>
<v Speaker 3>endeavor.</v>

73
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.690
<v Speaker 3>And then the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spirit of the truth that was </v>

74
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.271
<v Speaker 3>developed by Christianity turned on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>roots of Christianity and everyone woke </v>

75
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 3>up and said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or thought something like,</v>

76
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is it that we came to believe any of</v>

77
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

78
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like waking up one day and noting,</v>

79
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 3>noting that you really don't know why </v>
<v Speaker 3>you put a Christmas tree up,</v>

80
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 3>but you've been doing it for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what people do.</v>

81
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 3>And I know there are reasons that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christmas trees came about,</v>

82
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you say?</v>

83
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 3>That ritual lasts long after the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been forgotten.</v>

84
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 3>So now Nicha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although he was a critic of Christianity</v>

85
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 3>and also a champion of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of its disciplinary capacity,</v>

86
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:40.981
<v Speaker 3>because you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing that needs you to </v>

87
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 3>believe was that it was not possible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be free in some sense,</v>

88
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 3>unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you had been a slave.</v>

89
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.730
<v Speaker 3>And by that he meant that you don't go </v>
<v Speaker 3>from childhood to full fledged adult </v>

90
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:55.321
<v Speaker 3>individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go from childhood to estate of </v>

91
00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:59.490
<v Speaker 3>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you might think is akin to </v>

92
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 3>slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to self imposed slavery.</v>

93
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 3>That that would be the best scenario </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have to discipline yourself to</v>

94
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:09.851
<v Speaker 3>become something specific before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be able to retain the generality </v>

95
00:06:09.851 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 3>that you had as a child.</v>

96
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.590
<v Speaker 3>And he believed that Christianity had </v>
<v Speaker 3>played that role for Western </v>

97
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.810
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

98
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.160
<v Speaker 3>but in the late 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he announced that God was dead and you </v>

99
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 3>often hear of that as something </v>
<v Speaker 3>triumphant,</v>

100
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 3>but for her it wasn't because he was too</v>
<v Speaker 3>nuanced.</v>

101
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:38.471
<v Speaker 3>The thinker to be that simple minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See Nicha understood that this is </v>

102
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:44.021
<v Speaker 3>something I'm going to try to make clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we,</v>

103
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.320
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a very large amount that we </v>

104
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.961
<v Speaker 3>don't know about the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that we don't know about </v>

105
00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 3>reality and we have our articulated </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations of the world.</v>

106
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 3>And then you can think of outside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

107
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:02.981
<v Speaker 3>there are things we know absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing about and there's a buffer </v>

108
00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:06.011
<v Speaker 3>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those are things we sort of know </v>

109
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 3>something about and we don't know them </v>
<v Speaker 3>in an articulated way.</v>

110
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

111
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you're arguing with one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

112
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.780
<v Speaker 3>someone close to you and they're in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad mood,</v>

113
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

114
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.670
<v Speaker 3>they're being touchy and unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it keep the conversation up and </v>

115
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 3>maybe all of a sudden they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

116
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:24.971
<v Speaker 3>they get angry or maybe they cry and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then when they cry they figure out what </v>

117
00:07:24.971 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 3>they're angry about and it has nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with you.</v>

118
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 3>Even though you might have been what </v>
<v Speaker 3>precipitated the argument,</v>

119
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting phenomena as far </v>

120
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.621
<v Speaker 3>as I'm concerned because it means that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people can know things at one level </v>

121
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:38.220
<v Speaker 3>without being able to speak what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know at another and so in,</v>

122
00:07:38.221 --> 00:07:43.221
<v Speaker 3>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thoughts rise up from the body and </v>

123
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:46.210
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do that in moods and they do that </v>

124
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:46.210
<v Speaker 3>in the images and they do that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>actions.</v>

125
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.171
<v Speaker 3>And we have all sorts of ways that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand before we understand in a </v>

126
00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:54.941
<v Speaker 3>fully articulated manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we have this articulated space </v>

127
00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:59.381
<v Speaker 3>that we can all discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then outside of that we have </v>

128
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:00.240
<v Speaker 3>something that's more akin to a dream </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're embedded in.</v>

129
00:08:00.241 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 3>And it's an emotional dream that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>embedded in and that's based at least in</v>

130
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 3>part on her actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll describe that later.</v>

131
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Speaker 3>And then outside of that is what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know anything about at all.</v>

132
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 3>And in that dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the mystics live and that's</v>

133
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:18.461
<v Speaker 3>where the artists live and there are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mediators between the absolute unknown </v>

134
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:22.931
<v Speaker 3>and the things we know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see what that means in some </v>

135
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:29.171
<v Speaker 3>sense is what we know is established on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a form of knowledge that we don't really</v>

136
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:34.631
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that if those two things are out of </v>

137
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:37.091
<v Speaker 3>sync.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might say if our articulated </v>

138
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:39.311
<v Speaker 3>knowledge is out of sync with our dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than we've become dissociated </v>

139
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:44.261
<v Speaker 3>internally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think things we don't act out and we </v>

140
00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:47.650
<v Speaker 3>act out things we don't dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that produces a kind of sickness of </v>

141
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.551
<v Speaker 3>the spirit and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that sickness of the spirit it see </v>

142
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cure or is something like an system</v>

143
00:08:56.041 --> 00:09:01.041
<v Speaker 3>of belief and representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then people turn to things like </v>

144
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:04.941
<v Speaker 3>ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I regard as parasites on an </v>

145
00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 3>underlying religious substructure to try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to organize their thinking.</v>

146
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 3>And then that's a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what Nisha Nisha foresaw,</v>

147
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.960
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew that when we knocked the slats </v>

148
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 3>out of the base of Western civilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>by destroying this representation,</v>

149
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 3>this is God ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

150
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 3>that we would destabilize and move back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and forth violently between nihilism,</v>

151
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:29.481
<v Speaker 3>let's say in the extremes of videology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was particularly concerned about </v>

152
00:09:29.481 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 3>radical leftist ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

153
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 3>unbelieved in predicted this in the late</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 hundreds,</v>

154
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 3>which is really an absolute intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 3>tour.</v>

155
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:40.971
<v Speaker 3>De Force of staggering magnitude </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicted that in the 20th century that </v>

156
00:09:40.971 --> 00:09:44.991
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of millions of people would die</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the replacement of these </v>

157
00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 3>underlying dreamlike structures with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this rational,</v>

158
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 3>rational but deeply incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of the world.</v>

159
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:57.411
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd been oscillating back and forth </v>

160
00:09:57.411 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 3>between left and right in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever since.</v>

161
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some good sprinkling of nihilism in</v>

162
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:05.331
<v Speaker 3>there and despair in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the situation of the modern </v>

163
00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 3>western person and in an increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>have people in general.</v>

164
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think part of the reason that Islam </v>

165
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.030
<v Speaker 3>has its backup with regards to the west </v>
<v Speaker 3>to such a degree.</v>

166
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's many reasons and not all of them</v>

167
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 3>are valid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

168
00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:20.420
<v Speaker 3>But one of the reasons is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

169
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they being still grounded in a,</v>

170
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.000
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a dream,</v>

171
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:29.001
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can see that the root less </v>

172
00:10:29.001 --> 00:10:32.360
<v Speaker 3>questioning mind of the west pope poses </v>
<v Speaker 3>a tremendous danger to the integrity of </v>

173
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 3>their culture now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it does,</v>

174
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:36.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean Westerners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

175
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 3>we undermine ourselves all the time with</v>
<v Speaker 3>our searching intellect.</v>

176
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not complaining about that at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

177
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.250
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

178
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.760
<v Speaker 3>there isn't anything easy that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>done about it,</v>

179
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.940
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still,</v>

180
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.300
<v Speaker 3>it's still sort of what fruitful </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe and you know,</v>

181
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 3>it has real effects on people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not some abstract thing,</v>

182
00:10:57.481 --> 00:10:57.710
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

183
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of times when I've been treating </v>

184
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:02.740
<v Speaker 3>people for depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

185
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 3>or anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have existential issues.</v>

186
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.831
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just some psychiatric </v>

187
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:09.831
<v Speaker 3>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just that they're tapped off of</v>

188
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 3>normal because their brain chemistry is </v>
<v Speaker 3>faulty.</v>

189
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

190
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:18.051
<v Speaker 3>sometimes that happens to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that they are overwhelmed by the </v>

191
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:22.350
<v Speaker 3>suffering and complexity of their life </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're not sure why it's reasonable</v>

192
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 3>to continue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

193
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 3>that they can feel that terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative meanings of life,</v>

194
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:31.440
<v Speaker 3>but are skeptical beyond belief about </v>
<v Speaker 3>any of the positive meanings.</v>

195
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:36.441
<v Speaker 3>I had one client who was a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant artist and as long as he </v>

196
00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:36.900
<v Speaker 3>didn't think he was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

197
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 3>because he'd go and create and who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at being an artist.</v>

198
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

199
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:46.071
<v Speaker 3>he had that personality that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually creative and quite </v>

200
00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:46.071
<v Speaker 3>brilliant.</v>

201
00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Although he was self denigrating and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as he started to think about</v>

202
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:50.910
<v Speaker 3>what he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

203
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

204
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.110
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a drill or a saw or something like </v>

205
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.831
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd saw the branch off that he was </v>

206
00:12:01.831 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 3>sitting on because it starts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticize what he was doing.</v>

207
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Even the utility of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it was sort of self </v>

208
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.110
<v Speaker 3>evidently useful and then he would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

209
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.841
<v Speaker 3>It would be very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard for him to even motivate </v>

210
00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:11.841
<v Speaker 3>himself to create an he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

211
00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 3>he always struck me as a good example </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

212
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.320
<v Speaker 3>of the consequences of having your </v>
<v Speaker 3>rational intellect divorced in some way </v>

213
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:26.701
<v Speaker 3>from your being divorced enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually questioned the utility of </v>

214
00:12:26.701 --> 00:12:28.750
<v Speaker 3>your being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a good thing.</v>

215
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

216
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.900
<v Speaker 3>it's really not a good thing because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifests itself not only an individual </v>

217
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 3>psychopathology but also in social </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychopathology.</v>

218
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 3>And that's his proclivity of people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get tangled up in ideologies,</v>

219
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:44.640
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I really do think of as,</v>

220
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.130
<v Speaker 3>as they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like crippled religions.</v>

221
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the right way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

222
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:51.910
<v Speaker 3>They're like a religion that's missing </v>
<v Speaker 3>an arm and a leg,</v>

223
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 3>but can still haul bill along and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it provides a certain amount of security</v>

224
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:56.880
<v Speaker 3>and group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

225
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
<v Speaker 3>it's warped and twisted and demented and</v>
<v Speaker 3>banter and it's a parasite on something </v>

226
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.650
<v Speaker 3>underlying that's rich and true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how it looks to me anyways.</v>

227
00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so.</v>

228
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's very important that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort out this problem.</v>

229
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

230
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.260
<v Speaker 3>I think that there isn't anything more </v>
<v Speaker 3>important that needs to be done than </v>

231
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 3>that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've thought that for a long,</v>

232
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.720
<v Speaker 3>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably since the early eighties when I</v>

233
00:13:24.731 --> 00:13:29.731
<v Speaker 3>started looking at the site,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the role that belief systems played in </v>

234
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:31.720
<v Speaker 3>regulating psychological and social </v>
<v Speaker 3>health,</v>

235
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they,</v>

236
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.330
<v Speaker 3>you can tell that they do that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of how upset people get.</v>

237
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.310
<v Speaker 3>If you challenge their belief systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

238
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 3>why the hell do they care?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly what difference does it make if,</v>

239
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 3>if all of your ideological axioms are </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent correct?</v>

240
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.870
<v Speaker 3>Like people get unbelievably upset when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

241
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.570
<v Speaker 3>when you poke them in the axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

242
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.960
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is not by any stretch of the </v>

243
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.510
<v Speaker 3>imagination obvious why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

244
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.780
<v Speaker 3>but there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's a fundamental truth </v>

245
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:03.780
<v Speaker 3>that they're standing on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

246
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.041
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're on a raft in the </v>

247
00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:08.041
<v Speaker 3>middle of the ocean and you're starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pull out the logs,</v>

248
00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're afraid they're gonna fall in</v>

249
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 3>and drown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like drowning.</v>

250
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:13.930
<v Speaker 3>What and what are the logs protecting </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

251
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:19.090
<v Speaker 3>protecting them from and why are they so</v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid to to move beyond the confines of</v>

252
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Speaker 3>the ideological system and like these </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not obvious things,</v>

253
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:28.590
<v Speaker 3>so I've been trying to puzzle that out </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time and I've done some </v>

254
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 3>lectures about that that are on youtube.</v>

255
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Most of you know that some of what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to talk about in this series,</v>

256
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 3>you'll have heard if you've listened to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the youtube videos,</v>

257
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 3>but you know I'm trying to hit it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>different angles and so okay,</v>

258
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:44.770
<v Speaker 3>so niches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Idea was that human beings,</v>

259
00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to create their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>values essentially.</v>

260
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Now he understood that we have bodies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that we had motivations and emotions</v>

261
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:56.711
<v Speaker 3>like he was a romantic thinker in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense but way ahead of his time because </v>

262
00:14:56.711 --> 00:15:00.050
<v Speaker 3>he knew that our capacity to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't some free floating soul,</v>

263
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:04.730
<v Speaker 3>but was embedded in our physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constrained by our emotions,</v>

264
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 3>shaped by our motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shaped by our body.</v>

265
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:11.891
<v Speaker 3>He understood that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he still believed that the only </v>

266
00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:14.480
<v Speaker 3>possible way out of the problem would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>for human beings themselves.</v>

267
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:19.481
<v Speaker 3>To become something akin to God and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create their own values that was steps </v>

268
00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:20.830
<v Speaker 3>and he thought that the person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

269
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:25.970
<v Speaker 3>He talked about the person who could </v>
<v Speaker 3>create their own values as the overman </v>

270
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.790
<v Speaker 3>or the superman and that was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts of the Nietzschean philosophy that</v>

271
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:31.840
<v Speaker 3>the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say took out of context and used</v>

272
00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:36.841
<v Speaker 3>to fuel their superior man ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know what happened with that.</v>

273
00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:41.810
<v Speaker 3>That didn't seem to turn out very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

274
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:47.340
<v Speaker 3>And See.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also spent a lot of time reading Carl </v>

275
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.710
<v Speaker 3>young and it was through you and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>

276
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Piaget's developmental psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I started to understand that are </v>

277
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 3>articulated systems of thought are </v>
<v Speaker 3>embedded in something like a dream.</v>

278
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.690
<v Speaker 3>That dream is informed in a complex way </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way we act.</v>

279
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.930
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we act out things we don't understand </v>

280
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.401
<v Speaker 3>all the time and if that wasn't the case</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we wouldn't need a psychology or </v>

281
00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:15.671
<v Speaker 3>sociology or in anthropology or any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because we would be completely </v>

282
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:15.671
<v Speaker 3>transparent to ourselves.</v>

283
00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:20.560
<v Speaker 3>And we're clearly not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're much more complicated than we </v>

284
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.521
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which means that the way that we behave </v>

285
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:27.041
<v Speaker 3>contains way more information than we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know and part of the dream that </v>

286
00:16:27.501 --> 00:16:32.501
<v Speaker 3>surrounds our articulated knowledge has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been extracted as a consequence of us </v>

287
00:16:32.501 --> 00:16:37.061
<v Speaker 3>watching each other and behave and </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling stories about it for thousands </v>

288
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:40.700
<v Speaker 3>and thousands and thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extracting out patterns of behavior that</v>

289
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:45.701
<v Speaker 3>characterize humanity and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent them partly through </v>

290
00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:48.530
<v Speaker 3>invitation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also through drama and mythology and</v>

291
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 3>literature and art and all of that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent what we're like so that we can</v>

292
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:56.831
<v Speaker 3>understand what we're like and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>process of understanding is what I see </v>

293
00:16:57.051 --> 00:17:02.051
<v Speaker 3>unfolding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in part the biblical stories </v>

294
00:17:02.051 --> 00:17:02.870
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's halting and partial and awkward and</v>

295
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:07.871
<v Speaker 3>contradictory and and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the things that makes </v>

296
00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:10.850
<v Speaker 3>the book so complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I see in it the struggle of humanity</v>

297
00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 3>to arise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to rise above its animal forebear say,</v>

298
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:17.600
<v Speaker 3>and to become conscious of what it means</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be human.</v>

299
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.130
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very difficult thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we don't know who we are,</v>

300
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.520
<v Speaker 3>what we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we came from.</v>

301
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:27.521
<v Speaker 3>One of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know the light life is an </v>

302
00:17:27.521 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 3>unbroken chain going back three and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>half billion years.</v>

303
00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:33.701
<v Speaker 3>It's an absolutely unbelievable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every single one of your ancestors </v>

304
00:17:33.701 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 3>reproduce successfully for three and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>half billion years.</v>

305
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.430
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We rose out of the dirt and the muck and</v>

306
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.640
<v Speaker 3>here we are conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not knowing and we're trying to </v>

307
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 3>figure out who we are and a story that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been telling her,</v>

308
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 3>a set of stories that we've telling for </v>
<v Speaker 3>3000 years seems to me to have something</v>

309
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:54.540
<v Speaker 3>to offer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when,</v>

310
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.960
<v Speaker 3>when I look at the stories in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do it.</v>

311
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 3>I would say in some sense with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginner's mind,</v>

312
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a mystery.</v>

313
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:03.270
<v Speaker 3>This book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the Hell it was made,</v>

314
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:05.100
<v Speaker 3>why it was made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why we preserved it,</v>

315
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:10.370
<v Speaker 3>how it happened to motivated and entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture for 2000 years and to transform </v>

316
00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:12.540
<v Speaker 3>the world like what's going on?</v>

317
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:17.540
<v Speaker 3>How did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's by no means obvious and one of the </v>

318
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.811
<v Speaker 3>things that bothers me about casual </v>
<v Speaker 3>critics of religion is that they don't </v>

319
00:18:20.811 --> 00:18:23.370
<v Speaker 3>take the phenomena seriously and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>serious phenomenon.</v>

320
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:26.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not at least because people have the</v>

321
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:29.280
<v Speaker 3>capacity for religious experience and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one knows why that is.</v>

322
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can induce it reliably and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different ways.</v>

323
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.150
<v Speaker 3>You could do it with brain stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can certainly do it with drugs.</v>

324
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:38.220
<v Speaker 3>There's especially the psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>variety.</v>

325
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:43.221
<v Speaker 3>They produce intimations of the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Extraordinarily regularly.</v>

326
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:46.830
<v Speaker 3>People have been using drugs like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>for God only knows how long,</v>

327
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:48.030
<v Speaker 3>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

328
00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:53.031
<v Speaker 3>maybe more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to produce some sort of intimate union </v>

329
00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:57.201
<v Speaker 3>with the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we don't understand any of </v>

330
00:18:57.201 --> 00:18:59.721
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we discovered the psychedelics in </v>

331
00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:01.581
<v Speaker 3>the late sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shocked everybody so badly that they </v>

332
00:19:01.581 --> 00:19:04.660
<v Speaker 3>were instantly made illegal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoned in terms of research for like </v>

333
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.230
<v Speaker 3>50 years and it's no wonder because who </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hell would expected that?</v>

334
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Nobody now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now young was a student of niches.</v>

335
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.950
<v Speaker 3>You see him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was also,</v>

336
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.500
<v Speaker 3>I would say at the very astute critic of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nicha.</v>

337
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:24.480
<v Speaker 3>He was educated by Freud and Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freud,</v>

338
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.080
<v Speaker 3>I suppose in some sense started to </v>
<v Speaker 3>collate,</v>

339
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:32.090
<v Speaker 3>collate the information that we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>pertaining to the notion that people </v>

340
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.640
<v Speaker 3>lived inside a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

341
00:19:32.641 --> 00:19:36.630
<v Speaker 3>it was Freud who really popularized the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the unconscious mind,</v>

342
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.900
<v Speaker 3>and we take this for granted to such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree today that we don't understand </v>

343
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.060
<v Speaker 3>how revolutionary the idea was like with</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happened with Freud is that we've</v>

344
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:48.060
<v Speaker 3>taken all the marrow out of his bones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

345
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:50.630
<v Speaker 3>and less the husk behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

346
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.640
<v Speaker 3>now when we think about Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just think about the husk because </v>

347
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.940
<v Speaker 3>that's everything that's been discarded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so much of what he discovered is </v>

348
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.230
<v Speaker 3>part of our popular conception now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the idea that your perceptions</v>

349
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 3>and your actions and your thoughts are </v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

350
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you say,</v>

351
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:10.371
<v Speaker 3>informed and shaped by unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivations that are not part of your </v>

352
00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:11.690
<v Speaker 3>voluntary control.</v>

353
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.740
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange thing.</v>

354
00:20:13.741 --> 00:20:18.741
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most unsettling things </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the psychoanalytic theories </v>

355
00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 3>because the psychoanalytic theories are </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like,</v>

356
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:25.610
<v Speaker 3>you're a loose collection of living </v>
<v Speaker 3>subpersonalities each with its own set </v>

357
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.010
<v Speaker 3>of motivations and perceptions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions and rationales,</v>

358
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have limited control over that.</v>

359
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 3>So you're like a plurality of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

360
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.530
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of internal personalities that's loosely</v>

361
00:20:37.531 --> 00:20:42.531
<v Speaker 3>late into a unity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that because you can't control </v>

362
00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:47.031
<v Speaker 3>yourself very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of [inaudible] objections </v>

363
00:20:47.031 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 3>to niches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea that we could create our own values</v>

364
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 3>so young didn't believe that especially </v>
<v Speaker 3>not after interacting with Freud because</v>

365
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 3>he saw that human beings were affected </v>
<v Speaker 3>by things that were deeply,</v>

366
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:58.690
<v Speaker 3>deeply effected by things that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond their conscious control.</v>

367
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.510
<v Speaker 3>No one really knows how to conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>

368
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.590
<v Speaker 3>You know the cognitive psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about them in some senses.</v>

369
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.750
<v Speaker 3>Computational machines and the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

370
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 3>I think thought of them as gods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although it's more complex than that,</v>

371
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 3>like rage would be a god Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the regard of rage.</v>

372
00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that possesses you when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're angry,</v>

373
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:18.940
<v Speaker 3>you know it has a viewpoint and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it it,</v>

374
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:23.941
<v Speaker 3>it says what it wants to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that might have very little to do </v>

375
00:21:23.941 --> 00:21:27.481
<v Speaker 3>with what you want to say when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>being sensible and it doesn't just </v>

376
00:21:27.481 --> 00:21:30.781
<v Speaker 3>inhabit you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It inhabits everyone and it lives </v>

377
00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:33.091
<v Speaker 3>forever and it even inhabits animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's this transcendent </v>

378
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:38.100
<v Speaker 3>psychological entity that inhabits the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body politic like,</v>

379
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.780
<v Speaker 3>like a thought and habits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brain.</v>

380
00:21:40.781 --> 00:21:43.990
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange way of thinking,</v>

381
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:48.991
<v Speaker 3>but it certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it certainly has its merits and so and </v>

382
00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Speaker 3>those things well in some sense those </v>
<v Speaker 3>are deities,</v>

383
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:55.501
<v Speaker 3>although it's not that simple and so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>ill was regard very interested in dreams</v>

384
00:21:56.781 --> 00:22:01.781
<v Speaker 3>to started to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between dreams and myths </v>

385
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 3>because he would see in his client's </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams,</v>

386
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:08.370
<v Speaker 3>echoes of stories that he knew because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was deeply read in mythology and and </v>

387
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.020
<v Speaker 3>then he started to believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dream was the birthplace of the myth and</v>

388
00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:14.920
<v Speaker 3>that there was a continual interaction </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the two processes,</v>

389
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:18.100
<v Speaker 3>the dream and the story and storytelling</v>
<v Speaker 3>and well,</v>

390
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:23.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tend to tell your dreams as stories </v>

391
00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 3>when you remember them and some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember dreams all the time,</v>

392
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.150
<v Speaker 3>like two or three a night.</v>

393
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I've had clients like that and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>often have archetipal dreams that have </v>

394
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.960
<v Speaker 3>very clear mythological structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's more the case with people</v>

395
00:22:31.961 --> 00:22:36.961
<v Speaker 3>who are creative by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're a bit unstable at </v>

396
00:22:36.961 --> 00:22:40.611
<v Speaker 3>at the time because the dream tends to </v>
<v Speaker 3>occupy the space of uncertainty and to </v>

397
00:22:40.781 --> 00:22:44.560
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on fleshing out the the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown reality.</v>

398
00:22:44.561 --> 00:22:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Before you get a real grip on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like the dream is the birthplace</v>

399
00:22:48.371 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 3>of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of thinking about it,</v>

400
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:52.420
<v Speaker 3>and so because it's the birthplace of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

401
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:57.421
<v Speaker 3>it's not that clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's doing its best to formulate </v>

402
00:22:57.421 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 3>something that was [inaudible] notion as</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to Freud who believed that there</v>

403
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:05.941
<v Speaker 3>were sensors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>internal sensors that were hiding the </v>

404
00:23:05.941 --> 00:23:05.941
<v Speaker 3>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True message.</v>

405
00:23:05.941 --> 00:23:08.620
<v Speaker 3>That's not what you and believed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believed the dream was doing its best</v>

406
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:13.950
<v Speaker 3>to excel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to express a reality that was still </v>

407
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.460
<v Speaker 3>outside of fully articulated conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehension.</v>

408
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.870
<v Speaker 3>It was [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

409
00:23:16.871 --> 00:23:18.760
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thought appears in your head,</v>

410
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's obvious.</v>

411
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.240
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing you ever ask about,</v>

412
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:25.960
<v Speaker 3>but what the hell does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A thought appears in your head?</v>

413
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.570
<v Speaker 3>What kind of ridiculous explanation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

414
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't help with anything.</v>

415
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Where does it come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

416
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:36.940
<v Speaker 3>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just appears in my head.</v>

417
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's not a very sophisticated </v>

418
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.060
<v Speaker 3>explanation as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

419
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.810
<v Speaker 3>and so you might think that those </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts,</v>

420
00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 3>thoughts that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well where do they come from?</v>

421
00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:50.951
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're often someone else's thoughts </v>

422
00:23:50.951 --> 00:23:50.951
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone Long Dad,</v>

423
00:23:50.951 --> 00:23:52.730
<v Speaker 3>that might be part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the words you use to think our</v>

424
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:57.731
<v Speaker 3>utterances of people who've been long </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead and so you're informed by the </v>

425
00:23:57.731 --> 00:24:00.830
<v Speaker 3>spirit of your ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of looking at it and your</v>

426
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 3>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speak to your motion,</v>

427
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 3>speak to in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaks to you and it all does all that,</v>

428
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:08.630
<v Speaker 3>at least in part through the dream.</v>

429
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.190
<v Speaker 3>And the dream is the birthplace of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fully articulated idea.</v>

430
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.880
<v Speaker 3>They don't just come from nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fully fledged,</v>

431
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a developmental origin and god</v>

432
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:22.490
<v Speaker 3>only knows how long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How lengthy that origin is.</v>

433
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:25.460
<v Speaker 3>Even to say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am conscious,</v>

434
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's taken chimpanzees.</v>

435
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Don't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

436
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:34.250
<v Speaker 3>it's been 7 million years since we broke</v>
<v Speaker 3>from chimpanzees,</v>

437
00:24:34.251 --> 00:24:36.260
<v Speaker 3>something like that from the common </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancestor.</v>

438
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:41.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have no articulated knowledge at </v>

439
00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.091
<v Speaker 3>all and very little self representation </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some sense and very little self </v>

440
00:24:43.091 --> 00:24:45.470
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not the case with us at all.</v>

441
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.460
<v Speaker 3>And we had to painstakingly figure all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this out during that,</v>

442
00:24:49.461 --> 00:24:51.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>7 million year voyage.</v>

443
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.180
<v Speaker 3>And I think some of that's represented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

444
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.030
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

445
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.330
<v Speaker 3>and captured in some sense in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient stories,</v>

446
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.360
<v Speaker 3>which I believe were part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the oldest stories in </v>

447
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.351
<v Speaker 3>genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the stories we're going to </v>

448
00:25:08.351 --> 00:25:10.271
<v Speaker 3>start with that they were at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that some of the archaic nature of the </v>

449
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:13.940
<v Speaker 3>human being is encapsulated in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories and it's very,</v>

450
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.580
<v Speaker 3>very instructive as far as I can tell.</v>

451
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.560
<v Speaker 3>I can give you just a quick example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

452
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:21.240
<v Speaker 3>there's an idea of sacrifice in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

453
00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.340
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Old Testament and it's pretty </v>

454
00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:26.340
<v Speaker 3>barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

455
00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 3>The story of Abraham and Isaac is a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>example of that because Abraham is </v>

456
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.440
<v Speaker 3>called on to actually sacrifice his own </v>
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>

457
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:35.441
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't really seem like something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a reasonable God would ask you to </v>

458
00:25:35.441 --> 00:25:35.441
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

459
00:25:35.441 --> 00:25:39.341
<v Speaker 3>Then the garden in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's frequently cruel and arbitrary and </v>

460
00:25:39.341 --> 00:25:43.750
<v Speaker 3>demanding and paradoxical and which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the things that really </v>

461
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.771
<v Speaker 3>gives the book life because it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>edited by a committee or a committee </v>

462
00:25:47.771 --> 00:25:50.900
<v Speaker 3>that was concerned with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with not offending anyone.</v>

463
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:52.900
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

464
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:09.630
<v Speaker 3>so young believed that the dream was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>birthplace of thought and I've been </v>

465
00:26:10.361 --> 00:26:14.650
<v Speaker 3>extending that idea because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things I wondered about deeply was,</v>

466
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a dream and then someone </v>

467
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.111
<v Speaker 3>interprets it and you can argue about </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not an interpretation is </v>

468
00:26:22.111 --> 00:26:25.261
<v Speaker 3>valid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like you can argue about whether </v>

469
00:26:25.261 --> 00:26:25.660
<v Speaker 3>your interpretation of a novel or movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>is valid,</v>

470
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very difficult thing to determine</v>

471
00:26:28.451 --> 00:26:32.410
<v Speaker 3>with any degree of accuracy accounts in </v>
<v Speaker 3>part for the postmodern critique.</v>

472
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:37.830
<v Speaker 3>But my observation has been that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>will present a dream and sometimes we </v>

473
00:26:38.621 --> 00:26:42.850
<v Speaker 3>can extract out real useful information </v>
<v Speaker 3>from it that the person didn't appear to</v>

474
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.320
<v Speaker 3>know now and they get a flash of </v>
<v Speaker 3>insight.</v>

475
00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:51.321
<v Speaker 3>And to me that's a marker that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>stumbled on something that unites part </v>

476
00:26:51.321 --> 00:26:52.500
<v Speaker 3>of that person that wasn't united </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

477
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:57.501
<v Speaker 3>It pulls things together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is often what a good story we'll </v>

478
00:26:57.501 --> 00:26:57.501
<v Speaker 3>do where sometimes a good theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

479
00:26:57.501 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 3>things snap together for you and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little light goes on.</v>

480
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.670
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the markers that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>used for accuracy and dreams.</v>

481
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:08.460
<v Speaker 3>And I know in my own family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

482
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.410
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was first married,</v>

483
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:16.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have fights with my wife arguments </v>

484
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.021
<v Speaker 3>about this and that and I'm fairly hot </v>
<v Speaker 3>headed and so I'd get all puffed up and </v>

485
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.860
<v Speaker 3>agitated about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about whatever we were arguing about and</v>

486
00:27:22.861 --> 00:27:26.400
<v Speaker 3>she'd go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was really annoying as so annoying</v>

487
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:33.650
<v Speaker 3>because I couldn't sleep right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like chewing off my fingernails and </v>

488
00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.270
<v Speaker 3>she'd be like sleeping peacefully beside</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

489
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 3>It's maddening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

490
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 3>but often she'd have a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

491
00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:43.371
<v Speaker 3>and then the next morning she discuss it</v>
<v Speaker 3>with me and then we could unravel what </v>

492
00:27:43.371 --> 00:27:46.731
<v Speaker 3>was at the bottom of our argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was unbelievably useful even </v>

493
00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:47.070
<v Speaker 3>though it was extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggravating.</v>

494
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

495
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:50.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was convinced by young,</v>

496
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:55.730
<v Speaker 3>it looked to me like his ideas about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between dreams and </v>

497
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.340
<v Speaker 3>mythology and drama and literature made </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense to me in the and the uh,</v>

498
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the relationship between that and </v>

499
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 3>art.</v>

500
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I know this native carver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a Kwakwaka'wakw guy.</v>

501
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.590
<v Speaker 3>He's carved a bunch of wooden </v>
<v Speaker 3>sculptures,</v>

502
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.960
<v Speaker 3>totem poles and masks that I have in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

503
00:28:09.961 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 3>And he's a very interesting person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not literate,</v>

504
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:16.350
<v Speaker 3>not particularly literate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and really still steeped in this ancient</v>

505
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.070
<v Speaker 3>13,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old tradition,</v>

506
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:23.080
<v Speaker 3>these original language speaker and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that he isn't literate has sort</v>

507
00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 3>of left Camden with the mind of someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's preliterate and preliterate people</v>

508
00:28:27.451 --> 00:28:29.130
<v Speaker 3>aren't stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just not literate.</v>

509
00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:32.090
<v Speaker 3>So their brains are organized </v>
<v Speaker 3>differently in many ways.</v>

510
00:28:32.091 --> 00:28:34.140
<v Speaker 3>And I've asked him about his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

511
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:39.260
<v Speaker 3>his intuition for his carvings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He's told me that he dreams,</v>

512
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.280
<v Speaker 3>like you've seen the Haida masks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

513
00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 3>what they look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

514
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.990
<v Speaker 3>his people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are closely related to the hightest,</v>

515
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:50.991
<v Speaker 3>so it's the same kind of style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he dreams in those animals and,</v>

516
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.980
<v Speaker 3>and can remember his dreams.</v>

517
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.980
<v Speaker 3>And he also talks to his grandparents </v>
<v Speaker 3>who taught him how to carve in his </v>

518
00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:02.241
<v Speaker 3>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quite often if he runs into a problem </v>

519
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:04.461
<v Speaker 3>with carving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his grandparents will come and he'll </v>

520
00:29:04.461 --> 00:29:04.461
<v Speaker 3>talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he sees that the creatures that he's</v>

521
00:29:04.461 --> 00:29:09.210
<v Speaker 3>going to carve living in an animated </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense soon as in his imagination.</v>

522
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that difficult.</v>

523
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no reason to disbelieve him.</v>

524
00:29:12.811 --> 00:29:17.811
<v Speaker 3>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very straightforward person and he </v>

525
00:29:17.811 --> 00:29:20.391
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have the motivation or the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>all I would say in some sense to invent </v>

526
00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:25.101
<v Speaker 3>a story like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just no reason that you would </v>

527
00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:25.101
<v Speaker 3>possibly do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's told that many people</v>

528
00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:26.490
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks it's kinda crazy.</v>

529
00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:28.200
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said when he was a kid,</v>

530
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:33.350
<v Speaker 3>he thought he was insane because he'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>had those dreams all the time about </v>

531
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.420
<v Speaker 3>these creatures and so forth and so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't something he was trumpeting,</v>

532
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.900
<v Speaker 3>but I found it fascinating because I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>see in him of the manifestation of this </v>

533
00:29:42.641 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 3>unbroken tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no idea how traditions like that</v>

534
00:29:45.911 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 3>are really passed along for thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>and thousands of years.</v>

535
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of it's oral and memory,</v>

536
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.640
<v Speaker 3>part of it's acted out dramatized and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then part of it's going to be </v>

537
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.250
<v Speaker 3>imaginative and people who aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>literate,</v>

538
00:29:57.251 --> 00:29:59.410
<v Speaker 3>they store information quite differently</v>
<v Speaker 3>than we do.</v>

539
00:29:59.411 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 3>We don't remember anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all written down in books.</v>

540
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're from an oral culture,</v>

541
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:05.110
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're trained in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

542
00:30:05.111 --> 00:30:07.360
<v Speaker 3>you have all of that information at </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand,</v>

543
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.960
<v Speaker 3>both so you can speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell the stories and you really </v>

544
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.931
<v Speaker 3>know them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern people don't really know what </v>

545
00:30:15.931 --> 00:30:18.451
<v Speaker 3>that's like anymore doubt if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than maybe two of you in the </v>

546
00:30:18.451 --> 00:30:21.571
<v Speaker 3>audience that could spout for memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a 30 line poem on poetry was </v>

547
00:30:21.731 --> 00:30:24.020
<v Speaker 3>written so that people could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

548
00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:29.021
<v Speaker 3>that that's why we have that form is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people could remember it and have </v>

549
00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 3>it with them and we don't do any of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

550
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:36.690
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to you and was a great believer in </v>

551
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:41.641
<v Speaker 3>the dream and I noted that dreams will </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you things that you don't know and </v>

552
00:30:41.641 --> 00:30:41.641
<v Speaker 3>then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

553
00:30:41.641 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 3>how the hell can that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How in the world can something you think</v>

554
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.630
<v Speaker 3>up tell you something you don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that make any sense?</v>

555
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.600
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you understand it?</v>

556
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Why does it have to come forth in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of the dream?</v>

557
00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:00.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something going on inside you </v>

558
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 3>that you don't control rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dream happens.</v>

559
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.160
<v Speaker 3>Do you just like life happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

560
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:06.010
<v Speaker 3>there is the odd lucid dreamer who can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

561
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.200
<v Speaker 3>apply a certain amount of conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>

562
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:13.201
<v Speaker 3>but most of the time it's you're laying </v>
<v Speaker 3>there asleep and it's crazy complicated.</v>

563
00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:18.010
<v Speaker 3>World manifests itself inside you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know how you couldn't.</v>

564
00:31:18.011 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it when you're awake and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what it means.</v>

565
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:26.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like what the hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that's so </v>

566
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:28.510
<v Speaker 3>damn frightening about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalysts because you get this both</v>

567
00:31:28.511 --> 00:31:33.511
<v Speaker 3>from Freud and young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really start to understand that </v>

568
00:31:33.511 --> 00:31:36.901
<v Speaker 3>there are things inside you that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening that control you instead of </v>

569
00:31:36.901 --> 00:31:37.270
<v Speaker 3>the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

570
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:41.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a bit of reciprocal control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's manifestations of spirits,</v>

571
00:31:41.831 --> 00:31:46.831
<v Speaker 3>so to speak inside you that determine </v>
<v Speaker 3>the manner in which you walk through </v>

572
00:31:46.831 --> 00:31:51.571
<v Speaker 3>life and you don't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what does is it random.</v>

573
00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:56.641
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are people who have claimed that </v>

574
00:31:56.641 --> 00:31:57.430
<v Speaker 3>dreams are mirror merely the consequence</v>
<v Speaker 3>of random neuronal firing,</v>

575
00:31:57.431 --> 00:32:02.431
<v Speaker 3>which is a theory I think is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>absurd because there's nothing random </v>

576
00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:02.940
<v Speaker 3>about dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

577
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.560
<v Speaker 3>there are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very structured and very,</v>

578
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:10.561
<v Speaker 3>very complex and they're not like snow </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a television screen or or static on a</v>

579
00:32:10.631 --> 00:32:15.631
<v Speaker 3>radio like those things are complicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>and and then also I've seen so often </v>

580
00:32:15.631 --> 00:32:18.970
<v Speaker 3>that people have very coherent dreams </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have a perfect narrative structure.</v>

581
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Now they're fully developed in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense and so that just doesn't hide,</v>

582
00:32:22.701 --> 00:32:24.580
<v Speaker 3>that theory just doesn't go anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me.</v>

583
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 3>I just can't see that as useful at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

584
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.260
<v Speaker 3>so I'm more likely to take the phenomena</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously say,</v>

585
00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:37.261
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something to dreams what you </v>

586
00:32:37.261 --> 00:32:39.841
<v Speaker 3>dream of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you try to make it into a </v>

587
00:32:39.841 --> 00:32:39.841
<v Speaker 3>reality that seems to be an important </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

588
00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:44.910
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you dream up a nightmare and </v>
<v Speaker 3>try to make that into a reality because </v>

589
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 3>people do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they're hell bent on revenge,</v>

590
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:47.660
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and full of hatred and resentment,</v>

591
00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 3>that manifests itself and terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantasies,</v>

592
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:52.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are dreams.</v>

593
00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Then people go act them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things are powerful,</v>

594
00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whole nations can get caught up in </v>

595
00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:00.670
<v Speaker 3>collective dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened to the Nazis.</v>

596
00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:05.531
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened to Nazi Germany in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19 thirties and it was absolutely </v>

597
00:33:05.531 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 3>remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>

598
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:10.781
<v Speaker 3>horrific destructive spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing happened in the </v>

599
00:33:10.781 --> 00:33:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing happened in China.</v>

600
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.880
<v Speaker 3>It's like we have to take these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

601
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:16.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and try to understand what's going on.</v>

602
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:23.370
<v Speaker 3>So you believe that the dream could </v>
<v Speaker 3>contain more information than was yet </v>

603
00:33:23.381 --> 00:33:26.590
<v Speaker 3>articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think artists do the same thing,</v>

604
00:33:26.591 --> 00:33:31.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people go to museums and they look </v>

605
00:33:31.591 --> 00:33:34.771
<v Speaker 3>at paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>renaissance paintings or modern </v>

606
00:33:34.771 --> 00:33:34.771
<v Speaker 3>paintings and they don't exactly know </v>
<v Speaker 3>why they're there.</v>

607
00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Now I was in this room and in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember which museum,</v>

608
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.280
<v Speaker 3>but he was a room full of renaissance </v>
<v Speaker 3>art,</v>

609
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great painters,</v>

610
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:47.440
<v Speaker 3>the greatest painters and thought maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that room was worth a billion dollars or</v>

611
00:33:47.441 --> 00:33:49.930
<v Speaker 3>something outrageous because there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 20 paintings in there,</v>

612
00:33:49.931 --> 00:33:51.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so priceless.</v>

613
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.230
<v Speaker 3>And the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

614
00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:56.710
<v Speaker 3>why are those paintings worth so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>and why is there a museum in the biggest</v>

615
00:33:56.711 --> 00:34:01.711
<v Speaker 3>city in the world devoted to them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why do people from all over the </v>

616
00:34:01.711 --> 00:34:02.890
<v Speaker 3>world come and look at them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell are those people doing?</v>

617
00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.170
<v Speaker 3>One of them was of the assumption of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mary,</v>

618
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautifully painted,</v>

619
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:11.080
<v Speaker 3>absolutely glowing work of art and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like 20 people standing in front</v>

620
00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:13.810
<v Speaker 3>of it looking at it and think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are those people up to?</v>

621
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.370
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know.</v>

622
00:34:15.371 --> 00:34:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Why did they make a pilgrimage to New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York to come and look at that painting?</v>

623
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.340
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they know why is it worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much?</v>

624
00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:26.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a status element to it </v>

625
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:26.370
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that begs the question,</v>

626
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.940
<v Speaker 3>why did those items become such high </v>
<v Speaker 3>status items?</v>

627
00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.910
<v Speaker 3>What is it about them that so absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>remarkable?</v>

628
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're strange creatures,</v>

629
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.830
<v Speaker 3>so I was trying to figure out in part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well where did the information that's in</v>

630
00:34:38.831 --> 00:34:43.831
<v Speaker 3>the dream come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to come from somewhere and you </v>

631
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:45.280
<v Speaker 3>can think about it as a revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

632
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.740
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it springs out of the void and</v>

633
00:34:47.741 --> 00:34:50.220
<v Speaker 3>it's new knowledge and it's a revelation</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't produce it,</v>

634
00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:51.880
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just appears.</v>

635
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.240
<v Speaker 3>But that's one of the things I want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with this series.</v>

636
00:34:55.241 --> 00:35:00.241
<v Speaker 3>It's like I am scientifically minded and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm quite a rational person and I like </v>

637
00:35:00.241 --> 00:35:03.700
<v Speaker 3>to have an explanation for things that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>rational and empirical before I look for</v>

638
00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:08.080
<v Speaker 3>any other kind of explanation and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to say that everything that's</v>

639
00:35:08.081 --> 00:35:13.081
<v Speaker 3>associated with divinity can be reduced </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some manner to biology or to an </v>

640
00:35:13.081 --> 00:35:14.230
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary history or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

641
00:35:14.231 --> 00:35:17.800
<v Speaker 3>but in so far as it's possible to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that reduction,</v>

642
00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:22.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do that and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave the other phenomena floating in </v>

643
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:27.271
<v Speaker 3>the air because they can't be pinned </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and in that category I would put </v>

644
00:35:27.271 --> 00:35:28.990
<v Speaker 3>the category of mystical or religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

645
00:35:28.991 --> 00:35:30.490
<v Speaker 3>which we don't understand at all.</v>

646
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.760
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

647
00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 3>artists observe one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They observe and they represent what </v>

648
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.360
<v Speaker 3>they see and they transmit a message of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they see to us and they teach us to</v>

649
00:35:42.361 --> 00:35:45.930
<v Speaker 3>see and we don't necessarily know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is that we're learning from them,</v>

650
00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:51.610
<v Speaker 3>but we're learning something or at least</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're acting like we're learning </v>

651
00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:51.610
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go to movies,</v>

652
00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:52.320
<v Speaker 3>we watch stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

653
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

654
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.680
<v Speaker 3>we immerse ourselves in fiction </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>

655
00:35:55.681 --> 00:35:58.650
<v Speaker 3>That's an artistic production and for </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people,</v>

656
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.250
<v Speaker 3>the world of the arts is a living world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's particularly true if you're a</v>

657
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.490
<v Speaker 3>creative person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the creative artistic people that </v>

658
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.881
<v Speaker 3>do move the knowledge of humanity </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward and they do that with their </v>

659
00:36:10.881 --> 00:36:11.160
<v Speaker 3>artistic productions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First.</v>

660
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:16.161
<v Speaker 3>They're on the edge and the dancers do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and the poets do that and the </v>

661
00:36:16.161 --> 00:36:20.450
<v Speaker 3>visual artists do that at the musicians </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that and we're not sure what they're </v>

662
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.450
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

663
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.110
<v Speaker 3>We're not sure what musicians are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are they doing?</v>

664
00:36:22.111 --> 00:36:23.910
<v Speaker 3>Why do you like music?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

665
00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:28.911
<v Speaker 3>it gives you a deep intimation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance of things and no one </v>

666
00:36:28.911 --> 00:36:30.690
<v Speaker 3>questions that you go to a concert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thrilled.</v>

667
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:35.691
<v Speaker 3>It's a quasi religious experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly if the people really get </v>

668
00:36:35.691 --> 00:36:37.260
<v Speaker 3>themselves together and get the crowd </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>

669
00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:42.261
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something incredibly intense </v>

670
00:36:42.261 --> 00:36:42.261
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes no sense whatsoever.</v>

671
00:36:42.261 --> 00:36:43.740
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an easy thing to understand.</v>

672
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Music is deeply patterned and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

673
00:36:46.591 --> 00:36:51.591
<v Speaker 3>and patterned in layers and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>has something to do with it because </v>

674
00:36:51.591 --> 00:36:53.490
<v Speaker 3>reality is patterned and deeply </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterned in layers.</v>

675
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 3>And so I think music is representing </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality in some fundamental way and that</v>

676
00:36:57.991 --> 00:37:01.860
<v Speaker 3>we get into the sway of that and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>participate in being.</v>

677
00:37:01.861 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of what makes it such an</v>
<v Speaker 3>uplifting experience.</v>

678
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 3>But we don't really know that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing.</v>

679
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:08.850
<v Speaker 3>We just go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

680
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.900
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

681
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.970
<v Speaker 3>and it's nourishing for people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

682
00:37:11.971 --> 00:37:16.971
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young people in particular that lots of </v>

683
00:37:16.971 --> 00:37:20.391
<v Speaker 3>them live for music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's where they derive all their </v>

684
00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:20.391
<v Speaker 3>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their cultural identity.</v>

685
00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:24.590
<v Speaker 3>Everything that's nourishing comes from </v>
<v Speaker 3>their affiliation with their music that </v>

686
00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.760
<v Speaker 3>is part of their cultural identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's an amazing thing.</v>

687
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.660
<v Speaker 3>The question still remains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where does the information and dreams </v>

688
00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.260
<v Speaker 3>come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what it,</v>

689
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:40.630
<v Speaker 3>where it comes from is that we watch the</v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns that everyone.</v>

690
00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:47.370
<v Speaker 3>So we've watched that forever and we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got some representations of those </v>

691
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 3>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of our cultural history.</v>

692
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:54.291
<v Speaker 3>That's what's embedded in stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fictional accounts of the story </v>

693
00:37:54.291 --> 00:37:58.161
<v Speaker 3>between good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bad guy and the good guy and the </v>

694
00:37:58.161 --> 00:37:58.161
<v Speaker 3>romance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

695
00:37:58.161 --> 00:38:01.131
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are canonical patterns of being </v>

696
00:38:01.131 --> 00:38:03.711
<v Speaker 3>for people in and they deeply affect </v>
<v Speaker 3>this because they represent what it is </v>

697
00:38:03.711 --> 00:38:07.191
<v Speaker 3>that we will act out in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then we flesh that out with the </v>

698
00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:10.551
<v Speaker 3>individual information we have about </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves and other people and so it's </v>

699
00:38:10.551 --> 00:38:11.340
<v Speaker 3>like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

700
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:16.580
<v Speaker 3>there's waves of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of behavioral patterns that manifest </v>

701
00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:21.021
<v Speaker 3>themselves in the crowd across time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>great dramas are played on the crowd </v>

702
00:38:21.271 --> 00:38:26.271
<v Speaker 3>across time and the artists watched that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get intimations of what that is</v>

703
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:31.611
<v Speaker 3>and they write it down and they tell us </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we're a little clearer about </v>

704
00:38:31.611 --> 00:38:31.611
<v Speaker 3>what we're up to now.</v>

705
00:38:31.611 --> 00:38:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Like a great dramatists like Shakespeare</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say is we know that what he wrote </v>

706
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 3>is fiction and then we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

707
00:38:36.161 --> 00:38:38.560
<v Speaker 3>fiction isn't true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you think,</v>

708
00:38:38.561 --> 00:38:40.450
<v Speaker 3>well wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's true.</v>

709
00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Like numbers are true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

710
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 3>numbers are an abstraction from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlying reality,</v>

711
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:49.690
<v Speaker 3>but no one in their right mind would </v>
<v Speaker 3>really think numbers aren't true.</v>

712
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.870
<v Speaker 3>You could even make a case that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers are more real than the things </v>

713
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.870
<v Speaker 3>that they represent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

714
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Because the abstraction is so insanely </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>

715
00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 3>Once you have mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just deadly.</v>

716
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:05.220
<v Speaker 3>You can move the world with mathematics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's not obvious that the </v>

717
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:09.001
<v Speaker 3>abstraction is less real than the than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the than the more concrete reality and </v>

718
00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:12.550
<v Speaker 3>you take a work of fiction like hamlet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>

719
00:39:12.551 --> 00:39:17.551
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's not true because it's </v>

720
00:39:17.551 --> 00:39:17.551
<v Speaker 3>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you think,</v>

721
00:39:17.551 --> 00:39:18.610
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of explanation is that?</v>

722
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:23.790
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe it's more true than </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonfiction because it takes what the </v>

723
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:27.871
<v Speaker 3>story that needs to be told about you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the story that needs to be told </v>

724
00:39:27.871 --> 00:39:29.440
<v Speaker 3>about you and you and you and you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstracts that out and says,</v>

725
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:34.441
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's something that's a key part of </v>

726
00:39:34.441 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 3>the human experience as such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

727
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:37.480
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an abstraction from this underlying</v>

728
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:42.690
<v Speaker 3>noisy substrate and people are affected </v>
<v Speaker 3>by it because they see that the thing </v>

729
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:47.050
<v Speaker 3>that's represented the as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern of their being,</v>

730
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:50.560
<v Speaker 3>that's the right way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then with these old stories,</v>

731
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:55.561
<v Speaker 3>these ancient stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me like that process has </v>

732
00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:58.171
<v Speaker 3>been occurring for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we watched ourselves and we </v>

733
00:39:58.171 --> 00:40:02.551
<v Speaker 3>extracted out some stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we imitated each other and we </v>

734
00:40:02.551 --> 00:40:06.211
<v Speaker 3>represented that in drama and then we </v>
<v Speaker 3>distilled the drama and we got a </v>

735
00:40:06.211 --> 00:40:08.690
<v Speaker 3>representation of the distillation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then we did it again.</v>

736
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of that process that </v>
<v Speaker 3>took,</v>

737
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.530
<v Speaker 3>God only knows how long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of these stories,</v>

738
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 3>they've traced fairytales back 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

739
00:40:18.311 --> 00:40:20.970
<v Speaker 3>some fairy tales in relatively unchanged</v>
<v Speaker 3>for.</v>

740
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.700
<v Speaker 3>And it certainly seems to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>archeological evidence,</v>

741
00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:29.701
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggests that the really old stories </v>

742
00:40:29.701 --> 00:40:29.701
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

743
00:40:29.701 --> 00:40:32.570
<v Speaker 3>that the Bible begins with our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least that old and likely embedded in</v>

744
00:40:32.571 --> 00:40:35.650
<v Speaker 3>a prehistory that's far older than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might think,</v>

745
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:38.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can you be so sure?</v>

746
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.070
<v Speaker 3>The answer to that in part is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures that don't change,</v>

747
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.860
<v Speaker 3>like the ancient cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

748
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.540
<v Speaker 3>They didn't change as fast as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>stayed the same.</v>

749
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:48.970
<v Speaker 3>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they call it,</v>

750
00:40:48.971 --> 00:40:51.880
<v Speaker 3>they keep their information moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation to generation.</v>

751
00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 3>That's how they stay the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we know,</v>

752
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:56.410
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the archaeological record,</v>

753
00:40:56.411 --> 00:41:01.411
<v Speaker 3>there are records of rituals that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>remained relatively unbroken for up to </v>

754
00:41:01.411 --> 00:41:01.540
<v Speaker 3>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

755
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:06.750
<v Speaker 3>It was discovered in caves in Japan that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were set up for a particular kind of </v>

756
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.550
<v Speaker 3>bare worship that was also </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristic of western Europe.</v>

757
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.100
<v Speaker 3>So these things can last for very long </v>
<v Speaker 3>periods of time.</v>

758
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.310
<v Speaker 3>We're watching each other act in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

759
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.050
<v Speaker 3>and then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

760
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:22.090
<v Speaker 3>how long have we been watching each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other?</v>

761
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:27.510
<v Speaker 3>And the answered that in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while as long as there's been creatures </v>

762
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 3>with nervous systems now that's a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

763
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:34.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's some hundreds of millions of </v>

764
00:41:34.501 --> 00:41:34.501
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps longer than that.</v>

765
00:41:34.501 --> 00:41:38.290
<v Speaker 3>We've been watching each other trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out what we're up to across that </v>

766
00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.591
<v Speaker 3>entire span of time and some of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge is built right into our </v>

767
00:41:41.591 --> 00:41:44.951
<v Speaker 3>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why we can dance with each </v>

768
00:41:44.951 --> 00:41:44.951
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

769
00:41:44.951 --> 00:41:47.831
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because understanding isn't just </v>

770
00:41:47.831 --> 00:41:49.070
<v Speaker 3>something that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have as an abstraction,</v>

771
00:41:49.071 --> 00:41:50.860
<v Speaker 3>it's something that you act out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

772
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:56.140
<v Speaker 3>that's what children are doing when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're learning too rough and tumble </v>

773
00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 3>play is they're learning to integrate </v>
<v Speaker 3>their body with the body of someone else</v>

774
00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.770
<v Speaker 3>in a harmonious way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning to cooperate and compete,</v>

775
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 3>and that's all instantiated right into </v>
<v Speaker 3>their body.</v>

776
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not abstract knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know that they're doing that.</v>

777
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.890
<v Speaker 3>They're just doing it and so we can even</v>
<v Speaker 3>use our body as a representational </v>

778
00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:15.941
<v Speaker 3>platform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'd been studying each other for a </v>

779
00:42:15.941 --> 00:42:18.260
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abstracting out what is it that we're up</v>

780
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 3>to and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're up to.</v>

781
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:24.260
<v Speaker 3>What should we be up to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's even a more fundamental question.</v>

782
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.410
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to live in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do it properly,</v>

783
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.400
<v Speaker 3>what does properly mean and how is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you might go about that?</v>

784
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

785
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.950
<v Speaker 3>It's the right question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

786
00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:36.470
<v Speaker 3>It's what everyone wants to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you live in the world?</v>

787
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Not what is the world made of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same question.</v>

788
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:44.590
<v Speaker 3>How do you live in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the eternal question of human </v>

789
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.711
<v Speaker 3>beings and I guess we're the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>species that has ever really asked that </v>

790
00:42:47.711 --> 00:42:49.730
<v Speaker 3>question because all the other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just go and do whatever they do,</v>

791
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:50.840
<v Speaker 3>not us.</v>

792
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.510
<v Speaker 3>It's a question for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had to.</v>

793
00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 3>We have to become aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to be able to speak it.</v>

794
00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.710
<v Speaker 3>God only knows why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that seems to be the situation.</v>

795
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:06.580
<v Speaker 3>So we act that acting is shaped by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

796
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:10.040
<v Speaker 3>that acting is shaped by society into </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that we don't understand,</v>

797
00:43:10.041 --> 00:43:12.870
<v Speaker 3>but that we can model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can model it.</v>

798
00:43:12.871 --> 00:43:17.871
<v Speaker 3>We model it in our stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We Marlett with our bodies and that's </v>

799
00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:21.911
<v Speaker 3>where the dream gets its information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dream is part of the process that's </v>

800
00:43:21.911 --> 00:43:24.380
<v Speaker 3>watching everything and then trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>formulate it and trying to say,</v>

801
00:43:24.381 --> 00:43:29.381
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get the signal from the noise </v>

802
00:43:29.381 --> 00:43:32.051
<v Speaker 3>and to portray it in dramatic form </v>
<v Speaker 3>because a dream is a little drama and </v>

803
00:43:32.051 --> 00:43:35.591
<v Speaker 3>then you get the chance to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what that dream is and then you have.</v>

804
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:39.050
<v Speaker 3>You have something like articulated </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge at that point.</v>

805
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:44.890
<v Speaker 3>And so the Bible I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it sort of exists in that space </v>

806
00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:48.410
<v Speaker 3>that's half into the dream and half into</v>
<v Speaker 3>articulated knowledge.</v>

807
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.560
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that and going into </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to find out what the stories are </v>

808
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.870
<v Speaker 3>about can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can,</v>

809
00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.270
<v Speaker 3>what can aid our self understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other issue is,</v>

810
00:44:00.271 --> 00:44:05.271
<v Speaker 3>is that if nature was correct and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky or young was correct and </v>

811
00:44:05.271 --> 00:44:10.151
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we without the cornerstone that that </v>

812
00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:13.460
<v Speaker 3>understanding provides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were lost.</v>

813
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:18.590
<v Speaker 3>And that's not good because then we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>susceptible to psych pathology.</v>

814
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.650
<v Speaker 3>That's psychological pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

815
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:26.750
<v Speaker 3>the people who are ad adamant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti religious thinkers seem to believe </v>

816
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 3>that if we abandoned our immersement in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the underlying dream,</v>

817
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

818
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.730
<v Speaker 2>we'd all instantly become rationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>like descartes or Bacon or,</v>

819
00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>

820
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:40.080
<v Speaker 2>clear thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rational scientific people.</v>

821
00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that for a moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think there's any </v>

822
00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:45.900
<v Speaker 2>evidence for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we would become so irrational so</v>

823
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:50.901
<v Speaker 2>rapidly that the weirdest mysteries of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Catholicism would see positively </v>

824
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.120
<v Speaker 2>rational by contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's already happening.</v>

825
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

826
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

827
00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:08.230
<v Speaker 2>so this is the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially,</v>

828
00:45:08.231 --> 00:45:10.930
<v Speaker 2>you know that you have the unknown world</v>
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

829
00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.610
<v Speaker 2>That's just what you don't know at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

830
00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:18.700
<v Speaker 2>that's outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the ocean that surrounds the </v>

831
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:18.700
<v Speaker 2>island,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you inhabit something like that.</v>

832
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:23.281
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos itself and then you act in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that world and you act in ways you don't</v>

833
00:45:23.771 --> 00:45:25.960
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more to your actions.</v>

834
00:45:25.961 --> 00:45:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Then you can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things young said,</v>

835
00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.370
<v Speaker 2>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first understood it,</v>

836
00:45:30.371 --> 00:45:32.410
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody acts out of myth,</v>

837
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.550
<v Speaker 2>but very few people know what their myth</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and you should know what your myth is</v>

838
00:45:36.551 --> 00:45:40.540
<v Speaker 2>because it might be a tragedy and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want it to be,</v>

839
00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:43.120
<v Speaker 2>and that's really worth thinking because</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about,</v>

840
00:45:43.121 --> 00:45:48.121
<v Speaker 2>because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a pattern of behavior that </v>

841
00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:48.940
<v Speaker 2>characterized as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when God only knows where you got it.</v>

842
00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Partly it's biological.</v>

843
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Partly it's from your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

844
00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 2>it's your unconscious assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the way the philosophy of your </v>

845
00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.030
<v Speaker 2>society is shaped you and is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's aimed.</v>

846
00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It's aiming you somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

847
00:46:00.821 --> 00:46:02.920
<v Speaker 2>is it aiming you somewhere you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go?</v>

848
00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of self realization.</v>

849
00:46:06.041 --> 00:46:09.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know we don't understand our actions.</v>

850
00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.850
<v Speaker 2>That's almost every argument you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone is about that.</v>

851
00:46:12.851 --> 00:46:14.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you do that?</v>

852
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.170
<v Speaker 2>You come up with some half baked reasons</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you did it.</v>

853
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.510
<v Speaker 2>You're flailing around in the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

854
00:46:19.511 --> 00:46:22.990
<v Speaker 2>you try to give an account for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can only do it partially.</v>

855
00:46:22.991 --> 00:46:26.280
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult because you're in your,</v>

856
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.820
<v Speaker 2>you're a complicated animal with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginnings of an articulated mind,</v>

857
00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:35.821
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're just way more than you can </v>

858
00:46:35.821 --> 00:46:35.821
<v Speaker 2>handle it.</v>

859
00:46:35.821 --> 00:46:35.821
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

860
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you act things out,</v>

861
00:46:39.191 --> 00:46:39.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

862
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.240
<v Speaker 2>you act things out and that's a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence.</v>

863
00:46:43.241 --> 00:46:48.241
<v Speaker 2>And then you imagine what you act out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you imagine what everyone else acts </v>

864
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:52.111
<v Speaker 2>out and so there's a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of information in your action and then </v>

865
00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.330
<v Speaker 2>that information is translated up into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dream and into art,</v>

866
00:46:55.331 --> 00:47:00.331
<v Speaker 2>into mythology and literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a tremendous amount of </v>

867
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:02.170
<v Speaker 2>information in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some of that is translated into</v>

868
00:47:02.171 --> 00:47:07.171
<v Speaker 2>articulated thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll give you a quick example of </v>

869
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:10.711
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is partly what happens in </v>

870
00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:11.170
<v Speaker 2>exodus when Moses comes up with the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

871
00:47:11.171 --> 00:47:16.171
<v Speaker 2>he's wandering around with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israelites forever in the desert and </v>

872
00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:18.880
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like going left and going right </v>

873
00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.420
<v Speaker 2>worshiping idols and like having a hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a time and um,</v>

874
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:24.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting rebellious and Moses goes up on </v>

875
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.361
<v Speaker 2>the mountain and he has this tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation sort of in the sight of God </v>

876
00:47:27.361 --> 00:47:29.350
<v Speaker 2>and illuminates him and he comes down </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the law.</v>

877
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

878
00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moses acted as a judge.</v>

879
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 2>I know this is a mythological story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moses acted as a judge in the desert.</v>

880
00:47:36.251 --> 00:47:41.251
<v Speaker 2>He was continually mediating between </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are having problems </v>

881
00:47:41.251 --> 00:47:44.581
<v Speaker 2>constantly trying to keep peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what are you doing when you're </v>

882
00:47:44.581 --> 00:47:47.881
<v Speaker 2>trying to keep peace?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you're trying to understand what </v>

883
00:47:47.881 --> 00:47:47.881
<v Speaker 2>peace is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

884
00:47:47.881 --> 00:47:49.600
<v Speaker 2>You have to apply the principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are the principles?</v>

885
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.950
<v Speaker 2>But you don't know the principals or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever satisfies people enough to make</v>

886
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:56.290
<v Speaker 2>peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you do that 10,000</v>

887
00:47:56.291 --> 00:47:57.970
<v Speaker 2>times and then you get some sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

888
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:02.971
<v Speaker 2>here's the principles that bring peace </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then one day at blasts into your </v>

889
00:48:02.971 --> 00:48:02.971
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

890
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:08.100
<v Speaker 2>like a revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the rules that were already </v>

891
00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:08.720
<v Speaker 2>acting out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the 10 commandments.</v>

892
00:48:08.721 --> 00:48:13.721
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there to begin with and Moses </v>

893
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:13.721
<v Speaker 2>comes forward and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

894
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:14.740
<v Speaker 2>this is already basically what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

895
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.600
<v Speaker 2>But now it's codafide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

896
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:21.730
<v Speaker 2>And like that's all historical process </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's condensed into a single story.</v>

897
00:48:21.731 --> 00:48:25.150
<v Speaker 2>But obviously that happened because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have written law,</v>

898
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:30.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that emerged in good legal systems </v>

899
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:30.700
<v Speaker 2>that emerges from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's English.</v>

900
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Common law is exactly like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

901
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:37.951
<v Speaker 2>It's single decisions that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on principles that have been </v>

902
00:48:37.951 --> 00:48:40.250
<v Speaker 2>articulated and made into the body of </v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

903
00:48:40.251 --> 00:48:42.790
<v Speaker 2>And the body of law is something you act</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

904
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's a body of law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a good citizen,</v>

905
00:48:46.361 --> 00:48:50.080
<v Speaker 2>you act out the body of law and the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>of law has principles.</v>

906
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

907
00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.340
<v Speaker 2>there's principles that guide our </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

908
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.620
<v Speaker 2>What are those principles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

909
00:48:56.621 --> 00:48:58.110
<v Speaker 2>I think when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

910
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:03.390
<v Speaker 2>if you want the initial answer of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the art archaic Israelites meant by God,</v>

911
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:08.290
<v Speaker 2>that something like what they meant now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good enough explanation,</v>

912
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:10.660
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you,</v>

913
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.960
<v Speaker 2>that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're a chimpanzee and you have a </v>

914
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:15.960
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

915
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:20.090
<v Speaker 2>a dominant figure at the pinnacle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your society that,</v>

916
00:49:20.091 --> 00:49:21.550
<v Speaker 2>that represents power.</v>

917
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than that because it's not sheer </v>

918
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:26.770
<v Speaker 2>physical prowess that keeps a chimp at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of the hierarchy,</v>

919
00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 2>it's much more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you could say,</v>

920
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:29.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

921
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.330
<v Speaker 2>there's a principle that a dominant </v>
<v Speaker 2>person manifests,</v>

922
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 2>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

923
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.400
<v Speaker 2>that principals shines forth even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>brightly.</v>

924
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:43.150
<v Speaker 2>If you know 10 people who are dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>

925
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:46.720
<v Speaker 2>then you can extract out what dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>means from that.</v>

926
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:51.721
<v Speaker 2>You can extract out what power means </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that and then you can divorce the </v>

927
00:49:51.721 --> 00:49:55.261
<v Speaker 2>concept from the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had to do that at some point </v>

928
00:49:55.261 --> 00:49:59.431
<v Speaker 2>because we can save power in a human </v>
<v Speaker 2>context and we can imagine what that </v>

929
00:49:59.431 --> 00:50:03.901
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's divorced from any specific </v>

930
00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:03.901
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

931
00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:08.521
<v Speaker 2>how the hell did we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's so complicated when if </v>

932
00:50:08.521 --> 00:50:11.050
<v Speaker 2>you're a chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the power is in another chimp.</v>

933
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:13.990
<v Speaker 2>It's not some damn abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

934
00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:15.850
<v Speaker 2>so the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is think,</v>

935
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:17.710
<v Speaker 2>think about it when we're in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>

936
00:50:17.711 --> 00:50:22.711
<v Speaker 2>many of them across centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to figure out what the </v>

937
00:50:22.711 --> 00:50:25.831
<v Speaker 2>guiding principle is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to extract out the core of </v>

938
00:50:25.831 --> 00:50:28.280
<v Speaker 2>the guiding principle and we turned that</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a representation</v>

939
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 3>of a pattern of being well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

940
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:36.030
<v Speaker 3>That's God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an abstracted ideal and it's.</v>

941
00:50:36.031 --> 00:50:37.820
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's put in persona.</v>

942
00:50:37.821 --> 00:50:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Find form manifests itself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>personified form,</v>

943
00:50:41.161 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 3>but that's okay because what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get at is the,</v>

944
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:49.120
<v Speaker 3>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the essence of what it means to be a </v>

945
00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.920
<v Speaker 3>properly functioning and properly a </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly functioning properly social and</v>

946
00:50:51.921 --> 00:50:56.921
<v Speaker 3>property competent individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to figure out what that </v>

947
00:50:56.921 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need a an embodiment.</v>

948
00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:02.710
<v Speaker 3>You need an ideal that's abstracted that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could act out that would enable you </v>

949
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:06.830
<v Speaker 3>to understand what that means and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we've been driving out.</v>

950
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.590
<v Speaker 3>So that's the first hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some sense.</v>

951
00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go over some of the some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the attributes of this abstract,</v>

952
00:51:13.541 --> 00:51:18.541
<v Speaker 3>that ideal that we've formalized as God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the first sort of hypothesis </v>

953
00:51:18.541 --> 00:51:22.451
<v Speaker 3>is that a philosophical or moral ideal </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifests itself first as a concrete </v>

954
00:51:23.871 --> 00:51:28.871
<v Speaker 3>pattern of behavior that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristic of a single individual </v>

955
00:51:28.871 --> 00:51:32.650
<v Speaker 3>and then it's a set of individuals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's an abstraction from that set </v>

956
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.330
<v Speaker 3>and then you have the abstraction and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

957
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.760
<v Speaker 3>So here's a political implication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

958
00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:50.690
<v Speaker 3>one of the debates we might say between </v>
<v Speaker 3>early Christianity and the late Roman </v>

959
00:51:52.201 --> 00:51:57.201
<v Speaker 3>empire was whether or not an emperor </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be God literally right to be </v>

960
00:51:58.051 --> 00:52:03.051
<v Speaker 3>deified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put enough to be put in a temple and </v>

961
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:06.831
<v Speaker 3>you can see why that might happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's someone at the pinnacle </v>

962
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:10.221
<v Speaker 3>of a very steep hierarchy who has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of power and </v>

963
00:52:10.221 --> 00:52:13.431
<v Speaker 3>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the Christian response to that was </v>

964
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:17.660
<v Speaker 3>never confuse the specific sovereign </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the principle of sovereignty </v>

965
00:52:19.111 --> 00:52:21.640
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brilliant to see,</v>

966
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:26.650
<v Speaker 3>see how difficult it is to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>an idea like that so that even the </v>

967
00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:30.201
<v Speaker 3>person who has the power is actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>subordinate to something else </v>

968
00:52:30.201 --> 00:52:32.280
<v Speaker 3>subordinate to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's call it a divine principle,</v>

969
00:52:32.281 --> 00:52:37.281
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so even the king himself is subordinate </v>

970
00:52:37.281 --> 00:52:41.841
<v Speaker 3>to the principal and we still believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because we believe that our </v>

971
00:52:41.841 --> 00:52:44.070
<v Speaker 3>president or prime minister is </v>
<v Speaker 3>subordinate to the damn law.</v>

972
00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the body of law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

973
00:52:45.841 --> 00:52:50.841
<v Speaker 3>There's a principle inside that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>even the leader is subordinate to and </v>

974
00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:52.260
<v Speaker 3>without that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could argue we can't even have a</v>

975
00:52:52.261 --> 00:52:57.261
<v Speaker 3>civilized society because your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your leader immediately turns into </v>

976
00:52:57.261 --> 00:53:00.561
<v Speaker 3>something that's transcendent and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful and I mean that's certainly </v>

977
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:04.521
<v Speaker 3>what happened in the Soviet Union and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened in Maoist China and what </v>

978
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:07.791
<v Speaker 3>happened in Nazi Germany because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was nothing for the powerful to </v>

979
00:53:07.791 --> 00:53:11.211
<v Speaker 3>subordinate themselves to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to be subordinate to </v>

980
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:11.970
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>

981
00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to tear that idea part,</v>

982
00:53:14.071 --> 00:53:16.830
<v Speaker 3>but partly what it means is that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>subordinate,</v>

983
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:20.220
<v Speaker 3>even if you're sovereign to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>principle of sovereignty itself,</v>

984
00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.820
<v Speaker 3>and then the question is what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the principle of sovereignty?</v>

985
00:53:23.821 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 3>And I could say we been working that out</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a very long period of time,</v>

986
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:33.080
<v Speaker 3>and so that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk about because the ancient </v>

987
00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.591
<v Speaker 3>Mesopotamians and the ancient Egyptians </v>
<v Speaker 3>had some very interesting dramatic ideas</v>

988
00:53:37.921 --> 00:53:38.730
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

989
00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.030
<v Speaker 3>So is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

990
00:53:42.031 --> 00:53:47.031
<v Speaker 3>very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a dandy known as Marduk and </v>

991
00:53:47.031 --> 00:53:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Martech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in Mesopotamia.</v>

992
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:53.271
<v Speaker 3>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and imagine this is sorta what happened </v>

993
00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:55.950
<v Speaker 3>is that as an empire grew out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>post ice age age,</v>

994
00:53:55.951 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 3>say 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

995
00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:58.680
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

996
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.290
<v Speaker 3>all these tribes came together in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribes.</v>

997
00:54:01.291 --> 00:54:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Each had their own data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own image of the ideal,</v>

998
00:54:04.321 --> 00:54:06.600
<v Speaker 3>but then they started to occupy the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>territory,</v>

999
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then one tribe had god,</v>

1000
00:54:09.571 --> 00:54:14.370
<v Speaker 3>a in one tribe had God be and no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>could wipe the other one out and then it</v>

1001
00:54:14.371 --> 00:54:19.371
<v Speaker 3>would just be God a who wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's not so good because while </v>

1002
00:54:19.371 --> 00:54:23.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe you want to trade with those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people or maybe you don't want to lose </v>

1003
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:23.370
<v Speaker 3>half your population in a war or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

1004
00:54:23.371 --> 00:54:28.371
<v Speaker 3>so then you have to have an argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>about whose God is going to take </v>

1005
00:54:28.371 --> 00:54:32.871
<v Speaker 3>priority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which ideal is going to take priority </v>

1006
00:54:32.871 --> 00:54:35.271
<v Speaker 3>and what seems to happen is that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>represented in mythology is a battle of </v>

1007
00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:38.700
<v Speaker 3>the gods in sort of celestial space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from a practical perspective,</v>

1008
00:54:38.701 --> 00:54:40.530
<v Speaker 3>it's more like an ongoing dialogue.</v>

1009
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.420
<v Speaker 3>You believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe this.</v>

1010
00:54:42.421 --> 00:54:44.070
<v Speaker 3>You believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe this.</v>

1011
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:49.190
<v Speaker 3>How are we going to Meld that together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you take God a and you take God be </v>

1012
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:53.130
<v Speaker 3>and maybe what you do is extract God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see from them and you say,</v>

1013
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:56.160
<v Speaker 3>well God see now has the attributes of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>and B,</v>

1014
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.940
<v Speaker 3>and then some other tribes come in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then see takes them over to.</v>

1015
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Speaker 3>And so you get like with Marduk for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1016
00:55:02.551 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 3>he has a multitude of names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 different names.</v>

1017
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:08.910
<v Speaker 3>While those are names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in part of the subordinate,</v>

1018
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.870
<v Speaker 3>God's that represented the tribes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>came together to make the civilization.</v>

1019
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:15.300
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the process by which that</v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract,</v>

1020
00:55:15.301 --> 00:55:19.350
<v Speaker 3>that ideal is abstractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think this is important and it works</v>

1021
00:55:19.351 --> 00:55:24.351
<v Speaker 3>because you're trying to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you think this is important and it </v>

1022
00:55:24.351 --> 00:55:25.740
<v Speaker 3>works because your tribe is alive and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll take the best of both.</v>

1023
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:30.740
<v Speaker 3>If we could manage it and extract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extract out something that's even more </v>

1024
00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.370
<v Speaker 3>abstract that covers both of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we can do it.</v>

1025
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.560
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about,</v>

1026
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.830
<v Speaker 3>I'll just give you a couple of of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>features,</v>

1027
00:55:37.831 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 3>but he has eyes all the way around his </v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

1028
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.470
<v Speaker 3>He's elected by all the other gods to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>Katen God.</v>

1029
00:55:43.471 --> 00:55:48.471
<v Speaker 3>So that's the first thing that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool and they elect him because they're </v>

1030
00:55:48.471 --> 00:55:52.400
<v Speaker 3>facing a terrible threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like a flood and a monster </v>

1031
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:52.400
<v Speaker 3>combined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1032
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.720
<v Speaker 3>And Martin basically says that if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>elect him,</v>

1033
00:55:54.721 --> 00:55:59.721
<v Speaker 3>top God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he'll go out and stop the flood </v>

1034
00:55:59.721 --> 00:56:00.480
<v Speaker 3>monster and they won't all get wiped </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1035
00:56:00.481 --> 00:56:02.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a serious threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's chaos itself,</v>

1036
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.720
<v Speaker 3>making its comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so all the gods agree and Martin has</v>

1037
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:11.721
<v Speaker 3>the new manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got eyes all the way around his </v>

1038
00:56:11.721 --> 00:56:15.021
<v Speaker 3>head and he speaks magic words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he also goes out and when he </v>

1039
00:56:15.021 --> 00:56:19.701
<v Speaker 3>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fights this deity called Tiamat and </v>

1040
00:56:19.701 --> 00:56:19.780
<v Speaker 3>we need to know that because the word </v>
<v Speaker 3>Taya,</v>

1041
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Matt is associated with the Word Tay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Home t h o m</v>

1042
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:29.340
<v Speaker 2>entail is the chaos that God makes order</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of at the beginning of time in </v>

1043
00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.200
<v Speaker 2>genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's linked very tightly to the story</v>

1044
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.470
<v Speaker 2>and Martin with his eyes and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to speak.</v>

1045
00:56:35.471 --> 00:56:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Magic words goes out to confront tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

1046
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 2>who's like a watery sea dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1047
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a classic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a classic St George Story.</v>

1048
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Go out and and recalc on the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He cuts her into pieces and he makes the</v>

1049
00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:54.640
<v Speaker 2>world out of her pieces and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that human beings live in.</v>

1050
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:57.760
<v Speaker 2>The Mesopotamian emperor acted out </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marduk.</v>

1051
00:56:57.761 --> 00:57:01.120
<v Speaker 2>He was allowed to be emperor in so far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as he was a good Marduk console.</v>

1052
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:06.360
<v Speaker 2>That meant that he had eyes all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>around his head and he could speak </v>

1053
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.390
<v Speaker 2>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could speak properly and so that </v>

1054
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.640
<v Speaker 2>we're starting to understand they're at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>

1055
00:57:09.641 --> 00:57:11.140
<v Speaker 2>the essence of leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1056
00:57:11.141 --> 00:57:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Because what's leadership?</v>

1057
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:17.370
<v Speaker 2>It's the capacity to see what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in front of your face and maybe in </v>

1058
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:21.331
<v Speaker 2>every direction and then the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use your language properly in a </v>

1059
00:57:21.331 --> 00:57:25.111
<v Speaker 2>transformative manner and to transform </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos into order and God only know how </v>

1060
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:30.200
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long it took the Mesopotamians to </v>

1061
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.161
<v Speaker 2>figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the best they could do is dramatize </v>

1062
00:57:32.161 --> 00:57:32.710
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's staggeringly brilliant.</v>

1063
00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:33.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1064
00:57:33.521 --> 00:57:38.521
<v Speaker 2>It's by no means obvious in this chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>is chaos is a very strange thing and </v>

1065
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.620
<v Speaker 2>this is the chaos that God wrestled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of time.</v>

1066
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Chaos is what it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's half psychological and half real.</v>

1067
00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way to really describe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1068
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:52.900
<v Speaker 2>The chaos is what you encounter when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thrown into deep confusion,</v>

1069
00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:54.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When your world falls apart,</v>

1070
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:57.700
<v Speaker 2>when when you encounter something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>blows you into pieces,</v>

1071
00:57:57.701 --> 00:57:59.980
<v Speaker 2>when your dreams die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're betrayed,</v>

1072
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.000
<v Speaker 2>it's the chaos that emerges and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos is everything at once and it's too</v>

1073
00:58:04.001 --> 00:58:09.001
<v Speaker 2>much for you and that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it pulls you down into the </v>

1074
00:58:09.001 --> 00:58:09.001
<v Speaker 2>underworld and all.</v>

1075
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:14.070
<v Speaker 2>That's where the dragons are and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got at that point is your </v>

1076
00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:16.861
<v Speaker 2>capacity to bloody well keep your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>open and to speak as carefully and </v>

1077
00:58:16.861 --> 00:58:18.310
<v Speaker 2>clearly as you can and maybe if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>lucky,</v>

1078
00:58:18.311 --> 00:58:22.150
<v Speaker 2>you'll get through it that way and come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the other side and it's taken people</v>

1079
00:58:22.151 --> 00:58:27.151
<v Speaker 2>a very long time to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it looks to me like the idea is </v>

1080
00:58:27.151 --> 00:58:31.950
<v Speaker 2>erected on the platform of our ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors maybe tens of millions of </v>

1081
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:36.900
<v Speaker 2>years ago because we seem to represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>that which disturbs us deeply using the </v>

1082
00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:42.691
<v Speaker 2>same system that we use to represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>like serpentine while serpentine or </v>

1083
00:58:42.691 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 2>other carnivorous predators and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1084
00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:47.590
<v Speaker 2>we're biological creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1085
00:58:47.591 --> 00:58:52.591
<v Speaker 2>So when we've formulated our capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract are strange capacity to </v>

1086
00:58:52.591 --> 00:58:57.421
<v Speaker 2>abstract and use language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still have all those underlying </v>

1087
00:58:57.421 --> 00:59:00.121
<v Speaker 2>systems that were there when we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>only animals and we have to use those </v>

1088
00:59:00.641 --> 00:59:01.420
<v Speaker 2>systems there.</v>

1089
00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:06.420
<v Speaker 2>They're part of the emotional and </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational architecture of our </v>

1090
00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:09.730
<v Speaker 2>thinking and part of the reason we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonize our enemies who upset or axioms</v>

1091
00:59:09.731 --> 00:59:13.450
<v Speaker 2>is because we perceive them as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're carnivorous predators.</v>

1092
00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:17.200
<v Speaker 2>We do it with the same system and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos itself.</v>

1093
00:59:17.201 --> 00:59:18.940
<v Speaker 2>The thing that always threatens us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1094
00:59:18.941 --> 00:59:23.941
<v Speaker 2>The snakes that came to the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lived in them like 60 million years </v>

1095
00:59:23.941 --> 00:59:25.430
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same damn systems.</v>

1096
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:31.090
<v Speaker 2>So the Martech story is partly the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>of using attention to language to </v>

1097
00:59:31.341 --> 00:59:36.341
<v Speaker 2>confront those things that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened us and some of those things </v>

1098
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:39.740
<v Speaker 2>are real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real world threats,</v>

1099
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:44.890
<v Speaker 2>but some of them are psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>threats which are just as profound but </v>

1100
00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:47.150
<v Speaker 2>far more abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we use the same systems to represent</v>

1101
00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:48.320
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why you freeze.</v>

1102
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 2>If you're frightened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1103
00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:52.190
<v Speaker 2>You're a prey animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like a rabbit,</v>

1104
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:57.520
<v Speaker 2>you've seen us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen something that's going to </v>

1105
00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:57.520
<v Speaker 2>eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you freeze.</v>

1106
00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.940
<v Speaker 2>And that way you're paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're turn to stone,</v>

1107
00:59:58.941 --> 01:00:02.900
<v Speaker 2>which is what you do when you see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>medusa with a head full of state snakes,</v>

1108
01:00:02.901 --> 01:00:04.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your turned to stone,</v>

1109
01:00:04.131 --> 01:00:09.131
<v Speaker 2>you're paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason you do that is because </v>

1110
01:00:09.131 --> 01:00:10.820
<v Speaker 2>you're using the Predator detection </v>
<v Speaker 2>system to protect yourself.</v>

1111
01:00:10.821 --> 01:00:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Your heart rate goes way up and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to move.</v>

1112
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Things that upset us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rely on that system,</v>

1113
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:21.470
<v Speaker 2>and then the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story for example,</v>

1114
01:00:21.471 --> 01:00:24.290
<v Speaker 2>is the idea that if there are things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that upset you,</v>

1115
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 2>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

1116
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:27.860
<v Speaker 2>serpentine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monstrous underworld,</v>

1117
01:00:27.861 --> 01:00:32.861
<v Speaker 2>things that threaten you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best thing to do is to open your </v>

1118
01:00:32.861 --> 01:00:36.071
<v Speaker 2>eyes and get your speech organized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and confront the thing and make </v>

1119
01:00:36.071 --> 01:00:37.880
<v Speaker 2>the world out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's staggering.</v>

1120
01:00:37.881 --> 01:00:42.881
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I read that story and started to </v>

1121
01:00:42.881 --> 01:00:42.881
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just blew me away.</v>

1122
01:00:42.881 --> 01:00:44.660
<v Speaker 2>It's such a profound idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know it's true too,</v>

1123
01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:46.790
<v Speaker 2>because we know in psychotherapy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1124
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:50.480
<v Speaker 2>that you're much better off to confront </v>
<v Speaker 2>your fears head on.</v>

1125
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Then you are to wait and let them find </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1126
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.340
<v Speaker 2>And so partly what you do if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapist,</v>

1127
01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:59.480
<v Speaker 2>is you help people break their fears </v>
<v Speaker 2>into little pieces,</v>

1128
01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:04.481
<v Speaker 2>the things that upset them and into </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter them one by one and master </v>

1129
01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:08.741
<v Speaker 2>that when you're teaching this process </v>
<v Speaker 2>of eternal mastery over the strange and </v>

1130
01:01:08.741 --> 01:01:12.150
<v Speaker 2>chaotic world and that all of that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>up some of the background.</v>

1131
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.230
<v Speaker 2>We haven't even got to the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence of the biblical stories yet.</v>

1132
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1133
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:27.610
<v Speaker 2>And all of that makes up the background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to think that we've </v>

1134
01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:30.821
<v Speaker 2>extracted this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are this strange collection of </v>

1135
01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:34.301
<v Speaker 2>stories with all its errors and it's and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's repetitions and its peculiarities </v>

1136
01:01:34.301 --> 01:01:39.251
<v Speaker 2>out of the entire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the entire history that we've been </v>

1137
01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:41.420
<v Speaker 2>able to collect ideas and it's the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been able to do.</v>

1138
01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.600
<v Speaker 2>And I know there are other religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions about not concerned about </v>

1139
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.220
<v Speaker 2>that at the moment because we can use </v>
<v Speaker 2>this as an example,</v>

1140
01:01:49.221 --> 01:01:51.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's the basket we've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1141
01:01:51.201 --> 01:01:55.250
<v Speaker 2>And what I'm hoping is that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>return to the stories in some sense with</v>

1142
01:01:55.251 --> 01:01:58.760
<v Speaker 2>an open mind and see if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something there that we actually need.</v>

1143
01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And hope and I hope that that will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case and as I said,</v>

1144
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>all approaches as rationally as I </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly can,</v>

1145
01:02:05.481 --> 01:02:08.040
<v Speaker 2>so well this is the idea to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1146
01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>we have the unknown as such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we act in it like animals act,</v>

1147
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>they act first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't think,</v>

1148
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:18.440
<v Speaker 2>they don't imagine they act and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where we started.</v>

1149
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.440
<v Speaker 2>We started acting and then we started to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to represent how we acted and </v>

1150
01:02:23.641 --> 01:02:28.641
<v Speaker 2>then we started to talk about how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented how we acted and that </v>

1151
01:02:28.641 --> 01:02:30.690
<v Speaker 2>enabled us to tell stories because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what a story is.</v>

1152
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:35.930
<v Speaker 2>It's to tell about how you represent how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you act and so you know that because if </v>

1153
01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:38.040
<v Speaker 2>you read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>

1154
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.400
<v Speaker 2>You read the board and images come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind of the people in the book behaving,</v>

1155
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:46.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one step from acting it out.</v>

1156
01:02:46.021 --> 01:02:48.540
<v Speaker 2>It's you don't act it out cause you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract.</v>

1157
01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:51.630
<v Speaker 2>You can represent action without having </v>
<v Speaker 2>to act it out.</v>

1158
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:56.870
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing thing and that's part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the development of the prefrontal </v>

1159
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:59.541
<v Speaker 2>cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the capacity for human </v>

1160
01:02:59.541 --> 01:02:59.670
<v Speaker 2>abstract thought is that you can pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>the behavior,</v>

1161
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:04.730
<v Speaker 2>the representation of the behavior away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the behavior and manipulate the </v>

1162
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:08.961
<v Speaker 2>representation before you enact it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you think it's so that you </v>

1163
01:03:09.391 --> 01:03:14.391
<v Speaker 2>can generate a pattern of action and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tested out in a fictional world before </v>

1164
01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.230
<v Speaker 2>you embody it and die because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>foolish,</v>

1165
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You let the representation die,</v>

1166
01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.810
<v Speaker 2>not you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why you think.</v>

1167
01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.810
<v Speaker 2>And so that's partly what we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with these stories.</v>

1168
01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:32.980
<v Speaker 2>What do I hope to accomplish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope to end this 12 lecture series </v>

1169
01:03:33.591 --> 01:03:37.970
<v Speaker 2>knowing more than I did when I started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my goal because I said,</v>

1170
01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you what I know.</v>

1171
01:03:40.101 --> 01:03:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure things out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1172
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:43.760
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1173
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:48.050
<v Speaker 2>and this is part of this is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process by which I'm doing that.</v>

1174
01:03:48.051 --> 01:03:51.170
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm doing my best to think on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>

1175
01:03:51.171 --> 01:03:51.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1176
01:03:51.481 --> 01:03:55.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm trying to stay on the edge of my</v>

1177
01:03:55.371 --> 01:03:59.870
<v Speaker 2>capacity to generate knowledge and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make this continually clearer and to get</v>

1178
01:03:59.871 --> 01:04:03.200
<v Speaker 2>to the bottom of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm hoping that that's what I'm,</v>

1179
01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:08.590
<v Speaker 2>that's what I want to accomplish and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like people are interested in </v>

1180
01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:09.050
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we're going to try to accomplish</v>

1181
01:04:09.051 --> 01:04:10.550
<v Speaker 2>that together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the,</v>

1182
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:16.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the plan and the idea is to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's something at the bottom of </v>

1183
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:18.980
<v Speaker 2>this amazing civilization that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to construct</v>

1184
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:26.430
<v Speaker 2>did I think is in peril for a variety of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons and maybe if we understand it a </v>

1185
01:04:26.921 --> 01:04:28.200
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit better,</v>

1186
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:31.240
<v Speaker 2>we won't be so prone just to throw the </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn thing away,</v>

1187
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:36.390
<v Speaker 2>which I think would be a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to throw it away because of </v>

1188
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:39.040
<v Speaker 2>resentment and hatred and bitterness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>historical ignorance and jealousy and,</v>

1189
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.960
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1190
01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:42.400
<v Speaker 2>and the desire for destruction and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

1191
01:04:42.401 --> 01:04:47.401
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't want to go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bad idea to go there and we need </v>

1192
01:04:47.401 --> 01:04:51.370
<v Speaker 2>to be grounded better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so hopefully.</v>

1193
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Well we'll see how this works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

1194
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:57.490
<v Speaker 2>So how do I approach this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1195
01:04:57.670 --> 01:05:00.010
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in evolutionary terms,</v>

1196
01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:05.490
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos is 15 billion years old and </v>

1197
01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:10.051
<v Speaker 2>the world is four and a half billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old and there's been life for </v>

1198
01:05:10.051 --> 01:05:10.420
<v Speaker 2>three and a half billion years and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

1199
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

1200
01:05:11.191 --> 01:05:16.191
<v Speaker 2>there were creatures that had pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed nervous systems 300 to 600 </v>

1201
01:05:16.191 --> 01:05:20.790
<v Speaker 2>million years ago and we living in trees</v>
<v Speaker 2>as small mammals 60 million years ago </v>

1202
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:25.910
<v Speaker 2>when we were down on the plains between </v>
<v Speaker 2>$60 million and 7 million years ago.</v>

1203
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's about when we split from </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees and modern human beings seem</v>

1204
01:05:29.421 --> 01:05:34.421
<v Speaker 2>to emerge about 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and civilization pretty much </v>

1205
01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 2>after the last ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something after 15,000</v>

1206
01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:39.130
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not very long ago at all.</v>

1207
01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:40.820
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the.</v>

1208
01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the span across which I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1209
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the span across which I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1210
01:05:47.081 --> 01:05:52.081
<v Speaker 2>I want to understand why we are the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are looking at life and it's in its </v>

1211
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:55.240
<v Speaker 2>continual complexity right from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of life itself.</v>

1212
01:05:55.241 --> 01:06:00.241
<v Speaker 2>And there's some real utility in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we share attributes with other </v>

1213
01:06:00.241 --> 01:06:00.241
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even apple,</v>

1214
01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:03.280
<v Speaker 2>apple animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as simple as crustaceans,</v>

1215
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:08.281
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have nervous system properties that are </v>

1216
01:06:08.281 --> 01:06:10.921
<v Speaker 2>very much like ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very much worth worth knowing </v>

1217
01:06:10.921 --> 01:06:11.830
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think in an evolutionary way,</v>

1218
01:06:11.831 --> 01:06:16.831
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a grand and remarkable way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to think because it has this incredible </v>

1219
01:06:16.831 --> 01:06:17.680
<v Speaker 2>timespan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1220
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.090
<v Speaker 2>It's this amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1221
01:06:19.091 --> 01:06:24.091
<v Speaker 2>people at the end of the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the 19th century say,</v>

1222
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:28.060
<v Speaker 2>thought the world really thought the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world was about 6,000</v>

1223
01:06:28.061 --> 01:06:30.940
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 15 billion years old.</v>

1224
01:06:30.941 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1225
01:06:32.081 --> 01:06:33.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot grander.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot bigger,</v>

1226
01:06:33.971 --> 01:06:38.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a lot more frightening and</v>
<v Speaker 2>an alienating in some sense because,</v>

1227
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos has become so vast.</v>

1228
01:06:40.271 --> 01:06:45.271
<v Speaker 2>It's either easy for human beings to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of themselves as trivial specs on </v>

1229
01:06:45.271 --> 01:06:49.501
<v Speaker 2>a trivial spec out some misbegotten hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>hole end of the galaxy among hundreds of</v>

1230
01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:52.780
<v Speaker 2>millions of galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1231
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:57.781
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to see yourself as </v>

1232
01:06:57.781 --> 01:06:58.480
<v Speaker 2>nothing in that span of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real challenge for people.</v>

1233
01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:01.690
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a mistake to think that way</v>

1234
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.380
<v Speaker 2>because I think consciousness is far </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than we think it is,</v>

1235
01:07:05.381 --> 01:07:07.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's still something we have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grapple with.</v>

1236
01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm a psychoanalytic thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that means is that I believe </v>

1237
01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.780
<v Speaker 2>that people are collections of </v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonalities.</v>

1238
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:20.770
<v Speaker 2>Those subpersonalities are alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not machines.</v>

1239
01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:23.170
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their viewpoint,</v>

1240
01:07:23.171 --> 01:07:25.900
<v Speaker 2>they have their wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have their perceptions,</v>

1241
01:07:25.901 --> 01:07:28.150
<v Speaker 2>they have their arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have their emotions.</v>

1242
01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:31.510
<v Speaker 2>They're like low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>representations of you.</v>

1243
01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get angry,</v>

1244
01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:35.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's a very low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of you.</v>

1245
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:39.510
<v Speaker 2>It only wants rage or it only wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to eat or when we want it,</v>

1246
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.470
<v Speaker 2>only wants water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only wants sex.</v>

1247
01:07:41.471 --> 01:07:42.260
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1248
01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.810
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shrunken,</v>

1249
01:07:43.811 --> 01:07:45.850
<v Speaker 2>focused in a specific direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1250
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:47.850
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those,</v>

1251
01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.980
<v Speaker 2>all those motivational systems are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very ancient,</v>

1252
01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:52.390
<v Speaker 2>very archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and very,</v>

1253
01:07:52.391 --> 01:07:57.391
<v Speaker 2>very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they blamed determining role in the </v>

1254
01:07:57.391 --> 01:08:00.130
<v Speaker 2>manner in which we manifest ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As Freud pointed out with the Ed,</v>

1255
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 2>we have to figure out how to take all </v>
<v Speaker 2>those underlying animalistic motivations</v>

1256
01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:10.111
<v Speaker 2>and emotions and civilize them in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>way so that we can all live in the same </v>

1257
01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.390
<v Speaker 2>general territory without tearing each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other to shreds,</v>

1258
01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:17.780
<v Speaker 2>which is maybe the position of both </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzee and humanity.</v>

1259
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I take that seriously.</v>

1260
01:08:21.321 --> 01:08:24.450
<v Speaker 2>The idea that we're a loose collection </v>
<v Speaker 2>of spirits and that,</v>

1261
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:25.500
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1262
01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.780
<v Speaker 2>that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says in the Old Testament somewhere </v>

1263
01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.030
<v Speaker 2>that the fear of God is the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom and I think this is akin to that.</v>

1264
01:08:32.031 --> 01:08:37.031
<v Speaker 2>If you know that you're not in control </v>
<v Speaker 2>of yourself thoroughly and that there </v>

1265
01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:41.231
<v Speaker 2>are other factors behind the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Greeks thought that human </v>

1266
01:08:41.231 --> 01:08:43.530
<v Speaker 2>beings were the play things of the gods </v>
<v Speaker 2>outs,</v>

1267
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 2>the way they conceptualize the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sort of meant the same thing.</v>

1268
01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:50.900
<v Speaker 2>They meant that there are these great </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces that move us,</v>

1269
01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:53.480
<v Speaker 2>that we don't create that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were,</v>

1270
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:56.300
<v Speaker 2>that were subordinate to in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not entirely,</v>

1271
01:08:56.301 --> 01:08:59.150
<v Speaker 2>but we can be subordinate to them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they move our destinies.</v>

1272
01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.520
<v Speaker 2>That was the Greek view and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1273
01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:02.070
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1274
01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:02.580
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1275
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:07.590
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it teaches you humility to understand </v>

1276
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.590
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1277
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:09.270
<v Speaker 2>that there's a hell of a lot more going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on behind the scenes and you're,</v>

1278
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:11.570
<v Speaker 2>you're the driver of a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>vehicle,</v>

1279
01:09:11.571 --> 01:09:16.571
<v Speaker 2>but you don't understand the vehicle </v>
<v Speaker 2>very well and it's got its own </v>

1280
01:09:16.571 --> 01:09:20.110
<v Speaker 2>motivations and methods and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it's doing something and it's </v>

1281
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:21.260
<v Speaker 2>doing something completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different.</v>

1282
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:25.190
<v Speaker 2>You see that in psychotherapy all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time because you know you helped someone</v>

1283
01:09:25.191 --> 01:09:28.430
<v Speaker 2>unwind a pattern of behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've manifested forever.</v>

1284
01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:29.840
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they describe it.</v>

1285
01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:34.841
<v Speaker 2>Then they become aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe they start to see what the </v>

1286
01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:37.541
<v Speaker 2>cause is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no idea why they were acting </v>

1287
01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:37.541
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1288
01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:38.400
<v Speaker 2>they have to have the memory that </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced the,</v>

1289
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.480
<v Speaker 2>the behavioral pattern to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be brought back to mind and </v>

1290
01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.041
<v Speaker 2>then it has to be analyzed and assessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they have to think about a </v>

1291
01:09:48.041 --> 01:09:49.490
<v Speaker 2>different way of acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's extraordinarily complex.</v>

1292
01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:50.690
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1293
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.310
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalytic literary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

1294
01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:03.010
<v Speaker 2>there's this new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this postmodern idea about </v>

1295
01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:07.810
<v Speaker 2>literature and about the world for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter that if you take a complex piece </v>

1296
01:10:09.081 --> 01:10:11.300
<v Speaker 2>of literature like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Shakespeare play,</v>

1297
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.990
<v Speaker 2>there's no end to the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations that you can make of it.</v>

1298
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:17.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can eat turpin each word.</v>

1299
01:10:17.391 --> 01:10:19.370
<v Speaker 2>You can interpret each phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each sentence,</v>

1300
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:22.190
<v Speaker 2>each paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can interpret the entire play.</v>

1301
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:25.490
<v Speaker 2>The way you interpreted depends on how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many other books you've read,</v>

1302
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 2>depends on your orientation in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1303
01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:31.430
<v Speaker 2>It depends on a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very large number of things,</v>

1304
01:10:31.431 --> 01:10:34.760
<v Speaker 2>how cultured you are or how how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture you lack.</v>

1305
01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.580
<v Speaker 2>All of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That opens up a huge,</v>

1306
01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.860
<v Speaker 2>a huge vista for potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation and so the postmodern and</v>

1307
01:10:41.861 --> 01:10:43.550
<v Speaker 2>sort of stubbed their toe on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

1308
01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:48.551
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's this vast number of </v>

1309
01:10:48.551 --> 01:10:49.340
<v Speaker 2>interpretations of any particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>literary work,</v>

1310
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:54.370
<v Speaker 2>how can you be sure that any </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation is more valid than any </v>

1311
01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:54.370
<v Speaker 2>other interpretation?</v>

1312
01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:58.810
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't be sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then how do you even know those are </v>

1313
01:10:58.810 --> 01:10:58.810
<v Speaker 2>great works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you know they can't?</v>

1314
01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're just works that the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in power have used to facilitate their </v>

1315
01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:08.530
<v Speaker 2>continual succession of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really a postmodern idea.</v>

1316
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very cynical one,</v>

1317
01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:14.981
<v Speaker 2>but it has its point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is it's grounded in </v>

1318
01:11:14.981 --> 01:11:14.981
<v Speaker 2>something real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1319
01:11:14.981 --> 01:11:14.981
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1320
01:11:14.981 --> 01:11:17.490
<v Speaker 2>you can interpret things forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you something here.</v>

1321
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Just briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll go back to it later.</v>

1322
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the cool one of the coolest </v>

1323
01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:26.160
<v Speaker 2>things I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the bottom here,</v>

1324
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.100
<v Speaker 2>every single one of those lines is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical verse.</v>

1325
01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1326
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Now the length of the line is </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportionate to how many times that </v>

1327
01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:38.780
<v Speaker 2>verse is referred to in some way by some</v>
<v Speaker 2>other verse.</v>

1328
01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.520
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1329
01:11:42.521 --> 01:11:45.670
<v Speaker 2>this is the first hyperlinked book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1330
01:11:45.671 --> 01:11:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm dead serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

1331
01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.110
<v Speaker 2>You can't click and get the hyperlinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

1332
01:11:50.111 --> 01:11:52.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's a thoroughly hyperlink book and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because,</v>

1333
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:57.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who worked on these stories </v>

1334
01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:57.630
<v Speaker 2>that are hypothetically at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1335
01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:59.110
<v Speaker 2>which is the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't affect the beginning.</v>

1336
01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the rule of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1337
01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.300
<v Speaker 2>What happens now can affect what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to you 10 years ago.</v>

1338
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Even though it actually can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

1339
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you reinterpret things right and then </v>

1340
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.770
<v Speaker 2>they're not the same but like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't get into that,</v>

1341
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:15.940
<v Speaker 2>but technically speaking the president </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot affect the past,</v>

1342
01:12:15.941 --> 01:12:20.110
<v Speaker 2>but if we're looking at a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature that's not right because when</v>

1343
01:12:20.111 --> 01:12:25.111
<v Speaker 2>you write the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it was at the beginning </v>

1344
01:12:25.111 --> 01:12:25.111
<v Speaker 2>and when you write the beginning or edit</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1345
01:12:25.111 --> 01:12:29.131
<v Speaker 2>you know what's at the end so you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>weave the whole thing together and </v>

1346
01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:33.181
<v Speaker 2>there's 65,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>cross-references and that's what this </v>

1347
01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:36.510
<v Speaker 2>map shows and so that's a great visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the book and then you </v>

1348
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:37.420
<v Speaker 2>can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why is it deep?</v>

1349
01:12:37.421 --> 01:12:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Why is the book deep?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1350
01:12:38.891 --> 01:12:41.560
<v Speaker 2>just imagine how many pathways you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>take through that,</v>

1351
01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:47.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you'd just journey through your </v>

1352
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:47.010
<v Speaker 2>journey through that forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd never ever get to the end of it.</v>

1353
01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:52.290
<v Speaker 2>There's permutations and combinations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and every phrase is dependent on every </v>

1354
01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:54.010
<v Speaker 2>other phrase in every versus dependent </v>
<v Speaker 2>on every other doctor.</v>

1355
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Not entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 65,000</v>

1356
01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.840
<v Speaker 2>is not a bad start and so.</v>

1357
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well so,</v>

1358
01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:07.410
<v Speaker 2>so the that that's another issue in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that seems to make the </v>

1359
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:08.470
<v Speaker 2>postmodernist critique even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1360
01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:13.471
<v Speaker 2>How in the world you're going to extract</v>
<v Speaker 2>out a canonical interpretation of </v>

1361
01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:14.350
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like it's not possible,</v>

1362
01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.440
<v Speaker 2>but here's the issue as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>

1363
01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:23.130
<v Speaker 2>the interpreter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the postmodernists extended that </v>

1364
01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:23.130
<v Speaker 2>critique to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

1365
01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:23.950
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well a text is complicated enough.</v>

1366
01:13:23.951 --> 01:13:26.290
<v Speaker 2>You can't extract out a canonical </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>

1367
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:29.920
<v Speaker 2>What about the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is way more complicated than a</v>

1368
01:13:29.921 --> 01:13:34.921
<v Speaker 2>text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's an infinite number of </v>

1369
01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:36.841
<v Speaker 2>ways that you can look at the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do we know that any one way is </v>

1370
01:13:36.841 --> 01:13:38.530
<v Speaker 2>better than any other way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good question.</v>

1371
01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Now the postmodern answer was we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not a good answer because you</v>

1372
01:13:45.401 --> 01:13:47.620
<v Speaker 2>drowned in chaos under those </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>

1373
01:13:47.621 --> 01:13:52.621
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't make sense of anything and </v>

1374
01:13:52.621 --> 01:13:52.621
<v Speaker 2>that's not good because</v>

1375
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:56.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not neutral to not make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1376
01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:01.980
<v Speaker 2>It's very anxiety provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very depressing because if things </v>

1377
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.430
<v Speaker 2>are so chaotic that you can't get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle on them,</v>

1378
01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:08.610
<v Speaker 2>your body defaults into emergency </v>
<v Speaker 2>preparation mode and your heart rate </v>

1379
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:11.140
<v Speaker 2>goes up and your immune system stops </v>
<v Speaker 2>working and like you burn yourself,</v>

1380
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:15.850
<v Speaker 2>you age rapidly because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by nothing you can control.</v>

1381
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 2>It's varying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an existential crisis,</v>

1382
01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:20.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's anxiety provoking in depressing,</v>

1383
01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:23.080
<v Speaker 2>very hard on people and even more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1384
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:27.250
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that the way that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>constructed neurophysiologically is that</v>

1385
01:14:27.251 --> 01:14:32.251
<v Speaker 2>we don't experience any positive emotion</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless we have an aim and we can see </v>

1386
01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:38.131
<v Speaker 2>ourselves progressing towards that aim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't precisely attaining the aim </v>

1387
01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.080
<v Speaker 2>that makes us happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you all know,</v>

1388
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:43.900
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever attained anything because</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as you obtain it,</v>

1389
01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:49.290
<v Speaker 2>then the whole little game ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to come up with another </v>

1390
01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:49.290
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1391
01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:51.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's sisyphus and that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1392
01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:56.370
<v Speaker 2>but it does show that the attainment </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be the thing that drives you </v>

1393
01:14:56.370 --> 01:14:59.731
<v Speaker 2>because it collapses the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens when you graduate </v>

1394
01:14:59.731 --> 01:15:02.701
<v Speaker 2>from university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're king of the mountain </v>

1395
01:15:02.701 --> 01:15:03.370
<v Speaker 2>for one day and then you're like surf at</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

1396
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.010
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at starbucks for the next five years.</v>

1397
01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:12.550
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is that that human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings are weird creatures because we're</v>

1398
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:17.551
<v Speaker 2>much more activated by having an aim and</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving towards it than we are by </v>

1399
01:15:17.551 --> 01:15:22.531
<v Speaker 2>attainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is you have to have </v>

1400
01:15:22.531 --> 01:15:23.560
<v Speaker 2>an aim and that means you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an interpretation and it also means that</v>

1401
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.650
<v Speaker 2>the nobler aim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>

1402
01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 2>the better your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really interesting thing to</v>

1403
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:34.981
<v Speaker 2>know because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've heard ever since you were tiny </v>

1404
01:15:34.981 --> 01:15:35.310
<v Speaker 2>that you should act like a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't lie,</v>

1405
01:15:35.311 --> 01:15:36.550
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you might think,</v>

1406
01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:41.551
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the hell should I act like a good </v>

1407
01:15:41.551 --> 01:15:42.400
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not lie in even a three year old can</v>

1408
01:15:42.401 --> 01:15:47.401
<v Speaker 2>ask that question because smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart kids learn to lie earlier by the </v>

1409
01:15:47.401 --> 01:15:47.440
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they think,</v>

1410
01:15:47.441 --> 01:15:52.441
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not twist the fabric of reality so </v>

1411
01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:54.220
<v Speaker 2>that it serves your specific short term </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs?</v>

1412
01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great question.</v>

1413
01:15:55.601 --> 01:15:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Why not do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why Act Morally?</v>

1414
01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:02.730
<v Speaker 2>If you can get away with something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it brings you closer to something you </v>

1415
01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:03.460
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why not do it?</v>

1416
01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.280
<v Speaker 2>These are good questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not self evident.</v>

1417
01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be tied in with what I just </v>

1418
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:14.101
<v Speaker 2>mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like your destabilize yourself and </v>

1419
01:16:14.101 --> 01:16:14.101
<v Speaker 2>things become chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good,</v>

1420
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.060
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't have a no blame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have nothing but but shallow or</v>

1421
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:24.270
<v Speaker 2>trivial pleasures and they don't sustain</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and that's not good because because </v>

1422
01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:27.370
<v Speaker 2>life is so difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much,</v>

1423
01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.860
<v Speaker 2>it's so much suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so complex.</v>

1424
01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.740
<v Speaker 2>It ends and everyone dies and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>painful.</v>

1425
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like without a no blame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you withstand any of that?</v>

1426
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.490
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You become desperate and once you become</v>

1427
01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:42.430
<v Speaker 2>desperate things go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things go from bad to worse,</v>

1428
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:46.600
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly when you become desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's the idea of the noble aim</v>

1429
01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:47.380
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

1430
01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's necessary.</v>

1431
01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:52.480
<v Speaker 2>It's the bread that people cannot live </v>
<v Speaker 2>without,</v>

1432
01:16:52.481 --> 01:16:54.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not physical bread.</v>

1433
01:16:54.011 --> 01:16:57.760
<v Speaker 2>It's the noble aim and what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1434
01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.780
<v Speaker 2>it was encapsulated in part in the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Marduk.</v>

1435
01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:03.040
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's to pay attention.</v>

1436
01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:05.830
<v Speaker 2>It's to speak properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to confront chaos,</v>

1437
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:08.620
<v Speaker 2>it's to make a better world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that,</v>

1438
01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:14.010
<v Speaker 2>and that's enough of a no blame so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stand up without cringing at the</v>

1439
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:19.090
<v Speaker 2>very thought of your own existence so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can do something that's </v>

1440
01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:21.380
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile to justify your wretched </v>
<v Speaker 2>position on the planet.</v>

1441
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:26.980
<v Speaker 2>So now there's a literary issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that so look,</v>

1442
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:30.680
<v Speaker 2>you take a text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can interpret it a variety of ways,</v>

1443
01:17:30.681 --> 01:17:35.681
<v Speaker 2>but that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where the postmodernist went </v>

1444
01:17:35.681 --> 01:17:38.501
<v Speaker 2>wrong because what you're looking for in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a text and in the world for that matter </v>

1445
01:17:38.501 --> 01:17:42.860
<v Speaker 2>is is sufficient order and direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then we have to think,</v>

1446
01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:47.861
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is sufficient order and direction </v>

1447
01:17:47.861 --> 01:17:49.901
<v Speaker 2>means well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to suffer so much that </v>

1448
01:17:49.901 --> 01:17:49.901
<v Speaker 2>your life is unbearable.</v>

1449
01:17:49.901 --> 01:17:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just seems self evident.</v>

1450
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Pain argues for itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of pain as the fundamental </v>

1451
01:17:56.451 --> 01:17:59.210
<v Speaker 2>reality because no one disputes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1452
01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:04.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you say that you don't believe </v>

1453
01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:04.420
<v Speaker 2>in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help when you're in pain,</v>

1454
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:06.020
<v Speaker 2>you still believe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1455
01:18:06.021 --> 01:18:06.410
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1456
01:18:06.411 --> 01:18:11.411
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't pry it up with logic and </v>

1457
01:18:11.411 --> 01:18:15.101
<v Speaker 2>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just stands forthe as as what the </v>

1458
01:18:15.101 --> 01:18:16.370
<v Speaker 2>fundament of existence and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually quite useful to know.</v>

1459
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1460
01:18:16.911 --> 01:18:21.911
<v Speaker 2>you don't want any more of that than is </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely necessary and I think that's </v>

1461
01:18:21.911 --> 01:18:22.940
<v Speaker 2>self evident and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

1462
01:18:22.941 --> 01:18:26.000
<v Speaker 2>It's more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want any more of that.</v>

1463
01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:29.710
<v Speaker 2>That's necessary today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also not tomorrow and not next week,</v>

1464
01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.790
<v Speaker 2>not next month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not next year,</v>

1465
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:36.850
<v Speaker 2>so however you act now better not </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromise how you're going to be in a </v>

1466
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:38.700
<v Speaker 2>year because that would just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive.</v>

1467
01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Now it's part of the problem with short </v>
<v Speaker 2>term pleasures,</v>

1468
01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:43.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like active haste,</v>

1469
01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:46.280
<v Speaker 2>repented leisure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows exactly what that means,</v>

1470
01:18:46.281 --> 01:18:51.281
<v Speaker 2>so you have to act in a way that works </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and tomorrow and next week and next </v>

1471
01:18:51.281 --> 01:18:53.330
<v Speaker 2>month and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have to take your future self</v>

1472
01:18:53.331 --> 01:18:58.331
<v Speaker 2>into account and human beings can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and taking your future self into </v>

1473
01:18:58.331 --> 01:19:01.100
<v Speaker 2>account isn't much different than taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people into account.</v>

1474
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I remember there's this Simpson </v>

1475
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:09.311
<v Speaker 2>episode and a homer downs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a quart of Manet's and vodka.</v>

1476
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's marge says,</v>

1477
01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:17.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't really do that,</v>

1478
01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:20.600
<v Speaker 2>and homer says that's a problem for </v>
<v Speaker 2>future homer.</v>

1479
01:19:20.770 --> 01:19:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure glad I'm not.</v>

1480
01:19:22.671 --> 01:19:27.671
<v Speaker 2>That guy had so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They called Rico,</v>

1481
01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but but okay,</v>

1482
01:19:31.911 --> 01:19:36.911
<v Speaker 2>but you see we have to grapple with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the you that's out there in the </v>

1483
01:19:36.911 --> 01:19:40.451
<v Speaker 2>future is sort of like another person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so figuring out how to conduct </v>

1484
01:19:40.451 --> 01:19:44.681
<v Speaker 2>yourself properly in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your future self isn't much different </v>

1485
01:19:44.681 --> 01:19:48.610
<v Speaker 2>than figuring out how to conduct </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself in relationship to other </v>

1486
01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:51.281
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then we could expand the </v>

1487
01:19:51.281 --> 01:19:53.231
<v Speaker 2>constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only does the interpretation that </v>

1488
01:19:53.231 --> 01:19:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you extract have to protect you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering and give you an Ame,</v>

1489
01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.860
<v Speaker 2>but it has to do it in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>iterable.</v>

1490
01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:03.430
<v Speaker 2>So it works across time and then it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work in the presence of other people </v>

1491
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:07.870
<v Speaker 2>so that you can cooperate with them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compete with them in a way that doesn't </v>

1492
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.870
<v Speaker 2>make you suffer more.</v>

1493
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:10.980
<v Speaker 2>And people are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not that tolerant.</v>

1494
01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.290
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have choices.</v>

1495
01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:18.291
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to hang around with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can hang around with any one of </v>

1496
01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:18.510
<v Speaker 2>these other primates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you don't act properly,</v>

1497
01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:23.570
<v Speaker 2>at least within certain boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're just cast aside and so </v>

1498
01:20:23.581 --> 01:20:28.581
<v Speaker 2>people are broadcasting information at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you all the time about how you need to </v>

1499
01:20:28.581 --> 01:20:32.451
<v Speaker 2>interpret the world so they can tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 2>being around you and you need that </v>

1500
01:20:32.451 --> 01:20:34.620
<v Speaker 2>because socially isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're insane and then your dad,</v>

1501
01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:37.890
<v Speaker 2>no one can tolerate being alone for any </v>
<v Speaker 2>length of time.</v>

1502
01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:43.220
<v Speaker 2>We can't maintain our own sanity without</v>
<v Speaker 2>continual feedback from other people </v>

1503
01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:47.571
<v Speaker 2>because it's too damn complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're constrained by your own </v>

1504
01:20:47.571 --> 01:20:51.411
<v Speaker 2>existence and then you're constrained by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the existence of other people and then </v>

1505
01:20:51.411 --> 01:20:52.110
<v Speaker 2>you're also constrained by the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1506
01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:57.111
<v Speaker 2>if I read hamlet and what I extract out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that is the idea that I should jump </v>

1507
01:20:57.111 --> 01:20:57.780
<v Speaker 2>off a bridge.</v>

1508
01:20:57.990 --> 01:21:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It puts my interpretation to an end </v>

1509
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:06.711
<v Speaker 2>retailer rather quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to be optimally </v>

1510
01:21:06.711 --> 01:21:06.711
<v Speaker 2>functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1511
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:11.580
<v Speaker 2>and so an interpretation has is </v>
<v Speaker 2>constrained by the reality of the world.</v>

1512
01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:16.581
<v Speaker 2>It's constrained by the reality of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and is constrained by your </v>

1513
01:21:16.581 --> 01:21:19.680
<v Speaker 2>reality across time and there's only a </v>
<v Speaker 2>small number of interpretations that are</v>

1514
01:21:19.681 --> 01:21:22.740
<v Speaker 2>going to work in that tightly defined </v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

1515
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 2>and so that's part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the postmodernists are wrong.</v>

1516
01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:31.940
<v Speaker 2>It's also part of the reason by the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that ai people who've been trying to </v>

1517
01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:35.211
<v Speaker 2>make intelligent machines had had to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in a body is it turns out that you </v>

1518
01:21:35.211 --> 01:21:36.480
<v Speaker 2>just can't make something intelligent in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense,</v>

1519
01:21:36.481 --> 01:21:41.481
<v Speaker 2>without it being embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's partly for the reasons that I </v>

1520
01:21:41.481 --> 01:21:44.451
<v Speaker 2>just described as you need constraints </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the system before you need </v>

1521
01:21:45.121 --> 01:21:50.121
<v Speaker 2>constraints on the system so that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system doesn't drown in an infinite sea </v>

1522
01:21:50.121 --> 01:21:50.280
<v Speaker 2>of interpretation.</v>

1523
01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:54.020
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the literary end of it.</v>

1524
01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:59.210
<v Speaker 2>Moral while morality for me is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>action and I'm an existentialist in some</v>

1525
01:22:00.211 --> 01:22:05.211
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that means is that I believe </v>

1526
01:22:05.211 --> 01:22:05.910
<v Speaker 2>that what people believe to be true is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they act out,</v>

1527
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:10.911
<v Speaker 2>not what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's lots of definitions of </v>

1528
01:22:10.911 --> 01:22:10.911
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1529
01:22:10.911 --> 01:22:13.350
<v Speaker 2>truth is a very expansive word and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can think of objective truth,</v>

1530
01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:17.400
<v Speaker 2>but behavioral truth isn't the same as </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective truth.</v>

1531
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:21.750
<v Speaker 2>What you should do isn't the same as </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is as far as I can tell,</v>

1532
01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:26.751
<v Speaker 2>people debate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the reason that that has to </v>

1533
01:22:26.751 --> 01:22:27.720
<v Speaker 2>be the case is because think about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>

1534
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:31.860
<v Speaker 2>You're standing in front of a field and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the field,</v>

1535
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.770
<v Speaker 2>but the field doesn't tell you how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk through it.</v>

1536
01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:40.250
<v Speaker 2>There's an infinite number of ways you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could walk through it and so you can </v>

1537
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:44.161
<v Speaker 2>extract out an inviolable guide to how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you should act from the array of facts </v>

1538
01:22:44.731 --> 01:22:49.731
<v Speaker 2>that are in front of you because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just too many facts and they don't have </v>

1539
01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:51.330
<v Speaker 2>directionality and but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know.</v>

1540
01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:55.590
<v Speaker 2>You need to know how not to suffer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know what your aim is,</v>

1541
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.610
<v Speaker 2>and so you have to overlay that </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective reality with some interpretive</v>

1542
01:22:59.611 --> 01:23:04.611
<v Speaker 2>structure and it's the nature of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretive structure that we're going </v>

1543
01:23:04.611 --> 01:23:04.611
<v Speaker 2>to be aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heart.</v>

1544
01:23:04.611 --> 01:23:09.181
<v Speaker 2>I've given you hints about it already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've extracted it in part from </v>

1545
01:23:09.181 --> 01:23:12.991
<v Speaker 2>observations of our own behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people's behavior and we've </v>

1546
01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:16.501
<v Speaker 2>extracted in part by the nature of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>embodiment that's been shaped over </v>

1547
01:23:16.501 --> 01:23:20.880
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we see the infinite plane of facts </v>

1548
01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.591
<v Speaker 2>and we impose a moral interpretation on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and the moral interpretation is what </v>

1549
01:23:25.991 --> 01:23:30.991
<v Speaker 2>to do about what is and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated both with security because </v>

1550
01:23:31.061 --> 01:23:36.061
<v Speaker 2>you just don't need too much complexity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also with aim and so we're mobile </v>

1551
01:23:36.061 --> 01:23:36.070
<v Speaker 2>creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1552
01:23:36.071 --> 01:23:41.071
<v Speaker 2>We need to know where we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>because all were ever concerned about </v>

1553
01:23:41.071 --> 01:23:42.670
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking is where we're going.</v>

1554
01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:45.220
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are we going,</v>

1555
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.510
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why?</v>

1556
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:51.220
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the same question as what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the world made of objectively,</v>

1557
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a different question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>requires different answers,</v>

1558
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:57.460
<v Speaker 2>and so that's the domain of the moral as</v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I'm concerned,</v>

1559
01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:00.190
<v Speaker 2>which is what are you aiming at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1560
01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:02.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's the question of the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal in some sense.</v>

1561
01:24:02.891 --> 01:24:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Even if you have trivial little </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragmentary ideals,</v>

1562
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:11.430
<v Speaker 2>there's there's something trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge out of that that's it's more </v>

1563
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:15.490
<v Speaker 2>coherent and more integrated and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>applicable and more practical.</v>

1564
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.960
<v Speaker 2>And that's the other thing is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1565
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you think about literature and you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about art and you think those aren't </v>

1566
01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:27.031
<v Speaker 2>very tightly tied to the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're imperial in area and spiritual </v>

1567
01:24:27.031 --> 01:24:31.861
<v Speaker 2>and they don't seem practical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a practical person and part of </v>

1568
01:24:32.021 --> 01:24:37.021
<v Speaker 2>the reason that I wanted to assess these</v>
<v Speaker 2>books from a literary and aesthetic and </v>

1569
01:24:37.061 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary perspective is to extract </v>
<v Speaker 2>out something of value.</v>

1570
01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Something of real value that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>practical.</v>

1571
01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:48.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something because one of the rules that </v>

1572
01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I have when I'm lecturing is that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to tell anybody anything that</v>

1573
01:24:50.471 --> 01:24:53.770
<v Speaker 2>they can't use because I think of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge as a tool.</v>

1574
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 2>It states something to implement in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world where tool,</v>

1575
01:24:56.891 --> 01:25:01.891
<v Speaker 2>using creatures and our knowledges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tools and we need tools to work in the </v>

1576
01:25:01.891 --> 01:25:06.151
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need tools to regulate our emotions </v>

1577
01:25:06.151 --> 01:25:08.221
<v Speaker 2>and to make things better and to put an </v>
<v Speaker 2>end to suffering to the degree that we </v>

1578
01:25:08.221 --> 01:25:11.911
<v Speaker 2>can and to live with ourselves properly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to stand up properly and you need </v>

1579
01:25:12.041 --> 01:25:17.041
<v Speaker 2>the tools to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't want to do anything in </v>

1580
01:25:17.041 --> 01:25:18.280
<v Speaker 2>this lecture series that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>practical.</v>

1581
01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:23.680
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to come away having things </v>

1582
01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.520
<v Speaker 2>put together in a way that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately apply,</v>

1583
01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:28.750
<v Speaker 2>not interested in abstraction for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sake of abstraction.</v>

1584
01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1585
01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.680
<v Speaker 2>it's gotTa make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1586
01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.040
<v Speaker 2>because the more restrictions on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory the better.</v>

1587
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:40.430
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

1588
01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I want it all laid out causally so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>a and a fall or be follows a and b </v>

1589
01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:53.740
<v Speaker 2>proceeds and in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>understandable and doesn't require a </v>

1590
01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:56.520
<v Speaker 2>leap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any unnecessary leap of faith,</v>

1591
01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:01.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's another thing that I </v>

1592
01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:02.931
<v Speaker 2>think interferes with our relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a collection of books like the </v>

1593
01:26:02.931 --> 01:26:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Bible is that you're called upon to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe things that no one can believe.</v>

1594
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's no good because that's a form</v>
<v Speaker 2>of lie as far as I can tell.</v>

1595
01:26:10.701 --> 01:26:15.701
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you have to scrap the whole </v>

1596
01:26:15.701 --> 01:26:17.561
<v Speaker 2>thing because in principle the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is about truth and if you have to </v>

1597
01:26:17.561 --> 01:26:18.380
<v Speaker 2>start your pursuit of truth by </v>
<v Speaker 2>swallowing a bunch of lies,</v>

1598
01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:20.810
<v Speaker 2>then how in the world are you going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get anywhere with that?</v>

1599
01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:25.640
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't want any uncertainty at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of this.</v>

1600
01:26:25.641 --> 01:26:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want any more than that.</v>

1601
01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.520
<v Speaker 2>I have to leave in it because I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get any farther than that.</v>

1602
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna make sense?</v>

1603
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Rationally I want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to be pushing up against</v>

1604
01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:41.300
<v Speaker 2>what we know to be scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>untrue,</v>

1605
01:26:41.301 --> 01:26:43.340
<v Speaker 2>even though science is in flux and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1606
01:26:43.341 --> 01:26:48.341
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat of a dangerous parameter I </v>

1607
01:26:48.341 --> 01:26:51.151
<v Speaker 2>don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it isn't working with evolutionary </v>

1608
01:26:51.151 --> 01:26:51.151
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1609
01:26:51.151 --> 01:26:52.430
<v Speaker 2>then I think that it's not a good enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>

1610
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.690
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1611
01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.420
<v Speaker 2>And then finally it's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logical,</v>

1612
01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:00.970
<v Speaker 4>modern people.</v>

1613
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:02.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think of the,</v>

1614
01:27:03.210 --> 01:27:07.280
<v Speaker 2>of reality as objective and that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

1615
01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:10.100
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't how we experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

1616
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:13.770
<v Speaker 2>We have our domain of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1617
01:27:14.170 --> 01:27:19.170
<v Speaker 2>and it's a hard thing to get a grip on </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it should be the most </v>

1618
01:27:19.170 --> 01:27:23.681
<v Speaker 2>obvious thing for the phenomenologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that you experienced is real </v>

1619
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.890
<v Speaker 2>and so they're interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of your subjective experience.</v>

1620
01:27:27.891 --> 01:27:28.460
<v Speaker 2>I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1621
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:31.210
<v Speaker 2>you have subjective experience and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have subjective experiences,</v>

1622
01:27:31.230 --> 01:27:36.230
<v Speaker 2>so to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's commonalities across all of </v>

1623
01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:36.230
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>

1624
01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:38.300
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're likely to experience the same set</v>

1625
01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:39.390
<v Speaker 2>of emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1626
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:43.620
<v Speaker 2>we've been able to identify canonical </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions and canonical motivations,</v>

1627
01:27:43.621 --> 01:27:48.621
<v Speaker 2>and without that we couldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate because you wouldn't know </v>

1628
01:27:48.621 --> 01:27:49.700
<v Speaker 2>what the other person was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to explain infinitely.</v>

1629
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:51.560
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you can take for </v>
<v Speaker 2>granted,</v>

1630
01:27:51.561 --> 01:27:56.561
<v Speaker 2>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when phenomenology is the fact </v>

1631
01:27:56.561 --> 01:27:59.501
<v Speaker 2>that in the center of my vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hands are very clear and then out in </v>

1632
01:27:59.501 --> 01:27:59.960
<v Speaker 2>the periphery they get they disappear.</v>

1633
01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:05.200
<v Speaker 2>And phenomenology is the way things </v>
<v Speaker 2>smell and the way things taste and the </v>

1634
01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.681
<v Speaker 2>fact that they matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you could say in some sense that </v>

1635
01:28:08.681 --> 01:28:12.340
<v Speaker 2>phenomenology is the study of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters rather than matter.</v>

1636
01:28:13.770 --> 01:28:18.770
<v Speaker 2>And it's a given from the phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical perspective that things have </v>

1637
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:20.570
<v Speaker 2>meaning and that did any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1638
01:28:20.571 --> 01:28:24.800
<v Speaker 2>even if you're a rationalist saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>cynic and denialist and you say,</v>

1639
01:28:24.801 --> 01:28:26.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing has any meaning.</v>

1640
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:31.390
<v Speaker 2>You still run into the problem of pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>because pain undercuts your arguments </v>

1641
01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:35.180
<v Speaker 2>and has a meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no escaping from the meaning.</v>

1642
01:28:35.181 --> 01:28:37.820
<v Speaker 2>You can pretty much demolished all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive parts of it,</v>

1643
01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.880
<v Speaker 2>but trying to think your way out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative parts.</v>

1644
01:28:40.881 --> 01:28:45.881
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck with that because that just </v>

1645
01:28:45.881 --> 01:28:47.621
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So phenomenology is now the Bible </v>

1646
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:49.610
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is true.</v>

1647
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.420
<v Speaker 2>A fiction in general is phenomenal </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical and</v>

1648
01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:01.060
<v Speaker 2>it concentrates on trying to elucidate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of human experience and that </v>

1649
01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:04.560
<v Speaker 2>is not the as the objective world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a form of truth because it</v>

1650
01:29:04.561 --> 01:29:08.670
<v Speaker 2>is true that you have a field of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and that it has qualities.</v>

1651
01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:11.490
<v Speaker 2>The question is what are the qualities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

1652
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:16.550
<v Speaker 2>Ancient representations of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're sort of a weird meld of observable</v>

1653
01:29:16.591 --> 01:29:21.591
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that we would consider objective </v>

1654
01:29:21.591 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 2>facts and subjective truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the projection of subjective truth.</v>

1655
01:29:23.581 --> 01:29:25.350
<v Speaker 2>And I'll show you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1656
01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you how the Mesopotamians </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewed the world and they had a.</v>

1657
01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.500
<v Speaker 2>They had a model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the world was a disc.</v>

1658
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:35.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go out into field at night,</v>

1659
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:37.860
<v Speaker 2>what does the world look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1660
01:29:37.930 --> 01:29:40.800
<v Speaker 2>it's a disc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a dome on top of it.</v>

1661
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was basically the Mesopotamian view</v>

1662
01:29:43.531 --> 01:29:48.531
<v Speaker 2>of the world view of the world that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who wrote the first stories in </v>

1663
01:29:48.531 --> 01:29:49.590
<v Speaker 2>the Bible believe too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an eye on top of the dome.</v>

1664
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:52.170
<v Speaker 2>There was water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While obviously it's like a range,</v>

1665
01:29:52.171 --> 01:29:53.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does the water come from?</v>

1666
01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:58.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's water around the dome and then </v>

1667
01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.910
<v Speaker 2>there's land that's the disk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then underneath that there's water.</v>

1668
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.280
<v Speaker 2>How do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well drill.</v>

1669
01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:03.750
<v Speaker 2>You'll hit water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1670
01:30:03.751 --> 01:30:08.751
<v Speaker 2>it's under the earth obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise how would you hit the </v>

1671
01:30:08.751 --> 01:30:08.751
<v Speaker 2>water and then what's under that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This freshwater.</v>

1672
01:30:08.751 --> 01:30:09.990
<v Speaker 2>And then what's under that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1673
01:30:10.110 --> 01:30:12.360
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the edge of the disc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hit the ocean.</v>

1674
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:17.600
<v Speaker 2>It's sold water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a dome with water outside of it.</v>

1675
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:20.880
<v Speaker 2>And then it's a desk that the dome sits </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1676
01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:22.860
<v Speaker 2>And then underneath that there's fresh </v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

1677
01:30:22.861 --> 01:30:27.861
<v Speaker 2>and then underneath that there's sold </v>
<v Speaker 2>water and that was roughly the </v>

1678
01:30:27.861 --> 01:30:27.861
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see,</v>

1679
01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:31.980
<v Speaker 2>you see that's a mix of observation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination,</v>

1680
01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that isn't the world,</v>

1681
01:30:33.991 --> 01:30:36.570
<v Speaker 2>but it is the way the world appears.</v>

1682
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:41.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfectly believable cosmology </v>
<v Speaker 2>from and the sunrises and sunsets on </v>

1683
01:30:43.621 --> 01:30:48.621
<v Speaker 2>that dome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the thing is bloody well </v>

1684
01:30:48.621 --> 01:30:48.621
<v Speaker 2>spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would ever think that out?</v>

1685
01:30:48.621 --> 01:30:51.480
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously the sun comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes down and then travels underneath</v>

1686
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:56.510
<v Speaker 2>the world and comes back up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing more self evident than </v>

1687
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.940
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

1688
01:30:57.230 --> 01:31:00.930
<v Speaker 2>that's that strange intermingling of </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective fantasy,</v>

1689
01:31:00.931 --> 01:31:05.931
<v Speaker 2>let's say right at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception and actual observable </v>

1690
01:31:05.931 --> 01:31:09.291
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of the cosmology that's </v>

1691
01:31:09.291 --> 01:31:10.020
<v Speaker 2>associated with the biblical stories is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly like that.</v>

1692
01:31:10.021 --> 01:31:14.970
<v Speaker 2>It's half psychology in half and half </v>
<v Speaker 2>and half reality.</v>

1693
01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Although the psychological is real as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1694
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:22.770
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that an end to know that the biblical</v>

1695
01:31:22.771 --> 01:31:25.710
<v Speaker 2>stories have a phenomenal logical truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>is really worth knowing.</v>

1696
01:31:25.711 --> 01:31:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poor fundamentalists,</v>

1697
01:31:29.521 --> 01:31:32.930
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to claim to their moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and you know,</v>

1698
01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I understand why because it does </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize their societies and organizes </v>

1699
01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.390
<v Speaker 2>their psyche so they've got something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cling to,</v>

1700
01:31:39.391 --> 01:31:44.391
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a very sophisticated </v>

1701
01:31:44.391 --> 01:31:47.481
<v Speaker 2>idea of the complexity of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes truth and they try to </v>

1702
01:31:47.481 --> 01:31:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Gerrymander the biblical stories into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the domain of scientific theory.</v>

1703
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:52.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating,</v>

1704
01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.070
<v Speaker 2>promoting creationism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1705
01:31:56.071 --> 01:31:58.430
<v Speaker 2>has an alternative scientific theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this,</v>

1706
01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.700
<v Speaker 2>just that just isn't gonna go anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1707
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:05.940
<v Speaker 2>because the people who wrote these damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories weren't scientists to begin </v>

1708
01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:07.060
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There weren't any scientists back then.</v>

1709
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:10.030
<v Speaker 2>There's hardly any scientists now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1710
01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:11.080
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1711
01:32:11.081 --> 01:32:12.940
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to think scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1712
01:32:12.941 --> 01:32:17.941
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot of training and even </v>

1713
01:32:17.941 --> 01:32:20.131
<v Speaker 2>scientists don't think scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get the boat of the lab and </v>

1714
01:32:20.131 --> 01:32:20.590
<v Speaker 2>hardly even when they're in the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1715
01:32:20.591 --> 01:32:25.591
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get peer reviewed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticized and it gets hard to think </v>

1716
01:32:25.591 --> 01:32:26.290
<v Speaker 2>scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in however,</v>

1717
01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:29.290
<v Speaker 2>the people who wrote these stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it was more like dramatists,</v>

1718
01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:34.291
<v Speaker 2>think more like Shakespeare thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that there isn't </v>

1719
01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:37.860
<v Speaker 2>truth in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just means that you have to be a </v>

1720
01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:38.590
<v Speaker 2>little bit more sophisticated about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas of truth and that's okay.</v>

1721
01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:41.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are truth to live by,</v>

1722
01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:43.060
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well fine.</v>

1723
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:48.061
<v Speaker 2>Then we want to figure out what those </v>
<v Speaker 2>are because we need to live then maybe </v>

1724
01:32:48.061 --> 01:32:48.061
<v Speaker 2>not to suffer so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1725
01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:49.540
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so.</v>

1726
01:32:49.541 --> 01:32:54.541
<v Speaker 2>If you know that what the Bible stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stories in general are trying to </v>

1727
01:32:54.541 --> 01:32:57.700
<v Speaker 2>represent is the lived experience of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious individuals,</v>

1728
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.300
<v Speaker 2>like the structure of the lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of conscious individuals,</v>

1729
01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:06.020
<v Speaker 2>then that opens up the possibility of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole different realm of understanding,</v>

1730
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:11.020
<v Speaker 2>eliminates the contradiction that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>painful for people between the objective</v>

1731
01:33:11.021 --> 01:33:16.021
<v Speaker 2>world and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's say the claims of religious </v>

1732
01:33:16.021 --> 01:33:16.021
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1733
01:33:16.021 --> 01:33:16.870
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1734
01:33:16.871 --> 01:33:17.890
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1735
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:20.290
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look at the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book itself.</v>

1736
01:33:20.710 --> 01:33:25.710
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing about the Bible is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a comedy and a comedy has a </v>

1737
01:33:25.710 --> 01:33:26.620
<v Speaker 2>happy ending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1738
01:33:26.621 --> 01:33:31.621
<v Speaker 2>So that's a strange thing because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek God stories were almost always </v>

1739
01:33:31.621 --> 01:33:31.621
<v Speaker 2>tragic.</v>

1740
01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Now the Bible is a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a happy ending.</v>

1741
01:33:34.961 --> 01:33:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Everyone lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a habit.</v>

1742
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:41.110
<v Speaker 2>So now what you think about that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different issue.</v>

1743
01:33:41.111 --> 01:33:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm just telling you the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story.</v>

1744
01:33:43.061 --> 01:33:48.061
<v Speaker 2>It's something like there was paradise </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of time and then some </v>

1745
01:33:48.061 --> 01:33:52.231
<v Speaker 2>cataclysmic occurred and people fell </v>
<v Speaker 2>into history and history is limitation </v>

1746
01:33:52.231 --> 01:33:54.070
<v Speaker 2>and mortality and suffering and self </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

1747
01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:59.340
<v Speaker 2>but there's a mode of being or </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially the establishment of the </v>

1748
01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 2>state that will transcend that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what time is aiming at.</v>

1749
01:34:02.410 --> 01:34:04.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea of the story.</v>

1750
01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:09.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny thing that the Bible has </v>

1751
01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:10.630
<v Speaker 2>this story because it wasn't written as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a book,</v>

1752
01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:15.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was assembled from a whole bunch of </v>

1753
01:34:15.690 --> 01:34:17.881
<v Speaker 2>different books and the fact that it got</v>
<v Speaker 2>assembled into something resembling a </v>

1754
01:34:17.881 --> 01:34:19.060
<v Speaker 2>story is quite remarkable.</v>

1755
01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 2>And what the question is then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1756
01:34:22.961 --> 01:34:26.620
<v Speaker 2>what is that story about and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how did it come up as a story?</v>

1757
01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:28.750
<v Speaker 2>And then I suppose as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anything to it?</v>

1758
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:34.110
<v Speaker 2>It constitutes a dramatic record of self</v>
<v Speaker 2>realization or obstruction already </v>

1759
01:34:34.110 --> 01:34:36.070
<v Speaker 2>mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is like the idea,</v>

1760
01:34:36.071 --> 01:34:38.590
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the formulation of the,</v>

1761
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:41.380
<v Speaker 2>let's say the image of God is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction.</v>

1762
01:34:41.381 --> 01:34:43.000
<v Speaker 2>That's how we're gonna handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To begin with.</v>

1763
01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:48.600
<v Speaker 2>I want to say though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I said I wasn't going to be any </v>

1764
01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.481
<v Speaker 2>more reductionist than necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that the evidence for genuine </v>

1765
01:34:53.441 --> 01:34:56.200
<v Speaker 2>religious experience is </v>
<v Speaker 2>incontrovertible,</v>

1766
01:34:56.530 --> 01:35:00.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's not explicable and so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to explain it away.</v>

1767
01:35:00.081 --> 01:35:05.081
<v Speaker 2>I want to just leave it as a fact and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I want to pull back from that and </v>

1768
01:35:05.081 --> 01:35:05.081
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1769
01:35:05.081 --> 01:35:08.540
<v Speaker 2>well we'll leave that as a fact and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery and what we'll look at this.</v>

1770
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:13.600
<v Speaker 2>We're going to look at this from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational perspective and say that the </v>

1771
01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:16.400
<v Speaker 2>initial formulation of the idea of God </v>
<v Speaker 2>was an attempt to abstract out the ideal</v>

1772
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:21.590
<v Speaker 2>and to do consider it as a abstraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside its instantiation,</v>

1773
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:23.960
<v Speaker 2>so and that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

1774
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:25.730
<v Speaker 2>That's an amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's true,</v>

1775
01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:26.850
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to</v>

1776
01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:33.480
<v Speaker 2>throw out the baby with the bath water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's a collection of books </v>

1777
01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:35.190
<v Speaker 2>with multiple redactors and editors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>

1778
01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Many people wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's many different books even and </v>

1779
01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:44.401
<v Speaker 2>they're interwoven together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the first five books by </v>

1780
01:35:44.401 --> 01:35:47.881
<v Speaker 2>people who I suspect took the traditions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of tribes that had been brought together</v>

1781
01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:56.340
<v Speaker 2>under a single political organization </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tried to make their accounts </v>

1782
01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:00.721
<v Speaker 2>coherent and so it took a little of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they took a little of that and they </v>

1783
01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:05.281
<v Speaker 2>took a little of this and they and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried not to lose anything because it </v>

1784
01:36:05.281 --> 01:36:07.120
<v Speaker 2>seemed valuable or it was certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable to the people who had collected</v>

1785
01:36:07.121 --> 01:36:08.150
<v Speaker 2>the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't gonna,</v>

1786
01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerate too much editing,</v>

1787
01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:14.230
<v Speaker 2>but they also wanted it to make sense to</v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree.</v>

1788
01:36:14.231 --> 01:36:17.410
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't completely logically </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradictory and,</v>

1789
01:36:17.670 --> 01:36:18.400
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1790
01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:23.490
<v Speaker 2>and completely absurd and so many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote it and many people edited and many</v>

1791
01:36:25.031 --> 01:36:28.180
<v Speaker 2>people assembled it over a vast stretch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>

1792
01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:30.700
<v Speaker 2>And we have very few documents like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1793
01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:35.701
<v Speaker 2>And so just because we have a document </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is sufficient reason to to </v>

1794
01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:41.090
<v Speaker 2>look at it as a remarkable phenomena and</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to understand what it is that it's </v>

1795
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:42.550
<v Speaker 2>trying to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

1796
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.670
<v Speaker 2>And then I said it's also the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>first hyperlink text,</v>

1797
01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:47.610
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that again,</v>

1798
01:36:47.770 --> 01:36:50.140
<v Speaker 2>very much we're thinking about for quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time.</v>

1799
01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.920
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's four sources</v>

1800
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:59.850
<v Speaker 2>in the old testament or the Hebrew Bible</v>
<v Speaker 2>for stories that we know came together.</v>

1801
01:36:59.910 --> 01:37:02.880
<v Speaker 2>One was called the priestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a source called the priestly,</v>

1802
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:08.030
<v Speaker 2>and he used the name below him or El </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shaddai for God and I believe Al is the </v>

1803
01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:13.400
<v Speaker 2>root word for Ela as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and that's usually translated as God </v>

1804
01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:19.161
<v Speaker 2>or gods because below him is is utilized</v>
<v Speaker 2>as plural in the beginning books of the </v>

1805
01:37:20.490 --> 01:37:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Bible and it's newer than a yard was </v>
<v Speaker 2>version.</v>

1806
01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Now the reason I'm telling you that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because genesis one,</v>

1807
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:30.420
<v Speaker 2>which is the first story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't as old as genesis two.</v>

1808
01:37:30.421 --> 01:37:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Genesis contains the yard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fruit,</v>

1809
01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.100
<v Speaker 2>contains the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1810
01:37:35.101 --> 01:37:40.101
<v Speaker 2>of Adam and eve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's older than the very first </v>

1811
01:37:40.101 --> 01:37:42.921
<v Speaker 2>book in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they decided to put a newer version </v>

1812
01:37:42.921 --> 01:37:46.251
<v Speaker 2>first and what isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's because it deals with </v>

1813
01:37:46.251 --> 01:37:46.680
<v Speaker 2>more fundamental abstractions.</v>

1814
01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:51.680
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it deals with the most basic </v>

1815
01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.201
<v Speaker 2>of abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the universe was created and then </v>

1816
01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:57.980
<v Speaker 2>segues into what the human is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that seems to be the logic behind</v>

1817
01:37:58.351 --> 01:38:02.820
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The yard was version uses the name,</v>

1818
01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.320
<v Speaker 2>why h,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two h,</v>

1819
01:38:04.321 --> 01:38:07.290
<v Speaker 2>which apparently people didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we believe was pronounced,</v>

1820
01:38:07.291 --> 01:38:08.990
<v Speaker 2>something like Yahuah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1821
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:13.170
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a strongly anthropomorphic God.</v>

1822
01:38:13.171 --> 01:38:16.500
<v Speaker 2>So one that takes human form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It begins with genesis two,</v>

1823
01:38:16.501 --> 01:38:21.501
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the account of the heavens and </v>

1824
01:38:21.501 --> 01:38:23.661
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wind and contains the story of Adam and </v>

1825
01:38:23.661 --> 01:38:26.301
<v Speaker 2>Eve and Cain and Abel and Noah and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tower of Babel in exodus and numbers </v>

1826
01:38:26.301 --> 01:38:29.990
<v Speaker 2>alone with priestly version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also contains the law in the form,</v>

1827
01:38:29.991 --> 01:38:34.310
<v Speaker 2>just the form of the 10 commandments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a truncated form of the,</v>

1828
01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.210
<v Speaker 2>of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's</v>

1829
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.810
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

1830
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Elo has a source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it contains the stories of Abraham and </v>

1831
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Isaac it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's concerned with a heavenly hierarchy</v>

1832
01:38:45.471 --> 01:38:48.680
<v Speaker 2>that includes angels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It talks about the departure from Egypt,</v>

1833
01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.140
<v Speaker 2>and it presents the Covenant Code,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this idea of,</v>

1834
01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:54.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that society is predicated.</v>

1835
01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:57.440
<v Speaker 2>This was Israeli society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was predicated on a covenant with God</v>

1836
01:38:57.650 --> 01:38:59.660
<v Speaker 2>and that's laid out in a sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules,</v>

1837
01:38:59.661 --> 01:39:04.661
<v Speaker 2>some of which are the 10 commandments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many of which are much more </v>

1838
01:39:04.661 --> 01:39:07.841
<v Speaker 2>extensive than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the final one is the </v>

1839
01:39:07.841 --> 01:39:10.751
<v Speaker 2>deuteronomistic code and it contains the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bulk of the law and the what's called </v>

1840
01:39:10.881 --> 01:39:14.090
<v Speaker 2>the Deuterenomic history and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent of Genesis,</v>

1841
01:39:14.091 --> 01:39:15.320
<v Speaker 2>exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leviticus,</v>

1842
01:39:15.490 --> 01:39:20.490
<v Speaker 2>and numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we know that at least for now </v>

1843
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:21.620
<v Speaker 2>there's debate about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there is about everything you know,</v>

1844
01:39:21.621 --> 01:39:24.650
<v Speaker 2>so I'm brushing over a very large area </v>
<v Speaker 2>of scholarship,</v>

1845
01:39:24.651 --> 01:39:29.651
<v Speaker 2>but people generally assume that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were multiple authors over multiple </v>

1846
01:39:29.721 --> 01:39:32.450
<v Speaker 2>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way they've concluded that is by</v>

1847
01:39:32.451 --> 01:39:34.390
<v Speaker 2>looking at textual analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1848
01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:39.700
<v Speaker 2>trying to see where there are chunks of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stories that have the same kind of </v>

1849
01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:43.991
<v Speaker 2>style or the same reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People argue about that because you </v>

1850
01:39:43.991 --> 01:39:47.951
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's difficult to recreate </v>

1851
01:39:47.951 --> 01:39:47.951
<v Speaker 2>something ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

1852
01:39:47.951 --> 01:39:52.690
<v Speaker 2>that's the basic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is an amalgam of viewpoints about </v>

1853
01:39:52.701 --> 01:39:55.370
<v Speaker 2>these initial issues and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's important to know.</v>

1854
01:39:55.490 --> 01:40:00.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a collective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a collective story and uh,</v>

1855
01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:06.880
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now to understand the first part of </v>

1856
01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.641
<v Speaker 2>Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to turn strangely enough to</v>

1857
01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:18.780
<v Speaker 2>something that's actually part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Testament and this is a central </v>

1858
01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:22.560
<v Speaker 2>element of Christianity and it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange idea and it's going to take a </v>

1859
01:40:22.631 --> 01:40:25.570
<v Speaker 2>very long time to unpack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea,</v>

1860
01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:30.010
<v Speaker 2>this is what John said about Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said in the beginning was the word.</v>

1861
01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:35.100
<v Speaker 2>And so that relates back to genesis one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the beginning was the word and the </v>

1862
01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.870
<v Speaker 2>word was with God and the word was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have some.</v>

1863
01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1864
01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.430
<v Speaker 2>three sentences like that take a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpacking because,</v>

1865
01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:47.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that seems to make any sense </v>

1866
01:40:47.630 --> 01:40:47.630
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1867
01:40:47.630 --> 01:40:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the beginning was the word and the </v>

1868
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.801
<v Speaker 2>word was with God and the word was God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first question might be what in </v>

1869
01:40:52.901 --> 01:40:57.901
<v Speaker 2>the does that mean in the beginning was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word that's the logos actually on </v>

1870
01:40:58.271 --> 01:41:00.640
<v Speaker 2>the logos is embodied in the figure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

1871
01:41:00.641 --> 01:41:03.430
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea in John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever Christ is,</v>

1872
01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:07.000
<v Speaker 2>the son of God is not only instantiated </v>
<v Speaker 2>in history,</v>

1873
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:11.200
<v Speaker 2>say at a particular time and place as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a carpenter in some backwoods part of</v>

1874
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:16.201
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also something eternal that exists </v>

1875
01:41:16.201 --> 01:41:19.890
<v Speaker 2>outside of time and space that was there</v>
<v Speaker 2>right at the beginning and as far as I </v>

1876
01:41:19.890 --> 01:41:21.280
<v Speaker 2>can tell what that logo represents.</v>

1877
01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:26.280
<v Speaker 2>It's something like modern people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like what modern people </v>

1878
01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.190
<v Speaker 2>refer to when they talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

1879
01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:29.350
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more than that.</v>

1880
01:41:29.351 --> 01:41:34.351
<v Speaker 2>It's like consciousness and its capacity</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to be aware and its capacity to </v>

1881
01:41:34.351 --> 01:41:39.271
<v Speaker 2>communicate if something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's an ID underneath that which </v>

1882
01:41:39.271 --> 01:41:41.350
<v Speaker 2>is that being especially from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal logical perspective.</v>

1883
01:41:41.351 --> 01:41:45.280
<v Speaker 2>So the being that is experienced cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist without consciousness.</v>

1884
01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:50.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like consciousness shines a light </v>
<v Speaker 2>on things to bring it into being because</v>

1885
01:41:50.411 --> 01:41:54.910
<v Speaker 2>without consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is there no one experiences.</v>

1886
01:41:54.911 --> 01:41:59.911
<v Speaker 2>Anything is like is there a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anything when no one </v>

1887
01:41:59.911 --> 01:42:03.211
<v Speaker 2>experiences anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the question and the answer that </v>

1888
01:42:03.211 --> 01:42:05.740
<v Speaker 2>this book is presenting is that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to think about consciousness as</v>

1889
01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:11.100
<v Speaker 2>a constituent element of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's necessary for </v>

1890
01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.700
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It extends itself to exist.</v>

1891
01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Now of course it depends on what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean by reality,</v>

1892
01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.640
<v Speaker 2>but the reality that's being referred to</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1893
01:42:18.641 --> 01:42:22.470
<v Speaker 2>I told you already is this strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>amalgam of the subjective experience and</v>

1894
01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:24.910
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the question is deeper than that too</v>

1895
01:42:24.911 --> 01:42:28.480
<v Speaker 2>because it is by no means obvious what </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

1896
01:42:28.570 --> 01:42:33.570
<v Speaker 2>If there's no one to experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole notion of time itself </v>

1897
01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:37.771
<v Speaker 2>seems to collapse at least in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like felt duration and then </v>

1898
01:42:37.771 --> 01:42:42.420
<v Speaker 2>the notion of size disappears </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially because there's nothing to </v>

1899
01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:46.651
<v Speaker 2>scale it and the causality seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>vanish and so and and we don't </v>

1900
01:42:47.471 --> 01:42:50.080
<v Speaker 2>understand consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In the least.</v>

1901
01:42:50.590 --> 01:42:53.200
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand what it is that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in us.</v>

1902
01:42:53.201 --> 01:42:57.580
<v Speaker 2>That gives illumination to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens in the Old Testament,</v>

1903
01:42:57.581 --> 01:43:00.790
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that that consciousness is associated</v>

1904
01:43:00.791 --> 01:43:03.310
<v Speaker 2>with the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you think,</v>

1905
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:08.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a reasonable proposition and </v>

1906
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:12.361
<v Speaker 2>that's a very complicated question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least we might know that there's </v>

1907
01:43:12.361 --> 01:43:15.870
<v Speaker 2>something to the claim because there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a miracle of experience and existence </v>

1908
01:43:16.781 --> 01:43:21.781
<v Speaker 2>that's dependent on consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people try to explain it away </v>

1909
01:43:21.781 --> 01:43:25.050
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem to work very well </v>

1910
01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:25.050
<v Speaker 2>and here's something else to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1911
01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really worth thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1912
01:43:26.770 --> 01:43:30.130
<v Speaker 2>People do not like it when you treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>them like they're not conscious,</v>

1913
01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:35.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They react very badly to that and then </v>

1914
01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:39.540
<v Speaker 2>you don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone assumes that you're not </v>

1915
01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:41.671
<v Speaker 2>conscious and you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone assumes that you don't have </v>

1916
01:43:41.671 --> 01:43:44.470
<v Speaker 2>freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that you're just absolutely </v>

1917
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:47.191
<v Speaker 2>determined in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your actions and there's nothing </v>

1918
01:43:47.191 --> 01:43:50.371
<v Speaker 2>that's going to repair you and that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't need to have any responsibility </v>

1919
01:43:50.371 --> 01:43:51.190
<v Speaker 2>for your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like our culture,</v>

1920
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:54.020
<v Speaker 2>the laws of our culture are predicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the idea.</v>

1921
01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Something like people are conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have experienced people make </v>

1922
01:43:59.170 --> 01:44:00.890
<v Speaker 2>decisions and can be held responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>

1923
01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:06.040
<v Speaker 2>That there's a freewill element to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can debate all that </v>

1924
01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.611
<v Speaker 2>philosophically and fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is is that that is how we </v>

1925
01:44:09.611 --> 01:44:13.631
<v Speaker 2>act and that is the idea that our legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is predicated on and there's </v>

1926
01:44:13.631 --> 01:44:17.861
<v Speaker 2>something deep about it because you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're subject to the law,</v>

1927
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:24.010
<v Speaker 2>but the law is also limited by you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that in a well </v>

1928
01:44:24.531 --> 01:44:28.070
<v Speaker 2>functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly grounded democratic system,</v>

1929
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:31.670
<v Speaker 2>you have intrinsic value.</v>

1930
01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the source of your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're a murderer,</v>

1931
01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:41.080
<v Speaker 2>we have to say the law can only go so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far because there's something about you </v>

1932
01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.200
<v Speaker 2>that's divine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

1933
01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:43.370
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1934
01:44:43.371 --> 01:44:48.371
<v Speaker 2>partly it means that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you that's conscious and capable </v>

1935
01:44:48.371 --> 01:44:51.941
<v Speaker 2>of communicating like your whole world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and unto yourself and you have that to </v>

1936
01:44:51.941 --> 01:44:56.381
<v Speaker 2>contribute to everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's valuable mean that you can </v>

1937
01:44:56.381 --> 01:45:00.191
<v Speaker 2>learn new things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can transform the structure of </v>

1938
01:45:00.191 --> 01:45:00.191
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can invent a new way of dealing with</v>

1939
01:45:00.191 --> 01:45:02.110
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're capable of old,</v>

1940
01:45:02.111 --> 01:45:05.810
<v Speaker 2>that it's an intrinsic part of you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with this.</v>

1941
01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.800
<v Speaker 2>It's associated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea there is that there's </v>

1942
01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:14.710
<v Speaker 2>something about the logos that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary for the absolute chaos of the </v>

1943
01:45:17.241 --> 01:45:21.020
<v Speaker 2>reality beyond experience to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself as reality.</v>

1944
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:26.590
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing idea because it gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness a constitute of role in </v>

1945
01:45:26.661 --> 01:45:30.020
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos and you can debate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know it's not.</v>

1946
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:34.490
<v Speaker 2>You can't just bloody well brush it off </v>
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>

1947
01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:38.000
<v Speaker 2>we are the most complicated things there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are that we know of by,</v>

1948
01:45:38.150 --> 01:45:39.440
<v Speaker 2>by a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

1949
01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:43.010
<v Speaker 2>by a massive amount were so complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's unbelievable.</v>

1950
01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.570
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1951
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:48.410
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of cosmos out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of cosmos in here too.</v>

1952
01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:52.910
<v Speaker 2>And which one is greater is by no means </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious unless you use something trivial</v>

1953
01:45:52.911 --> 01:45:57.911
<v Speaker 2>like relative size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know really isn't a very </v>

1954
01:45:57.911 --> 01:46:00.521
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated approach and whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that is you has this capacity to </v>

1955
01:46:00.801 --> 01:46:05.000
<v Speaker 2>experience reality and to transform it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very strange thing.</v>

1956
01:46:05.001 --> 01:46:10.001
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can conceptualize a future in your </v>

1957
01:46:10.001 --> 01:46:11.720
<v Speaker 2>imagination and then you can work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make that manifest.</v>

1958
01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:14.420
<v Speaker 2>You participate in the process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation.</v>

1959
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:19.570
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I think in genesis </v>

1960
01:46:19.570 --> 01:46:20.190
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it re,</v>

1961
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:25.550
<v Speaker 2>it relates to the idea that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>are made in the image of the divine men </v>

1962
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:26.450
<v Speaker 2>and women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is interesting too,</v>

1963
01:46:26.451 --> 01:46:31.451
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminists are always criticizing </v>

1964
01:46:31.451 --> 01:46:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1965
01:46:31.881 --> 01:46:36.881
<v Speaker 2>as being what inexorably patriarchal or </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they criticize everything like that.</v>

1966
01:46:38.361 --> 01:46:39.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hardly a stroke,</v>

1967
01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:44.771
<v Speaker 2>a bloody brilliance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's an absolute miracle </v>

1968
01:46:44.771 --> 01:46:48.731
<v Speaker 2>that right at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>document it says straightforwardly like </v>

1969
01:46:48.731 --> 01:46:52.630
<v Speaker 2>with no hesitation whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the divine spark which were associated </v>

1970
01:46:52.630 --> 01:46:57.411
<v Speaker 2>with the word that brings forth being is</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest in men and women equally.</v>

1971
01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:00.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a very cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta think,</v>

1972
01:47:00.841 --> 01:47:01.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1973
01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:03.900
<v Speaker 2>they actually take that seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1974
01:47:03.901 --> 01:47:07.290
<v Speaker 2>what you got to ask is what happens if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't take it seriously,</v>

1975
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:09.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's reading,</v>

1976
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:13.800
<v Speaker 2>read Dostoyevsky's crime and punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best,</v>

1977
01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:20.240
<v Speaker 2>the best investigation of that tactic </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever been produced.</v>

1978
01:47:20.251 --> 01:47:25.251
<v Speaker 2>Because what happens in Dostoyevsky's </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime and punishment is that the main </v>

1979
01:47:25.251 --> 01:47:29.631
<v Speaker 2>character whose name is [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>cough decides that there's no intrinsic </v>

1980
01:47:29.631 --> 01:47:31.050
<v Speaker 2>value to other people and that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>

1981
01:47:31.051 --> 01:47:36.051
<v Speaker 2>he can do whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only cowardice that stops him from </v>

1982
01:47:36.051 --> 01:47:36.051
<v Speaker 2>acting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1983
01:47:36.051 --> 01:47:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Because why would it be anything else if</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>

1984
01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:41.970
<v Speaker 2>if the value of other people is just an </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary superstition,</v>

1985
01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:44.700
<v Speaker 2>then why can't I do exactly what I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I want,</v>

1986
01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:47.380
<v Speaker 2>which is the psychopaths viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1987
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.850
<v Speaker 2>so regarding the cough does he killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's a very horrible person and</v>

1988
01:47:50.851 --> 01:47:55.851
<v Speaker 2>he has very good reasons for killing her</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's half starved and a little bit </v>

1989
01:47:55.851 --> 01:47:57.420
<v Speaker 2>insane and possessed by this ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliant,</v>

1990
01:47:57.421 --> 01:48:01.050
<v Speaker 2>brilliant layout and he finds out </v>
<v Speaker 2>something after he kills her,</v>

1991
01:48:01.051 --> 01:48:03.900
<v Speaker 2>which is that the post killing Roscoe </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the carbon,</v>

1992
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:08.910
<v Speaker 2>the pre killing risk walnut cove are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same person even a little bit </v>

1993
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:13.370
<v Speaker 2>because he's broken a rule like he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>broken and serious rule and there's no </v>

1994
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:14.530
<v Speaker 2>going back and crime and punishment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1995
01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:19.560
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the best investigation I know of of </v>

1996
01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:19.560
<v Speaker 2>what happens.</v>

1997
01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.990
<v Speaker 2>If you take the notion that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing defined about the individual,</v>

1998
01:48:22.050 --> 01:48:24.270
<v Speaker 2>seriously now you.</v>

1999
01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:29.530
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the people I know who are deeply</v>

2000
01:48:29.531 --> 01:48:32.650
<v Speaker 2>atheistic and I understand why they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply atheistic,</v>

2001
01:48:32.651 --> 01:48:35.620
<v Speaker 2>they haven't contended with people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky,</v>

2002
01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:40.740
<v Speaker 2>not as far as I can tell because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>see logical flaws in crime and </v>

2003
01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:44.551
<v Speaker 2>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got the psychology exactly </v>

2004
01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:46.750
<v Speaker 2>right and he Dostoyevsky's amazing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because in one of his books,</v>

2005
01:48:46.751 --> 01:48:48.070
<v Speaker 2>the devil's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2006
01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:53.400
<v Speaker 2>he describes a political scene scenario </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not much different than the one </v>

2007
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.151
<v Speaker 2>we find yourself in now and there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people who are possessed by </v>

2008
01:48:57.151 --> 01:48:59.660
<v Speaker 2>rationalistic utopian atheistic ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're very powerful.</v>

2009
01:48:59.830 --> 01:49:01.840
<v Speaker 2>They give rise to the communist </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution,</v>

2010
01:49:01.841 --> 01:49:02.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2011
01:49:02.351 --> 01:49:07.351
<v Speaker 2>they're powerful ideas and his character</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stavenhagen also acts out the the,</v>

2012
01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:14.100
<v Speaker 2>the presupposition that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no intrinsic nature and no </v>

2013
01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.491
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic value and it's Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other brilliant investigation and </v>

2014
01:49:17.491 --> 01:49:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky prophesies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I would say.</v>

2015
01:49:20.050 --> 01:49:24.370
<v Speaker 2>What will happen to a society if it goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>down that road and he was dead.</v>

2016
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Exactly accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's uncanny to read Dostoyevsky's,</v>

2017
01:49:28.481 --> 01:49:31.030
<v Speaker 2>the Pisaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the devil's depending on the translation</v>

2018
01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:35.770
<v Speaker 2>and then to read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gulag archipelago because one is fiction</v>

2019
01:49:35.771 --> 01:49:38.200
<v Speaker 2>and prophecy and the second is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>

2020
01:49:38.201 --> 01:49:43.201
<v Speaker 2>it turned out exactly the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky said it would for exactly </v>

2021
01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:44.050
<v Speaker 2>the same reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's quite remarkable.</v>

2022
01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>So well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is do you seriously with</v>

2023
01:49:48.071 --> 01:49:53.071
<v Speaker 2>the idea that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something can't cosmically </v>

2024
01:49:53.071 --> 01:49:55.920
<v Speaker 2>constitutive about consciousness and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2025
01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.720
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might well be considered divine and</v>

2026
01:49:58.721 --> 01:50:03.721
<v Speaker 2>see that that is instantiated in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and then ask yourself if you're </v>

2027
01:50:03.821 --> 01:50:08.821
<v Speaker 2>not a criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't act it out and then ask </v>

2028
01:50:08.821 --> 01:50:11.830
<v Speaker 2>yourself what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that reflective of a reality or is it</v>

2029
01:50:11.831 --> 01:50:16.831
<v Speaker 2>a metaphor like maybe it's a metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex metaphor that we have to use to </v>

2030
01:50:16.831 --> 01:50:20.050
<v Speaker 2>organize her societies could well be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even as a metaphor,</v>

2031
01:50:20.051 --> 01:50:23.500
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true enough so that we mess with it</v>

2032
01:50:23.501 --> 01:50:27.280
<v Speaker 2>at our peril and it also took people a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very long time to figure out.</v>

2033
01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:32.440
<v Speaker 2>This is genesis one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

2034
01:50:32.441 --> 01:50:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably going to stop there because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's 9:30</v>

2035
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:38.480
<v Speaker 2>and so we didn't even get to the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

2036
01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2037
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I want to read you a couple of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we'll use as a pro drama for the </v>

2038
01:50:58.090 --> 01:50:59.870
<v Speaker 2>next lecture because our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just bounce through a collection of</v>

2039
01:50:59.871 --> 01:51:02.600
<v Speaker 2>ideas that's associated with the notion </v>
<v Speaker 2>of divinity.</v>

2040
01:51:02.601 --> 01:51:07.601
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll turn back to the first </v>

2041
01:51:07.601 --> 01:51:10.150
<v Speaker 2>lines when we start the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how far I'm going to get </v>

2042
01:51:10.150 --> 01:51:12.440
<v Speaker 2>through the biblical stories by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm trying to figure this out as</v>

2043
01:51:12.441 --> 01:51:13.550
<v Speaker 2>I go along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2044
01:51:13.551 --> 01:51:17.100
<v Speaker 2>So you know there's an idea in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity that God,</v>

2045
01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:20.910
<v Speaker 2>that the image of God is a trinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2046
01:51:20.911 --> 01:51:25.911
<v Speaker 2>There's the father is the father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the element of the sun and </v>

2047
01:51:25.911 --> 01:51:27.770
<v Speaker 2>there's the element of the Holy Spirit </v>
<v Speaker 2>is something like tradition,</v>

2048
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:32.890
<v Speaker 2>the spirit of tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like the human being as </v>

2049
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:34.970
<v Speaker 2>the newest incarnation of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition,</v>

2050
01:51:34.971 --> 01:51:39.971
<v Speaker 2>like the living incarnation of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition and then then it's something </v>

2051
01:51:39.971 --> 01:51:44.051
<v Speaker 2>like the spirit in people that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with this and this </v>

2052
01:51:44.271 --> 01:51:46.040
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spirit and individuals,</v>

2053
01:51:46.041 --> 01:51:51.041
<v Speaker 2>and so I'm going to bounce my way </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly through some of the classical </v>

2054
01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:56.270
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical attributes of God so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we kind of have a cloud of notions about</v>

2055
01:51:56.271 --> 01:52:01.271
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>returned to genesis one and talk about </v>

2056
01:52:01.271 --> 01:52:04.961
<v Speaker 2>the God who spoke can you into to be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fatherly aspect.</v>

2057
01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:12.040
<v Speaker 2>So here's what God as a father is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can enter into a covenant with it so</v>

2058
01:52:12.381 --> 01:52:15.080
<v Speaker 2>you can make a bargain with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you think about that.</v>

2059
01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Money is like that because money is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bargain you make with the future.</v>

2060
01:52:19.670 --> 01:52:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we structured our world so that </v>

2061
01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:27.011
<v Speaker 2>you can negotiate with the future and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think that we would have gone to </v>

2062
01:52:27.011 --> 01:52:30.440
<v Speaker 2>the point where we could do that without</v>
<v Speaker 2>having this idea to begin with.</v>

2063
01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:35.800
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can act as if the future is a </v>

2064
01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:37.971
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a spirit of tradition that </v>

2065
01:52:37.971 --> 01:52:38.300
<v Speaker 2>enables you to act as if the future is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that can be bargained with.</v>

2066
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:40.940
<v Speaker 2>That's why you make sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2067
01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:45.080
<v Speaker 2>and the sacrifices were acted out for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very long period of time and now they're</v>

2068
01:52:45.090 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 2>psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that you can sacrifice something</v>

2069
01:52:48.111 --> 01:52:53.111
<v Speaker 2>valuable in the present and expect that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're negotiating with something that </v>

2070
01:52:53.111 --> 01:52:55.730
<v Speaker 2>represents the transcendent future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a map.</v>

2071
01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Amazing human discovery like no other </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature can do that,</v>

2072
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:04.270
<v Speaker 2>to act as if the future is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know that you can bargain with </v>

2073
01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:05.720
<v Speaker 2>reality itself and that you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>successfully.</v>

2074
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:09.110
<v Speaker 2>It's an unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It responds to sacrifice.</v>

2075
01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:14.560
<v Speaker 2>It answers prayers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that any of this is true </v>

2076
01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:18.041
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying what the what the cloud </v>

2077
01:53:18.041 --> 01:53:21.041
<v Speaker 2>of ideas represents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It punishes and rewards it judges and </v>

2078
01:53:21.041 --> 01:53:22.850
<v Speaker 2>forgives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not nature.</v>

2079
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:28.780
<v Speaker 2>You see the thing about the thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the thing that's weird about the </v>

2080
01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:31.721
<v Speaker 2>Judeo Christian tradition is that God </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nature are not the same thing at </v>

2081
01:53:31.721 --> 01:53:35.201
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever God is partially manifest in </v>

2082
01:53:35.201 --> 01:53:35.870
<v Speaker 2>this logo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that stands outside of nature,</v>

2083
01:53:35.871 --> 01:53:40.871
<v Speaker 2>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's something like </v>

2084
01:53:40.871 --> 01:53:41.330
<v Speaker 2>consciousness as abstracted from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural world,</v>

2085
01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:46.280
<v Speaker 2>so it built even for mankind and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>banished us for disobedience.</v>

2086
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:48.050
<v Speaker 2>It's too powerful to be touched.</v>

2087
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:52.850
<v Speaker 2>It granted freewill distance from it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell distance from it,</v>

2088
01:53:52.851 --> 01:53:57.851
<v Speaker 2>his death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It reveals itself in Dogma and had </v>

2089
01:53:57.851 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 2>mystical experience and it's the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's sorta like the fatherly aspect</v>

2090
01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:05.540
<v Speaker 2>and then the sun like aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It speaks chaos into order.</v>

2091
01:54:05.541 --> 01:54:08.600
<v Speaker 2>It slays dragons and feeds people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the remains.</v>

2092
01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:10.920
<v Speaker 2>It finds gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rescues virgins.</v>

2093
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:16.090
<v Speaker 2>It's the body and blood of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tragic victim and scapegoat and </v>

2094
01:54:16.090 --> 01:54:18.410
<v Speaker 2>eternally Triano Triumphant Redeemer </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>

2095
01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:21.950
<v Speaker 2>It cares for the outcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It dies and is reborn.</v>

2096
01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:24.830
<v Speaker 2>It's the king of kings and hero of </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroes.</v>

2097
01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:27.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's both.</v>

2098
01:54:27.261 --> 01:54:29.780
<v Speaker 2>It's both the fulfillment and critic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this state.</v>

2099
01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:34.310
<v Speaker 2>It dwells in the perfect house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is aiming at Paradise or heaven.</v>

2100
01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:37.760
<v Speaker 2>It can rescue from hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cares for the outcast.</v>

2101
01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:43.060
<v Speaker 2>It's the foundation stone and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cornerstone that was rejected and it's </v>

2102
01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:43.400
<v Speaker 2>the spirit of the law</v>

2103
01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:49.570
<v Speaker 2>and then its spirit like it's akin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the human soul.</v>

2104
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It's the prophetic voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the still small voice of </v>

2105
01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:56.200
<v Speaker 2>conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the spoken truth.</v>

2106
01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:00.760
<v Speaker 2>It's called forth by music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the enemy of deceit,</v>

2107
01:55:00.761 --> 01:55:02.110
<v Speaker 2>arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and resentment.</v>

2108
01:55:02.290 --> 01:55:05.650
<v Speaker 2>It's the water of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It burns without consuming,</v>

2109
01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:07.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's a blinding light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2110
01:55:07.961 --> 01:55:12.961
<v Speaker 2>so that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very well developed poetic set </v>

2111
01:55:12.961 --> 01:55:13.360
<v Speaker 2>of poetic metaphors essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2112
01:55:13.361 --> 01:55:15.070
<v Speaker 2>So these are all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

2113
01:55:15.071 --> 01:55:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Glimpses of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the transcendent ideal.</v>

2114
01:55:19.121 --> 01:55:22.750
<v Speaker 2>That's the right way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their glimpses of the transcendent ideal</v>

2115
01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:28.020
<v Speaker 2>and all of them have a specific meaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and well in part that we're going to do </v>

2116
01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:29.890
<v Speaker 2>is go over that meaning as we continue </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this,</v>

2117
01:55:30.670 --> 01:55:35.670
<v Speaker 2>with this series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what we've got now is a brief </v>

2118
01:55:36.871 --> 01:55:40.170
<v Speaker 2>description at least of what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the beginning,</v>

2119
01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:44.550
<v Speaker 2>God created the heavens and the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know it's with the logos</v>

2120
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:49.640
<v Speaker 6>in this sequence of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know it's associated with the word </v>

2121
01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.731
<v Speaker 6>end with consciousness and we know that </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's associated with whatever God is and</v>

2122
01:55:53.341 --> 01:55:58.341
<v Speaker 6>then I laid out the metaphoric landscape</v>
<v Speaker 6>that at least in part describes God and </v>

2123
01:55:58.351 --> 01:56:03.351
<v Speaker 6>so now we have some sense of the being </v>
<v Speaker 6>that does this creates the heavens and </v>

2124
01:56:03.351 --> 01:56:05.190
<v Speaker 6>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The earth was without form and void.</v>

2125
01:56:05.250 --> 01:56:10.250
<v Speaker 6>That's that chaotic state of </v>
<v Speaker 6>intermingled confusion and darkness was </v>

2126
01:56:10.250 --> 01:56:13.470
<v Speaker 6>over the face of the deep and the spirit</v>
<v Speaker 6>of God was hovering over the face of the</v>

2127
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:18.471
<v Speaker 6>waters and God said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let there be light and there was light </v>

2128
01:56:18.471 --> 01:56:23.010
<v Speaker 6>and so we'll stop with that because now </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're ready to take attendance of step </v>

2129
01:56:23.891 --> 01:56:28.891
<v Speaker 6>into the very first part of this book </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's important to have your </v>

2130
01:56:28.891 --> 01:56:33.680
<v Speaker 6>conceptual framework properly organized </v>
<v Speaker 6>so that you can appreciate where it's </v>

2131
01:56:33.871 --> 01:56:36.720
<v Speaker 6>going and what it might possibly meet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so well,</v>

2132
01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:40.020
<v Speaker 6>I've done what I can today to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What would you say,</v>

2133
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:44.140
<v Speaker 6>elaborate on this single word I suppose </v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2134
01:56:45.110 --> 01:56:46.620
<v Speaker 6>but it's a big word,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2135
01:56:46.621 --> 01:56:51.621
<v Speaker 6>so it's not so unreasonable that it </v>
<v Speaker 6>takes a long time to get to the point </v>

2136
01:56:51.621 --> 01:56:53.250
<v Speaker 6>where you have any sense of what it </v>
<v Speaker 6>means at all.</v>

2137
01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:58.890
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is nowhere near.</v>

2138
01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.500
<v Speaker 6>That is not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought I would get a lot farther.</v>

2139
01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:04.800
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So thank you.</v>

2140
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2141
01:57:26.010 --> 01:57:30.390
<v Speaker 6>So we do have time for some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have to be out of here at 10:30.</v>

2142
01:57:30.391 --> 01:57:35.391
<v Speaker 6>It's 9:30.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So maybe we'll have questions until </v>

2143
01:57:35.391 --> 01:57:38.370
<v Speaker 6>someone crazy grubs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>microphone or maybe we'll have questions</v>

2144
01:57:38.371 --> 01:57:40.080
<v Speaker 6>for half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

2145
01:57:40.081 --> 01:57:44.220
<v Speaker 6>And so if anybody has any questions then</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a microphone there and there's a</v>

2146
01:57:44.221 --> 01:57:49.221
<v Speaker 6>microphone there and I'll try to answer </v>
<v Speaker 6>them to the best that I can miss the my </v>

2147
01:57:51.031 --> 01:57:53.990
<v Speaker 6>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So let's.</v>

2148
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:54.990
<v Speaker 6>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's start.</v>

2149
01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:02.960
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you talked about the idea of when </v>

2150
01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:04.620
<v Speaker 6>you're confronting something that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>fear you,</v>

2151
01:58:04.650 --> 01:58:07.710
<v Speaker 6>like you face it head on and you destroy</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2152
01:58:08.190 --> 01:58:13.190
<v Speaker 6>but then you said that the idea is when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're confronting something you make </v>

2153
01:58:13.190 --> 01:58:15.630
<v Speaker 6>the world that have it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was wondering if you could just,</v>

2154
01:58:15.790 --> 01:58:17.540
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just expound on,</v>

2155
01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:20.730
<v Speaker 6>that means you make your marriage out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the arguments.</v>

2156
01:58:21.810 --> 01:58:23.640
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you have arguments with your wife,</v>

2157
01:58:23.641 --> 01:58:28.641
<v Speaker 6>you have arguments with your children,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's that chaotic state because no </v>

2158
01:58:28.641 --> 01:58:31.720
<v Speaker 6>one's been able to formulate a habitable</v>
<v Speaker 6>order from that,</v>

2159
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:34.410
<v Speaker 6>that domain of controversy and </v>
<v Speaker 6>confusion.</v>

2160
01:58:34.650 --> 01:58:39.650
<v Speaker 6>And then through dialogue you erect a </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure that's a house that you can </v>

2161
01:58:39.650 --> 01:58:40.620
<v Speaker 6>both live in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that's the.</v>

2162
01:58:40.770 --> 01:58:43.530
<v Speaker 6>That's the idea of making the world out </v>
<v Speaker 6>of that chaos.</v>

2163
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:46.950
<v Speaker 6>And it's frightening because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're really ha,</v>

2164
01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:52.040
<v Speaker 6>this is why people often avoid having </v>
<v Speaker 6>disputes with people they love because </v>

2165
01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:52.040
<v Speaker 6>it's frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2166
01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:54.700
<v Speaker 6>You find out what the person's light and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you find out what your life is like,</v>

2167
01:58:54.701 --> 01:58:56.110
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who wants to do that?</v>

2168
01:58:56.350 --> 01:58:58.540
<v Speaker 6>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

2169
01:58:58.541 --> 01:59:02.880
<v Speaker 6>your heart rate goes up and it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's confrontation and conflict and,</v>

2170
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:07.990
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's because you're encountering </v>

2171
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.170
<v Speaker 6>that domain that hasn't been properly </v>
<v Speaker 6>mapped,</v>

2172
01:59:08.171 --> 01:59:12.160
<v Speaker 6>are configured and so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're doing that with your Predator</v>

2173
01:59:12.161 --> 01:59:17.161
<v Speaker 6>detection systems essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that chaos that it threatens the </v>

2174
01:59:17.161 --> 01:59:19.240
<v Speaker 6>stability of the marriage is equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

2175
01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:21.460
<v Speaker 6>while it's equivalent to the serpent and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the tree,</v>

2176
01:59:21.461 --> 01:59:23.170
<v Speaker 6>that's one form of equivalence.</v>

2177
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:25.420
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then by dialogue,</v>

2178
01:59:25.421 --> 01:59:29.020
<v Speaker 6>through dialogue and negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you formulate the problem,</v>

2179
01:59:29.050 --> 01:59:31.930
<v Speaker 6>what exactly is going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where exactly are we,</v>

2180
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:36.990
<v Speaker 6>what exactly is the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so you keep talking until you reach </v>

2181
01:59:36.990 --> 01:59:38.410
<v Speaker 6>a consensus about that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you can live with,</v>

2182
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:43.430
<v Speaker 6>when you can act out right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you and maybe you come up with </v>

2183
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:45.850
<v Speaker 6>a solution to the problem and you've </v>
<v Speaker 6>established piece again and peace.</v>

2184
01:59:45.851 --> 01:59:47.860
<v Speaker 6>That's the house that you can both live </v>
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>

2185
01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:53.070
<v Speaker 6>And that's the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the chaos that people can fall </v>

2186
01:59:53.070 --> 01:59:55.300
<v Speaker 6>into all the time and often do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's the chaos that makes a marriage</v>

2187
01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:58.480
<v Speaker 6>wash up on the shores and transform into</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2188
01:59:58.481 --> 02:00:00.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>15 year divorce court,</v>

2189
02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:04.150
<v Speaker 6>very horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's the idea.</v>

2190
02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:06.030
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

2191
02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:06.510
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2192
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:17.830
<v Speaker 7>Hi Dr Allison.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thank you so much for the talk and </v>

2193
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.830
<v Speaker 7>thanks for your teachings.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's really helped me a lot.</v>

2194
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:22.271
<v Speaker 7>I had a experience in Grad school,</v>
<v Speaker 7>two English degrees and the way he </v>

2195
02:00:22.271 --> 02:00:23.450
<v Speaker 7>described the humanities in my </v>
<v Speaker 7>experience,</v>

2196
02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:26.810
<v Speaker 7>help me understand my experience back </v>
<v Speaker 7>then.</v>

2197
02:00:27.230 --> 02:00:29.270
<v Speaker 7>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's too bad.</v>

2198
02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:31.320
<v Speaker 7>That's too bad that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that happens to be the case.</v>

2199
02:00:31.330 --> 02:00:32.840
<v Speaker 7>I really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2200
02:00:32.841 --> 02:00:34.160
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's really not good,</v>

2201
02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:38.710
<v Speaker 7>but you don't have to tell me that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2202
02:00:38.711 --> 02:00:40.600
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I survived and I learned a lot and,</v>

2203
02:00:40.610 --> 02:00:41.210
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not,</v>

2204
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:43.850
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ungrateful for my experience.</v>

2205
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:45.220
<v Speaker 7>I've learned a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2206
02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.480
<v Speaker 7>but you said something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you described the Bible,</v>

2207
02:00:47.490 --> 02:00:49.940
<v Speaker 7>the collection of stories in the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 7>and interesting way,</v>

2208
02:00:49.941 --> 02:00:51.530
<v Speaker 7>and I wonder if it was on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2209
02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:53.320
<v Speaker 7>you described it as,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2210
02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:58.820
<v Speaker 7>created by an assembly of stories </v>
<v Speaker 7>created by many people over time.</v>

2211
02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:02.240
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's hyperlinked into itself.</v>

2212
02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:07.600
<v Speaker 7>And it sounds a lot like how I have </v>
<v Speaker 7>description of like the internet and </v>

2213
02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:07.600
<v Speaker 7>like how that works.</v>

2214
02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:09.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well it's not,</v>

2215
02:01:09.291 --> 02:01:10.670
<v Speaker 6>it's not accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2216
02:01:10.671 --> 02:01:12.650
<v Speaker 6>because the Internet's also a </v>
<v Speaker 6>collective.</v>

2217
02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:18.160
<v Speaker 6>It's a collective endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God only knows what personality it's </v>

2218
02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:18.680
<v Speaker 6>going to manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2219
02:01:18.681 --> 02:01:23.681
<v Speaker 6>but it's going to manifest some </v>
<v Speaker 6>personality because it's learning to </v>

2220
02:01:23.681 --> 02:01:23.681
<v Speaker 6>understand us very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very rapidly.</v>

2221
02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:28.840
<v Speaker 6>So I think you could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no reason not to think about it </v>

2222
02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:32.681
<v Speaker 6>as a precursor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the distance between the Bible </v>

2223
02:01:32.681 --> 02:01:35.891
<v Speaker 6>and the Internet is a lot less than the </v>
<v Speaker 6>distance between a chimpanzee and a </v>

2224
02:01:35.891 --> 02:01:38.830
<v Speaker 6>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's a.</v>

2225
02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:42.440
<v Speaker 6>and the difference between a book and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Internet is,</v>

2226
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:47.530
<v Speaker 6>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's in some sense it's a matter of new </v>

2227
02:01:47.530 --> 02:01:47.530
<v Speaker 6>matter of degree rather than kind.</v>

2228
02:01:47.530 --> 02:01:51.790
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so in a personality,</v>

2229
02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:58.120
<v Speaker 8>personality gets in by separating,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it sounds like you're talking about.</v>

2230
02:01:59.910 --> 02:02:02.370
<v Speaker 6>I know I can't speculate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2231
02:02:02.371 --> 02:02:05.730
<v Speaker 6>because God only knows what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>happen in the next 20 years.</v>

2232
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:10.910
<v Speaker 6>I certainly don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I don't know what the </v>

2233
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:12.780
<v Speaker 6>preconditions are for consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea and I don't think anybody</v>

2234
02:02:12.781 --> 02:02:15.420
<v Speaker 6>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I guess we're gonna find out.</v>

2235
02:02:16.030 --> 02:02:17.310
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yup,</v>

2236
02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:18.390
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

2237
02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:28.500
<v Speaker 9>Hey Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm curious about the connection between</v>

2238
02:02:28.501 --> 02:02:31.500
<v Speaker 9>aesthetic beauty and religious </v>
<v Speaker 9>experience.</v>

2239
02:02:31.501 --> 02:02:34.440
<v Speaker 9>I think you've hinted at it once or </v>
<v Speaker 9>twice over the course of this lecture.</v>

2240
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.760
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is it possible for something that's </v>

2241
02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:42.960
<v Speaker 9>incredibly beautiful to evoke or </v>
<v Speaker 9>religion,</v>

2242
02:02:42.990 --> 02:02:46.410
<v Speaker 9>religious or mystical experience or </v>
<v Speaker 9>something and in the same ballpark,</v>

2243
02:02:46.650 --> 02:02:48.200
<v Speaker 9>that's what they're for.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2244
02:02:48.630 --> 02:02:51.030
<v Speaker 9>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you look at the structure of like a,</v>

2245
02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:55.980
<v Speaker 9>like a Renaissance Cathedral just </v>
<v Speaker 9>yesterday was just going to check my,</v>

2246
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.880
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>my tag onto.</v>

2247
02:02:56.881 --> 02:02:59.400
<v Speaker 9>I apologize you mentioned trump might </v>
<v Speaker 9>tag onto that question.</v>

2248
02:02:59.401 --> 02:03:01.260
<v Speaker 9>The next part was,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2249
02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:07.100
<v Speaker 9>is that why we have cathedrals built </v>
<v Speaker 9>like a spectacular buildings as opposed </v>

2250
02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:07.500
<v Speaker 9>to a box or something?</v>

2251
02:03:07.530 --> 02:03:08.020
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2252
02:03:08.021 --> 02:03:10.470
<v Speaker 6>it says if you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how's the ultimate ideal,</v>

2253
02:03:10.770 --> 02:03:15.770
<v Speaker 6>you build something beautiful right to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to represent it's dwelling place and it </v>

2254
02:03:15.901 --> 02:03:18.120
<v Speaker 6>should be beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this is something that people do.</v>

2255
02:03:18.121 --> 02:03:19.320
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what takes seriously,</v>

2256
02:03:19.650 --> 02:03:22.500
<v Speaker 6>and this is especially something we </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't take seriously in Canada.</v>

2257
02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:23.820
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the,</v>

2258
02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:28.880
<v Speaker 6>you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think about all the hundreds of </v>

2259
02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:31.821
<v Speaker 6>millions of dollars that were invested </v>
<v Speaker 6>into beauty and in Europe mean </v>

2260
02:03:31.821 --> 02:03:35.820
<v Speaker 6>spectacular,</v>
<v Speaker 6>excessive investment in beauty that's </v>

2261
02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:40.371
<v Speaker 6>paid back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God only knows how many multiples of </v>

2262
02:03:40.371 --> 02:03:43.581
<v Speaker 6>times people make pilgrimages to Europe </v>
<v Speaker 6>constantly because it's so beautiful </v>

2263
02:03:43.581 --> 02:03:48.291
<v Speaker 6>that it just staggers you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beauty is so valuable and when we're so </v>

2264
02:03:48.291 --> 02:03:52.881
<v Speaker 6>afraid of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think we're afraid of it because </v>

2265
02:03:52.881 --> 02:03:52.881
<v Speaker 6>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a pathway.</v>

2266
02:03:52.881 --> 02:03:54.570
<v Speaker 6>It's not the only pathway to the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's lot.</v>

2267
02:03:54.571 --> 02:03:57.480
<v Speaker 6>There's pathways to the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Love is one of them,</v>

2268
02:03:57.481 --> 02:04:02.481
<v Speaker 6>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but beauty especially for people who </v>

2269
02:04:02.481 --> 02:04:02.481
<v Speaker 6>have an affinity for beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2270
02:04:02.481 --> 02:04:03.300
<v Speaker 6>it's like music.</v>

2271
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:05.640
<v Speaker 6>It's one of those things that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 6>argue against,</v>

2272
02:04:05.641 --> 02:04:07.590
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't even understand.</v>

2273
02:04:07.591 --> 02:04:11.250
<v Speaker 6>It just hits you and it does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It shows you.</v>

2274
02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:13.140
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it shows you the ideal.</v>

2275
02:04:13.141 --> 02:04:15.780
<v Speaker 6>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it also shows you,</v>

2276
02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:19.230
<v Speaker 6>I think it's like a vision of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>potential future.</v>

2277
02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:22.410
<v Speaker 6>It's something like that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that if we just got her act together and</v>

2278
02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:27.620
<v Speaker 6>beautified things that that's the place </v>
<v Speaker 6>that we can inhabit and that would end </v>

2279
02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:31.710
<v Speaker 6>us and that's why this Jerusalem heavily</v>
<v Speaker 6>city is paved with gemstones.</v>

2280
02:04:31.711 --> 02:04:32.750
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their crystalline,</v>

2281
02:04:32.751 --> 02:04:37.751
<v Speaker 6>the admit light and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the proper dwelling place for an </v>

2282
02:04:37.751 --> 02:04:41.481
<v Speaker 6>enlightened God is the proper dwelling </v>
<v Speaker 6>place for an enlightened consciousness </v>

2283
02:04:41.481 --> 02:04:45.930
<v Speaker 6>and we ignore it at our spiritual and </v>
<v Speaker 6>economic peril.</v>

2284
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:48.810
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's obvious that duty.</v>

2285
02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:52.680
<v Speaker 6>There's almost nothing more valuable </v>
<v Speaker 6>than beauty economically,</v>

2286
02:04:52.681 --> 02:04:53.560
<v Speaker 6>practically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2287
02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:56.250
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why that is.</v>

2288
02:04:56.251 --> 02:04:57.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

2289
02:04:57.930 --> 02:05:00.000
<v Speaker 6>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who knows.</v>

2290
02:05:00.930 --> 02:05:04.770
<v Speaker 6>I mean why we experienced gemstones for </v>
<v Speaker 6>example,</v>

2291
02:05:04.771 --> 02:05:06.420
<v Speaker 6>is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very mysterious,</v>

2292
02:05:06.450 --> 02:05:09.420
<v Speaker 6>but they're deep reasons for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

2293
02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:11.350
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2294
02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

2295
02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:19.080
<v Speaker 7>I have a bit of a similar question </v>
<v Speaker 7>actually.</v>

2296
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:22.200
<v Speaker 7>I know one of the ways in which,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2297
02:05:22.230 --> 02:05:27.230
<v Speaker 7>the Bible is appreciated even by some of</v>
<v Speaker 7>its harshest critics and deeply a people</v>

2298
02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:33.770
<v Speaker 7>is as a work of literature and is </v>
<v Speaker 7>something I'm at least I'm the King </v>

2299
02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:37.731
<v Speaker 7>James or the authorized translation of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the Bible is something very </v>

2300
02:05:37.731 --> 02:05:40.191
<v Speaker 7>aesthetically beautiful and a great work</v>
<v Speaker 7>of literature and a great work of </v>

2301
02:05:40.191 --> 02:05:40.191
<v Speaker 7>poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2302
02:05:40.191 --> 02:05:45.170
<v Speaker 7>and I'm wondering just from your study </v>
<v Speaker 7>of it and from your personal </v>

2303
02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:45.170
<v Speaker 7>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if there's any,</v>

2304
02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:50.020
<v Speaker 7>any particular passages or are parts of </v>
<v Speaker 7>it that you find particularly have </v>

2305
02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:51.570
<v Speaker 7>struck you in that way or that you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you cherish more than,</v>

2306
02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:53.670
<v Speaker 7>more than any others that you'd be able </v>
<v Speaker 7>to share or.</v>

2307
02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:55.770
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the ones that have really opened,</v>

2308
02:05:55.850 --> 02:06:00.850
<v Speaker 6>the ones that have really opened up to </v>
<v Speaker 6>me I think are the stories in genesis </v>

2309
02:06:00.850 --> 02:06:02.430
<v Speaker 6>right up to the tower of Babel because I</v>
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>

2310
02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:04.830
<v Speaker 6>well hopefully I'll be able to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 6>all of you about that,</v>

2311
02:06:04.831 --> 02:06:08.460
<v Speaker 6>but I think I got some sense of what </v>
<v Speaker 6>they mean and why.</v>

2312
02:06:08.610 --> 02:06:13.410
<v Speaker 6>I mean I know it's not exhaustive and </v>
<v Speaker 6>obviously but like and then the story in</v>

2313
02:06:13.411 --> 02:06:18.411
<v Speaker 6>exodus as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I also feel like I've got a handle on </v>

2314
02:06:18.411 --> 02:06:19.800
<v Speaker 6>that and so those have those have hit me</v>
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>

2315
02:06:19.801 --> 02:06:22.140
<v Speaker 6>really hard and that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

2316
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:27.350
<v Speaker 6>Just trying to understand this first </v>
<v Speaker 6>part of genesis to try to understand </v>

2317
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:30.651
<v Speaker 6>what these concepts mean has been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially when I started to understand </v>

2318
02:06:30.651 --> 02:06:33.900
<v Speaker 6>that the concept that human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 6>made in God's image,</v>

2319
02:06:34.290 --> 02:06:36.870
<v Speaker 6>God is has all those attributes that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>just described,</v>

2320
02:06:37.290 --> 02:06:39.330
<v Speaker 6>that human beings are made in God's </v>
<v Speaker 6>image,</v>

2321
02:06:39.331 --> 02:06:41.910
<v Speaker 6>but that's actually the cornerstone of </v>
<v Speaker 6>our legal system.</v>

2322
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:46.910
<v Speaker 6>That really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that really rattled me because I didn't </v>

2323
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:50.901
<v Speaker 6>understand that clearly that our body of</v>
<v Speaker 6>laws has that metaphysical </v>

2324
02:06:50.901 --> 02:06:55.611
<v Speaker 6>presupposition without which the laws </v>
<v Speaker 6>fall apart and that's starting to </v>

2325
02:06:55.611 --> 02:06:56.160
<v Speaker 6>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It really is.</v>

2326
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:58.380
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the postmodern critique of law.</v>

2327
02:06:58.530 --> 02:07:03.530
<v Speaker 6>The law schools are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say they're overrun by </v>

2328
02:07:03.530 --> 02:07:06.780
<v Speaker 6>postmodernists two are undermining the </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure of western law as fast as they</v>

2329
02:07:06.781 --> 02:07:11.781
<v Speaker 6>possibly can because they don't buy any </v>
<v Speaker 6>of this and so they're much more likely </v>

2330
02:07:11.781 --> 02:07:15.681
<v Speaker 6>to just think of the law is something at</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a like a casual pragmatic tool to </v>

2331
02:07:15.691 --> 02:07:18.960
<v Speaker 6>be manipulated for the purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 6>bringing forth the utopia.</v>

2332
02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:20.850
<v Speaker 6>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>

2333
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:25.910
<v Speaker 6>really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's very strange to me that we go </v>

2334
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:29.220
<v Speaker 6>off track when that metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 6>foundation starts to get rattled.</v>

2335
02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:29.780
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2336
02:07:30.070 --> 02:07:35.070
<v Speaker 7>do you think your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your appreciation of the aesthetic </v>

2337
02:07:35.070 --> 02:07:37.070
<v Speaker 7>beauty of it comes from a belief in the </v>
<v Speaker 7>truth that it's the underlying </v>

2338
02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:41.161
<v Speaker 7>propositions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's just because even the </v>

2339
02:07:41.161 --> 02:07:43.801
<v Speaker 7>atheistic critics,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm thinking of like even Dawkins or </v>

2340
02:07:43.801 --> 02:07:46.530
<v Speaker 7>hitchens really appreciate the Bible as </v>
<v Speaker 7>just a piece of I'm really beautiful </v>

2341
02:07:46.530 --> 02:07:50.851
<v Speaker 7>literature and I guess the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the writing and the sort of exalted </v>

2342
02:07:50.851 --> 02:07:54.481
<v Speaker 7>themes behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even if they totally reject the </v>

2343
02:07:54.481 --> 02:07:54.481
<v Speaker 7>underlying premises of it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you seem to.</v>

2344
02:07:54.481 --> 02:07:54.481
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well I don't,</v>

2345
02:07:54.481 --> 02:07:58.880
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that you can see it as </v>
<v Speaker 6>beautiful and poetic with the and reject</v>

2346
02:07:58.881 --> 02:08:02.720
<v Speaker 6>the underlying premises because if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>see it as beautiful and poetic,</v>

2347
02:08:02.721 --> 02:08:07.721
<v Speaker 6>you're accepting the underlying premises</v>
<v Speaker 6>with your experience of the beauty and </v>

2348
02:08:07.721 --> 02:08:12.251
<v Speaker 6>the poetics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even though you may be fighting it with </v>

2349
02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:14.861
<v Speaker 6>your articulated rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think all that indicates is a </v>

2350
02:08:14.861 --> 02:08:17.570
<v Speaker 6>disintegrated perspective on the book.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not.</v>

2351
02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:19.910
<v Speaker 6>It's not surprising that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 6>case.</v>

2352
02:08:19.911 --> 02:08:20.770
<v Speaker 6>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2353
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:24.590
<v Speaker 6>it's the perspective that everyone has </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the book except with them.</v>

2354
02:08:24.591 --> 02:08:26.660
<v Speaker 6>It's more well developed and well </v>
<v Speaker 6>thought through,</v>

2355
02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:32.080
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's fundamentally they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not approaching the thing with enough </v>

2356
02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:35.120
<v Speaker 6>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's my sense is they and who knows,</v>

2357
02:08:35.121 --> 02:08:35.900
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I don't.</v>

2358
02:08:35.930 --> 02:08:40.930
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what I've tried to do is to think </v>

2359
02:08:40.930 --> 02:08:41.120
<v Speaker 6>there's probably more to this than I </v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

2360
02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:45.230
<v Speaker 6>and then try to understand it from that </v>
<v Speaker 6>perspective rather than to think,</v>

2361
02:08:45.231 --> 02:08:50.231
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once a collection of of superstitions </v>

2362
02:08:50.231 --> 02:08:50.240
<v Speaker 6>that we've somehow grown.</v>

2363
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:51.020
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2364
02:08:51.021 --> 02:08:52.550
<v Speaker 6>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sorry that's,</v>

2365
02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:57.080
<v Speaker 6>that's not a deep enough analysis </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's got some truth,</v>

2366
02:08:57.081 --> 02:09:02.081
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't take into account the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that the proposition still stand at</v>

2367
02:09:04.671 --> 02:09:08.090
<v Speaker 6>the foundation of our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't address niches,</v>

2368
02:09:08.150 --> 02:09:10.910
<v Speaker 6>central concern,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is that if you blow out the notion</v>

2369
02:09:10.911 --> 02:09:14.270
<v Speaker 6>of God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the entire structure crumbled and Owen,</v>

2370
02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.850
<v Speaker 6>you can debate that fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I just,</v>

2371
02:09:16.890 --> 02:09:21.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just assume that you debated it with </v>

2372
02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:21.890
<v Speaker 6>nature because he's a pretty tough </v>
<v Speaker 6>customer to tangle with.</v>

2373
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:27.070
<v Speaker 6>So I don't think the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the atheist types in so far as there's a</v>

2374
02:09:27.171 --> 02:09:32.171
<v Speaker 6>type.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they've wrestled with the </v>

2375
02:09:32.171 --> 02:09:32.171
<v Speaker 6>real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

2376
02:09:32.171 --> 02:09:32.171
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2377
02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:40.380
<v Speaker 10>So I appreciate you setting some ground </v>
<v Speaker 10>rules.</v>

2378
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:42.680
<v Speaker 10>Keep things rational and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

2379
02:09:42.690 --> 02:09:45.930
<v Speaker 10>I think that's going to help us.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What I'm wondering is,</v>

2380
02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.570
<v Speaker 10>so for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you had said elsewhere,</v>

2381
02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:54.380
<v Speaker 10>the new testament from the best from </v>
<v Speaker 10>what you can see it's psychologically </v>

2382
02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:54.750
<v Speaker 10>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

2383
02:09:54.970 --> 02:09:59.970
<v Speaker 10>and that's quite astounding.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I would say there's a lot of truth and </v>

2384
02:09:59.970 --> 02:10:02.040
<v Speaker 10>in your depictions of these stories </v>
<v Speaker 10>elsewhere,</v>

2385
02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:04.760
<v Speaker 10>you've pointed out like deep truths,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2386
02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:09.780
<v Speaker 10>the real powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So what my question would be is if we </v>

2387
02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:14.751
<v Speaker 10>can say Nietzsche took a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>like in order of magnitude of a </v>

2388
02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:20.780
<v Speaker 10>intelligence and the depth to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 10>predict what would happen to the next </v>

2389
02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:21.750
<v Speaker 10>side century,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

2390
02:10:21.751 --> 02:10:25.950
<v Speaker 10>rationally if the Bible's not the </v>
<v Speaker 10>inherent word of God,</v>

2391
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:27.540
<v Speaker 10>what's going on?</v>

2392
02:10:28.370 --> 02:10:31.250
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a really good question.</v>

2393
02:10:31.251 --> 02:10:36.251
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to try to answer that </v>

2394
02:10:36.251 --> 02:10:36.251
<v Speaker 6>rationally but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

2395
02:10:36.251 --> 02:10:36.251
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and as we move forward,</v>

2396
02:10:36.251 --> 02:10:41.201
<v Speaker 6>but as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to leave people with the </v>

2397
02:10:41.201 --> 02:10:41.201
<v Speaker 6>notion because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some ways.</v>

2398
02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:44.750
<v Speaker 6>This is something I've thought about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I've been thinking about for a long</v>

2399
02:10:44.751 --> 02:10:49.751
<v Speaker 6>time is I can't tell if I'm a like an </v>
<v Speaker 6>advocate of the religious viewpoint or </v>

2400
02:10:49.751 --> 02:10:54.071
<v Speaker 6>its worst possible critic because I am </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing my best to make it rational and </v>

2401
02:10:54.071 --> 02:10:55.490
<v Speaker 6>there's an reductionistic element to </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2402
02:10:55.491 --> 02:11:00.491
<v Speaker 6>but I think that I'm doing that while </v>
<v Speaker 6>also leaving the door open to things </v>

2403
02:11:00.491 --> 02:11:02.360
<v Speaker 6>that I don't understand because I know </v>
<v Speaker 6>that there's.</v>

2404
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:07.570
<v Speaker 6>There's more to this story than I </v>
<v Speaker 6>understand or can understand and I'm </v>

2405
02:11:07.570 --> 02:11:09.020
<v Speaker 6>laying out what I can understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm making it rational,</v>

2406
02:11:09.021 --> 02:11:14.021
<v Speaker 6>but I do not believe for an instant that</v>
<v Speaker 6>that exhausts the realm.</v>

2407
02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:19.660
<v Speaker 6>It's like there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are ways of interpreting these </v>

2408
02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:21.290
<v Speaker 6>stories that work in the conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 6>universe we inhabit right now,</v>

2409
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:24.730
<v Speaker 6>but there's a lot of things that we </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't understand.</v>

2410
02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:29.800
<v Speaker 6>What I'm thing I found about digging </v>
<v Speaker 6>into these stories is that the deeper </v>

2411
02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:29.800
<v Speaker 6>you dig,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the more you find,</v>

2412
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:35.050
<v Speaker 6>and that's pretty damned.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the things that convinced </v>

2413
02:11:35.050 --> 02:11:37.451
<v Speaker 6>me that there was more to them that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>had originally suspected because things </v>

2414
02:11:37.451 --> 02:11:37.610
<v Speaker 6>would click and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

2415
02:11:37.611 --> 02:11:40.400
<v Speaker 6>that's really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's really something and then I would</v>

2416
02:11:40.401 --> 02:11:44.030
<v Speaker 6>take it apart further and I think whole,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well I thought that was something,</v>

2417
02:11:44.031 --> 02:11:46.400
<v Speaker 6>but this is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is even more remarkable.</v>

2418
02:11:46.401 --> 02:11:50.240
<v Speaker 6>It just keeps opening and opening and so</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to make it rational.</v>

2419
02:11:50.450 --> 02:11:53.390
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to try to provide an answer to</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it is.</v>

2420
02:11:53.391 --> 02:11:58.391
<v Speaker 6>I think you're right about speaking </v>
<v Speaker 6>about niche and his capacity for </v>

2421
02:11:58.391 --> 02:11:58.730
<v Speaker 6>prophecy and Dostoyevsky's in the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>category,</v>

2422
02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.260
<v Speaker 6>so like there are prophetic elements to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the old and New Testament that seemed to</v>

2423
02:12:03.261 --> 02:12:08.261
<v Speaker 6>stretch over much vaster spans of time </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm going to try to produce a </v>

2424
02:12:08.261 --> 02:12:09.380
<v Speaker 6>rational account of that.</v>

2425
02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:14.620
<v Speaker 6>But I mean one of the reasons that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think the new testament is </v>

2426
02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:14.620
<v Speaker 6>psychologically true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say is because,</v>

2427
02:12:14.810 --> 02:12:17.340
<v Speaker 6>and this is one of the things that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2428
02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:20.030
<v Speaker 6>that's deeply embedded in the structure </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the Bible.</v>

2429
02:12:20.031 --> 02:12:25.031
<v Speaker 6>In the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's this idea and I'm skipping </v>

2430
02:12:25.031 --> 02:12:28.580
<v Speaker 6>ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that through a succession of states,</v>

2431
02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:33.680
<v Speaker 6>the people who behave properly will </v>
<v Speaker 6>eventually establish the proper state.</v>

2432
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:36.410
<v Speaker 6>And so the state is viewed in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 6>as the,</v>

2433
02:12:36.710 --> 02:12:41.030
<v Speaker 6>as the entity of salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But what happens in the new testament is</v>

2434
02:12:41.031 --> 02:12:46.031
<v Speaker 6>that idea gets,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could say deconstructed and instead </v>

2435
02:12:46.031 --> 02:12:49.220
<v Speaker 6>of a state being the place of </v>
<v Speaker 6>redemption,</v>

2436
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:52.190
<v Speaker 6>a state of being becomes the State of </v>
<v Speaker 6>redemption.</v>

2437
02:12:52.191 --> 02:12:57.191
<v Speaker 6>And so the idea that human beings will </v>
<v Speaker 6>be redeemed moves from the Utopian state</v>

2438
02:12:58.671 --> 02:13:01.850
<v Speaker 6>vision to the responsibility of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual.</v>

2439
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:04.040
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2440
02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:09.900
<v Speaker 6>I believe that that's the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that West in particular is </v>

2441
02:13:10.041 --> 02:13:15.041
<v Speaker 6>predicated on the idea that idea because</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes the state subservient to the </v>

2442
02:13:15.041 --> 02:13:16.400
<v Speaker 6>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's a,</v>

2443
02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:19.330
<v Speaker 6>there's a what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a dialogue,</v>

2444
02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:22.520
<v Speaker 6>a continual dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in the final analysis,</v>

2445
02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:24.710
<v Speaker 6>the locus of the divine is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>individual,</v>

2446
02:13:24.711 --> 02:13:28.460
<v Speaker 6>not the state.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I believe that that's so true,</v>

2447
02:13:28.461 --> 02:13:30.710
<v Speaker 6>that if we don't act it out and believe </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2448
02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:34.290
<v Speaker 6>then all die painfully.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's true enough for me.</v>

2449
02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:35.860
<v Speaker 6>So thank you.</v>

2450
02:13:36.050 --> 02:13:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2451
02:13:41.770 --> 02:13:46.770
<v Speaker 11>Or eliminating talk.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm going to keep you on the creation </v>

2452
02:13:46.770 --> 02:13:50.701
<v Speaker 11>story and if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 11>because we know this editing that was </v>

2453
02:13:50.701 --> 02:13:52.030
<v Speaker 11>done,</v>
<v Speaker 11>there was the purpose for the editing.</v>

2454
02:13:52.570 --> 02:13:57.280
<v Speaker 11>Can you give us your thoughts about the </v>
<v Speaker 11>difference in the story of creation,</v>

2455
02:13:57.281 --> 02:14:01.210
<v Speaker 11>especially pertaining to men from the </v>
<v Speaker 11>first chapter,</v>

2456
02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:03.790
<v Speaker 11>which is very godlike,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

2457
02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:08.820
<v Speaker 11>by a word after the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 11>which is more like a fatherly type of </v>

2458
02:14:09.250 --> 02:14:11.950
<v Speaker 11>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Is it a selling point?</v>

2459
02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:16.210
<v Speaker 11>What was the reason for this type of </v>
<v Speaker 11>editing to put the two together?</v>

2460
02:14:16.770 --> 02:14:18.660
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you know,</v>

2461
02:14:18.990 --> 02:14:23.990
<v Speaker 6>the more cynical would you call critic </v>
<v Speaker 6>criticisms of the Bible and the </v>

2462
02:14:24.391 --> 02:14:27.990
<v Speaker 6>religious tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>criticisms like Marxists or Freud's even</v>

2463
02:14:27.991 --> 02:14:31.430
<v Speaker 6>for that matter make the case that it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>a power.</v>

2464
02:14:31.431 --> 02:14:36.431
<v Speaker 6>It's a manifestation of power in </v>
<v Speaker 6>politics and that there's always a </v>

2465
02:14:36.431 --> 02:14:40.971
<v Speaker 6>political or economic motivation behind </v>
<v Speaker 6>the construction of the stories and I </v>

2466
02:14:40.971 --> 02:14:44.961
<v Speaker 6>think that that's true to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think that it's true enough </v>

2467
02:14:44.961 --> 02:14:49.560
<v Speaker 6>so that you can take that particular </v>
<v Speaker 6>interpretive tack and be done with it.</v>

2468
02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:55.040
<v Speaker 6>And I would say that to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 6>there are political and economic </v>

2469
02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:55.860
<v Speaker 6>motivations that have shaped the </v>
<v Speaker 6>stories,</v>

2470
02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:58.770
<v Speaker 6>the fact that multiple stories have come</v>
<v Speaker 6>together,</v>

2471
02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:00.750
<v Speaker 6>they're sort of corrective in some </v>
<v Speaker 6>sense.</v>

2472
02:15:00.751 --> 02:15:05.751
<v Speaker 6>And so even at the level of detail,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's political intrigue and politics </v>

2473
02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:10.230
<v Speaker 6>say with regards to the ascendancy of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Israel,</v>

2474
02:15:11.190 --> 02:15:16.190
<v Speaker 6>when you step away from it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it becomes something that's more </v>

2475
02:15:16.190 --> 02:15:17.340
<v Speaker 6>universal and escapes from that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And how that happened.</v>

2476
02:15:18.810 --> 02:15:19.660
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2477
02:15:19.810 --> 02:15:23.290
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think safe to say it's reasonably safe</v>

2478
02:15:23.291 --> 02:15:25.720
<v Speaker 6>to say that the people who put this </v>
<v Speaker 6>document together,</v>

2479
02:15:25.930 --> 02:15:30.930
<v Speaker 6>they did two things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they were guided by their </v>

2480
02:15:30.930 --> 02:15:32.200
<v Speaker 6>aesthetic taste and their conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I truly believe that.</v>

2481
02:15:32.410 --> 02:15:37.240
<v Speaker 6>And the reason I believe that is because</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think anything that was propagandistic</v>

2482
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:41.320
<v Speaker 6>would have been forgotten because he </v>
<v Speaker 6>can't remember propaganda.</v>

2483
02:15:41.710 --> 02:15:46.710
<v Speaker 6>No one likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's dead 10 years after you </v>

2484
02:15:46.710 --> 02:15:49.471
<v Speaker 6>write it or 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it isn't only that these books were </v>

2485
02:15:49.471 --> 02:15:52.801
<v Speaker 6>assembled in written.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was that they were preserved and </v>

2486
02:15:52.801 --> 02:15:55.711
<v Speaker 6>remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And to me that means they have an </v>

2487
02:15:55.711 --> 02:15:55.900
<v Speaker 6>affinity with the structure of memory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2488
02:15:55.930 --> 02:15:58.480
<v Speaker 6>you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how does this story last 10,000</v>

2489
02:15:58.481 --> 02:16:03.481
<v Speaker 6>years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless it's the kind of story you can </v>

2490
02:16:03.481 --> 02:16:05.281
<v Speaker 6>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't because you forget all of </v>

2491
02:16:05.281 --> 02:16:06.040
<v Speaker 6>forgettable stuff and all you remember </v>
<v Speaker 6>is the memorable stuff.</v>

2492
02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:11.340
<v Speaker 6>And so there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this interplay between the </v>

2493
02:16:12.191 --> 02:16:17.191
<v Speaker 6>document itself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>found its audience that shapes the </v>

2494
02:16:17.191 --> 02:16:18.160
<v Speaker 6>document.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so now,</v>

2495
02:16:18.161 --> 02:16:20.800
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how specifically I answered</v>
<v Speaker 6>your question.</v>

2496
02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:26.300
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to hit this different </v>

2497
02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:28.240
<v Speaker 6>stories as they come up and sequence and</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I'll shed some more light on the</v>

2498
02:16:28.241 --> 02:16:32.470
<v Speaker 6>relationship between doing that and </v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll start with that next week.</v>

2499
02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:38.670
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

2500
02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:39.870
<v Speaker 11>So,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

2501
02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:45.080
<v Speaker 11>I've been really interested in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 11>the stuff that you've been saying about </v>

2502
02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:47.820
<v Speaker 11>dreams because I've been lucid dreaming </v>
<v Speaker 11>a lot for many years,</v>

2503
02:16:47.850 --> 02:16:52.850
<v Speaker 11>but always in a sort of atheistic way.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's sort of like a game or something </v>

2504
02:16:52.850 --> 02:16:53.400
<v Speaker 11>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 11>But um,</v>

2505
02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:56.280
<v Speaker 11>because of seeing your talks and </v>
<v Speaker 11>everything,</v>

2506
02:16:56.281 --> 02:16:58.020
<v Speaker 11>I've started to think of it from a </v>
<v Speaker 11>different perspective.</v>

2507
02:16:58.021 --> 02:17:03.021
<v Speaker 11>Like you're now interfacing with </v>
<v Speaker 11>something beyond the narrow scope of </v>

2508
02:17:03.021 --> 02:17:05.850
<v Speaker 11>your conscious awareness that or </v>
<v Speaker 11>something like that,</v>

2509
02:17:05.851 --> 02:17:07.800
<v Speaker 11>maybe mythological or maybe something </v>
<v Speaker 11>like God.</v>

2510
02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:13.220
<v Speaker 11>And so what I've been thinking about and</v>
<v Speaker 11>what I maybe wonder what you think about</v>

2511
02:17:13.531 --> 02:17:16.950
<v Speaker 11>it is that in some ways when you're </v>
<v Speaker 11>lucid dreaming,</v>

2512
02:17:16.951 --> 02:17:20.070
<v Speaker 11>you're kind of tread.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You're getting beyond the limitations of</v>

2513
02:17:20.071 --> 02:17:23.490
<v Speaker 11>an ordinary dream or sort of trends </v>
<v Speaker 11>sending limitations,</v>

2514
02:17:23.491 --> 02:17:27.450
<v Speaker 11>which maybe is like,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it's not the purpose of people,</v>

2515
02:17:27.451 --> 02:17:32.451
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's because as a person who was </v>

2516
02:17:32.451 --> 02:17:34.531
<v Speaker 11>supposed to be limited in some way as </v>
<v Speaker 11>opposed to like God who's like not </v>

2517
02:17:34.531 --> 02:17:37.611
<v Speaker 11>limited and how,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but on the other hand it's a good </v>

2518
02:17:37.611 --> 02:17:40.521
<v Speaker 11>opportunity to kind of have control over</v>
<v Speaker 11>your interactions with this like very </v>

2519
02:17:40.521 --> 02:17:44.781
<v Speaker 11>special and interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So I guess the conundrum is that on one </v>

2520
02:17:44.781 --> 02:17:46.500
<v Speaker 11>hand like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you can control your interactions,</v>

2521
02:17:46.501 --> 02:17:48.570
<v Speaker 11>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 11>like you are controlling them.</v>

2522
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:52.500
<v Speaker 11>So I guess I'm wondering what you think </v>
<v Speaker 11>about that and also just in general,</v>

2523
02:17:52.501 --> 02:17:54.390
<v Speaker 11>what do you think about lucid dreaming </v>
<v Speaker 11>as a thing?</v>

2524
02:17:54.391 --> 02:17:55.470
<v Speaker 11>Like should you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Or.</v>

2525
02:17:55.510 --> 02:17:57.490
<v Speaker 6>I had a client who could really lucid </v>
<v Speaker 6>dream,</v>

2526
02:17:57.491 --> 02:18:02.491
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and one of the things she used them now </v>

2527
02:18:02.491 --> 02:18:05.491
<v Speaker 6>and then to solve problems even though </v>
<v Speaker 6>she didn't always pay attention to that </v>

2528
02:18:05.491 --> 02:18:05.491
<v Speaker 6>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but sometimes she did.</v>

2529
02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:11.580
<v Speaker 6>She went to her in one of her dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the characters told her that she </v>

2530
02:18:11.901 --> 02:18:14.060
<v Speaker 6>would have to learn to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>slaughter house.</v>

2531
02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:19.540
<v Speaker 6>She was very afraid of life and one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the consequences of that was that we </v>

2532
02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:20.060
<v Speaker 6>went and watched an embalming,</v>

2533
02:18:20.890 --> 02:18:21.460
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2534
02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:24.450
<v Speaker 6>so the dreams were.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But one of the things she did,</v>

2535
02:18:24.451 --> 02:18:26.790
<v Speaker 6>she'd asked the characters what they </v>
<v Speaker 6>were up to,</v>

2536
02:18:26.850 --> 02:18:28.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was instead of controlling,</v>

2537
02:18:28.681 --> 02:18:33.240
<v Speaker 6>she would inquire and so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't know what to say about lucid</v>

2538
02:18:33.241 --> 02:18:38.241
<v Speaker 6>dreaming beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I know it's a well documented </v>

2539
02:18:38.241 --> 02:18:40.640
<v Speaker 6>phenomenon and many people can do it and</v>
<v Speaker 6>women seem to be able to do it better </v>

2540
02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:40.920
<v Speaker 6>than men.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what the research indicates.</v>

2541
02:18:41.370 --> 02:18:45.300
<v Speaker 6>But I think that what we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 6>about lucid dreaming could fill a lot of</v>

2542
02:18:45.301 --> 02:18:47.940
<v Speaker 6>books.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think you do.</v>

2543
02:18:47.970 --> 02:18:52.020
<v Speaker 6>There is some danger in controlling it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think because you lose the spontaneous</v>

2544
02:18:52.021 --> 02:18:54.330
<v Speaker 6>revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>although not completely because he can't</v>

2545
02:18:54.331 --> 02:18:57.660
<v Speaker 6>control it completely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I like you see,</v>

2546
02:18:57.690 --> 02:19:02.690
<v Speaker 6>you might be interested in reading </v>
<v Speaker 6>humans works on active imagination </v>

2547
02:19:02.690 --> 02:19:07.130
<v Speaker 6>because he kind of learned to dream when</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was awake and he spent a lot of time </v>

2548
02:19:07.130 --> 02:19:10.590
<v Speaker 6>in the world of imagination when he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>awake.</v>

2549
02:19:10.590 --> 02:19:11.910
<v Speaker 6>The red books,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

2550
02:19:11.911 --> 02:19:16.560
<v Speaker 6>the red book is as a document of his </v>
<v Speaker 6>experiences with awake dreaming,</v>

2551
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:19.290
<v Speaker 6>but he was very interactive with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dream,</v>

2552
02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:24.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>instead of trying to bend it to his </v>

2553
02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:24.320
<v Speaker 6>Morris will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

2554
02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:29.270
<v Speaker 6>he was exploring it in some sense like </v>
<v Speaker 6>you explore a video game right now which</v>

2555
02:19:29.271 --> 02:19:31.700
<v Speaker 6>are forms of dreams in and of </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves.</v>

2556
02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:36.760
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say do it with an exploratory </v>

2557
02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.230
<v Speaker 6>purpose in mind and you could always ask</v>
<v Speaker 6>yourself what you could learn to,</v>

2558
02:19:39.231 --> 02:19:44.231
<v Speaker 6>which is a very dangerous question to </v>
<v Speaker 6>ask a dream because sometimes you'll </v>

2559
02:19:44.231 --> 02:19:45.530
<v Speaker 6>find out what you have to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now it's not so pleasant,</v>

2560
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:48.610
<v Speaker 6>but it's really worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2561
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:53.520
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

2562
02:19:53.521 --> 02:19:58.521
<v Speaker 6>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I'm going to take four more </v>

2563
02:19:58.521 --> 02:20:00.861
<v Speaker 6>questions only because I'm running out </v>
<v Speaker 6>of brain and I don't want to say stupid </v>

2564
02:20:00.861 --> 02:20:02.700
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so or stupid or things that I've already</v>

2565
02:20:02.701 --> 02:20:03.360
<v Speaker 6>said so.</v>

2566
02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:06.220
<v Speaker 9>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Thank you for the talk.</v>

2567
02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:10.450
<v Speaker 9>I'm in the beginning of your lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you talked about how society needed this</v>

2568
02:20:10.451 --> 02:20:15.451
<v Speaker 9>kind of dreamlike religious base,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so we don't go between left and right </v>

2569
02:20:16.211 --> 02:20:21.211
<v Speaker 9>violently and we can kind of have this </v>
<v Speaker 9>base and then you also said you admired </v>

2570
02:20:21.211 --> 02:20:24.951
<v Speaker 9>Nisha for kind of a chopping down these,</v>
<v Speaker 9>these ideological and kind of dogmatic </v>

2571
02:20:25.481 --> 02:20:28.210
<v Speaker 9>weeds coming up from the base of </v>
<v Speaker 9>Christianity.</v>

2572
02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:33.700
<v Speaker 9>I was wondering how what your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 9>are on how society can have this kind of</v>

2573
02:20:33.701 --> 02:20:38.701
<v Speaker 9>religious base without having these kind</v>
<v Speaker 9>of dangerous ideologies that can spring </v>

2574
02:20:38.701 --> 02:20:39.130
<v Speaker 9>up once a month.</v>

2575
02:20:39.380 --> 02:20:42.500
<v Speaker 6>That's what I'm trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not really.</v>

2576
02:20:42.501 --> 02:20:45.410
<v Speaker 6>I mean that really that's the serious </v>
<v Speaker 6>answer to that question.</v>

2577
02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:48.680
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the reason that I'm an admirer of</v>

2578
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:51.930
<v Speaker 6>niches because he was the spirit of his </v>
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

2579
02:20:51.931 --> 02:20:53.540
<v Speaker 6>so that's a good way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2580
02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:58.840
<v Speaker 6>It's not like nature killed God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the nature gathered what was in the</v>

2581
02:20:59.451 --> 02:21:04.451
<v Speaker 6>air and articulated it right incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 6>profoundly in so he put his finger on </v>

2582
02:21:05.661 --> 02:21:10.661
<v Speaker 6>the spot and in doing so he announced </v>
<v Speaker 6>the problem and once you announced the </v>

2583
02:21:11.331 --> 02:21:16.331
<v Speaker 6>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then maybe you can come up with a </v>

2584
02:21:16.331 --> 02:21:18.371
<v Speaker 6>solution because you can't solve a </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem unless you know what it is and </v>

2585
02:21:18.371 --> 02:21:20.000
<v Speaker 6>the fact that he made it so stark and so</v>
<v Speaker 6>clear,</v>

2586
02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:25.420
<v Speaker 6>it was horrifying in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at least we know where we stand and </v>

2587
02:21:25.461 --> 02:21:30.461
<v Speaker 6>so since then I would say particularly </v>
<v Speaker 6>with in many ways,</v>

2588
02:21:31.251 --> 02:21:36.251
<v Speaker 6>particularly with the work of yoga and </v>
<v Speaker 6>and everything that's come out of that </v>

2589
02:21:36.251 --> 02:21:39.020
<v Speaker 6>which is the deeper study of mythology </v>
<v Speaker 6>and its meanings and we'd been trying to</v>

2590
02:21:39.021 --> 02:21:42.530
<v Speaker 6>address that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The issue that you brought up and trying</v>

2591
02:21:42.531 --> 02:21:47.531
<v Speaker 6>to solve the problem and the problem is </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like the reunification of the </v>

2592
02:21:47.531 --> 02:21:48.170
<v Speaker 6>spirit of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's something like that.</v>

2593
02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:51.650
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're slogging through it,</v>

2594
02:21:51.651 --> 02:21:53.570
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

2595
02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:55.790
<v Speaker 6>That's why you're all here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least in part.</v>

2596
02:21:55.791 --> 02:21:58.340
<v Speaker 6>So we'll see how far we can get by at </v>
<v Speaker 6>this rate.</v>

2597
02:21:58.341 --> 02:22:00.890
<v Speaker 6>We'll get to like the twelfth verse in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the first,</v>

2598
02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:03.740
<v Speaker 6>but that's the aim,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

2599
02:22:04.330 --> 02:22:04.720
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2600
02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:15.350
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So first we have access to the slides.</v>

2601
02:22:15.390 --> 02:22:16.870
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll be in the,</v>

2602
02:22:17.420 --> 02:22:22.420
<v Speaker 6>there'll be in the video.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could also make them available as </v>

2603
02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:24.640
<v Speaker 6>slides.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Slides.</v>

2604
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:26.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's okay.</v>

2605
02:22:26.581 --> 02:22:29.160
<v Speaker 6>I'll return to this when we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when we get going again.</v>

2606
02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:30.090
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

2607
02:22:30.310 --> 02:22:35.310
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You mentioned the significant.</v>

2608
02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:41.320
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Different colors represent the distance </v>

2609
02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:41.320
<v Speaker 6>between the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>between the,</v>

2610
02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:43.680
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cross references.</v>

2611
02:22:44.010 --> 02:22:44.340
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2612
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:50.880
<v Speaker 5>Is the Holy Spirit as the logos?</v>

2613
02:22:51.530 --> 02:22:55.430
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll talk about that more next time.</v>

2614
02:22:55.431 --> 02:23:00.431
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that the best answer to that is </v>

2615
02:23:00.431 --> 02:23:01.260
<v Speaker 6>I'll talk more about that next time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2616
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:04.760
<v Speaker 6>I think of them as overlapping </v>
<v Speaker 6>metaphorical domains.</v>

2617
02:23:05.170 --> 02:23:10.170
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when the descriptions I put up the </v>

2618
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:10.170
<v Speaker 6>fatherly aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the second aspect and the spirit aspect.</v>

2619
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:11.660
<v Speaker 6>You could swap a lot of those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2620
02:23:11.661 --> 02:23:13.710
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think they're,</v>

2621
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:17.750
<v Speaker 6>I think the trinitarian idea is trying </v>
<v Speaker 6>to get forward.</v>

2622
02:23:17.751 --> 02:23:21.230
<v Speaker 6>The notion that the locus of the divine </v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

2623
02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:25.820
<v Speaker 6>is it's the same thing in its essence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it exists in a multiplicity.</v>

2624
02:23:25.821 --> 02:23:30.821
<v Speaker 6>It exists as the spirit of tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it exists as the living individual in </v>

2625
02:23:31.011 --> 02:23:35.270
<v Speaker 6>the in time and space and that it exists</v>
<v Speaker 6>as the spirit that,</v>

2626
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:35.930
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2627
02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:39.230
<v Speaker 6>that and is consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that that we all share,</v>

2628
02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:40.310
<v Speaker 6>which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which you know,</v>

2629
02:23:40.311 --> 02:23:45.311
<v Speaker 6>young would have thought about that as </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like the capacity for the </v>

2630
02:23:45.311 --> 02:23:48.761
<v Speaker 6>individual to realize that tragedy and </v>
<v Speaker 6>redemption of Christ in their individual</v>

2631
02:23:50.211 --> 02:23:55.211
<v Speaker 6>life and that's something like your </v>
<v Speaker 6>capacity to voluntarily accept the </v>

2632
02:23:55.941 --> 02:24:00.941
<v Speaker 6>tragic conditions of your exist in San </v>
<v Speaker 6>to move forward to something resembling </v>

2633
02:24:00.941 --> 02:24:02.720
<v Speaker 6>paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Regardless of that,</v>

2634
02:24:03.050 --> 02:24:08.050
<v Speaker 6>you know as something that's intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 6>to you and I think that's associated </v>

2635
02:24:08.050 --> 02:24:09.410
<v Speaker 6>with the idea of the pentecost and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2636
02:24:09.411 --> 02:24:11.060
<v Speaker 6>and the Holy Spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of that.</v>

2637
02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:15.350
<v Speaker 6>It's so that that's as good as I can do </v>
<v Speaker 6>in a short period of time.</v>

2638
02:24:15.530 --> 02:24:15.890
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2639
02:24:16.970 --> 02:24:21.970
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Contract or a legal system.</v>

2640
02:24:29.730 --> 02:24:30.190
<v Speaker 5>Religion.</v>

2641
02:24:35.050 --> 02:24:37.450
<v Speaker 6>I think it's because it's because of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2642
02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:40.900
<v Speaker 6>the gap between what we articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we don't know.</v>

2643
02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:45.070
<v Speaker 6>Something has to fill that gap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I think the law could be,</v>

2644
02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:47.800
<v Speaker 6>could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>could replace it if the law was total,</v>

2645
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:49.550
<v Speaker 6>but it isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2646
02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:54.620
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's bounded and the incorrect and </v>

2647
02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:57.061
<v Speaker 6>there's something in wrists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has to rest on something inside </v>

2648
02:24:57.061 --> 02:25:00.811
<v Speaker 6>that's like this mediator between what </v>
<v Speaker 6>we articulate and what we don't </v>

2649
02:25:00.811 --> 02:25:01.200
<v Speaker 6>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's something like custom.</v>

2650
02:25:01.201 --> 02:25:06.201
<v Speaker 6>It's something like expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's something like the intrinsic sense </v>

2651
02:25:06.201 --> 02:25:10.081
<v Speaker 6>of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know that the law itself is aiming </v>

2652
02:25:10.081 --> 02:25:13.051
<v Speaker 6>at and those aren't fully articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but without them there'd be no </v>

2653
02:25:13.051 --> 02:25:15.520
<v Speaker 6>grounding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like without the body,</v>

2654
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.640
<v Speaker 6>the law would be a dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2655
02:25:18.641 --> 02:25:22.240
<v Speaker 6>and if you don't know what a word means,</v>
<v Speaker 6>using the dictionary is helpful,</v>

2656
02:25:22.241 --> 02:25:26.740
<v Speaker 6>but not that because like unless you've </v>
<v Speaker 6>had the experience of anger,</v>

2657
02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:28.930
<v Speaker 6>the dictionary can't tell you what anger</v>
<v Speaker 6>means.</v>

2658
02:25:28.930 --> 02:25:33.930
<v Speaker 6>It's just refers to other words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the words themselves refer to </v>

2659
02:25:33.930 --> 02:25:37.741
<v Speaker 6>something else and the law refers to </v>
<v Speaker 6>something else and without that it has </v>

2660
02:25:37.741 --> 02:25:42.691
<v Speaker 6>to be in tune with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Something else has to be in accordance </v>

2661
02:25:42.691 --> 02:25:45.721
<v Speaker 6>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I don't think we can ever </v>

2662
02:25:45.721 --> 02:25:49.050
<v Speaker 6>delineate the proper body of laws and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's also why you like ideological </v>

2663
02:25:49.661 --> 02:25:51.200
<v Speaker 6>utopias.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

2664
02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:54.550
<v Speaker 6>the ideological utopia is dispensed with</v>
<v Speaker 6>the transcendent.</v>

2665
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:58.120
<v Speaker 6>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what we need to do.</v>

2666
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:59.380
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2667
02:25:59.410 --> 02:26:00.130
<v Speaker 6>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2668
02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:05.460
<v Speaker 6>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to leave space for what you </v>

2669
02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:06.850
<v Speaker 6>kind of known for what you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I mean,</v>

2670
02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:08.980
<v Speaker 6>you know in the story of the Tower of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Babel,</v>

2671
02:26:08.981 --> 02:26:13.810
<v Speaker 6>human beings make this massive building.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's supposed to reach up to the heavens</v>

2672
02:26:13.811 --> 02:26:16.030
<v Speaker 6>so that it'll take the place of God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2673
02:26:16.031 --> 02:26:21.031
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the earliest warning we have of </v>

2674
02:26:21.031 --> 02:26:24.720
<v Speaker 6>the danger of making things so big that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you confuse them with God and God gets </v>

2675
02:26:25.301 --> 02:26:30.301
<v Speaker 6>irritated and comes down and makes </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody speak different languages and </v>

2676
02:26:30.301 --> 02:26:30.301
<v Speaker 6>scatters them.</v>

2677
02:26:30.301 --> 02:26:30.301
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2678
02:26:30.301 --> 02:26:34.711
<v Speaker 6>that's what happens when you try to make</v>
<v Speaker 6>something a totality is that it starts </v>

2679
02:26:34.711 --> 02:26:38.400
<v Speaker 6>to fragment inside and disintegrates </v>
<v Speaker 6>into catastrophe and so it's,</v>

2680
02:26:38.430 --> 02:26:43.330
<v Speaker 6>it's almost as if we have to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 6>this articulated space inside the dream,</v>

2681
02:26:43.331 --> 02:26:46.240
<v Speaker 6>inside the customer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that because otherwise it</v>

2682
02:26:46.241 --> 02:26:51.241
<v Speaker 6>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's the same as having </v>

2683
02:26:51.241 --> 02:26:51.241
<v Speaker 6>respect for the fact that we have </v>
<v Speaker 6>bodies.</v>

2684
02:26:51.241 --> 02:26:56.100
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're not just abstract creatures that </v>

2685
02:26:56.100 --> 02:26:56.100
<v Speaker 6>follow rules.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're not that at all,</v>

2686
02:26:56.100 --> 02:27:01.080
<v Speaker 6>we only follow certain rules,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we won't follow the other ones and our </v>

2687
02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:03.070
<v Speaker 6>societies will crumble.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>

2688
02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.520
<v Speaker 6>and we just don't know enough to </v>
<v Speaker 6>articulate the entire landscape of </v>

2689
02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:10.720
<v Speaker 6>behavior with articulated rules.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not at all.</v>

2690
02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:12.400
<v Speaker 6>We can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's beyond us.</v>

2691
02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:14.170
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

2692
02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:24.110
<v Speaker 12>Thanks for the talk.</v>
<v Speaker 12>My question is also about dreams.</v>

2693
02:27:24.111 --> 02:27:26.630
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you spoke about dreams as a,</v>

2694
02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:30.650
<v Speaker 12>like a representation of truth and </v>
<v Speaker 12>universal truths that,</v>

2695
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:34.470
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>can be interpreted into like myths and,</v>

2696
02:27:34.490 --> 02:27:37.730
<v Speaker 12>and religion and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>as,</v>

2697
02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:42.820
<v Speaker 12>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's very beneficial for the individual </v>

2698
02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:46.091
<v Speaker 12>and it sounds like also for,</v>
<v Speaker 12>for the society as well because not </v>

2699
02:27:46.091 --> 02:27:50.141
<v Speaker 12>everyone can as easily.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm a rep,</v>

2700
02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:53.540
<v Speaker 12>remember their dreams are or interpreted</v>
<v Speaker 12>their creams like that.</v>

2701
02:27:54.050 --> 02:27:55.460
<v Speaker 12>And also it's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>

2702
02:27:55.461 --> 02:27:57.710
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like broadcast at to,</v>

2703
02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.800
<v Speaker 12>to all of society for their benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So I guess I'm wondering what the </v>

2704
02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:06.380
<v Speaker 12>evolutionary advantage of dreams are.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And my question would be,</v>

2705
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:11.830
<v Speaker 12>do you think that dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm a suggests some sort of a </v>

2706
02:28:12.510 --> 02:28:17.450
<v Speaker 12>evolutionary group selection such that </v>
<v Speaker 12>like groups that don't have these dreams</v>

2707
02:28:17.451 --> 02:28:20.210
<v Speaker 12>that are represented into myths and </v>
<v Speaker 12>religion to be think they,</v>

2708
02:28:20.330 --> 02:28:21.950
<v Speaker 12>they didn't as well.</v>

2709
02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:27.400
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I'm not gonna answer the second part </v>

2710
02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:29.741
<v Speaker 6>of that question because I'd have to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>far too far off at a tangent for me to </v>

2711
02:28:29.751 --> 02:28:34.751
<v Speaker 6>manage right now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I can answer the first part being </v>

2712
02:28:34.751 --> 02:28:35.840
<v Speaker 6>what happens when you're dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a little switch so to speak,</v>

2713
02:28:35.841 --> 02:28:38.960
<v Speaker 6>in your brain that shuts off when you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>dreaming and it stops you from moving,</v>

2714
02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:41.840
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It shuts everything off except your eyes</v>

2715
02:28:41.900 --> 02:28:44.300
<v Speaker 6>because you know you're moving your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 6>back and forth.</v>

2716
02:28:44.301 --> 02:28:46.730
<v Speaker 6>You're not going to get run around and </v>
<v Speaker 6>get eaten by a lion.</v>

2717
02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:51.760
<v Speaker 6>It's okay to move your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the rescue was standing exactly </v>

2718
02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:54.791
<v Speaker 6>where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you can run these simulations and </v>

2719
02:28:54.791 --> 02:28:58.181
<v Speaker 6>so what's happening at night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this is a fairly well accepted </v>

2720
02:28:58.181 --> 02:29:02.050
<v Speaker 6>theory of dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know that dreams update memories and </v>

2721
02:29:02.050 --> 02:29:02.330
<v Speaker 6>help consolidate memories.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They also help you forget,</v>

2722
02:29:02.810 --> 02:29:05.690
<v Speaker 6>but what seems to be happening at night </v>
<v Speaker 6>is that you're.</v>

2723
02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:10.900
<v Speaker 6>You're running the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 6>architecture of your cognitive ability </v>

2724
02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:12.420
<v Speaker 6>in different simulations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we're,</v>

2725
02:29:12.430 --> 02:29:14.930
<v Speaker 6>and it's cost free because you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>paralyzed,</v>

2726
02:29:14.931 --> 02:29:17.570
<v Speaker 6>you're not running around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're owed in the world investigating,</v>

2727
02:29:17.571 --> 02:29:22.571
<v Speaker 6>so it's part of the manner in which your</v>
<v Speaker 6>brain experiments with the way the world</v>

2728
02:29:23.061 --> 02:29:28.061
<v Speaker 6>can be represented and so and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely necessary and I mean if you </v>

2729
02:29:29.301 --> 02:29:33.200
<v Speaker 6>deprive people of rem sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't stay sane very long.</v>

2730
02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:37.190
<v Speaker 6>There's something necessary about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dreaming process to maintenance of the,</v>

2731
02:29:37.550 --> 02:29:38.390
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2732
02:29:38.510 --> 02:29:43.510
<v Speaker 6>of articulated sanity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you're doing some kind of </v>

2733
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:45.620
<v Speaker 6>organization at night when you descend </v>
<v Speaker 6>into that chaos.</v>

2734
02:29:45.621 --> 02:29:49.120
<v Speaker 6>And partly what seems to happen is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>your categorical no,</v>

2735
02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:51.800
<v Speaker 6>your categories have boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2736
02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:56.920
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you don't have the categories </v>
<v Speaker 6>correct and so the boundaries have to </v>

2737
02:29:56.920 --> 02:30:00.791
<v Speaker 6>loosen and other things need to be put </v>
<v Speaker 6>into categories where some things </v>

2738
02:30:00.791 --> 02:30:02.570
<v Speaker 6>shunted away and in the dream the </v>
<v Speaker 6>category structure loosens,</v>

2739
02:30:02.571 --> 02:30:06.860
<v Speaker 6>which is why dreams are so cute,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're experimenting.</v>

2740
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:12.010
<v Speaker 6>It's your mind is experimenting with the</v>
<v Speaker 6>underlying categorical structure of </v>

2741
02:30:12.010 --> 02:30:16.391
<v Speaker 6>imagination and trying to update your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your mode of being in the world.</v>

2742
02:30:16.970 --> 02:30:20.120
<v Speaker 6>Dreams often concentrate on things that </v>
<v Speaker 6>provoke anxiety.</v>

2743
02:30:20.121 --> 02:30:21.680
<v Speaker 6>So if you wake people up when they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>dreaming,</v>

2744
02:30:21.681 --> 02:30:24.680
<v Speaker 6>the most commonly reported emotion is </v>
<v Speaker 6>anxiety.</v>

2745
02:30:25.010 --> 02:30:30.010
<v Speaker 6>And so the dream is like the first </v>
<v Speaker 6>stages of the attempt to contend with </v>

2746
02:30:30.010 --> 02:30:34.451
<v Speaker 6>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so the dream is half unknown and </v>

2747
02:30:34.451 --> 02:30:35.660
<v Speaker 6>half known,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is also why it's so peculiar,</v>

2748
02:30:35.661 --> 02:30:37.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because you kind of understand it,</v>

2749
02:30:37.131 --> 02:30:38.650
<v Speaker 6>but you don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it,</v>

2750
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:43.710
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it partakes of the unknown and of the </v>

2751
02:30:43.710 --> 02:30:43.710
<v Speaker 6>note and it's the bridge between the </v>
<v Speaker 6>two,</v>

2752
02:30:43.710 --> 02:30:45.170
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2753
02:30:54.050 --> 02:30:54.680
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>okay.</v>

2754
02:30:54.681 --> 02:30:59.681
<v Speaker 11>So my question is kind of two parts.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The first one is just like a general </v>

2755
02:30:59.681 --> 02:31:00.800
<v Speaker 11>question and then just the application </v>
<v Speaker 11>of the question.</v>

2756
02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:06.100
<v Speaker 11>So my first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 11>do you think that consciousness and </v>

2757
02:31:06.100 --> 02:31:07.100
<v Speaker 11>being hood are inextricably,</v>
<v Speaker 11>inextricably linked?</v>

2758
02:31:07.430 --> 02:31:12.430
<v Speaker 11>And then secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 11>so if there was something like a </v>

2759
02:31:12.430 --> 02:31:15.550
<v Speaker 11>supercomputer that one could have </v>
<v Speaker 11>theoretically a perfect brain of a </v>

2760
02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:19.121
<v Speaker 11>person in it,</v>
<v Speaker 11>does that thing then become the same </v>

2761
02:31:19.121 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 11>person as the person who was before?</v>
<v Speaker 11>So is</v>

2762
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:23.190
<v Speaker 6>there a transcendence he to be in hood </v>
<v Speaker 6>but not too conscious.</v>

2763
02:31:23.250 --> 02:31:24.780
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the first question is,</v>

2764
02:31:24.810 --> 02:31:29.810
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say that the kind of being that </v>

2765
02:31:29.810 --> 02:31:31.110
<v Speaker 6>these stories are concerned with is </v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely dependent on consciousness.</v>

2766
02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:36.560
<v Speaker 6>Now whether or not that means that being</v>
<v Speaker 6>as such as dependent on consciousness </v>

2767
02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:37.950
<v Speaker 6>actually depends on how you define Ba.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2768
02:31:37.951 --> 02:31:41.070
<v Speaker 6>So it's always tricky when you ask an a </v>
<v Speaker 6>if is a,</v>

2769
02:31:41.340 --> 02:31:44.010
<v Speaker 6>an instant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an example of b.</v>

2770
02:31:44.130 --> 02:31:47.070
<v Speaker 6>There was a tricky question because it </v>
<v Speaker 6>depends on how you define the two,</v>

2771
02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:52.280
<v Speaker 6>but for our purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the being that we're discussing that's </v>

2772
02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:55.731
<v Speaker 6>represented in these stories is </v>
<v Speaker 6>intrinsically associated with conscious </v>

2773
02:31:55.731 --> 02:31:59.721
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And consciousness is given this </v>

2774
02:31:59.721 --> 02:32:04.570
<v Speaker 6>constitutive role.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It says that the experience that we're </v>

2775
02:32:04.570 --> 02:32:05.760
<v Speaker 6>talking about would not exist if </v>
<v Speaker 6>consciousness did not exist.</v>

2776
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:11.150
<v Speaker 6>So you can think about it as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>game in a way and then you have to </v>

2777
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:12.150
<v Speaker 6>decide for yourself whether that's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>game that can be generalized.</v>

2778
02:32:12.390 --> 02:32:14.760
<v Speaker 6>And I won't answer the second part.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2779
02:32:15.090 --> 02:32:15.780
<v Speaker 6>If you don't mind.</v>

2780
02:32:16.270 --> 02:32:21.270
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So two part question.</v>

2781
02:32:22.131 --> 02:32:22.510
<v Speaker 5>First one</v>

2782
02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:23.690
<v Speaker 10>very quick,</v>
<v Speaker 10>almost admin.</v>

2783
02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:27.620
<v Speaker 10>If we want to read the biblical stories </v>
<v Speaker 10>that you're referring to is a particular</v>

2784
02:32:27.621 --> 02:32:28.300
<v Speaker 10>version,</v>
<v Speaker 10>edition,</v>

2785
02:32:28.310 --> 02:32:29.090
<v Speaker 10>source publisher.</v>

2786
02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:32.330
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll bring the thing I like next week,</v>

2787
02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:35.030
<v Speaker 6>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the reader's digest published it</v>

2788
02:32:35.031 --> 02:32:36.710
<v Speaker 6>of all things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

2789
02:32:36.711 --> 02:32:37.960
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2790
02:32:38.060 --> 02:32:38.690
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2791
02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.810
<v Speaker 6>it lays out the narratives in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>different format.</v>

2792
02:32:41.811 --> 02:32:43.640
<v Speaker 6>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I find it much easier to read.</v>

2793
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:46.130
<v Speaker 6>So I'll show it to you and I'll bring it</v>
<v Speaker 6>next time and show it to you.</v>

2794
02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:49.990
<v Speaker 10>The main question is one of the main </v>
<v Speaker 10>reasons why I'm interested in so much of</v>

2795
02:32:49.991 --> 02:32:54.991
<v Speaker 10>your work and I think as well as you </v>
<v Speaker 10>kind of liberalism at the door and you </v>

2796
02:32:54.991 --> 02:32:58.711
<v Speaker 10>open up another door to have a much more</v>
<v Speaker 10>deeper meaning in your interview with </v>

2797
02:32:58.711 --> 02:32:59.370
<v Speaker 10>Trans Liminal media.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You mentioned his eyeballs,</v>

2798
02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:03.520
<v Speaker 10>book of the serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the tree and vision,</v>

2799
02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:08.880
<v Speaker 10>and you note that we as a species are </v>
<v Speaker 10>very good at recognizing camouflage </v>

2800
02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:09.850
<v Speaker 10>patterns of snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>particularly in the law field of vision.</v>

2801
02:33:10.210 --> 02:33:15.210
<v Speaker 10>And you further note that visual </v>
<v Speaker 10>acuities is correlated with that and </v>

2802
02:33:15.210 --> 02:33:19.201
<v Speaker 10>that it could bold.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And you summarize that by saying the </v>

2803
02:33:19.201 --> 02:33:19.201
<v Speaker 10>following.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm paraphrasing you.</v>

2804
02:33:19.201 --> 02:33:20.170
<v Speaker 10>You say what gives you vision?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Snakes do.</v>

2805
02:33:20.530 --> 02:33:22.960
<v Speaker 10>That's what it says in Genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What else gives you vision?</v>

2806
02:33:22.961 --> 02:33:24.130
<v Speaker 10>Fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's also right.</v>

2807
02:33:24.490 --> 02:33:26.650
<v Speaker 10>That's why we have color vision.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What makes you self conscious?</v>

2808
02:33:26.651 --> 02:33:28.000
<v Speaker 10>Fear Man,</v>
<v Speaker 10>woman.</v>

2809
02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:33.040
<v Speaker 10>That's eve.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so I understand that the elementary </v>

2810
02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:33.040
<v Speaker 10>level,</v>
<v Speaker 10>some of the concepts that you have about</v>

2811
02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:33.160
<v Speaker 10>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 10>dreams,</v>

2812
02:33:33.161 --> 02:33:34.150
<v Speaker 10>abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 10>et Cetera,</v>

2813
02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:36.940
<v Speaker 10>but kind of raises the question for me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

2814
02:33:36.941 --> 02:33:39.100
<v Speaker 10>I'm not accusing you of any creationism </v>
<v Speaker 10>or literalism.</v>

2815
02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:41.890
<v Speaker 10>What's your point?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Why did you make that connection?</v>

2816
02:33:41.891 --> 02:33:46.060
<v Speaker 10>What's the meaning of the story of </v>
<v Speaker 10>Genesis Visa VI Liberals Book?</v>

2817
02:33:46.170 --> 02:33:51.170
<v Speaker 6>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're gonna as soon as I get past this </v>

2818
02:33:51.170 --> 02:33:51.840
<v Speaker 6>first,</v>
<v Speaker 6>genesis one,</v>

2819
02:33:51.841 --> 02:33:56.841
<v Speaker 6>we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're gonna hit that hard partly.</v>

2820
02:34:00.810 --> 02:34:02.430
<v Speaker 5>Are you at all suggesting that one?</v>

2821
02:34:06.410 --> 02:34:11.410
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm suggesting that it foreshadowed it </v>

2822
02:34:11.410 --> 02:34:12.710
<v Speaker 6>and and I think they're the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean his belt and her books plays with</v>

2823
02:34:12.711 --> 02:34:16.040
<v Speaker 6>that idea metaphorically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but she never really takes it seriously,</v>

2824
02:34:16.041 --> 02:34:17.230
<v Speaker 6>which is no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2825
02:34:17.231 --> 02:34:20.170
<v Speaker 6>there's only so much you can take </v>
<v Speaker 6>seriously and she did a fine job of what</v>

2826
02:34:20.171 --> 02:34:25.171
<v Speaker 6>you did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'll talk about that a lot because </v>

2827
02:34:25.171 --> 02:34:25.240
<v Speaker 6>it's a very complicated issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2828
02:34:25.241 --> 02:34:27.000
<v Speaker 6>I would say to begin with that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2829
02:34:27.490 --> 02:34:32.490
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the systems that you use to deal with </v>

2830
02:34:32.490 --> 02:34:34.390
<v Speaker 6>radical uncertainty or the same systems </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're primate ancestors evolved to</v>

2831
02:34:34.391 --> 02:34:37.060
<v Speaker 6>deal with snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good start.</v>

2832
02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:38.990
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2833
02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:40.720
<v Speaker 6>One more and then we're done.</v>

2834
02:34:45.020 --> 02:34:50.020
<v Speaker 9>I'm an aerospace science engineer and an</v>
<v Speaker 9>expert computer programmer and I have </v>

2835
02:34:50.020 --> 02:34:51.230
<v Speaker 9>three rapid fire questions,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so I'm going to get through quick.</v>

2836
02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:56.980
<v Speaker 9>Based on your opinion of where the </v>
<v Speaker 9>university is now standing in terms of </v>

2837
02:34:56.980 --> 02:35:00.851
<v Speaker 9>humanities and social sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is mathematics more powerful than </v>

2838
02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:02.330
<v Speaker 9>articulated speech?</v>

2839
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:10.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not exactly sure how the more </v>

2840
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:12.970
<v Speaker 6>powerful to study mathematics and </v>
<v Speaker 6>science in university.</v>

2841
02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:16.600
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it depends on what you mean by power,</v>

2842
02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:21.960
<v Speaker 6>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean obviously studying mathematics </v>

2843
02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:22.420
<v Speaker 6>and computer science makes you insanely </v>
<v Speaker 6>powerful.</v>

2844
02:35:22.421 --> 02:35:27.421
<v Speaker 6>The question is to what end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I don't think that you can extract </v>

2845
02:35:27.421 --> 02:35:28.840
<v Speaker 6>an answer to that from the study of </v>
<v Speaker 6>mathematics.</v>

2846
02:35:28.841 --> 02:35:32.320
<v Speaker 6>The humanities are there to ground </v>
<v Speaker 6>people in proper citizen hood.</v>

2847
02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:34.720
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a way of thinking about it and so</v>

2848
02:35:34.930 --> 02:35:36.190
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it makes you powerful,</v>

2849
02:35:36.191 --> 02:35:38.740
<v Speaker 6>but then the question is who has the </v>
<v Speaker 6>power?</v>

2850
02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:42.370
<v Speaker 6>Because it might not be you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it might be the mathematics,</v>

2851
02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:43.870
<v Speaker 6>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2852
02:35:43.871 --> 02:35:48.840
<v Speaker 6>because you never know what you're an </v>
<v Speaker 6>agent of precisely and so harvest.</v>

2853
02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:49.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well look,</v>

2854
02:35:49.901 --> 02:35:51.790
<v Speaker 6>I've got nothing against computer </v>
<v Speaker 6>programmers.</v>

2855
02:35:51.791 --> 02:35:54.370
<v Speaker 6>I mean more power to you guys and </v>
<v Speaker 6>mathematicians as well,</v>

2856
02:35:54.371 --> 02:35:58.670
<v Speaker 6>but the tool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it has to be a two,</v>

2857
02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:00.690
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has to be a tool.</v>

2858
02:36:00.691 --> 02:36:05.691
<v Speaker 6>I'll have something and what the </v>
<v Speaker 6>humanities were forward to take was to </v>

2859
02:36:05.691 --> 02:36:09.070
<v Speaker 6>tell people what the tools shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 6>used for and so the tools themselves are</v>

2860
02:36:09.310 --> 02:36:11.490
<v Speaker 6>crazily powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's,</v>

2861
02:36:11.540 --> 02:36:13.600
<v Speaker 6>that's not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2862
02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:15.670
<v Speaker 6>an,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an untrammeled good.</v>

2863
02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:20.040
<v Speaker 6>So I have to stop because.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2864
02:36:20.050 --> 02:36:20.410
<v Speaker 6>Quick.</v>

2865
02:36:22.210 --> 02:36:25.270
<v Speaker 9>You want to answer this question?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

2866
02:36:25.490 --> 02:36:30.490
<v Speaker 9>You were in this I guess one room in a </v>
<v Speaker 9>museum in New York seeing some original </v>

2867
02:36:30.490 --> 02:36:34.841
<v Speaker 9>renaissance art work masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 9>These are generally accepted as amazing </v>

2868
02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:35.810
<v Speaker 9>artifacts.</v>

2869
02:36:35.890 --> 02:36:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2870
02:36:40.650 --> 02:36:45.650
<v Speaker 9>Does a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>an original work of art as opposed to a </v>

2871
02:36:45.650 --> 02:36:49.101
<v Speaker 9>high fidelity reproduction contained the</v>
<v Speaker 9>spirit of the artist who created it and </v>

2872
02:36:49.321 --> 02:36:52.820
<v Speaker 9>does this account for the disparity and </v>
<v Speaker 9>how much you'd have to pay for it.</v>

2873
02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:56.990
<v Speaker 6>It does impart a good portrait artist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2874
02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:02.280
<v Speaker 6>one of the things he pointed out about a</v>
<v Speaker 6>great portrait is that it actually </v>

2875
02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:02.770
<v Speaker 6>contains time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

2876
02:37:02.771 --> 02:37:07.771
<v Speaker 6>because a photograph is one instant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a portrait is you layered on,</v>

2877
02:37:07.871 --> 02:37:10.750
<v Speaker 6>you layered on you late.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's gonna thickness,</v>

2878
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when there,</v>

2879
02:37:11.530 --> 02:37:14.170
<v Speaker 6>I think you can see that thickness in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the original,</v>

2880
02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:18.320
<v Speaker 6>but it's also a direct manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 6>that creative act of perception.</v>

2881
02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:23.620
<v Speaker 6>And I don't think you get that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just can't get the fidelity of the </v>

2882
02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:27.881
<v Speaker 6>original with the reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's more to it than that too </v>

2883
02:37:27.881 --> 02:37:28.340
<v Speaker 6>because the painting doesn't end with </v>
<v Speaker 6>the frame.</v>

2884
02:37:28.670 --> 02:37:33.670
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we tend to think of the painting </v>

2885
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.670
<v Speaker 6>itself as the object,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

2886
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:37.450
<v Speaker 6>but most objects are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are densely innervated with hisd with </v>

2887
02:37:37.450 --> 02:37:39.470
<v Speaker 6>historical context.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you can say,</v>

2888
02:37:39.471 --> 02:37:41.780
<v Speaker 6>well the historical context isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 6>object,</v>

2889
02:37:41.781 --> 02:37:43.940
<v Speaker 6>but it depends on what you mean by the </v>
<v Speaker 6>object.</v>

2890
02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:49.210
<v Speaker 6>And often people when they buy a piece </v>
<v Speaker 6>of a painting are buying the historical </v>

2891
02:37:49.210 --> 02:37:51.200
<v Speaker 6>context and you just don't get that with</v>
<v Speaker 6>the reproduction.</v>

2892
02:37:51.470 --> 02:37:53.180
<v Speaker 6>It's a kind of magic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2893
02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:58.360
<v Speaker 6>do you want to have Elvis Presley's </v>
<v Speaker 6>guitar or another guitar just like it </v>

2894
02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:02.470
<v Speaker 6>while you want to have Elvis's guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's why you can't tell it's Elvis's </v>

2895
02:38:02.470 --> 02:38:02.810
<v Speaker 6>guitar by looking at it.</v>

2896
02:38:06.970 --> 02:38:11.970
<v Speaker 6>Perfect reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2897
02:38:12.290 --> 02:38:15.500
<v Speaker 6>it is at the level of detail,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but not at the level of context.</v>

2898
02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:17.180
<v Speaker 6>That's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2899
02:38:17.181 --> 02:38:17.870
<v Speaker 6>We gotta go.</v>

2900
02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
