00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a very strange day.</v>

2
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to tell you about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and then I'll start the </v>

3
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.031
<v Speaker 1>lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got up this morning and started to </v>

4
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:34.601
<v Speaker 1>put my day together and I tried to sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>into my gmail account and it said that </v>

5
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:41.951
<v Speaker 1>it had been disabled because I violated </v>
<v Speaker 1>the terms of service with g mail.</v>

6
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.780
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't violate any terms of service </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know of now.</v>

8
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>I set up a new youtube channel yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Jordan b Peterson clips and so we</v>

9
00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:01.691
<v Speaker 1>made some technical changes and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought maybe it had something to do </v>

10
00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:04.931
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had been shot out of Google one </v>

11
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:08.621
<v Speaker 1>other time years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you get a shout out like that,</v>

12
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>there's a little form you can fill out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I filled out the form and I said </v>

13
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>that I had been shot out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't know why.</v>

14
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And I sent it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized one of my staff </v>

15
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>members called me and said that she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked out of the youtube account.</v>

16
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

17
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.380
<v Speaker 1>the youtube account is hooked to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gmail Account,</v>

18
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 1>so that meant that I couldn't get access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to any of my youtube videos.</v>

19
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>They were still up and online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't get access to them.</v>

20
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't post last week's Biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture for,</v>

21
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

22
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 1>And so that was worrisome and made me </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicious.</v>

23
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 1>And then about two hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

24
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:56.831
<v Speaker 1>I got an email from Google and they said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had reviewed the my request to</v>

25
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:03.041
<v Speaker 1>be reinstated and that I had violated </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google's terms of agreement or terms of </v>

26
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>service and they weren't going to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>my account back on.</v>

27
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't say why they didn't say </v>

28
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

29
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>there was no warning whatsoever about </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of this.</v>

30
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>They didn't tell me why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't say why in the email </v>

31
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.050
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I wrote them back and I said,</v>

32
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Speaker 1>because they said I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote them back and I said,</v>

33
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>this might not be a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

34
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>and you might want to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I twitted tweeted what had </v>

35
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

36
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.571
<v Speaker 1>I took screenshots and I tweeted and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted a whole bunch of journalists </v>

37
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:44.861
<v Speaker 1>because it turns out that I know a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of journalists and so and so.</v>

38
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:50.321
<v Speaker 1>Then what happened then was that I got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>call from the daily caller in the United</v>

39
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.420
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had done an interview with them last </v>

40
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't posted yet and they </v>

41
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.041
<v Speaker 1>interviewed me and within 20 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>posted it online and so they have a </v>

42
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:07.741
<v Speaker 1>fairly big audience and so that was good</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then somebody phoned me from Ottawa </v>

43
00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>and I did a live radio show about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was good.</v>

44
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.090
<v Speaker 1>And then a number of other journalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted me and I sent them the </v>

45
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another one of my staff actually,</v>

46
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>my son emailed me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

47
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you should hold off because maybe there </v>
<v Speaker 1>still a mistake here.</v>

48
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

49
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 1>there might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be just a mistake,</v>

50
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but then why in the world did I email </v>
<v Speaker 1>google?</v>

51
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:33.841
<v Speaker 1>And they contacted me and they said they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not reinstate it and they didn't </v>

52
00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:37.051
<v Speaker 1>provide me with any information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I contacted the other journalists and</v>

53
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you never know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is just a mistake,</v>

55
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:44.581
<v Speaker 1>so let's hold off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then while I was about half an hour </v>

56
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:48.811
<v Speaker 1>later while I was trying to get into my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used this ad words account that's </v>

57
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>linked to google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't run ads on my videos but I need </v>

58
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.551
<v Speaker 1>the adwords account because it helps me </v>
<v Speaker 1>add some little gadgets to the videos </v>

59
00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>that I wouldn't otherwise be able to.</v>

60
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>And I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was playing with that.</v>

61
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>The system came back online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

62
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.710
<v Speaker 1>well that's interesting and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that emailed me and twittered me </v>

63
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.971
<v Speaker 1>and some people within Google and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people elsewhere and they were doing </v>

64
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:15.901
<v Speaker 1>whatever they were going to do to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>me get all this material back up and </v>

65
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:15.901
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so something worked.</v>

66
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>My suspicions are that what worked was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the publicity now.</v>

67
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not,</v>

68
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:25.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very weird being in this situation </v>

69
00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:29.551
<v Speaker 1>because there has been a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent episodes where these larger </v>

70
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

71
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Google Patrion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's a massive company,</v>

72
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's starting to become reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant,</v>

73
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Speaker 1>have decided on rather arbitrary grounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shut down their users.</v>

74
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And this is very ominous to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because we've,</v>

75
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>we've turned our communications over to </v>
<v Speaker 1>very large systems or very large systems</v>

76
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>have emerged to mediate our </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>

77
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

78
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of benefit to it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to get too cynical about </v>

79
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.561
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're blind with regards to the </v>

80
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:02.730
<v Speaker 1>policies that regulate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

81
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.850
<v Speaker 1>the actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regulatory actions of these large </v>

82
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.850
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really a bad thing.</v>

83
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>And something else has even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>ominous,</v>

84
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>really ominous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.440
<v Speaker 1>it's highly probable that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build political algorithms into our </v>

86
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing will be regulated by machines that</v>

87
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:25.291
<v Speaker 1>no one understands and that's a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad idea and that's a really likely </v>

88
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

89
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I was all confused about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought Jesus,</v>

90
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe I flew off the handle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>because I was sort of was stressful man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>because I have like 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>emails in that account.</v>

93
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a lot of emails and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>my correspondence for the last 10 years,</v>

94
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's an archive as well as an ongoing</v>

95
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>email system.</v>

96
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.080
<v Speaker 1>I have a commercial email system that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just set up three weeks ago with like </v>

97
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>six different email addresses now to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to organize my correspondent so I wasn't</v>

98
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:59.521
<v Speaker 1>completely unable to communicate but my </v>
<v Speaker 1>was gone and that's a bloody disaster </v>

99
00:05:59.521 --> 00:06:04.301
<v Speaker 1>because like I've got things scheduled </v>
<v Speaker 1>out forever and I don't remember what </v>

100
00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:08.201
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember what I'm doing in </v>

101
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.661
<v Speaker 1>a day so much less than a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought maybe I flew off the </v>

102
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:15.401
<v Speaker 1>handle and I was worried that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted the journalists too soon and </v>

103
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:15.401
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

104
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>it all worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what happened?</v>

105
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as I was coming to this lecture,</v>

106
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I stepped outside and there was little </v>
<v Speaker 1>package outside.</v>

107
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Luckily it wasn't a bomb and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>an here's a package outside.</v>

108
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Nice little packages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look,</v>

109
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I looked inside it and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a couple of bottles of wine in </v>

110
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was nice.</v>

111
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.131
<v Speaker 1>And there was a little note and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to read you the little note </v>

112
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:39.131
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

113
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

114
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.180
<v Speaker 1>So this person said that they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally tackled the self authoring </v>

115
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>suite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they seem to be happy about that,</v>

116
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>but that's not so interesting except </v>
<v Speaker 1>peripherally.</v>

117
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>A friend on twitter has contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google engineers.</v>

118
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.060
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

119
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I spoke with some friends inside Google </v>
<v Speaker 1>who offered to help and I did get </v>

120
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.071
<v Speaker 1>contacted by quite a few people at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google who said that they had been </v>

121
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 1>watching my lectures and so on and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy about what I was doing.</v>

122
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke with some friends inside Google </v>

123
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.081
<v Speaker 1>who offered to help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they suggest he set up a backup </v>

124
00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:23.351
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The teams are feeling significant </v>

125
00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:26.201
<v Speaker 1>pressure from advocacy groups and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have at least four Google engineers </v>

126
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:33.461
<v Speaker 1>who offered to speak up on his behalf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they know the team dynamics and </v>

127
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:38.261
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately especially youtube is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>sjw cesspool.</v>

128
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 1>I hope this information is useful to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

129
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

130
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

131
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 1>so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was part of what happened today.</v>

132
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't really understand it </v>

133
00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.521
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know why it got shut </v>

134
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:02.621
<v Speaker 1>down and I don't know if anything I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>got it turned back on and I don't know </v>

135
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:05.240
<v Speaker 1>the reasons for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also rather ominous.</v>

136
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:10.570
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that when I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>it through and was that.</v>

137
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a fairly,</v>

138
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.300
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Respectable Youtube following and I </v>

139
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>don't know if you necessarily call it </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectable.</v>

140
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.910
<v Speaker 1>It's fairly large youtube following and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it would have been </v>

141
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:31.060
<v Speaker 1>appropriate for Google if they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to shut down my account to tell me</v>

142
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:37.181
<v Speaker 1>why I would think and also maybe look me</v>
<v Speaker 1>up maybe especially after I emailed them</v>

143
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe not to have emailed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and said,</v>

144
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to reinstate you,</v>

145
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>but we're not going to tell you any </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons that they didn't say.</v>

146
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't tell me any reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't tell me any reasons.</v>

147
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:54.070
<v Speaker 1>And then it also seems very strange to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that it just all of a sudden went </v>

148
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.691
<v Speaker 1>back on after two hours and so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what to make of that.</v>

149
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe more information will come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>light over the next few days.</v>

150
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I hope that I didn't jump the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

151
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.800
<v Speaker 1>very peculiar set of circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was kind of amusing </v>

152
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the video that they stopped me from</v>

153
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>posting today was the last Biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture.</v>

154
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:25.491
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't necessarily think that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the sort of thing that people </v>

155
00:09:25.491 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 1>would want to stop from being posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

156
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 1>we're in very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange times.</v>

157
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.190
<v Speaker 1>So that was my adventure for today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I didn't,</v>

158
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate speakers who apologized to the </v>

159
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:40.720
<v Speaker 1>crowd before they talk to them because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're speaking to people and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>put all this effort into coming,</v>

161
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:50.211
<v Speaker 1>then you shouldn't tell them what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry and useless creature you are </v>

162
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>before you talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>and asked for their forbearance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness.</v>

164
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little,</v>

165
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you're a little late for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still gonna do that a little bit</v>

166
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 1>today because I wanted to spend all day </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparing this lecture.</v>

167
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've prepared it a lot before hand,</v>

168
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.490
<v Speaker 1>but that rattled me up a lot and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't prepare as much as I could have.</v>

169
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll stumble forward and see how it </v>

170
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

171
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

172
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm reasonably familiar with the stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and so onward and upward.</v>

173
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.140
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to reiterate this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.530
<v Speaker 1>I've learned something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this idea that it would be a good</v>

175
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 1>idea for young people and older people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens of the West,</v>

176
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.710
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn more about their culture and </v>

177
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:40.020
<v Speaker 1>their civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

178
00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a great civilization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

179
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's taken a lot of work to put </v>

180
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:47.540
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that we really know.</v>

181
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know a fair bit about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I wouldn't consider myself </v>

182
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Speaker 1>nearly as educated as a person should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

183
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.430
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not too badly educated and.</v>

184
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.080
<v Speaker 1>But I tell ya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through these biblical lectures </v>

185
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.020
<v Speaker 1>verse by verse just makes me even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of how unbelievably ignorant I am,</v>

186
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and partly for two reasons.</v>

187
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.240
<v Speaker 1>One is because I've been using this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bible hub dotcom place and I think I </v>

188
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.501
<v Speaker 1>told you last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to reiterate it because </v>

189
00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting the way that they've</v>

190
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:24.801
<v Speaker 1>set it up because you can go through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical stories verse by verse and then</v>

191
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:30.170
<v Speaker 1>for each verse there's a whole small </v>
<v Speaker 1>font page of commentary from multiple </v>

192
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.780
<v Speaker 1>sources and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is the Bible hybrid hyperlinked</v>

193
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>in the way that I discussed in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture with all the verses referring to</v>

194
00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:39.780
<v Speaker 1>not all the other verses but lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

195
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's got its tendrils out into </v>

196
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.080
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.030
<v Speaker 1>direct commentaries on the text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also all the,</v>

198
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>all the literature that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by it.</v>

199
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

200
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 1>it's an unbelievably central and text </v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

201
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.220
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting to read a book where</v>
<v Speaker 2>every sentence has been commented on </v>

202
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 2>what really in volumes and then just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a sense of that volume of material.</v>

203
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:09.361
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much power brain power there's been </v>

204
00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:09.361
<v Speaker 2>put into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

205
00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 2>and to also understand how bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorant,</v>

206
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.680
<v Speaker 2>like I'm so ignorant about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all this work and it seems that </v>

207
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.660
<v Speaker 2>we've left at to decay in the dust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big mistake,</v>

208
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:24.661
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big mistake because the people </v>

209
00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:24.661
<v Speaker 2>who were writing these commentaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

210
00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:26.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it's from the 14th and 15th and</v>

211
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 2>16th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of archaic and it's,</v>

212
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.090
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it's outdated and some of it you</v>

213
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:36.091
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you read all the commentaries </v>

214
00:12:36.091 --> 00:12:36.091
<v Speaker 2>side by side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

215
00:12:36.091 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 2>you get a pretty good blast of wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming at you.</v>

216
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:42.271
<v Speaker 2>And like the thing about wisdom is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>stops you from running face first into </v>

217
00:12:42.271 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 2>walls.</v>

218
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just there to,</v>

219
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:49.410
<v Speaker 2>to so that you can talk to people at </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties about what university you </v>

220
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:49.630
<v Speaker 2>graduated from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

221
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.070
<v Speaker 2>and it's there because the information </v>
<v Speaker 2>is unbelievably useful.</v>

222
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I realized that I</v>

223
00:12:56.471 --> 00:13:01.471
<v Speaker 2>want to return to tonight because I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been thinking a lot about this idea of </v>

224
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:01.471
<v Speaker 2>the arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

225
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:05.401
<v Speaker 2>and I think I mentioned to you last week</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'd figured out that there's this </v>

226
00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:09.751
<v Speaker 2>idea that noah was perfect in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations and that meant that he has </v>

227
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Speaker 2>said his family in order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just him,</v>

228
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 2>but he had said his family in order and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that,</v>

229
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:14.110
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the catastrophe came,</v>

230
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.830
<v Speaker 2>like it comes to everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was able to withstand it because he </v>

231
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.400
<v Speaker 2>had the support of the people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>near and dear to him.</v>

232
00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:24.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's really important when things </v>
<v Speaker 2>come along to lay you low,</v>

233
00:13:24.741 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 2>like if you're alone and in the flood </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes,</v>

234
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 2>it's like man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodbye to you.</v>

235
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.520
<v Speaker 2>If you've got 10 or 15 people supporting</v>
<v Speaker 2>you in a tight network,</v>

236
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:33.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

237
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:38.961
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're interrelationships with them are </v>

238
00:13:38.961 --> 00:13:40.030
<v Speaker 2>pristine and you can tell them the truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can tell the truth back to you.</v>

239
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.240
<v Speaker 2>It's possible that you might be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find that thin way that will preserve </v>

240
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

241
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

242
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.470
<v Speaker 2>when you know the terrible things come </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocking at your door.</v>

243
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.850
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this idea of the arc is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

244
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:59.851
<v Speaker 2>very concrete in Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a structure that that he </v>

245
00:13:59.851 --> 00:13:59.851
<v Speaker 2>inhabits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

246
00:13:59.851 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 2>what's a concretized almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>child's story,</v>

247
00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:07.201
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not being cynical about that </v>

248
00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:07.450
<v Speaker 2>because there are some bloody brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 2>child children's stories,</v>

249
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really concretized,</v>

250
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Speaker 2>but then Abraham comes along and instead</v>
<v Speaker 2>of an arc,</v>

251
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:15.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a covenant right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says in the story of Noah,</v>

252
00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 2>that Noah walked with God and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course Abraham,</v>

253
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.910
<v Speaker 2>it isn't clear exactly these walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>with God or before God,</v>

254
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:24.170
<v Speaker 2>which we'll get into later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you see,</v>

255
00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I see this as part of the increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>psycho psychology,</v>

256
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 2>ization of the sacred ideas that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>acted out by archaic people.</v>

257
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:36.870
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's concretized in the form of a ship </v>

258
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 2>that actually sustains you when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>floods come,</v>

259
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:39.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

260
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.900
<v Speaker 2>it's very concrete imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of thing you might see in a </v>

261
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:44.900
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then with Abraham,</v>

262
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.230
<v Speaker 2>it turns into a psychological covenant </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense.</v>

263
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:49.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like a contractual agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a country.</v>

264
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 2>It's a contractual agreement between </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham and God,</v>

265
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.710
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't really matter that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

266
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.330
<v Speaker 2>obviously it matters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's only,</v>

267
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Speaker 2>it's only half of what's important about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

268
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 2>The other half is that it's a contract </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

269
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you do with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideal,</v>

270
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:13.271
<v Speaker 2>let's say as you establish a contract </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it and you also establish a social </v>

271
00:15:13.271 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 2>contract with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

272
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:18.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what keeps society organized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's this idea that emerges in the</v>

273
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:23.231
<v Speaker 2>Abraham stories have a sacred contract </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that has the same function as the </v>

274
00:15:23.231 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 2>arc and what it does because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens in Abraham and we'll see more of</v>

275
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:29.630
<v Speaker 2>this today is that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

276
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:34.631
<v Speaker 2>God tells him to go forward into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and we've talked about that last </v>

277
00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:34.631
<v Speaker 2>week and he does that.</v>

278
00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:38.770
<v Speaker 2>He encounters famine and he encounters </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny and he encounters powerful </v>

279
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:39.740
<v Speaker 2>people who want to take from him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is his.</v>

280
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God sends him out in the world,</v>

281
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:43.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like he has an easy ride of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

282
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 2>It isn't easy at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as hard as it can be,</v>

283
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:51.550
<v Speaker 2>but there's this consistent emphasis in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the text and I think it's something </v>

284
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 2>really worth attending to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you maintain your contract,</v>

285
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:59.681
<v Speaker 2>which and that has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to do with honesty and trust </v>

286
00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:00.780
<v Speaker 2>and truth and all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you maintain your contract,</v>

287
00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:05.781
<v Speaker 2>then you have a good possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best possible possibility of making </v>

288
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 2>your way through the catastrophe and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and the.</v>

289
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be naive about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

290
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:16.061
<v Speaker 2>when I read young and I started to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the idea of the hero </v>

291
00:16:16.061 --> 00:16:19.331
<v Speaker 2>archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the idea that the human being </v>

292
00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:19.331
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a force,</v>

293
00:16:19.331 --> 00:16:23.431
<v Speaker 2>a logos forest that can stand up against</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and catastrophe and tragedy and </v>

294
00:16:23.431 --> 00:16:24.380
<v Speaker 2>evil and prevail.</v>

295
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I never did think that that meant that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you did stand up and tell the truth,</v>

296
00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:30.740
<v Speaker 2>that you would necessarily prevail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

297
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

298
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not a magic trick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your best bet.</v>

299
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a better option.</v>

300
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.200
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what's.</v>

301
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 2>That's what that I see the idea is </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerging in the abrahamic texts.</v>

302
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like people are figuring this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be progressive revelation.</v>

303
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:51.401
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can think about that religious </v>

304
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:54.371
<v Speaker 2>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can also think about it as </v>

305
00:16:54.371 --> 00:16:54.371
<v Speaker 2>humanity consulting itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

306
00:16:54.371 --> 00:16:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Each individual talking to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we do when we,</v>

307
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:02.140
<v Speaker 2>when we think and each individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating with every other </v>

308
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.441
<v Speaker 2>individual and gathering a body of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom that helps people or orient </v>

309
00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:11.261
<v Speaker 2>themselves in the toughest conditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an incremental process and I </v>

310
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:15.350
<v Speaker 2>think that I really do believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's speaking purely secularly.</v>

311
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that that's what manifests </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in the biblical stories,</v>

312
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:24.191
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the dawning enlightenment of </v>

313
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:24.191
<v Speaker 2>mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

314
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:28.360
<v Speaker 2>As we start to understand the principles</v>
<v Speaker 2>by which we have to live in order to </v>

315
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.321
<v Speaker 2>orient ourselves properly in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and I also do believe,</v>

316
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.360
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing that's the unspoken </v>

317
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:38.420
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like you don't.</v>

318
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:43.421
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any idea how rich and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfilling your life could be despite </v>

319
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:50.651
<v Speaker 2>its tragedy and limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you stop doing the things that you </v>

320
00:17:50.651 --> 00:17:54.951
<v Speaker 2>know to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really grand experiment and one </v>

321
00:17:54.951 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 2>of the things that God tells Abraham </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly as as the story progresses,</v>

322
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:00.250
<v Speaker 2>especially every time Abraham makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice,</v>

323
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 2>God says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk with me and be perfect at something</v>

324
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:07.950
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and so the injunction is well,</v>

325
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:12.951
<v Speaker 2>aim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high established this relationship with </v>

326
00:18:12.951 --> 00:18:15.921
<v Speaker 2>the highest thing that you can conceive </v>
<v Speaker 2>of which you might as well do that </v>

327
00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:15.921
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

328
00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:15.930
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

329
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Establish a relationship with the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediocre thing you can conceive of or </v>

330
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:25.150
<v Speaker 2>you're going to establish a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the lowest thing you can conceive </v>

331
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.101
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do that and I wouldn't recommend </v>

332
00:18:28.101 --> 00:18:31.191
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really bad thing and there's a </v>

333
00:18:31.191 --> 00:18:32.100
<v Speaker 2>lot of pain associated with that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you know,</v>

334
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:37.101
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's pain that can expand into a </v>

335
00:18:37.101 --> 00:18:39.891
<v Speaker 2>world destroying forests down that route</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's absolutely no doubt about </v>

336
00:18:39.891 --> 00:18:41.430
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is there something superstitious</v>

337
00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:46.431
<v Speaker 2>and foolish about attempting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>establish a contractual relationship </v>

338
00:18:46.431 --> 00:18:48.720
<v Speaker 2>with the source of all being?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

339
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

340
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:54.590
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an erroneous conception and you know,</v>

341
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessary perhaps to get lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the details.</v>

342
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:02.250
<v Speaker 2>We can argue forever about what God </v>
<v Speaker 2>might or might not be,</v>

343
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:07.251
<v Speaker 2>but we could at least say that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concept of God is an embodiment of </v>

344
00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 2>humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highest ideal,</v>

345
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could at least agree on that.</v>

346
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

347
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:17.031
<v Speaker 2>is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing I would say about </v>

348
00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:18.840
<v Speaker 2>that is there's a lot of things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world we don't understand.</v>

349
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:24.020
<v Speaker 2>And the second thing I would say is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>depends bloody well on what you mean by </v>

350
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.720
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

351
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.180
<v Speaker 2>And that turns out to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated question.</v>

352
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.710
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

353
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we left Abraham,</v>

354
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:40.131
<v Speaker 2>remember at the end last time he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>just gone off to fight a bunch of kings </v>

355
00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:44.661
<v Speaker 2>and get his nephew back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seemed to be a pretty courageous </v>

356
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 2>act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that brought a story to an end.</v>

357
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:48.570
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what happens in the narrative is</v>

358
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:53.571
<v Speaker 2>that there's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Abraham is somewhere and he goes </v>

359
00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:53.571
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

360
00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:57.621
<v Speaker 2>That's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he has adventures along the way and </v>

361
00:19:57.621 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 2>those adventures are usually the typical</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of adventure,</v>

362
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 2>which is a rift in the structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

363
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.380
<v Speaker 2>And exposure to a kind of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>novelty and then a reconstitution of </v>

364
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the motive being.</v>

365
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's classic classic story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

366
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 2>You are somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a certain way,</v>

367
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.520
<v Speaker 2>you're moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something happens that you don't expect.</v>

368
00:20:14.521 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>It blows you into pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It introduces chaos,</v>

369
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:17.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

370
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you face the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the gold,</v>

371
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:21.420
<v Speaker 2>or maybe the bloody thing eats you in.</v>

372
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.840
<v Speaker 2>The story is over and then and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to where you're going.</v>

373
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 2>But then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

374
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you get to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going?</v>

375
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:32.571
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really important issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that happens </v>

376
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:36.510
<v Speaker 2>to people all the time in their life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they get to where they're going and</v>

377
00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Speaker 2>then they don't know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

378
00:20:38.101 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you graduate from university,</v>

379
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.580
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

380
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.880
<v Speaker 2>story over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are you now?</v>

381
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Who are you the next day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

382
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.450
<v Speaker 2>so what happens is when you succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's the success crisis.</v>

383
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.520
<v Speaker 2>And the success crisis is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

384
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I've run this story to its end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what?</v>

385
00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what happens in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the abrahamic stories.</v>

386
00:21:01.091 --> 00:21:05.710
<v Speaker 2>And there are punctuated by a period of </v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplation and sacrifice,</v>

387
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 2>so every time an abrahamic story comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to its end,</v>

388
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.900
<v Speaker 2>then Abraham makes another sacrifice and</v>
<v Speaker 2>commune with God,</v>

389
00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 2>and then he figures out what to do next </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that seems,</v>

390
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:17.530
<v Speaker 2>that seems right.</v>

391
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:23.130
<v Speaker 2>It seems psychologically right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what you should do when your </v>

392
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 2>story comes to an end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you've achieved what it is that you</v>

393
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:27.070
<v Speaker 2>want to achieve or perhaps when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terribly dire straights,</v>

394
00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 2>but we won't talk about that at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

395
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 2>When you've achieved what you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve.</v>

396
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Then the next question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

397
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:35.590
<v Speaker 2>well now I'm that person or I have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

398
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.680
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I need to do next?</v>

399
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:39.760
<v Speaker 2>And some of that is always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

400
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:44.761
<v Speaker 2>what do I need to give up now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I need to let go of so I can </v>

401
00:21:44.761 --> 00:21:44.761
<v Speaker 2>move to the next plateau?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

402
00:21:44.761 --> 00:21:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Assuming that your life is a hopefully a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sequence of upward moving,</v>

403
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.760
<v Speaker 2>what would you call them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Sisyphus,</v>

404
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:54.250
<v Speaker 2>except you're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each time you climb up the mountain,</v>

405
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 2>you get a little higher on the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>at something like that.</v>

406
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.900
<v Speaker 2>So it says office with an optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>bent and,</v>

407
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:05.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe if you push the rock up the </v>

408
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.390
<v Speaker 2>mountain properly and let it roll down </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

409
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.850
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's okay.</v>

410
00:22:06.851 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Every time you roll it back up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

411
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:13.530
<v Speaker 2>it's better in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that's unrealistic </v>

412
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.771
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Abraham goes and rescues his </v>

413
00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:21.481
<v Speaker 2>nephew from this tyrannical kings that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very brave and he doesn't take any </v>

414
00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 2>reward for it because as far as he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

415
00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:25.360
<v Speaker 2>it's just a manifestation of the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

416
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:30.370
<v Speaker 2>And then he has another vision after </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things.</v>

417
00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:35.371
<v Speaker 2>That's the battle of the word of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord came unto Abraham in a vision </v>

418
00:22:35.371 --> 00:22:35.371
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear not Abraham.</v>

419
00:22:35.371 --> 00:22:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm the shield and I exceeding great </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward.</v>

420
00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.130
<v Speaker 2>And Abraham said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord God,</v>

421
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:44.131
<v Speaker 2>what will give me seeing I go childless </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the steward of my house is this </v>

422
00:22:44.131 --> 00:22:44.131
<v Speaker 2>Eliezer of Damascus.</v>

423
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Abraham said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behold to me,</v>

424
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 2>that was given no seed and lo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one born,</v>

425
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.150
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one born in my host is mine.</v>

426
00:22:51.151 --> 00:22:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Air and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word of the Lord came to him saying,</v>

427
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.160
<v Speaker 2>this shall not be nine heir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he that shall come forth out of own </v>

428
00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.470
<v Speaker 2>own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>own bowels shall be done here,</v>

429
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 2>and he brought him forth abroad and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

430
00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:07.531
<v Speaker 2>now look to heaven and tell the stars if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're able to number the number of </v>

431
00:23:07.531 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said unto him,</v>

432
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.740
<v Speaker 2>so shall thy seed be and neighbor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed in the Lord,</v>

433
00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:13.450
<v Speaker 2>and he counted it to him for </v>
<v Speaker 2>righteousness,</v>

434
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.660
<v Speaker 2>and he said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the Lord that brought the out of </v>

435
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.350
<v Speaker 2>the Chaldees to give this land to you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>inherit it.</v>

436
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:21.520
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord God,</v>

437
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.620
<v Speaker 2>whereby shall I know that I shall </v>
<v Speaker 2>inherit it?</v>

438
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.160
<v Speaker 2>And then he does this sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take me an effort,</v>

439
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.920
<v Speaker 2>a heifer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years old and the sheep goat and a</v>

440
00:23:29.921 --> 00:23:31.660
<v Speaker 2>ram and a turtle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dove and a young pigeon,</v>

441
00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.040
<v Speaker 2>and then God comes down and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham goes into a trance.</v>

442
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 2>That's what it appears to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story and has a great terror.</v>

443
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.600
<v Speaker 2>And then God appears to him and I'll</v>

444
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>just review this commentary again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from Joseph Benson and when the </v>

445
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.401
<v Speaker 1>sun was going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about the time when you wash up </v>

446
00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:54.401
<v Speaker 1>for the evening and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

447
00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:57.980
<v Speaker 1>he's praying and waiting towards evening</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep sleep fell upon Abraham,</v>

448
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.380
<v Speaker 1>not a common sleep through weariness or </v>
<v Speaker 1>carelessness,</v>

449
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:05.381
<v Speaker 1>but a divine ecstasy that being wholly </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken off from things sensible he might </v>

450
00:24:05.381 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 1>be wholly taken up with a contemplation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things spiritual,</v>

451
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 1>very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

452
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:13.901
<v Speaker 1>very strange series of interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it does seem that what happens </v>

453
00:24:13.901 --> 00:24:16.490
<v Speaker 1>to Abraham that he falls into some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of revelatory trance.</v>

454
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.970
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

455
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:19.920
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

456
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:24.950
<v Speaker 1>as I've taken some pains to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really understand such things </v>

457
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:28.841
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can't rule out their existence </v>

458
00:24:28.841 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 1>because there's too much evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do in fact occur.</v>

459
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's a technology that we no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer possess.</v>

460
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:39.041
<v Speaker 1>That's one possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps we no longer know how to access </v>

461
00:24:39.041 --> 00:24:39.041
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of states of consciousness.</v>

462
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly possible and lower horror</v>
<v Speaker 1>of great darkness fell upon him.</v>

463
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.780
<v Speaker 1>This was designed to strike all upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>this spirit of Abraham and to possess </v>

464
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.141
<v Speaker 1>them with holy reverence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy fear prepares the soul for holy </v>

465
00:24:53.141 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 1>joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God humbles first and then lifts,</v>

466
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 1>lifts up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

467
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 1>well I think that's right too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

468
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:03.341
<v Speaker 1>one of the experiences I've had in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life fairly commonly in a variety of </v>

469
00:25:03.341 --> 00:25:07.931
<v Speaker 1>different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is especially true when I was </v>

470
00:25:07.931 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>paying a lot of attention to my dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I did for about 15 years.</v>

471
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:14.321
<v Speaker 1>I guess something like that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would feel like I learned </v>

472
00:25:14.321 --> 00:25:17.891
<v Speaker 1>some things and had sort of consolidated</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and then before I went to sleep I </v>

473
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:17.891
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

474
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to learn something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

475
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.040
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't say that without </v>
<v Speaker 1>trepidation and usually because usually </v>

476
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.431
<v Speaker 1>when you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's not that pleasant because </v>

477
00:25:30.431 --> 00:25:34.451
<v Speaker 1>you usually learn something about why </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong and the deeper the thing </v>

478
00:25:34.451 --> 00:25:37.901
<v Speaker 1>that you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you learn about why you're </v>

479
00:25:37.901 --> 00:25:40.001
<v Speaker 1>wrong and there's a death that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with that because then you </v>

480
00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:40.070
<v Speaker 1>have to let that part of you that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

481
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

482
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

483
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 1>that's the sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

484
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:48.881
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to make a sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be willing to make a </v>

485
00:25:48.881 --> 00:25:49.970
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice before you're going to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and the.</v>

486
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.060
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you'll learn is in proportion to </v>

487
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:59.450
<v Speaker 1>your willingness to make a sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really do believe that.</v>

488
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that as well because I also</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that if you commit to something </v>

489
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.560
<v Speaker 1>that means that you don't do a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

490
00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:14.561
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the sacrifice of all those </v>

491
00:26:14.561 --> 00:26:14.561
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You commit to it and you set your sights</v>

492
00:26:14.561 --> 00:26:18.971
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really commit to it and you get </v>

493
00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:18.971
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

494
00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:22.430
<v Speaker 1>then the probability that that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be successful vastly increases.</v>

495
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's also not a naive</v>
<v Speaker 1>or or a naive way of thinking or a </v>

496
00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:29.360
<v Speaker 1>foolish way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

497
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 1>my experience has been that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

498
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.820
<v Speaker 1>And so back to the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

499
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I do think that we learn in trepidation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that most of the time,</v>

500
00:26:38.271 --> 00:26:43.271
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have to be laid low before the </v>

501
00:26:43.271 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 1>new revelation can make itself</v>

502
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:49.190
<v Speaker 2>manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's also what happens to </v>

503
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.710
<v Speaker 2>people often in psychedelic experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have a bad trip,</v>

504
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.290
<v Speaker 2>is they don't get through the bad part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

505
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.430
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's because there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>mess in their lives now I'm speculating,</v>

506
00:26:56.431 --> 00:27:00.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's informed speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much mess in their lives that</v>

507
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:05.751
<v Speaker 2>the altered state of consciousness makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest that it's like a little trip </v>

508
00:27:05.751 --> 00:27:08.901
<v Speaker 2>through hell and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the mess is so complete and </v>

509
00:27:08.901 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive and all pervading that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way they can get through it.</v>

510
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.920
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they could get through it and started</v>

511
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:16.020
<v Speaker 2>to sort those things out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

512
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:18.540
<v Speaker 2>there would be perhaps a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>

513
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.840
<v Speaker 2>a competent Satori positive revelation </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end.</v>

514
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:27.380
<v Speaker 2>But the first thing is if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn something is that you're going to </v>

515
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.620
<v Speaker 2>encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

516
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 2>you have to figure out what's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you.</v>

517
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.520
<v Speaker 2>You can figure out what wisdom you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>next to guide yourself.</v>

518
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:37.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's no laughing matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

519
00:27:37.471 --> 00:27:38.680
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

520
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 2>so I think that that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what this refers to.</v>

521
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the sort of psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that,</v>

522
00:27:45.031 --> 00:27:50.031
<v Speaker 2>that refers to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think we built this a little bit </v>

523
00:27:50.031 --> 00:27:51.420
<v Speaker 2>into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the future authoring program.</v>

524
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:56.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this really cool paper once </v>

525
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.720
<v Speaker 2>reviewed by this guy named Jeffrey Gray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey Gray wrote a book called the </v>

526
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.230
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychology of anxiety man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is a great book.</v>

527
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.260
<v Speaker 2>It is impossible to read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me really.</v>

528
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:09.290
<v Speaker 2>It took me like six months to read it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that he </v>

529
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:13.521
<v Speaker 2>reviewed about 3000 papers and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all neurological papers and and and </v>

530
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.180
<v Speaker 2>heavy psychological slash biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>

531
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:23.390
<v Speaker 2>He actually read them all and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood them and synthesize them and </v>

532
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:27.981
<v Speaker 2>then he wrote this book about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>synthesis and so and he's very very </v>

533
00:28:27.981 --> 00:28:32.061
<v Speaker 2>careful with this terminology and so to </v>
<v Speaker 2>read the book you have to understand </v>

534
00:28:32.061 --> 00:28:32.760
<v Speaker 2>brain anatomy and you have to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuro,</v>

535
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 2>neuro pharmacology and you have to end </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand animal behavior.</v>

536
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.500
<v Speaker 2>The whole literature on animal behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked whole whopping dose of human </v>

537
00:28:42.601 --> 00:28:45.510
<v Speaker 2>psychology and cybernetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a vicious book,</v>

538
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 2>but you really learn something when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>read it.</v>

539
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:53.781
<v Speaker 2>If you go through it by bit like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>had an overwhelming influence on </v>

540
00:28:53.781 --> 00:28:55.770
<v Speaker 2>psychology even among people who haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>read it,</v>

541
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.160
<v Speaker 2>which is most of the people who cite it </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way and so,</v>

542
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.670
<v Speaker 2>but he said he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He outlined this real cool study.</v>

543
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was a sequence of studies about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to motivate rats and rats are a lot </v>

544
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.850
<v Speaker 2>like us on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

545
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.660
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in positive and negative ways and uh,</v>

546
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biochemically and,</v>

547
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.850
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

548
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.610
<v Speaker 2>psycho pharmacologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very,</v>

549
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:21.500
<v Speaker 2>very similar and they have very complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>social environments and you know,</v>

550
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.760
<v Speaker 2>they have hierarchies and they play and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they laugh.</v>

551
00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:28.761
<v Speaker 2>Jaak Panksepp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jaak Panksepp found out that routes </v>

552
00:29:28.761 --> 00:29:28.761
<v Speaker 2>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you tickle them,</v>

553
00:29:28.761 --> 00:29:29.220
<v Speaker 2>you can tickle them with like the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pencil eraser,</v>

554
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.300
<v Speaker 2>but you can hear them laughing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they laugh ultrasonically like that.</v>

555
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.480
<v Speaker 2>So you have to record it and then slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>it down and then you can hear them </v>

556
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:38.480
<v Speaker 2>giggling away when you take a lump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

557
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 2>so which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

558
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:40.150
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

559
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 2>in I spend $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his study demonstrating that rats </v>

560
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 2>laugh and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

561
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second.</v>

562
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:47.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a major league study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

563
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.420
<v Speaker 2>because he's outlined a eluded circuit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a place circuit.</v>

564
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.610
<v Speaker 2>And Jaak Panksepp discovered the play </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuit had mammals.</v>

565
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a bloody big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

566
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 2>if you get that by like rubbing rats </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a pencil eraser.</v>

567
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Well good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

568
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.850
<v Speaker 2>so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talked a lot about how to motivate a rat</v>

569
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.880
<v Speaker 2>and you might've heard about bf skinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:11.860
<v Speaker 2>he used food pellets to motivate his </v>
<v Speaker 2>rats,</v>

571
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:16.861
<v Speaker 2>but what you don't know about skinner is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those rats were starved to three </v>

572
00:30:16.861 --> 00:30:16.861
<v Speaker 2>quarters of their normal body weight.</v>

573
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:22.110
<v Speaker 2>So they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would work for food and so </v>

574
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.410
<v Speaker 2>skinner's routes were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>oversimplified,</v>

575
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:26.860
<v Speaker 2>but you can get rats to work for food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to be that hungry.</v>

576
00:30:26.861 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 2>You can get them to work for food and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do all sorts of things.</v>

577
00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:33.931
<v Speaker 2>They'll press leavers and they'll open </v>
<v Speaker 2>our open doors and they'll solve </v>

578
00:30:33.941 --> 00:30:36.400
<v Speaker 2>problems and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do all sorts of things.</v>

579
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things you can do to kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of measure how much the rat is motivated</v>

580
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:42.670
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you've run them through a maze</v>

581
00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:45.100
<v Speaker 2>and he knows there's some food at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the maze.</v>

582
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.300
<v Speaker 2>You can tie a little spring to his tail </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see how hard he polls.</v>

583
00:30:49.301 --> 00:30:54.301
<v Speaker 2>When you open the door to the maze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's because that's how much prep </v>

584
00:30:54.301 --> 00:30:55.880
<v Speaker 2>work the route is willing to do so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can measure that or you can see fast,</v>

585
00:30:55.881 --> 00:31:00.881
<v Speaker 2>he skitters down the maze and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get an estimate about the rats </v>

586
00:31:00.881 --> 00:31:04.471
<v Speaker 2>motivation and so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how motivated is a hungry rat?</v>

587
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.420
<v Speaker 2>And the answer would be depends on how </v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry is,</v>

588
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:12.510
<v Speaker 2>but there's another answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also depends on what's chasing him </v>

589
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:16.351
<v Speaker 2>when he was going after the food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a rat and you have food </v>

590
00:31:16.351 --> 00:31:21.121
<v Speaker 2>over here and you walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some cat older rats hate cat odor and </v>

591
00:31:21.121 --> 00:31:25.950
<v Speaker 2>it's innate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never have to see or smell acat to </v>

592
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.520
<v Speaker 2>be absolutely petrified by cat odor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you walked in some cat odor </v>

593
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.290
<v Speaker 2>and then opened the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rat will zoom to that food a lot </v>

594
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.811
<v Speaker 2>faster than it will if it's just hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a rat running away from something </v>

595
00:31:36.811 --> 00:31:41.400
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't want toward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that it does want is a very </v>

596
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 2>motivated rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things we did with the</v>

597
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:46.120
<v Speaker 2>future authoring program that's Germane </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this idea of terror,</v>

598
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:48.200
<v Speaker 2>because there's a business idea in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Old Testament,</v>

599
00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:52.240
<v Speaker 2>the fear of God is the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom and it's a pretty harsh idea,</v>

600
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:57.770
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something really useful </v>

601
00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:59.701
<v Speaker 2>about it because one of the things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see with people all the time is that </v>

602
00:31:59.701 --> 00:32:03.100
<v Speaker 2>there maybe they're trying to stumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward towards their ideal as poorly </v>

603
00:32:03.431 --> 00:32:06.070
<v Speaker 2>defined as it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they're afraid,</v>

604
00:32:06.071 --> 00:32:06.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

605
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.320
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid about what they might </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter and that stops them because </v>

606
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.250
<v Speaker 2>fear does stop people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It freezes you like a prey on them.</v>

607
00:32:12.251 --> 00:32:17.251
<v Speaker 2>And so people move ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they get afraid and then they </v>

608
00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:17.320
<v Speaker 2>start moving ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

609
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.370
<v Speaker 2>and that's not so good because negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion is a really powerful motivator.</v>

610
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:24.430
<v Speaker 2>So we're more motivated by negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion than positive emotion,</v>

611
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.040
<v Speaker 2>quantitatively speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantitative,</v>

612
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:28.990
<v Speaker 2>quantitatively speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can measure that.</v>

613
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because we can only be so happy,</v>

614
00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:33.790
<v Speaker 2>but we can really be suffering and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

615
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.490
<v Speaker 2>so we have to pay more attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>

616
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's bad because the negative can </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop you.</v>

617
00:32:38.801 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 2>And then my clinical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I often talk to people who are trying to</v>

618
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:48.761
<v Speaker 2>make a difficult life decision and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are weighing out the costs and the </v>

619
00:32:48.761 --> 00:32:50.040
<v Speaker 2>benefits of making the life decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

620
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things I always talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them about is wait a second,</v>

621
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 2>that's an incomplete analysis.</v>

622
00:32:55.550 --> 00:33:00.550
<v Speaker 2>You have to weigh out the benefits and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the costs of doing this and you have to </v>

623
00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 2>weigh out the costs and benefits of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

624
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.390
<v Speaker 2>not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the same as the zero that</v>

625
00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:07.220
<v Speaker 2>you assume that you're starting with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

626
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Because to not make a decision also has </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cost and sometimes the cost of not </v>

627
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 2>making a decision is far worse than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cost of making a decision,</v>

628
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:21.130
<v Speaker 2>even if the decision is risky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things you can derive </v>

629
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:21.170
<v Speaker 2>from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is very useful,</v>

630
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.250
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

631
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 2>this is also why it's so useful to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contemplate your mortality,</v>

632
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:29.180
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you're screwed,</v>

633
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:31.520
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

634
00:33:31.521 --> 00:33:33.700
<v Speaker 2>and that actually frees you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you,</v>

635
00:33:33.701 --> 00:33:34.810
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have power,</v>

636
00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.840
<v Speaker 2>hey that has catastrophes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have path b that has </v>

637
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.730
<v Speaker 2>catastrophes and you don't get to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the no catastrophe path,</v>

638
00:33:40.731 --> 00:33:45.731
<v Speaker 2>but you get to pick which one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really something because if </v>

639
00:33:45.731 --> 00:33:49.151
<v Speaker 2>you know that there's terrible risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with everything that you do </v>

640
00:33:49.151 --> 00:33:53.651
<v Speaker 2>and don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can afford to take some risks </v>

641
00:33:53.651 --> 00:33:53.651
<v Speaker 2>because you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

642
00:33:53.651 --> 00:33:57.340
<v Speaker 2>this is all within the arc metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still making the case that despite </v>

643
00:33:57.471 --> 00:33:59.960
<v Speaker 2>the fact that your life is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic,</v>

644
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.900
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make a covenant with the highest</v>

645
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:05.840
<v Speaker 2>ideal and that will take you through it </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way possible.</v>

646
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still making that case.</v>

647
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:08.820
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

648
00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.460
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

649
00:34:12.461 --> 00:34:17.461
<v Speaker 2>well I'm trying to make this decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go try to do something </v>

650
00:34:17.461 --> 00:34:17.461
<v Speaker 2>difficult and isn't that terrifying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>

651
00:34:17.461 --> 00:34:18.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wait a minute,</v>

652
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.010
<v Speaker 2>what's really terrifying is not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

653
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.850
<v Speaker 2>and then you think about the cost of not</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

654
00:34:24.851 --> 00:34:28.180
<v Speaker 2>So in the future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have people do this little meditative</v>

655
00:34:28.181 --> 00:34:29.020
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

656
00:34:29.021 --> 00:34:32.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just think about your insufficiencies by</v>

657
00:34:32.291 --> 00:34:33.490
<v Speaker 2>your own definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

658
00:34:33.491 --> 00:34:38.491
<v Speaker 2>The way that you don't do what you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do about the things that you </v>

659
00:34:38.501 --> 00:34:43.501
<v Speaker 2>do that you shouldn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know you shouldn't do beyond a </v>

660
00:34:43.501 --> 00:34:43.501
<v Speaker 2>shadow of a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

661
00:34:43.501 --> 00:34:47.611
<v Speaker 2>There's some things like that and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad habits and poor aim and all </v>

662
00:34:47.611 --> 00:34:52.151
<v Speaker 2>of resentment and hatred and aggression </v>
<v Speaker 2>and unresolved conflicts and all those </v>

663
00:34:52.151 --> 00:34:54.610
<v Speaker 2>things that are demanding you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>warping you and then think,</v>

664
00:34:54.611 --> 00:34:56.740
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things get the upper hand man,</v>

665
00:34:56.741 --> 00:35:01.741
<v Speaker 2>they get the upper hand and they take </v>
<v Speaker 2>you the worst possible place you could </v>

666
00:35:01.741 --> 00:35:01.750
<v Speaker 2>go in the next three to five years.</v>

667
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:06.780
<v Speaker 2>What exactly does that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you schedule that out and you </v>

668
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:06.780
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

669
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:11.311
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the next time that attempt </v>

670
00:35:11.311 --> 00:35:11.311
<v Speaker 2>Taishan comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

671
00:35:11.311 --> 00:35:15.481
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a lot better for me if I didn't </v>

672
00:35:15.481 --> 00:35:15.481
<v Speaker 2>succumb to this temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

673
00:35:15.481 --> 00:35:16.630
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd look a little better if you didn't</v>

674
00:35:16.631 --> 00:35:18.880
<v Speaker 2>eat like a cheese cake a day or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

675
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something,</v>

676
00:35:20.831 --> 00:35:22.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the same as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

677
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have diabetes and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to lose my damn leg and in,</v>

678
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.200
<v Speaker 2>in five years if I don't get my eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>under control,</v>

679
00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:34.350
<v Speaker 2>that's motivating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the temptation comes along </v>

680
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:34.350
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

681
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.970
<v Speaker 2>how about no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously how?</v>

682
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:42.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just because a higher good would be </v>

683
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.651
<v Speaker 2>obtained if I avoided it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because of a terrible catastrophe </v>

684
00:35:45.651 --> 00:35:46.380
<v Speaker 2>would be averted if I didn't.</v>

685
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.130
<v Speaker 2>And so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to get your fear behind you,</v>

686
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to get it behind you where it's</v>

687
00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:57.381
<v Speaker 2>pushing you forward instead of in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you where it's stopping you and you </v>

688
00:35:57.381 --> 00:35:59.850
<v Speaker 2>get your fear behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing you forward by actually thinking</v>

689
00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:02.850
<v Speaker 2>through the consequences of not putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life together.</v>

690
00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 2>And the least of those is that you waste</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

691
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:07.200
<v Speaker 2>And suffer right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're going to suffer anyways,</v>

692
00:36:07.201 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you wasted and suffer.</v>

693
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.050
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad deal because maybe if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to suffer,</v>

694
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:18.051
<v Speaker 2>you could at least do something knowable</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Glorious and upright and powerful </v>

695
00:36:18.051 --> 00:36:21.210
<v Speaker 2>and honorable and admirable and helpful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and difficult.</v>

696
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just so much better.</v>

697
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's good enough so that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

698
00:36:25.471 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

699
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 2>little suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically worth it.</v>

700
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.260
<v Speaker 2>At least it's a way forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

701
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.270
<v Speaker 2>at least it's a way forward.</v>

702
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:41.600
<v Speaker 2>And he said unto Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know of assurity that thy seed shall be </v>

703
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.811
<v Speaker 2>a stranger in a land that is not theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she'll serve those people and </v>

704
00:36:44.811 --> 00:36:46.080
<v Speaker 2>they'll flick them for 400 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

705
00:36:46.081 --> 00:36:47.940
<v Speaker 2>he's hedging his bets here a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

706
00:36:47.941 --> 00:36:50.670
<v Speaker 2>He says to Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will go out into the world,</v>

707
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:55.671
<v Speaker 2>and then he confronts him with a famine </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he confronts him with a tyranny and </v>

708
00:36:55.671 --> 00:36:58.611
<v Speaker 2>with powerful people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to take his wife and then he </v>

709
00:36:58.611 --> 00:36:58.940
<v Speaker 2>loses his nephew and he has a fight with</v>
<v Speaker 2>nanny,</v>

710
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:03.780
<v Speaker 2>has to go fight a war and now you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's reconstituting this covenant.</v>

711
00:37:03.781 --> 00:37:04.500
<v Speaker 2>God says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

712
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:09.040
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a nation is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to come from you,</v>

713
00:37:09.041 --> 00:37:13.490
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to be slaves to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrants for like 400 years is like,</v>

714
00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.170
<v Speaker 2>he's not a great salesman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

715
00:37:17.171 --> 00:37:19.900
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing about it is that the thing</v>

716
00:37:19.901 --> 00:37:21.970
<v Speaker 2>that I like about it is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic.</v>

717
00:37:21.971 --> 00:37:23.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you gotta think too,</v>

718
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:29.740
<v Speaker 2>because who knows why it is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible exists or why people wrote it,</v>

719
00:37:29.741 --> 00:37:32.500
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're gonna sell you something.</v>

720
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is the way to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

721
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because unless you're a salesman who is </v>

722
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.230
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated beyond belief because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd think that if it was just a matter</v>

723
00:37:41.231 --> 00:37:43.060
<v Speaker 2>of controlling the masses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

724
00:37:43.061 --> 00:37:45.790
<v Speaker 2>which is one St Marxist interpretation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of religion or,</v>

725
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.380
<v Speaker 2>or providing people with a primitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense against death anxiety,</v>

726
00:37:50.381 --> 00:37:55.381
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially the Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation that you'd kind of make </v>

727
00:37:55.381 --> 00:37:57.430
<v Speaker 2>the deals that got cut with Abraham a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little more on the positive and polished</v>

728
00:37:57.431 --> 00:38:00.480
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of making them a realistic offer</v>

729
00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.800
<v Speaker 2>constantly like they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that that's also that.</v>

730
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:08.870
<v Speaker 2>That part of the reason I think it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable to treat the Bible as </v>

731
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.870
<v Speaker 2>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

732
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.600
<v Speaker 2>it's more than literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something other than literature,</v>

733
00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.840
<v Speaker 2>but you can treat it as literature and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think the reason that you can treat it </v>

734
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.600
<v Speaker 2>as literature is because the characters </v>
<v Speaker 2>are all complex,</v>

735
00:38:16.601 --> 00:38:20.890
<v Speaker 2>including the character of God himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>is complex and sophisticated.</v>

736
00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:25.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not one sided and it's paradoxical </v>
<v Speaker 2>and incomprehensible at times,</v>

737
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.010
<v Speaker 2>but I think good literature is like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know true art.</v>

738
00:38:30.011 --> 00:38:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's something about true art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something I learned from young.</v>

739
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.960
<v Speaker 2>It's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so smart.</v>

740
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:40.650
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you inhabit the land </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know conceptually and </v>

741
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:42.550
<v Speaker 2>practically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then imagine outside of that,</v>

742
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:45.580
<v Speaker 2>there's that massive space of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't know,</v>

743
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.520
<v Speaker 2>and even outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this space of things that no one</v>

744
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:49.300
<v Speaker 2>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

745
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.060
<v Speaker 2>So it's the known territory surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the unknown.</v>

746
00:38:52.061 --> 00:38:57.061
<v Speaker 2>That's the canonical architectural </v>
<v Speaker 2>landscape and the unknown manifests </v>

747
00:38:57.061 --> 00:38:58.810
<v Speaker 2>itself to you and that's where new </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge comes from.</v>

748
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:01.210
<v Speaker 2>But the question is how is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge generated?</v>

749
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:06.211
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't just leap from completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown to completely articulated in one</v>

750
00:39:06.731 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 2>move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't how it happens.</v>

751
00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:13.561
<v Speaker 2>It has to pass through stages of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis before it becomes articulable.</v>

752
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.990
<v Speaker 2>And the first stage of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell is that you act it </v>

753
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if something really surprises you,</v>

754
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.960
<v Speaker 2>the first way that you react to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your category is actually embodied.</v>

755
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 2>You'd like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's your first category.</v>

756
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not conceptual at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's embodied.</v>

757
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:33.750
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you start to like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>at home at night and something startled,</v>

758
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:38.780
<v Speaker 2>senior freeze and then it's dark and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then your imagination populates the </v>

759
00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:39.670
<v Speaker 2>darkness with whatever might be making </v>
<v Speaker 2>the noise.</v>

760
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's the sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like embodied response,</v>

761
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.430
<v Speaker 2>imaginative representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration,</v>

762
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:50.550
<v Speaker 2>articulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how information moves from the </v>

763
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:53.581
<v Speaker 2>unknown to the known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And artists are the people who stand on </v>

764
00:39:53.581 --> 00:39:56.200
<v Speaker 2>that images stick frontier and they and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they put themselves out into the unknown</v>

765
00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:01.380
<v Speaker 2>and they and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take a piece of it and they and </v>

766
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.351
<v Speaker 2>they transform it into some mythological</v>
<v Speaker 2>image and they don't know what they're </v>

767
00:40:04.351 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 2>doing exactly because they're guided by </v>
<v Speaker 2>their intuition.</v>

768
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:08.260
<v Speaker 2>If they're real artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise they're just propagandists.</v>

769
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.220
<v Speaker 2>They have to be contending with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something they don't understand and what</v>

770
00:40:12.221 --> 00:40:14.470
<v Speaker 2>they do is they make it more </v>
<v Speaker 2>understandable,</v>

771
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:15.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

772
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:20.610
<v Speaker 2>and then people gays it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those artworks or this or they listened </v>

773
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:20.890
<v Speaker 2>to the stories and then they start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become informed by them,</v>

774
00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know how or why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at the Modern Art Museum Museum of</v>

775
00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:27.910
<v Speaker 2>art and in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid.</v>

776
00:40:27.911 --> 00:40:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember which one </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

777
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.530
<v Speaker 2>but I was in this amazing room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

778
00:40:32.531 --> 00:40:33.880
<v Speaker 2>it had all these</v>

779
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:39.630
<v Speaker 2>priceless paintings from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the late renaissance hanging in it,</v>

780
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each painting worth who knows a billion </v>

781
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're priceless painting.</v>

782
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.121
<v Speaker 2>So the room was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a shrine and it was full of people </v>

783
00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:50.670
<v Speaker 2>from all over the world who are looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at these paintings.</v>

784
00:40:50.671 --> 00:40:51.030
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

785
00:40:51.031 --> 00:40:56.031
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are these people doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to this room looking at these </v>

786
00:40:56.031 --> 00:40:56.031
<v Speaker 2>paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are,</v>

787
00:40:56.031 --> 00:40:59.361
<v Speaker 2>what are they up to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was a painting of the </v>

788
00:40:59.361 --> 00:40:59.361
<v Speaker 2>assumption of Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

789
00:40:59.361 --> 00:41:03.710
<v Speaker 2>Brilliantly composed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was all these people looking </v>

790
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.710
<v Speaker 2>at it and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing?</v>

791
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.120
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sick.</v>

792
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Why are they looking at that painting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it in this room?</v>

793
00:41:07.351 --> 00:41:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Why does it cost a billion dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that painting worth so much?</v>

794
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:11.880
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

795
00:41:11.881 --> 00:41:14.720
<v Speaker 2>we don't really know like it happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

796
00:41:14.721 --> 00:41:19.721
<v Speaker 2>their sacred objects in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we gaze at the in ignorance and </v>

797
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:23.931
<v Speaker 2>wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that the </v>

798
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:25.470
<v Speaker 2>unknown shines through the madness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>partially articulated form.</v>

799
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:26.520
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

800
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 4>well</v>

801
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 2>that's the role of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the role of artists</v>

802
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:39.770
<v Speaker 5>in all</v>

803
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:48.430
<v Speaker 2>real artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real artists are contending with </v>

804
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.430
<v Speaker 2>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

805
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 2>And they're possessed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a personality trait,</v>

806
00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:52.130
<v Speaker 2>openness that makes them do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't even help it.</v>

807
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.970
<v Speaker 2>And I've had lots of creative people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my clinical practice.</v>

808
00:41:55.020 --> 00:42:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you the worst thing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative people is to not be creative </v>

809
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.240
<v Speaker 2>because they just die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

810
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.240
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

811
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.020
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like maybe you're a tree with a few</v>

812
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.880
<v Speaker 2>major branches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

813
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 2>that's your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're extroverted,</v>

814
00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:12.320
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be cut off from people because</v>

815
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:17.350
<v Speaker 2>you just wither and if you're agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be an intimate relationship </v>

816
00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 2>or you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 2>and if you're conscientious man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're unemployed,</v>

818
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:25.810
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to eat yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have to have a duty and you </v>

819
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.290
<v Speaker 2>have to carry a load because just can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand it otherwise and open.</v>

820
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:32.290
<v Speaker 2>People have to be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be because otherwise they </v>

821
00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any vitality,</v>

822
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.960
<v Speaker 2>and so they're cursed with the necessity</v>
<v Speaker 2>of putting a foot out into the unknown </v>

823
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.851
<v Speaker 2>and making sense of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're also cursed with </v>

824
00:42:42.851 --> 00:42:42.851
<v Speaker 2>necessity of trying to make a living </v>
<v Speaker 2>while they're doing that,</v>

825
00:42:42.851 --> 00:42:47.741
<v Speaker 2>which they can't because you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost impossible to monetize </v>

826
00:42:47.741 --> 00:42:50.981
<v Speaker 2>creative creative action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As many of you who are creative will no </v>

827
00:42:50.981 --> 00:42:51.350
<v Speaker 2>doubt find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

828
00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:54.590
<v Speaker 2>very frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that creative action is without</v>

829
00:42:54.591 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

830
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Because the creative people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs and the creative people,</v>

831
00:42:58.161 --> 00:43:03.161
<v Speaker 2>revitalized cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the creative people make things </v>

832
00:43:03.161 --> 00:43:05.951
<v Speaker 2>magnificent and beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think about what's happened in </v>

833
00:43:05.951 --> 00:43:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Europe over the last thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say 2000 years,</v>

834
00:43:06.411 --> 00:43:11.411
<v Speaker 2>this amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable collaboration to make </v>

835
00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:15.770
<v Speaker 2>things so beautiful that they're their </v>
<v Speaker 2>jaw dropping when you walk into them and</v>

836
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 2>you think about the economic value of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

837
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

838
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>

839
00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.400
<v Speaker 2>It's either France or Spain that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most visited country in the world.</v>

840
00:43:22.401 --> 00:43:27.401
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's more tourists in France </v>

841
00:43:27.401 --> 00:43:29.591
<v Speaker 2>than there are people most of the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of the reason for that is it's </v>

842
00:43:29.591 --> 00:43:30.800
<v Speaker 2>just so damn beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't stand it and you think,</v>

843
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 2>what's the economic value of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely incalculable,</v>

844
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:40.430
<v Speaker 2>and what's interesting too is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>build out beauty in and then the farther</v>

845
00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:44.180
<v Speaker 2>away you get from it in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more valuable it becomes,</v>

846
00:43:44.181 --> 00:43:45.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of decaying,</v>

847
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:48.860
<v Speaker 2>it has exactly the opposite effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's value magnifies.</v>

848
00:43:48.861 --> 00:43:53.861
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I'm deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>ashamed of as a Canadian is that our </v>

849
00:43:53.861 --> 00:43:57.440
<v Speaker 2>sense of beauty is so underdeveloped </v>
<v Speaker 2>were so primitive print.</v>

850
00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:02.441
<v Speaker 2>It's not even primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the wrong word because I know </v>

851
00:44:02.441 --> 00:44:03.920
<v Speaker 2>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

852
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's second rate,</v>

853
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:06.650
<v Speaker 2>it's second rate.</v>

854
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.590
<v Speaker 2>At least it's terror too because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are afraid of beauty,</v>

855
00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:14.060
<v Speaker 2>but the idea that art is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives really have a problem with</v>

856
00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:19.061
<v Speaker 2>this in particular because conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>people tend to want to be that creative </v>

857
00:44:19.061 --> 00:44:19.061
<v Speaker 2>and Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

858
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.700
<v Speaker 2>by temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mystery to me because they should</v>

859
00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:26.840
<v Speaker 2>be concerned with economic development </v>
<v Speaker 2>and beauty is so unbelievably crucial to</v>

860
00:44:26.841 --> 00:44:29.030
<v Speaker 2>economic development and just yells out </v>
<v Speaker 2>at you.</v>

861
00:44:29.031 --> 00:44:31.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

862
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:36.320
<v Speaker 2>so that's what artists are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things I would say is </v>

863
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:36.320
<v Speaker 2>by a damn piece of art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

864
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.970
<v Speaker 2>find one that really speaks to you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>buy a piece of art because you invite </v>

865
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.230
<v Speaker 2>that into your life and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an lookout if you do it,</v>

866
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.070
<v Speaker 2>if it's a real piece of art because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll also get a little introduction to</v>

867
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:50.670
<v Speaker 2>the artist and then that'll seep into </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life and that'll change things like</v>

868
00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:52.170
<v Speaker 2>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really,</v>

869
00:44:52.171 --> 00:44:57.171
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievably worth it because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>opens your eyes to the domain of the </v>

870
00:44:57.171 --> 00:44:57.870
<v Speaker 2>transcendent.</v>

871
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:02.870
<v Speaker 2>That's the right way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>our real piece of art is a window into </v>

872
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.681
<v Speaker 2>the transcendent and that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you need that in your life because </v>

873
00:45:06.681 --> 00:45:10.050
<v Speaker 2>your finite and limited and bounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>right by your ignorance and your lack of</v>

874
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:13.470
<v Speaker 2>knowing and unless you can make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection to the transcendent,</v>

875
00:45:13.471 --> 00:45:16.920
<v Speaker 2>then you don't have the strength to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevail and that's part of the covenant.</v>

876
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:22.250
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the covenant with God and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that because you look at </v>

877
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.530
<v Speaker 2>these magnificent cathedrals that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization built over the centuries,</v>

878
00:45:25.531 --> 00:45:26.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of those,</v>

879
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:31.610
<v Speaker 2>they're still building the Sangre de </v>
<v Speaker 2>Familia in Barcelona,</v>

880
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:33.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's an amazing building.</v>

881
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to take them like 300</v>
<v Speaker 2>years to build that.</v>

882
00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:38.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the Middle Ages,</v>

883
00:45:38.491 --> 00:45:40.260
<v Speaker 2>they'd start building a cathedral and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>

884
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't be done this in 300 years.</v>

885
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine the vision that it took to </v>

886
00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:47.720
<v Speaker 2>invest in something like that.</v>

887
00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:51.620
<v Speaker 2>We look at quarterly reports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can think 300 years into the future </v>

888
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 2>to build something of that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>remarkable,</v>

889
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:58.410
<v Speaker 2>remarkable what those cathedrals are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're perfect.</v>

890
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Speaker 2>They're trees first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there,</v>

891
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:00.780
<v Speaker 2>a forest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

892
00:46:00.781 --> 00:46:05.781
<v Speaker 2>the gothic cathedrals there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are forest and the sun is shining </v>

893
00:46:05.781 --> 00:46:08.811
<v Speaker 2>through the branches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the stain glass and they're the </v>

894
00:46:08.811 --> 00:46:11.631
<v Speaker 2>perfect balance of light and structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're representing something </v>

895
00:46:11.631 --> 00:46:15.891
<v Speaker 2>about the proper structure of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something like the proper </v>

896
00:46:15.891 --> 00:46:19.521
<v Speaker 2>balance between light and structure and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they represent like the sacred tragedy </v>

897
00:46:20.281 --> 00:46:25.281
<v Speaker 2>of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're in the shape of a </v>

898
00:46:25.281 --> 00:46:27.321
<v Speaker 2>cross and they're open to the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they have a dome and they're </v>

899
00:46:27.321 --> 00:46:30.030
<v Speaker 2>full of gold so that it glitters because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the city of God.</v>

900
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:30.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and,</v>

901
00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:36.060
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that that integral to our </v>

902
00:46:37.141 --> 00:46:42.090
<v Speaker 2>culture is the idea that beauty is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway towards God and it's.</v>

903
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's saying if you can't find </v>
<v Speaker 2>another pathway,</v>

904
00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:49.371
<v Speaker 2>then why don't you use beauty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure most of you do that with music </v>

905
00:46:49.371 --> 00:46:50.910
<v Speaker 2>because music is the one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern people can't be cynical about.</v>

906
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Thank God for that and being fascinated </v>
<v Speaker 2>by music.</v>

907
00:46:54.241 --> 00:46:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it speaks meaning to people,</v>

908
00:46:56.911 --> 00:46:58.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even nihilistic,</v>

909
00:46:58.141 --> 00:47:03.141
<v Speaker 2>punk rockers are so damn engaged with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their music that they can hardly stand </v>

910
00:47:03.141 --> 00:47:04.350
<v Speaker 2>it and you can knock on them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

911
00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having a transcendent religious </v>

912
00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:09.740
<v Speaker 2>experience and they'll just tell you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck off.</v>

913
00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:14.520
<v Speaker 5>Got Cause.</v>

914
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what punk rock yourself to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

915
00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.900
<v Speaker 2>but that's still what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

916
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.820
<v Speaker 2>It's still what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

917
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

918
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

919
00:47:31.561 --> 00:47:36.561
<v Speaker 2>I got into all that because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about about the Bible as </v>

920
00:47:36.561 --> 00:47:36.561
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

921
00:47:36.561 --> 00:47:40.800
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to enter into layout because </v>

922
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.540
<v Speaker 2>we need in our culture to justify the </v>
<v Speaker 2>art.</v>

923
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.050
<v Speaker 2>And you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that by talking about</v>

924
00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:52.051
<v Speaker 2>high culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about something abstract and </v>

925
00:47:52.051 --> 00:47:52.051
<v Speaker 2>evanescent that's the wrong way to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

926
00:47:52.051 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 2>This is vital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

927
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:59.010
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the University of </v>

928
00:47:59.010 --> 00:47:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Toronto is that the one side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>campus where we are,</v>

929
00:47:59.991 --> 00:48:03.220
<v Speaker 2>is beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medieval cathedral.</v>

930
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Another side is God awful factory and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

931
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.580
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

932
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:14.610
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is the attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge has paralleled that </v>

933
00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:16.180
<v Speaker 2>architectural transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

934
00:48:16.181 --> 00:48:20.200
<v Speaker 2>at one point the humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say we're a sacred endeavor and so</v>

935
00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:25.201
<v Speaker 2>was the art of being educated in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university and that's turned into like </v>

936
00:48:25.201 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 2>mass factory and that's reflected in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>architecture.</v>

937
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.470
<v Speaker 2>This isn't accidental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of this happens.</v>

938
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.370
<v Speaker 2>None of this happens by random chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

939
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.440
<v Speaker 2>it's not like there's a conspiracy or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything because there isn't,</v>

940
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:38.320
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't tangled together.</v>

941
00:48:38.321 --> 00:48:43.321
<v Speaker 2>And the loss of beauty in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities is a catastrophe because </v>

942
00:48:43.321 --> 00:48:46.300
<v Speaker 2>without that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no call to higher being,</v>

943
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:46.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

944
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:52.230
<v Speaker 2>This is also why I've mentioned to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that they should clean up their </v>

945
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:53.740
<v Speaker 2>rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's become quite the Internet meme,</v>

946
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm really serious about it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to do that.</v>

947
00:48:56.411 --> 00:48:58.150
<v Speaker 2>And I've been cleaning up my room by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

948
00:48:58.151 --> 00:49:03.151
<v Speaker 2>for about four months now because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life was thrown into such a catastrophe </v>

949
00:49:03.151 --> 00:49:04.570
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also we were renovating and so.</v>

950
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't just that you clean it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also make it beautiful and beauty.</v>

951
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:12.790
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to make something </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and it's really worthwhile.</v>

952
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.070
<v Speaker 2>And what's really cool is if you learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make something beautiful,</v>

953
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:18.040
<v Speaker 2>even one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could just make one thing in your</v>

954
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:18.850
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>

955
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:24.030
<v Speaker 2>then you've established your </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with beauty and then you </v>

956
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:25.600
<v Speaker 2>can start to expand that relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with beauty out into,</v>

957
00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:28.330
<v Speaker 2>into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like into other elements of your life.</v>

958
00:49:28.331 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 2>And that is so worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just incredibly crazily worthwhile.</v>

959
00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's an invitation to the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

960
00:49:35.311 --> 00:49:38.320
<v Speaker 2>You have to be daring to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people are terrified of it.</v>

961
00:49:38.321 --> 00:49:41.110
<v Speaker 2>People are terrified of color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They paint their walls beige.</v>

962
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:46.320
<v Speaker 2>They're terrified of art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They buy some mass produced thing </v>

963
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.620
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want anybody laughing</v>
<v Speaker 2>at them for their lack of taste.</v>

964
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.960
<v Speaker 2>And they would get laughed at because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no taste.</v>

965
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.780
<v Speaker 2>But you have to while it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what do you know,</v>

966
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:54.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to develop it.</v>

967
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:59.400
<v Speaker 2>And so you're going to stumble along and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make mistakes to begin with and you're </v>

968
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.611
<v Speaker 2>going to show yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you buy who I think this is </v>

969
00:50:02.611 --> 00:50:02.611
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

970
00:50:02.611 --> 00:50:02.611
<v Speaker 2>somebody comes over and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

971
00:50:02.611 --> 00:50:05.320
<v Speaker 2>what's up with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of hard on yourself esteem,</v>

972
00:50:05.321 --> 00:50:10.321
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the stuff you're stumbling </v>

973
00:50:10.321 --> 00:50:12.481
<v Speaker 2>towards the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're stumbling towards the Kingdom of </v>

974
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:17.880
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're stumbling towards </v>

975
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.171
<v Speaker 2>when you try to make an aesthetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision and to put something in your </v>

976
00:50:19.171 --> 00:50:22.051
<v Speaker 2>life that's beautiful and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably worthwhile to do that and </v>

977
00:50:22.051 --> 00:50:26.110
<v Speaker 2>you have to steer clear of the frauds </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the con artists and all of that and </v>

978
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:29.520
<v Speaker 2>art is full of that of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's to distinguish between the </v>

979
00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:29.830
<v Speaker 2>real thing and the fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

980
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:33.500
<v Speaker 2>But it's unbelievably worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so back to literature,</v>

981
00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:38.920
<v Speaker 2>and I'm telling you this partly because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking a lot about the </v>

982
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:42.160
<v Speaker 2>humanities and the arts and practically </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

983
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:48.160
<v Speaker 2>because I know that artistic types are </v>
<v Speaker 2>also entrepreneurial types of the same </v>

984
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:52.001
<v Speaker 2>personality types and so it's very much </v>
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile to make an economic and </v>

985
00:50:52.001 --> 00:50:52.820
<v Speaker 2>practical case for this sort of thing.</v>

986
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:58.870
<v Speaker 2>He studied literature in the humanities </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you can familiarize yourself </v>

987
00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:00.110
<v Speaker 2>with the wisdom of our civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

988
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:05.111
<v Speaker 2>you should do that because people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been working on this thing for a long </v>

989
00:51:05.111 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 2>time and it's rich beyond comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why wouldn't you do that?</v>

990
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:11.150
<v Speaker 2>And you teach yourself to read and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach yourself to speak,</v>

991
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.000
<v Speaker 2>and you teach yourself to think and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach yourself to communicate,</v>

992
00:51:14.001 --> 00:51:19.001
<v Speaker 2>and I can tell you if you can read and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think and communicate,</v>

993
00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:24.310
<v Speaker 2>you are absolutely 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>unstoppable and that's another thing </v>

994
00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:29.681
<v Speaker 2>that's so interesting about humanities </v>
<v Speaker 2>education that's at the core of the </v>

995
00:51:29.681 --> 00:51:32.501
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's nothing more </v>

996
00:51:32.501 --> 00:51:34.301
<v Speaker 2>economically valuable than teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>people how to articulate themselves and </v>

997
00:51:34.301 --> 00:51:35.000
<v Speaker 2>communicate because they can identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>

998
00:51:35.001 --> 00:51:37.820
<v Speaker 2>they can formulate solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can negotiate to consensus,</v>

999
00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:41.000
<v Speaker 2>they can negotiate on their own behalf </v>
<v Speaker 2>or on the behalf of others.</v>

1000
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:46.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's absolutely no downside</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it except that there's responsibility</v>

1001
00:51:46.701 --> 00:51:50.540
<v Speaker 2>that goes along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter because there's no</v>

1002
00:51:50.541 --> 00:51:52.010
<v Speaker 2>escape from responsibility.</v>

1003
00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:55.220
<v Speaker 2>You can either take it voluntarily or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take it in voluntarily.</v>

1004
00:51:55.221 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Those are your options,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there aren't any other options.</v>

1005
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.970
<v Speaker 2>And so we need to understand the role of</v>
<v Speaker 2>art and literature and and stop thinking</v>

1006
00:52:01.971 --> 00:52:03.920
<v Speaker 2>about it as an option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an option.</v>

1007
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it said,</v>

1008
00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:09.440
<v Speaker 2>man does not live by bread alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

1009
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:11.840
<v Speaker 2>We live by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we live by literature.</v>

1010
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:14.960
<v Speaker 2>We live by art and literally not </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically.</v>

1011
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:20.140
<v Speaker 2>We cannot live without it because life </v>
<v Speaker 2>is too dismal and tragic in the absence </v>

1012
00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:24.170
<v Speaker 2>of the sublime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and ourselves.</v>

1013
00:52:24.171 --> 00:52:29.171
<v Speaker 2>We have to be sharp so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>survive properly an orient the world </v>

1014
00:52:29.171 --> 00:52:32.891
<v Speaker 2>properly and not destroy things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including ourselves and so and so back </v>

1015
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 2>to the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I do think is a reasonable.</v>

1016
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:40.670
<v Speaker 2>It's reasonably construed as a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature because it's deep and because</v>

1017
00:52:40.671 --> 00:52:45.671
<v Speaker 2>the people who wrote it had at least one</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot in the unknowable and they're </v>

1018
00:52:45.671 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 2>trying to communicate what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced in the unknowable to make it</v>

1019
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:53.710
<v Speaker 2>known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly what we're trying to </v>

1020
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.721
<v Speaker 2>do in this series and what you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do while you're listening and all of </v>

1021
00:52:55.721 --> 00:52:59.561
<v Speaker 2>that and so good for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also that nation whom they shall </v>

1022
00:52:59.561 --> 00:52:59.660
<v Speaker 2>serve.</v>

1023
00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I will judge and afterward they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out with great substance.</v>

1024
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.980
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a period of tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1025
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.400
<v Speaker 2>and there's a psychological truth to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>

1026
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.400
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I learned from reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nietzsche,</v>

1027
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.930
<v Speaker 2>because you can learn a lot from reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

1028
00:53:11.931 --> 00:53:13.550
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

1029
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.260
<v Speaker 2>He talked about the Catholic Church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1030
00:53:15.261 --> 00:53:20.261
<v Speaker 2>Ninja is often construed as a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>critic of Christianity and and he </v>

1031
00:53:20.261 --> 00:53:22.250
<v Speaker 2>certainly was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was no casual critic.</v>

1032
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:27.580
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was the sort of critic that </v>

1033
00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:27.580
<v Speaker 2>you'd like to have as a friend because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the sort of critic that said,</v>

1034
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:32.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the great things you've done and </v>

1035
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 2>that you could keep doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a bunch of really neat things </v>

1036
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:35.520
<v Speaker 2>that you did that you really should stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1037
00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 2>And he talked about the Catholic Church </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

1038
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.640
<v Speaker 2>what the Catholic Church had done to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>European mind in particular was </v>

1039
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:44.550
<v Speaker 2>discipline it.</v>

1040
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:48.000
<v Speaker 2>So that over a period of a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1041
00:53:48.001 --> 00:53:49.710
<v Speaker 2>$1,300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1400 years,</v>

1042
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:54.950
<v Speaker 2>there was this rule that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptual structure within which you </v>

1043
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:59.121
<v Speaker 2>had to interpret everything and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>that did was turn the European educated </v>

1044
00:53:59.121 --> 00:54:01.550
<v Speaker 2>you European mind into a systematized </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1045
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:06.650
<v Speaker 2>cognitive entity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that once that systematizing </v>

1046
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:09.681
<v Speaker 2>cognitive entity at been established,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it could free itself from those </v>

1047
00:54:09.681 --> 00:54:13.611
<v Speaker 2>underlying disciplinary structures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>go off and do such things as produced </v>

1048
00:54:13.611 --> 00:54:15.300
<v Speaker 2>the scientific revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1049
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:17.610
<v Speaker 2>which required a credible systematic </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

1050
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:22.880
<v Speaker 2>And so Nisha had this really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea about freedom and he believed that </v>

1051
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:27.680
<v Speaker 2>slavery was an intermediary between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>undeveloped the individual and the free </v>

1052
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:32.091
<v Speaker 2>individual that you had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to submit yourself to some </v>

1053
00:54:32.091 --> 00:54:35.661
<v Speaker 2>intense disciplinary process for some </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time in your life before you </v>

1054
00:54:35.661 --> 00:54:38.640
<v Speaker 2>could develop any true freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you think maybe you want to learn</v>

1055
00:54:38.641 --> 00:54:39.360
<v Speaker 2>to play the piano.</v>

1056
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:44.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to be any fun for a </v>

1057
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:44.360
<v Speaker 2>really long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1058
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.511
<v Speaker 2>Because you're really bad at it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a million things you have to </v>

1059
00:54:47.511 --> 00:54:47.580
<v Speaker 2>memorize and you have to stumble around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1060
00:54:47.581 --> 00:54:48.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1061
00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:53.730
<v Speaker 2>like an amateur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same thing happens when kids </v>

1062
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:56.211
<v Speaker 2>learn how to read and some of them never</v>
<v Speaker 2>get past that point and they never get </v>

1063
00:54:56.211 --> 00:54:56.211
<v Speaker 2>to the point where they can enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading,</v>

1064
00:54:56.211 --> 00:55:00.501
<v Speaker 2>but in order to put yourself together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to put yourself in a vice and </v>

1065
00:55:00.501 --> 00:55:04.461
<v Speaker 2>allow yourself to be constricted and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mangled and by the thing that enslaves </v>

1066
00:55:04.461 --> 00:55:09.081
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the goal should be that as a </v>

1067
00:55:09.081 --> 00:55:11.931
<v Speaker 2>consequence of submitting to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline that you become disciplined </v>

1068
00:55:11.931 --> 00:55:15.680
<v Speaker 2>and then once you become disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can emerge from the disciplinary </v>

1069
00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.501
<v Speaker 2>structure as someone who's free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that's very much </v>

1070
00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:18.510
<v Speaker 2>we're thinking about as well.</v>

1071
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:23.130
<v Speaker 2>So that's illustrated conceptually in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1072
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:27.210
<v Speaker 2>in this piece of literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1073
00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:32.211
<v Speaker 2>because what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the psychological meaning of what </v>

1074
00:55:32.211 --> 00:55:35.931
<v Speaker 2>God tells Abraham is that all people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all people are subject.</v>

1075
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean not equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously all people are subject to the </v>

1076
00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:45.051
<v Speaker 2>tyranny that proceeds freedom and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that ideas is repeated over and over in </v>

1077
00:55:45.301 --> 00:55:50.301
<v Speaker 2>the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It comes out most particularly in the </v>

1078
00:55:50.301 --> 00:55:50.301
<v Speaker 2>story of Moses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1079
00:55:50.301 --> 00:55:53.361
<v Speaker 2>Because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the story of movement from </v>

1080
00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:53.361
<v Speaker 2>tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you go from a tyranny?</v>

1081
00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:56.190
<v Speaker 2>It's an absolute catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go from maturity into the desert.</v>

1082
00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:59.610
<v Speaker 2>You know where you starve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's harsh.</v>

1083
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:01.770
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 2>exodus,</v>

1084
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:07.040
<v Speaker 2>and so that's so interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what it means is that sometimes </v>

1085
00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.390
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to move up hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that happens is you move</v>

1086
00:56:09.391 --> 00:56:14.391
<v Speaker 2>downhill a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you want to escape from the </v>

1087
00:56:14.391 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 2>straits that bind you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're not going to move forward and</v>

1088
00:56:16.321 --> 00:56:16.710
<v Speaker 2>go up.</v>

1089
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:19.800
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna move forward and go down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another reason.</v>

1090
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:24.890
<v Speaker 2>This is also something that you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about a lot is that you know on </v>

1091
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:27.891
<v Speaker 2>the road to enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you encounter all the things that you </v>

1092
00:56:27.891 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 2>don't want to encounter first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all the weaknesses of yourself,</v>

1093
00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:34.110
<v Speaker 2>all the realizations of the tyranny of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and the catastrophe of nature </v>

1094
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:37.861
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you step out of your </v>

1095
00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:40.320
<v Speaker 2>encapsulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're ignorant encapsulation and it's </v>

1096
00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 2>immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plummet into something that's a desert.</v>

1097
00:56:40.811 --> 00:56:45.811
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everything is chaotic and where </v>

1098
00:56:45.811 --> 00:56:45.811
<v Speaker 2>you're wandering around without </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

1099
00:56:45.811 --> 00:56:46.930
<v Speaker 2>A real catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1100
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:52.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things you might ask </v>

1101
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:54.031
<v Speaker 2>yourself is that if enlightenment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and why aren't people </v>

1102
00:56:54.031 --> 00:56:55.480
<v Speaker 2>enlightened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if it was just a matter of going</v>

1103
00:56:55.481 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 2>from a good place to a better place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1104
00:56:57.551 --> 00:56:59.080
<v Speaker 2>well man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just get at it.</v>

1105
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.280
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no problem.</v>

1106
00:57:00.281 --> 00:57:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would we ever stop doing that?</v>

1107
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:06.880
<v Speaker 2>But it seems not to be that it's that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're here and that's not good and it's</v>

1108
00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:09.340
<v Speaker 2>unstable and you step out of it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like down,</v>

1109
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:15.240
<v Speaker 2>down to where you don't want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to contend with that and </v>

1110
00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:15.400
<v Speaker 2>then maybe you can start your struggle </v>
<v Speaker 2>upward.</v>

1111
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And so Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is telling Abraham this and he's </v>

1112
00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:24.151
<v Speaker 2>also telling him that it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rough though and now now shall go </v>

1113
00:57:24.151 --> 00:57:28.891
<v Speaker 2>to their fathers in peace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though shall be burned in the good old </v>

1114
00:57:28.891 --> 00:57:28.930
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the fourth generation,</v>

1115
00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:31.020
<v Speaker 2>they shall come hither again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the Israelites,</v>

1116
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:36.150
<v Speaker 2>the descendants of Abraham for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>iniquity of the Amorites is not yet </v>

1117
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:40.081
<v Speaker 2>full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God is going to leave the tyrants alone </v>

1118
00:57:40.081 --> 00:57:40.630
<v Speaker 2>until they've manifested their full </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny.</v>

1119
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:45.690
<v Speaker 2>For reasons that we don't fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand and it came to pass that when</v>

1120
00:57:49.041 --> 00:57:50.570
<v Speaker 2>the sun went down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was dark.</v>

1121
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Behold a smoking furnace and a burning </v>
<v Speaker 2>lamp that passed between the pieces.</v>

1122
00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 2>All Albert Barnes set the oven of smoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lamp aflame symbolize the smoke of </v>

1123
00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.010
<v Speaker 2>destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we've already talked about.</v>

1124
00:58:01.011 --> 00:58:06.011
<v Speaker 2>This catastrophe of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the initial stages and the light of </v>

1125
00:58:06.011 --> 00:58:09.791
<v Speaker 2>salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're passing through the pieces of </v>

1126
00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:12.131
<v Speaker 2>the victims and probably consuming them </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an accepted sacrifice are the </v>

1127
00:58:12.131 --> 00:58:14.690
<v Speaker 2>ratification of the Covenant on the part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of God as the dividing and presenting of</v>

1128
00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:15.810
<v Speaker 2>them were on the part of April.</v>

1129
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:22.370
<v Speaker 2>In the same day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Lord made a covenant with Abraham </v>

1130
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Saying Unto Thy seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've given this land from the river of </v>

1131
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Egypt unto the Great River Euphrates.</v>

1132
00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Now Sarai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abram's wife Barum,</v>

1133
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.900
<v Speaker 2>no children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she had a handmade and the Egyptian,</v>

1134
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:37.620
<v Speaker 2>whose name was Hagar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a big catastrophe for </v>

1135
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in those times,</v>

1136
00:58:37.661 --> 00:58:42.661
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps now as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although perhaps people aren't as </v>

1137
00:58:42.661 --> 00:58:44.740
<v Speaker 2>conscious of it as they once were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Abraham,</v>

1138
00:58:44.741 --> 00:58:49.210
<v Speaker 2>without a biological son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no.</v>

1139
00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:54.570
<v Speaker 2>There was no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no vision forward into the </v>

1140
00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:54.570
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1141
00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:58.581
<v Speaker 2>and I mean we don't really know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of time span over which these </v>

1142
00:58:58.581 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 2>archaic people thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the medieval people,</v>

1143
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:02.830
<v Speaker 2>we already said good thing 300 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the future without,</v>

1144
00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:06.130
<v Speaker 2>without batting an eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these people who were,</v>

1145
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:11.190
<v Speaker 2>who were concerned about their </v>
<v Speaker 2>descendants were obviously thinking </v>

1146
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:13.621
<v Speaker 2>about existence in a way that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just focused on their immediate </v>

1147
00:59:13.621 --> 00:59:13.621
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1148
00:59:13.621 --> 00:59:15.430
<v Speaker 2>They were thinking about while their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children and their grandchildren,</v>

1149
00:59:15.431 --> 00:59:20.431
<v Speaker 2>maybe their great grandchildren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the whole society that that </v>

1150
00:59:20.431 --> 00:59:21.470
<v Speaker 2>stemmed out from them and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's smart know.</v>

1151
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.140
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I learned from piaget </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

1152
00:59:24.141 --> 00:59:27.320
<v Speaker 2>was that his idea of the equilla braided</v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

1153
00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:32.321
<v Speaker 2>which he thought about as partly part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biological basis of the idea of </v>

1154
00:59:32.321 --> 00:59:33.740
<v Speaker 2>moral progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

1155
00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:38.741
<v Speaker 2>He was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart pig and we said that the </v>

1156
00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:40.700
<v Speaker 2>proper equilibrated state is one where </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine you have a family,</v>

1157
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:43.240
<v Speaker 2>you've got five people in it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what you want in your,</v>

1158
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:44.630
<v Speaker 2>in your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's good for you,</v>

1159
00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:49.810
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing it in such a way so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the other four members of your </v>

1160
00:59:49.810 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 2>family agree with what you do and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it also facilitates them doing what they</v>

1161
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:57.221
<v Speaker 2>want and what they should be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's a really tricky arrangement </v>

1162
00:59:57.221 --> 01:00:00.701
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't just for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for you in a way that's for them </v>

1163
01:00:00.701 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 2>and you can also see that that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that would be a multiplier,</v>

1164
01:00:02.631 --> 01:00:02.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1165
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Because if you have everyone working </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily towards the same common </v>

1166
01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:13.451
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get a multiplying effect of </v>

1167
01:00:13.451 --> 01:00:13.451
<v Speaker 2>that and then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1168
01:00:13.451 --> 01:00:17.471
<v Speaker 2>it's not just you and your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you and your family today and next </v>

1169
01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.190
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next month,</v>

1170
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.200
<v Speaker 2>next year and 10 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to take the time span into </v>

1171
01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.461
<v Speaker 2>account and then it should be you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your family in a way that works well in </v>

1172
01:00:27.461 --> 01:00:30.731
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it should work well now and </v>

1173
01:00:30.731 --> 01:00:30.731
<v Speaker 2>next week and next year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and into the future.</v>

1174
01:00:30.731 --> 01:00:31.100
<v Speaker 2>It should be iterative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agile,</v>

1175
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like sustainability.</v>

1176
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:36.040
<v Speaker 2>It's something like the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainability and that's,</v>

1177
01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:40.250
<v Speaker 2>that's I would say that's a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of conceptualizing the holy city.</v>

1178
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.350
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're.</v>

1179
01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:44.270
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to make it concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1180
01:00:44.271 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 2>how should you live your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1181
01:00:45.831 --> 01:00:50.831
<v Speaker 2>let's say you live your life in a manner</v>
<v Speaker 2>that justifies its limitation and </v>

1182
01:00:50.831 --> 01:00:50.831
<v Speaker 2>tragedy.</v>

1183
01:00:50.831 --> 01:00:55.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then let's say that it does that in </v>

1184
01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.881
<v Speaker 2>a way that also reduces the limitations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and suffering of the people that you </v>

1185
01:00:57.881 --> 01:00:59.150
<v Speaker 2>interact with and now and into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

1186
01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe there's a way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a good negotiation does that,</v>

1187
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:08.831
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're negotiating with </v>

1188
01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.181
<v Speaker 2>someone like your wife for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want is for her to agree with </v>

1189
01:01:10.181 --> 01:01:12.260
<v Speaker 2>the negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that Piaget said,</v>

1190
01:01:12.261 --> 01:01:14.180
<v Speaker 2>which I think was brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>

1191
01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.450
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take an equilibrated system,</v>

1192
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:19.010
<v Speaker 2>a family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1193
01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.770
<v Speaker 2>and a discipline celebrated system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be one way.</v>

1194
01:01:21.771 --> 01:01:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Or let's say the father is a tyrant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone is operating under his whip and</v>

1195
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.100
<v Speaker 2>you put them in a head to head </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

1196
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
<v Speaker 2>The equilibrated system will outcompete </v>
<v Speaker 2>the disequilibrium system because the </v>

1197
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.320
<v Speaker 2>enforcement cost is such that it will </v>
<v Speaker 2>slow the system down,</v>

1198
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:41.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you'll get resistances from the </v>

1199
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.670
<v Speaker 2>people inside the system.</v>

1200
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 2>They'll work at the system will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>working at counter purposes to itself.</v>

1201
01:01:43.461 --> 01:01:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Plus there's enforcement costs and so a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny can be to neil calibrated system</v>

1202
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:53.710
<v Speaker 2>and I was really excited to encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea because when I encountered it </v>

1203
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I was also trying to figure out if there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was some quantitative difference between</v>

1204
01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.520
<v Speaker 2>the system say of the Soviet Union in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mao's China and the systems of the west </v>

1205
01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.691
<v Speaker 2>apart from just arbitrary world </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation as the postmodern </v>

1206
01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:12.211
<v Speaker 2>nihilists might have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there is something fundamental at </v>

1207
01:02:12.211 --> 01:02:15.041
<v Speaker 2>stake in the terrible cold war that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought or if it was just a matter of </v>

1208
01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1209
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:20.081
<v Speaker 2>when the pig Eddie and take was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well roughly speaking is that the West </v>

1210
01:02:20.081 --> 01:02:22.490
<v Speaker 2>was Nicola braided system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not perfectly equilibrated,</v>

1211
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.620
<v Speaker 2>but reasonably celebrated in that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were essentially.</v>

1212
01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:30.621
<v Speaker 2>Even if they were slaves to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were at least voluntary slaves </v>

1213
01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:32.040
<v Speaker 2>instead of involuntary slaves and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was better.</v>

1214
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.280
<v Speaker 2>The system was actually technically </v>
<v Speaker 2>better and not just as a matter of </v>

1215
01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.511
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a lovely thing to know and I </v>

1216
01:02:41.511 --> 01:02:41.511
<v Speaker 2>think it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really solid,</v>

1217
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.990
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really solid idea.</v>

1218
01:02:42.991 --> 01:02:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1219
01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.830
<v Speaker 2>put crowbars under that idea and lifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1220
01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:51.831
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now Sarah Abraham's wife,</v>

1221
01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:52.920
<v Speaker 2>barum new children's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1222
01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to children must one of what?</v>

1223
01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:00.650
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's we're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about with regards to reading these old </v>

1224
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.650
<v Speaker 2>stories because we're so new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're very arrogant,</v>

1225
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:01.270
<v Speaker 2>modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1226
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.330
<v Speaker 2>we look at these old stories and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1227
01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:05.760
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've transcended all that superstition.</v>

1228
01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:07.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be so bloody sure about that.</v>

1229
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:11.100
<v Speaker 2>These people weren't stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's,</v>

1230
01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:16.180
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are ways that they viewed the </v>

1231
01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.021
<v Speaker 2>world that we don't have any more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them seems to be this concern for</v>

1232
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 2>descendants because that just isn't part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our way of thinking.</v>

1233
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.190
<v Speaker 2>We have very short term way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not even one lifetime long,</v>

1234
01:03:26.191 --> 01:03:30.210
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly not multiple lifetimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>long and it isn't clear to me at all for</v>

1235
01:03:30.211 --> 01:03:35.211
<v Speaker 2>the best and you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the constant complaint that the </v>

1236
01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:38.571
<v Speaker 2>environmentalists generate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which is justified in some of </v>

1237
01:03:38.571 --> 01:03:40.740
<v Speaker 2>which is just anticapitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti patriarchal nonsense that should be</v>

1238
01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:45.741
<v Speaker 2>cleared out of that entire conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we need to take a longer view </v>

1239
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.500
<v Speaker 2>and consider more things in our purview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not when we act and like that.</v>

1240
01:03:49.501 --> 01:03:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do we really want an ocean that has</v>

1241
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:55.200
<v Speaker 2>nothing in it but jellyfish because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really what we're doing and we're</v>

1242
01:03:55.201 --> 01:04:00.201
<v Speaker 2>doing it very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly and the data on that are </v>

1243
01:04:00.201 --> 01:04:02.391
<v Speaker 2>very clear and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you lift up your eyes and you make </v>

1244
01:04:02.391 --> 01:04:03.630
<v Speaker 2>a connection with something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent,</v>

1245
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.540
<v Speaker 2>then that should bring more of the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>within your purview.</v>

1246
01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:11.540
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's concerned for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>endless number of descendants that you </v>

1247
01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:11.790
<v Speaker 2>might have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might think to,</v>

1248
01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1249
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:15.870
<v Speaker 2>if you're a successful person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a successful family,</v>

1250
01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.500
<v Speaker 2>God only knows how many people you will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the father of.</v>

1251
01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely because you're a nexus,</v>

1252
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:27.291
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All sorts of things have come together </v>

1253
01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:30.020
<v Speaker 2>in the cosmos to produce you and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of things manifest themselves </v>

1254
01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.740
<v Speaker 2>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea what your potential,</v>

1255
01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:36.890
<v Speaker 2>the potential consequences of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions might be as they cascade across </v>

1256
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:37.890
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1257
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.920
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so Abraham at least is concerned </v>

1258
01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.951
<v Speaker 2>with these sorts of things and God seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be concerned too because he promises </v>

1259
01:04:45.951 --> 01:04:49.611
<v Speaker 2>Abraham that if he maintains the </v>
<v Speaker 2>covenant that the most important things </v>

1260
01:04:49.611 --> 01:04:53.460
<v Speaker 2>that he needs will come to him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty serious about this.</v>

1261
01:04:53.461 --> 01:04:57.660
<v Speaker 2>So Sariah talks to Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not very happy about the fact that</v>

1262
01:04:57.661 --> 01:04:59.970
<v Speaker 2>she can't have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

1263
01:04:59.971 --> 01:05:04.971
<v Speaker 2>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Lord hath restrained me from </v>

1264
01:05:04.971 --> 01:05:05.190
<v Speaker 2>bearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pray thee go in unto my made.</v>

1265
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:10.730
<v Speaker 2>It may be that I obtained children by </v>
<v Speaker 2>her and Abraham hearken to the voice of </v>

1266
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Siri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1267
01:05:10.861 --> 01:05:12.870
<v Speaker 2>that's not a very trivial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't think.</v>

1268
01:05:12.871 --> 01:05:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't imagine that that Sarah was </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1269
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I was very happy about turning her made </v>
<v Speaker 2>over to her husband</v>

1270
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:23.340
<v Speaker 1>and potentially being usurped in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole child bearing and the whole </v>

1271
01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>childbearing process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In the least,</v>

1272
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a major sacrifice on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's part.</v>

1273
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that on of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

1274
01:05:31.391 --> 01:05:36.391
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for us to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethics of the fact that Hagar was a </v>

1275
01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:37.180
<v Speaker 1>more or less than voluntary participant </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>

1276
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but that was the times absolutely the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>

1277
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:45.330
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery in indentured servitude is the </v>

1278
01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>way of mankind except in very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1279
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very limited circumstances.</v>

1280
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Carl young had something to say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that too,</v>

1281
01:05:49.781 --> 01:05:54.781
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that part of the reason that </v>

1282
01:05:54.781 --> 01:05:55.780
<v Speaker 1>modern people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only reason.</v>

1283
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:58.060
<v Speaker 1>There's the industrial revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1284
01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:02.350
<v Speaker 1>but part of the reason that modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been able to escape from the</v>

1285
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:07.590
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe of tyranny and slavery is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've agreed to make ourselves </v>

1286
01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:07.590
<v Speaker 1>our own slaves.</v>

1287
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of owning a slave,</v>

1288
01:06:09.881 --> 01:06:14.881
<v Speaker 1>you own yourself in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you try it yourself off to work </v>

1289
01:06:14.881 --> 01:06:18.811
<v Speaker 1>and exploit yourself so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay alive and maybe it's not something </v>

1290
01:06:18.811 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 1>that you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've taken on the role of slave in</v>

1291
01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:22.420
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to your own survival.</v>

1292
01:06:22.421 --> 01:06:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Instead of forcing someone else to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1293
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:27.130
<v Speaker 1>which is also something I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very noble about the West,</v>

1294
01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:31.090
<v Speaker 1>is that we're willing to enslave </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves as individuals and we're not,</v>

1295
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.060
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing that to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're doing it to some degree,</v>

1296
01:06:34.061 --> 01:06:35.950
<v Speaker 1>obviously because the society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfect,</v>

1297
01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:38.020
<v Speaker 1>but that's something that's very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth thinking about.</v>

1298
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:43.690
<v Speaker 1>So an Abraham hearkened to the voice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Surrey and Surrey.</v>

1299
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Abram's wife took Hagar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her maid the Egyptian after Abraham had </v>

1300
01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.071
<v Speaker 1>dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave her to her husband Abraham to be </v>

1301
01:06:53.071 --> 01:06:53.071
<v Speaker 1>his wife.</v>

1302
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:57.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing that's been so </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about doing this.</v>

1303
01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.650
<v Speaker 1>One of the other things about doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical series,</v>

1304
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:01.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the things that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool about Google,</v>

1305
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:07.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that they cut off my </v>

1306
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:07.930
<v Speaker 1>account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1307
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:11.950
<v Speaker 1>you can find any piece of art that ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed on Google.</v>

1308
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.660
<v Speaker 1>And so that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1309
01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm trying to illustrate these,</v>

1310
01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:20.940
<v Speaker 1>these lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I type in Abraham Renaissance and then </v>

1311
01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.140
<v Speaker 1>like I get 200 renaissance paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so great.</v>

1312
01:07:23.141 --> 01:07:28.141
<v Speaker 1>And then I can look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the other things that's so </v>

1313
01:07:28.141 --> 01:07:30.571
<v Speaker 1>remarkable is that all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the major themes of the stories have </v>

1314
01:07:30.571 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Speaker 1>been illustrated by people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular,</v>

1315
01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:36.550
<v Speaker 1>my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind expanding talent.</v>

1316
01:07:36.551 --> 01:07:40.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just this endless array of,</v>

1317
01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

1318
01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an amazing painting.</v>

1319
01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.490
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's an of this,</v>

1320
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:47.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1321
01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:52.920
<v Speaker 1>there's dozens of paintings on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>theme and it's just another indication </v>

1322
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.780
<v Speaker 1>of how obsessed people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1323
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:58.800
<v Speaker 1>this was the only book that existed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and people were absolutely </v>

1324
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.330
<v Speaker 1>obsessed by it and produced all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing things from it.</v>

1325
01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:06.930
<v Speaker 1>And we're in danger of losing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big mistake because it's </v>

1326
01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:10.411
<v Speaker 1>magnificent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little humility would go a long way </v>

1327
01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:13.471
<v Speaker 1>towards restoring it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went into unto Hagar and she </v>

1328
01:08:13.691 --> 01:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>conceived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when she saw that she had conceived,</v>

1329
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:21.881
<v Speaker 1>her mistress was despised in her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Hagar was successful and that was a </v>

1330
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:27.260
<v Speaker 1>hallmark of feminine success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1331
01:08:27.261 --> 01:08:32.261
<v Speaker 1>And certainly then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she started to Lord it over </v>

1332
01:08:32.261 --> 01:08:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Sariah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seemed a little bit on the </v>

1333
01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:36.340
<v Speaker 1>ungrateful side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1334
01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:40.451
<v Speaker 1>because I made a big sacrifice to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hagar to become Abram's wife.</v>

1335
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And so a little bit of gratitude would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been an order,</v>

1336
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that's how the story goes.</v>

1337
01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>And Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said unto Abraham,</v>

1338
01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>my wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be upon thee.</v>

1339
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I have given my maiden to Buddhism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when she saw that she had conceived,</v>

1340
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I was despised in her eyes.</v>

1341
01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>The Lord judge between you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Abraham said unto him,</v>

1342
01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:02.810
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

1343
01:09:02.811 --> 01:09:05.510
<v Speaker 1>thy maid is in dine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hand due to her as it pleases you.</v>

1344
01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And when Sarah dealt hardly with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hagar fled from her face.</v>

1345
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.800
<v Speaker 1>And the angel of the Lord Found Her by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fountain of Water in the Wilderness,</v>

1346
01:09:12.801 --> 01:09:14.780
<v Speaker 1>by the fountain in the way to assure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1347
01:09:14.781 --> 01:09:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Hagar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's maid,</v>

1348
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:19.070
<v Speaker 1>whence chemists and whether wilt thou </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1349
01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.890
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I flee from the face of my mistress.</v>

1350
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.540
<v Speaker 1>And the angel of the Lord said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>returned to my mistress and submit under</v>

1351
01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:28.340
<v Speaker 1>her hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the angel said,</v>

1352
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I will multiply your seed exceedingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it shall not be numbered for </v>

1353
01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.010
<v Speaker 1>multitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the angel said,</v>

1354
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.570
<v Speaker 1>behold thou art with child and shall </v>
<v Speaker 1>thou shall bear a son and shall call his</v>

1355
01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:39.320
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ishmael.</v>

1356
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:44.800
<v Speaker 1>And Ishmael means God hears by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Lord hath heard thy </v>

1357
01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.761
<v Speaker 1>affliction and he'll be a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His hand will be against every man and </v>

1358
01:09:48.761 --> 01:09:52.270
<v Speaker 1>every man's hand against him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>shall dwell in the presence of all his </v>

1359
01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:52.270
<v Speaker 1>brothers.</v>

1360
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:58.540
<v Speaker 1>And she called the name of the Lord that</v>
<v Speaker 1>spake unto her thou God CSB for she </v>

1361
01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.470
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have I also hear looked after him,</v>

1362
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:04.400
<v Speaker 1>that me were for the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well was called Beer la Roy.</v>

1363
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:07.550
<v Speaker 1>And that means the well of sees me in </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

1364
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:11.780
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting interlude because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Abraham,</v>

1365
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:17.050
<v Speaker 1>God has established his covenant with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham and obviously things are going </v>

1366
01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 1>wrong in the household in a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious way,</v>

1367
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:23.230
<v Speaker 1>like a really serious way because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's now had a child by another woman </v>

1368
01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:27.881
<v Speaker 1>and that the two women are not getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and one is beating the other </v>

1369
01:10:27.881 --> 01:10:30.020
<v Speaker 1>because of her insubordination and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and contempt.</v>

1370
01:10:30.021 --> 01:10:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And so she's so desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she runs out into the desert where she's</v>

1371
01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:38.741
<v Speaker 1>probably going to die and God comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and says anyways to to to to Hagar</v>

1372
01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:45.590
<v Speaker 1>that her son Shell as well be the father</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nations.</v>

1373
01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly a reflection back </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the power of Abraham's covenant,</v>

1374
01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:50.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though even though things are going</v>

1375
01:10:50.841 --> 01:10:54.650
<v Speaker 1>terribly wrong locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the fact that Abraham has made</v>

1376
01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:58.760
<v Speaker 1>this overarching agreement with God </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that all of these catastrophes are</v>

1377
01:10:58.761 --> 01:11:01.970
<v Speaker 1>taking place within a bounded space </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the arc.</v>

1378
01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:03.890
<v Speaker 1>We could say that's one way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

1379
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:09.100
<v Speaker 1>And I do think I do think that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>right because it seems to me that you </v>

1380
01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.780
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everything falls apart around you,</v>

1381
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>there's this a couple of things you're</v>

1382
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.040
<v Speaker 2>going to want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to want someone standing </v>

1383
01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:19.040
<v Speaker 2>beside you that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can trust.</v>

1384
01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.481
<v Speaker 2>You're going to want your family around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you want to want them to have </v>

1385
01:11:23.481 --> 01:11:27.201
<v Speaker 2>your back and you're going to want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you didn't do some God damn </v>

1386
01:11:27.201 --> 01:11:28.800
<v Speaker 2>stupid thing to bring all held down on </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

1387
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.190
<v Speaker 2>And if you're lacking any of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that crisis comes,</v>

1388
01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.950
<v Speaker 2>there's a high probability it will </v>
<v Speaker 2>flatten you and you won't be able to get</v>

1389
01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1390
01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:40.850
<v Speaker 2>it does seem to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can ask yourself this question when </v>

1391
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:45.320
<v Speaker 2>things collapse around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much utility is knowledge of your </v>

1392
01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.280
<v Speaker 2>own moral virtue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad enough to be late.</v>

1393
01:11:47.281 --> 01:11:52.281
<v Speaker 2>It's bad to be laid load,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be laid low and to know that you </v>

1394
01:11:52.281 --> 01:11:56.031
<v Speaker 2>were the fault you were at fault for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and worse the things that you did that </v>

1395
01:11:56.031 --> 01:11:58.440
<v Speaker 2>you knew you did that were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought you there.</v>

1396
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Then I think you have nothing to stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>on in that situation.</v>

1397
01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:05.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's also the circumstances under </v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think you're more more likely at</v>

1398
01:12:05.911 --> 01:12:08.040
<v Speaker 2>least to be abandoned by people around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1399
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:12.240
<v Speaker 2>So given that you know that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe is coming right,</v>

1400
01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:14.100
<v Speaker 2>that the tragedy of life will strike </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1401
01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:14.940
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1402
01:12:14.941 --> 01:12:16.590
<v Speaker 2>how do you afford to fire yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>against that?</v>

1403
01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.820
<v Speaker 2>And I'll obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to some degree you do that by being</v>

1404
01:12:20.821 --> 01:12:24.090
<v Speaker 2>materially sensible and these old people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the test,</v>

1405
01:12:24.091 --> 01:12:25.650
<v Speaker 2>in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ancient people,</v>

1406
01:12:25.651 --> 01:12:30.651
<v Speaker 2>they weren't blind to the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a good crop and some animals you </v>

1407
01:12:30.651 --> 01:12:35.481
<v Speaker 2>know that that's an that's an integral </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of their life to take care of </v>

1408
01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:38.901
<v Speaker 2>themselves physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also wise enough to know </v>

1409
01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:42.120
<v Speaker 2>that there is an element of moral this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

1410
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:47.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a necessity for moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>integration that defends you against the</v>

1411
01:12:47.161 --> 01:12:52.161
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe of existence even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively than anything material and </v>

1412
01:12:52.161 --> 01:12:56.850
<v Speaker 2>even more that the stability of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>material things is more dependent on the</v>

1413
01:12:56.851 --> 01:13:00.540
<v Speaker 2>integrity of your spirit than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity of your spirit is dependent on</v>

1414
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:01.470
<v Speaker 2>the material things.</v>

1415
01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:04.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think the evidence for that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually quite clear.</v>

1416
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I read it wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read a very interesting book a while </v>

1417
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.721
<v Speaker 2>back called the wealth and poverty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nations that was written by a Harvard </v>

1418
01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.980
<v Speaker 2>emeritus professor of history and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that he claimed I liked it.</v>

1419
01:13:13.981 --> 01:13:18.981
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that the only true natural </v>

1420
01:13:18.981 --> 01:13:19.530
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal trust.</v>

1421
01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.560
<v Speaker 2>If you can set up a society where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust each other,</v>

1422
01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:26.190
<v Speaker 2>then it will instantly become rich and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he used the example of Japan,</v>

1423
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.760
<v Speaker 2>which is a very conscientious society </v>
<v Speaker 2>and very rich society,</v>

1424
01:13:29.761 --> 01:13:31.980
<v Speaker 2>but the Japanese have no natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

1425
01:13:31.981 --> 01:13:33.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>None to speak of,</v>

1426
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:39.200
<v Speaker 2>and yet they're rich and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries like the Soviet Russia and </v>

1427
01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.120
<v Speaker 2>much of South America where there's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural resources that you know,</v>

1428
01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.200
<v Speaker 2>they're just like Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just more natural resources than </v>

1429
01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do with and the places are </v>

1430
01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:50.121
<v Speaker 2>absolute catastrophes.</v>

1431
01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Absolute catastrophes of cynicism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>

1432
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:57.590
<v Speaker 2>And so he attempted to document the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between default </v>

1433
01:13:57.590 --> 01:14:02.421
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal trust among citizens </v>
<v Speaker 2>within countries and their productivity </v>

1434
01:14:03.171 --> 01:14:08.171
<v Speaker 2>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their GDP and their standard of living </v>

1435
01:14:08.171 --> 01:14:08.171
<v Speaker 2>and found a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very tight relationship.</v>

1436
01:14:08.171 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 2>And I liked that a lot and I've got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story about that quickly that I think is</v>

1437
01:14:11.711 --> 01:14:14.200
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you two stories.</v>

1438
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:19.150
<v Speaker 2>One sort of generic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you one personal first.</v>

1439
01:14:19.151 --> 01:14:24.151
<v Speaker 2>So one day I lend my car to one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate students and he took it to </v>

1440
01:14:24.151 --> 01:14:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was this old Cadillac and he got.</v>

1441
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:32.430
<v Speaker 2>It was a really bad rainstorm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Montreal and he was in one of the </v>

1442
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:35.580
<v Speaker 2>highways that are like set into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and there was like six inches of </v>

1443
01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:39.031
<v Speaker 2>water and he was turning a corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit the brakes and skidded on the water </v>

1444
01:14:39.031 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>and smacked it into the wall and on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner of the,</v>

1445
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:41.800
<v Speaker 2>of the bumper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1446
01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.710
<v Speaker 2>and so then he brought it back and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was very apologetic about it.</v>

1447
01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:45.820
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1448
01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:51.090
<v Speaker 2>his name was matt shade will tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because Matt might hear this and I </v>

1449
01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 2>can shame them and they get for doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this 20 years ago,</v>

1450
01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:53.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1451
01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:57.850
<v Speaker 2>he's a professor at the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 2>Institute of Technology,</v>

1452
01:14:57.851 --> 01:15:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I think now quite a successful one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

1453
01:15:00.491 --> 01:15:05.050
<v Speaker 2>he brought the car back and I went and </v>
<v Speaker 2>got it evaluated for damages.</v>

1454
01:15:05.051 --> 01:15:07.930
<v Speaker 2>It was like $1,700</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something to repair it and,</v>

1455
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:11.290
<v Speaker 2>or maybe more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was almost as much as the car was</v>

1456
01:15:11.291 --> 01:15:12.490
<v Speaker 2>worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

1457
01:15:12.491 --> 01:15:14.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>

1458
01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.440
<v Speaker 2>So I went online and I typed in the part</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you do that you can get people to</v>

1459
01:15:20.711 --> 01:15:23.740
<v Speaker 2>bid on sending you used part from all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over North America.</v>

1460
01:15:23.741 --> 01:15:28.741
<v Speaker 2>So that's Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's all these junk dealers have </v>

1461
01:15:28.741 --> 01:15:28.970
<v Speaker 2>got together and they have this network </v>
<v Speaker 2>of communication.</v>

1462
01:15:28.971 --> 01:15:31.140
<v Speaker 2>So you put in the car part and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>send you a bit.</v>

1463
01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:33.100
<v Speaker 2>And so this guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1464
01:15:33.101 --> 01:15:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you that bumper assembly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the whole bumper and the lights</v>

1465
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.060
<v Speaker 2>for like 250 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

1466
01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:39.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1467
01:15:39.591 --> 01:15:40.990
<v Speaker 2>if you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be good.</v>

1468
01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:46.320
<v Speaker 2>So then I said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he called me up about half an </v>

1469
01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.830
<v Speaker 2>hour later if this guy from way down </v>
<v Speaker 2>south,</v>

1470
01:15:47.831 --> 01:15:49.720
<v Speaker 2>he had a really deep sort of Mississippi</v>
<v Speaker 2>accent.</v>

1471
01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:51.490
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a sec,</v>

1472
01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.950
<v Speaker 2>was that for the bumper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bumper assembly?</v>

1473
01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.530
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it was for the bumper assembly.</v>

1474
01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:57.190
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1475
01:15:57.191 --> 01:15:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was for the bumper and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

1476
01:15:58.691 --> 01:16:00.610
<v Speaker 2>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send it to you anyways.</v>

1477
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:02.740
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's pretty good.</v>

1478
01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well thank you.</v>

1479
01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:07.690
<v Speaker 2>And then I hung up and then half an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>later he called me up again and he said,</v>

1480
01:16:07.691 --> 01:16:12.691
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just went out and looked at that </v>

1481
01:16:12.691 --> 01:16:14.041
<v Speaker 2>bumper assembly and there's a plastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>trim piece on this side and it has a </v>

1482
01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:14.041
<v Speaker 2>scratch in it.</v>

1483
01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:18.510
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better tell you that just in case you </v>

1484
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.510
<v Speaker 2>didn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

1485
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.880
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so amazing.</v>

1486
01:16:18.881 --> 01:16:21.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a miracle man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this guy,</v>

1487
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.790
<v Speaker 2>he's somewhere in Mississippi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never gonna see him again.</v>

1488
01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never going to have any contact with </v>

1489
01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:29.820
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he made a bad deal,</v>

1490
01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:34.171
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the part was worth more than he </v>

1491
01:16:34.171 --> 01:16:34.171
<v Speaker 2>decided to sell it to me for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he stuck with this deal.</v>

1492
01:16:34.171 --> 01:16:35.830
<v Speaker 2>And then he went over and above the call</v>
<v Speaker 2>of duty,</v>

1493
01:16:35.831 --> 01:16:36.340
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1494
01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:41.080
<v Speaker 2>this part that I'm selling you to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>for way less than it's worth is damaged.</v>

1495
01:16:41.081 --> 01:16:42.610
<v Speaker 2>So I thought I'd better tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1496
01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:48.180
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to recognize a miracle when you </v>

1497
01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:48.180
<v Speaker 2>see one that was a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

1498
01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.650
<v Speaker 2>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for calling man.</v>

1499
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:55.830
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can handle the scratch then the part </v>

1500
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.830
<v Speaker 2>needed.</v>

1501
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:58.660
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I got the car fixed and forgave </v>

1502
01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1503
01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.860
<v Speaker 2>it had a happy ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's trust,</v>

1504
01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:05.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I didn't know him from Adam and </v>

1505
01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.970
<v Speaker 2>he's a primate full of snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the rest of us.</v>

1506
01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:12.180
<v Speaker 2>And yet he was willing to simplify </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself to the point where I could just </v>

1507
01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:15.221
<v Speaker 2>take him absolutely at his word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that meant we could trade even </v>

1508
01:17:15.221 --> 01:17:15.221
<v Speaker 2>though we were strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1509
01:17:15.221 --> 01:17:20.110
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not underestimate the utility of </v>

1510
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's Ebay.</v>

1511
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 2>So when Ebay first started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1512
01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:26.020
<v Speaker 2>the idea was not gonna work because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll send me junk and I'll send you a </v>

1513
01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:27.250
<v Speaker 2>check that bounces and that'll be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of Ebay.</v>

1514
01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these escrow agents popped up so </v>

1515
01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:35.561
<v Speaker 2>you could insure your transaction with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them moves for like 10 percent of the </v>

1516
01:17:35.561 --> 01:17:38.981
<v Speaker 2>transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would get the check and the goods </v>

1517
01:17:38.981 --> 01:17:41.591
<v Speaker 2>and make sure that they were okay and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then send them on or ensure the </v>

1518
01:17:41.591 --> 01:17:41.591
<v Speaker 2>transaction.</v>

1519
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:44.450
<v Speaker 2>But what happened was the escrow agents </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't make any money.</v>

1520
01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:47.270
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that was no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheated.</v>

1521
01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.790
<v Speaker 2>And you think about how amazing that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1522
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:52.610
<v Speaker 2>You bring these people together across a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole continent,</v>

1523
01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:57.611
<v Speaker 2>they've never seen each other before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're never going to interact with </v>

1524
01:17:57.611 --> 01:18:00.551
<v Speaker 2>each other again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was before there were any </v>

1525
01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:02.291
<v Speaker 2>reputation ratings on Ebay and yet the </v>
<v Speaker 2>default transaction was you describe </v>

1526
01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:04.700
<v Speaker 2>your goods honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including their flaws.</v>

1527
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:07.670
<v Speaker 2>You set a reasonable price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided to pay you.</v>

1528
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:11.030
<v Speaker 2>You ship the goods and I pay you and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>

1529
01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:13.910
<v Speaker 2>and what happened was that Ebay </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced,</v>

1530
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:18.290
<v Speaker 2>produced a tremendous amount of capital </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was previously frozen,</v>

1531
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 2>so frozen capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you've invested money in something,</v>

1532
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:23.840
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is no longer useful to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1533
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:26.360
<v Speaker 2>So the money is just sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen,</v>

1534
01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to speak,</v>

1535
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.380
<v Speaker 2>and you can't get it loose because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1536
01:18:30.381 --> 01:18:32.000
<v Speaker 2>you've got an attic full of junk.</v>

1537
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.190
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to get rid of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1538
01:18:34.191 --> 01:18:39.191
<v Speaker 2>he may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so all of a sudden all these things </v>

1539
01:18:39.191 --> 01:18:41.051
<v Speaker 2>that were just junk became valuable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody got richer and none of that </v>

1540
01:18:41.051 --> 01:18:45.101
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would have happened without the </v>

1541
01:18:45.101 --> 01:18:45.101
<v Speaker 2>covenant that we established between </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

1542
01:18:45.101 --> 01:18:48.940
<v Speaker 2>That's predicated on trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say that trust is the </v>

1543
01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:51.470
<v Speaker 2>currency and currency is trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a promissory note,</v>

1544
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.850
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if people lie,</v>

1545
01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:57.851
<v Speaker 2>then the currency gets debased very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly and so the economy runs on </v>

1546
01:18:57.851 --> 01:19:01.781
<v Speaker 2>trust and so that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overarching covenant.</v>

1547
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:11.650
<v Speaker 2>So Abraham makes this covenant with God </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he decides that he's going to aim </v>

1548
01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:16.781
<v Speaker 2>high and live a good life and tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and that puts this boundary around</v>

1549
01:19:16.941 --> 01:19:19.130
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a walled garden.</v>

1550
01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like a walled garden and inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>there there's all sorts of things that </v>

1551
01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:24.440
<v Speaker 2>are happening that are complex and </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult,</v>

1552
01:19:24.441 --> 01:19:27.740
<v Speaker 2>but outside there's a boundary and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundary is,</v>

1553
01:19:27.741 --> 01:19:30.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe things won't.</v>

1554
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:33.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like God says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the flood he says,</v>

1555
01:19:33.861 --> 01:19:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I'll never send a flood again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the story.</v>

1556
01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:39.560
<v Speaker 2>And so there's an intimation there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how bad things get,</v>

1557
01:19:39.561 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 2>they won't get so bad that they'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic.</v>

1558
01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:44.390
<v Speaker 2>But there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a Coda to that which is that you</v>

1559
01:19:44.391 --> 01:19:49.391
<v Speaker 2>have to maintain the covenant and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what that means,</v>

1560
01:19:51.561 --> 01:19:53.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1561
01:19:53.031 --> 01:19:57.170
<v Speaker 2>you think it's pretty obvious that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you treat people well,</v>

1562
01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:01.730
<v Speaker 2>if you really think about it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not being naively optimistic and like,</v>

1563
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:03.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nice,</v>

1564
01:20:03.411 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 2>good person for op with all the weakness</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1565
01:20:05.661 --> 01:20:06.340
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1566
01:20:06.341 --> 01:20:07.000
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1567
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.780
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1568
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:10.260
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that intimate,</v>

1569
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:15.910
<v Speaker 2>if you're being hard nosed insensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand that if you treat people,</v>

1570
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:19.620
<v Speaker 2>if you trust people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an act of courage.</v>

1571
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:20.730
<v Speaker 2>If you're not naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1572
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:25.910
<v Speaker 2>If you're naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an act of stupidity because you </v>

1573
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:27.420
<v Speaker 2>might get bit and you probably will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're naive and you get bit,</v>

1574
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you will suffer for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll traumatize you.</v>

1575
01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:32.100
<v Speaker 2>But if you're not naive and you know you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get that,</v>

1576
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.820
<v Speaker 2>then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1577
01:20:32.821 --> 01:20:37.821
<v Speaker 2>what should you do with people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is you should trust them </v>

1578
01:20:37.821 --> 01:20:40.320
<v Speaker 2>not because you're naive and not because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't betray you and not because</v>

1579
01:20:40.321 --> 01:20:44.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't know that they could be trail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because if you hold out your hand in</v>

1580
01:20:44.761 --> 01:20:47.820
<v Speaker 2>trust and you're inviting the best part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that person to step forward,</v>

1581
01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:50.970
<v Speaker 2>and that won't happen unless you take </v>
<v Speaker 2>that initial step and that's courage,</v>

1582
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.220
<v Speaker 2>not naivety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to trust someone,</v>

1583
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:58.221
<v Speaker 2>once your eyes are open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an act of courage and that opens </v>

1584
01:20:58.221 --> 01:20:58.650
<v Speaker 2>up the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you might say,</v>

1585
01:20:58.651 --> 01:20:59.160
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1586
01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:10.960
<v Speaker 2>and so there's this idea in this story </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can withstand it.</v>

1587
01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 2>A fair bit of the catastrophe of life by</v>
<v Speaker 2>establishing the proper covenant and by </v>

1588
01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:19.990
<v Speaker 2>acting in a trustworthy manner and </v>
<v Speaker 2>extending your hand to people properly.</v>

1589
01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.090
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1590
01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sensible.</v>

1591
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I can understand how that would work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can certainly see how the opposite </v>

1592
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.250
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

1593
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:32.850
<v Speaker 2>if I have to be absolutely terrified </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to be trained me at </v>

1594
01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:34.390
<v Speaker 2>every possible moment and we're in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiation,</v>

1595
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:36.000
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to get any work done </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1596
01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm going to be figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're up to all the time and </v>

1597
01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:44.521
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be figuring out what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to all the time and we're just not </v>

1598
01:21:44.521 --> 01:21:47.011
<v Speaker 2>going to get anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll come and say you're going to do </v>

1599
01:21:47.011 --> 01:21:47.011
<v Speaker 2>something and I can just simplify you.</v>

1600
01:21:47.011 --> 01:21:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I can say you're going to do what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said you do.</v>

1601
01:21:47.561 --> 01:21:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to worry about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the same applies to me and then</v>

1602
01:21:51.131 --> 01:21:53.410
<v Speaker 2>we can go do something and that's how we</v>
<v Speaker 2>generate wealth.</v>

1603
01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:54.700
<v Speaker 2>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1604
01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:57.730
<v Speaker 2>if what's the ultimate limit of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1605
01:21:57.731 --> 01:22:02.731
<v Speaker 2>like we know that there's corruption in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our society that people betray each </v>

1606
01:22:02.731 --> 01:22:05.731
<v Speaker 2>other than the deceit and all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it causes things like the periodic </v>

1607
01:22:05.731 --> 01:22:10.051
<v Speaker 2>collapse in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was complicated but was partly </v>

1608
01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:13.111
<v Speaker 2>engendered by corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what would be the upside if we </v>

1609
01:22:13.111 --> 01:22:15.850
<v Speaker 2>acted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we really determined to act honestly,</v>

1610
01:22:15.851 --> 01:22:18.850
<v Speaker 2>what do you think it is that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be able to do with the world if we</v>

1611
01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:22.600
<v Speaker 2>stopped acting in a corrupt manner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1612
01:22:22.601 --> 01:22:24.030
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the like what,</v>

1613
01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.840
<v Speaker 2>what is the upside?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we could,</v>

1614
01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:26.980
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

1615
01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.620
<v Speaker 2>How far back could we push aging?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think?</v>

1616
01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.010
<v Speaker 2>If we hit it hard for 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we tripled our lifespan?</v>

1617
01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.230
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1618
01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.960
<v Speaker 2>all these terrible diseases that we set </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>

1619
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 2>We could get rid of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for hunger and </v>

1620
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 2>starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make enough food.</v>

1621
01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:47.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like what would happen if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped acting badly?</v>

1622
01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:51.490
<v Speaker 2>How much better could things get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you start locally.</v>

1623
01:22:51.491 --> 01:22:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I think you start with yourself and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start with your family,</v>

1624
01:22:53.771 --> 01:22:56.800
<v Speaker 2>but you know there's intimations of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>divine.</v>

1625
01:22:56.801 --> 01:23:00.880
<v Speaker 2>There's intimations of the Kingdom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>God and the Covenant with God in the Old</v>

1626
01:23:00.881 --> 01:23:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you think,</v>

1627
01:23:02.411 --> 01:23:04.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we speak secularly.</v>

1628
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:05.770
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1629
01:23:05.771 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

1630
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:08.170
<v Speaker 1>an unprovable assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1631
01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:08.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just.</v>

1632
01:23:08.831 --> 01:23:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the assumption here?</v>

1633
01:23:11.471 --> 01:23:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the upper end for humanity?</v>

1634
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

1635
01:23:15.761 --> 01:23:16.810
<v Speaker 1>who's going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1636
01:23:16.811 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in this day and age,</v>

1637
01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:23.761
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things happening that </v>

1638
01:23:23.761 --> 01:23:25.441
<v Speaker 1>you can't even comprehend them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could we do if we put all of our </v>

1639
01:23:25.441 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 1>effort into it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you can experiment with that,</v>

1640
01:23:26.051 --> 01:23:27.580
<v Speaker 1>because you can start in your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>household,</v>

1641
01:23:27.581 --> 01:23:32.581
<v Speaker 1>you can start in your own room and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could make miracles happen in the </v>

1642
01:23:32.581 --> 01:23:34.660
<v Speaker 1>confines of your own space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1643
01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do is try.</v>

1644
01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:38.920
<v Speaker 1>You'll see that that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened and people are writing to me</v>

1645
01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:40.630
<v Speaker 1>and telling me that they're trying this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

1646
01:23:40.631 --> 01:23:45.631
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what's happening and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't want to be too cynical about</v>

1647
01:23:48.170 --> 01:23:51.830
<v Speaker 1>about where we might be headed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hagar bore Abraham a son,</v>

1648
01:23:51.831 --> 01:23:54.170
<v Speaker 1>and Abraham called his son's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Hagar bear,</v>

1649
01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Ishmael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is by tradition the forefather of </v>

1650
01:23:59.380 --> 01:23:59.480
<v Speaker 1>several Arab nations and of Mohammed </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

1651
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:04.970
<v Speaker 1>and Abraham was four score and six years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old when Hagar Ishmael to Abrams.</v>

1652
01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:11.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's the end of another story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so that section ends,</v>

1653
01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:16.100
<v Speaker 1>and then again we have an encounter </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Abraham and God who when Abraham</v>

1654
01:24:16.101 --> 01:24:19.580
<v Speaker 1>was 90 years old and nine 99 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lord appeared to him and said,</v>

1655
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I am the Almighty God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walk before me and be thou perfect.</v>

1656
01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Alexander mcclaren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is our,</v>

1657
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:39.530
<v Speaker 1>a biblical commentator who lived in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early 19th century,</v>

1658
01:24:39.531 --> 01:24:44.531
<v Speaker 1>said this phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking before God is not precisely </v>

1659
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:46.820
<v Speaker 1>walking with God because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Noah did,</v>

1660
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:48.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1661
01:24:48.561 --> 01:24:53.561
<v Speaker 1>it's rather that have an active life </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent in continual consciousness of </v>

1662
01:24:53.561 --> 01:24:57.071
<v Speaker 1>being naked and open before the eyes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to have whom we have to give </v>

1663
01:24:57.071 --> 01:25:01.361
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty happy to stumble across </v>

1664
01:25:01.361 --> 01:25:01.610
<v Speaker 1>that because I mean I might've picked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and chosen.</v>

1665
01:25:01.611 --> 01:25:06.611
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd never know that whether you do </v>

1666
01:25:06.611 --> 01:25:08.261
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem in keeping with the </v>

1667
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:08.261
<v Speaker 1>narrative strain of the chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1668
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Because what we've hypothesized so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that God has called Abraham and said,</v>

1669
01:25:11.531 --> 01:25:13.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out there in the world gold,</v>

1670
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:18.830
<v Speaker 1>gold to where it's unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to where you're a stranger and get </v>

1671
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:19.760
<v Speaker 1>away from the familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go out to the unknown,</v>

1672
01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.670
<v Speaker 1>establish yourself and great things will</v>
<v Speaker 1>come of it.</v>

1673
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of the proximal evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great things will come of it,</v>

1674
01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.060
<v Speaker 1>and so I think that's what the walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>before God refers to.</v>

1675
01:25:29.061 --> 01:25:31.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not like Abraham is acting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty.</v>

1676
01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:36.280
<v Speaker 1>There's no certainty here that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the act of the leap of faith even </v>

1677
01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.760
<v Speaker 1>because it does require a leap of faith </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to move into the world because </v>

1678
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.170
<v Speaker 1>the world is a catastrophe of self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evidently the world is a catastrophe and</v>

1679
01:25:42.171 --> 01:25:43.460
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1680
01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:49.060
<v Speaker 1>there's every reason for you to assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should just sit in your </v>

1681
01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:51.200
<v Speaker 1>basement and hide from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not.</v>

1682
01:25:51.201 --> 01:25:52.970
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make things better.</v>

1683
01:25:52.971 --> 01:25:54.950
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is perhaps you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>built for that.</v>

1684
01:25:54.951 --> 01:25:59.951
<v Speaker 1>You're not built to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that people are built to </v>

1685
01:25:59.951 --> 01:25:59.951
<v Speaker 1>hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it destroys them.</v>

1686
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 1>So walking before God in sense means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Abraham</v>

1687
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.270
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could say,</v>

1688
01:26:05.271 --> 01:26:10.271
<v Speaker 2>is taking the lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the person that's going out there </v>

1689
01:26:10.271 --> 01:26:10.271
<v Speaker 2>into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God says,</v>

1690
01:26:10.271 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great things are gonna happen,</v>

1691
01:26:11.121 --> 01:26:13.250
<v Speaker 2>but he's a little short on details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

1692
01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:16.850
<v Speaker 2>So the weight is still on Abraham and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing because it also that</v>

1693
01:26:16.851 --> 01:26:18.170
<v Speaker 2>ennoble Abraham Ham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1694
01:26:18.171 --> 01:26:23.171
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing that's so cool is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if God had just laid out the whole </v>

1695
01:26:23.171 --> 01:26:23.171
<v Speaker 2>story and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1696
01:26:23.171 --> 01:26:27.660
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brush the branches from Abraham's path </v>

1697
01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:28.850
<v Speaker 2>while he was walking forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then there'd be nothing for Abraham</v>

1698
01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:33.851
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'd be no nobility in his own </v>

1699
01:26:33.851 --> 01:26:34.530
<v Speaker 2>pursuit and this is another thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand very well.</v>

1700
01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:39.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a really tough thing to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like how much trouble would you want </v>

1701
01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 2>there not to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird question,</v>

1702
01:26:42.261 --> 01:26:44.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you want to have some to contend</v>

1703
01:26:44.301 --> 01:26:44.690
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1704
01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:49.900
<v Speaker 2>You want to have something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that forces from you the best that you </v>

1705
01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:50.720
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have to have real problems.</v>

1706
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you dispense with all your real,</v>

1707
01:26:53.181 --> 01:26:57.590
<v Speaker 2>but you could just lay down on a bed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have pablum infused into your mouth.</v>

1708
01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:02.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if all your problems were solved and so </v>

1709
01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:05.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe you want difficult problems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can solve something like that </v>

1710
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:07.210
<v Speaker 2>because there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is about it.</v>

1711
01:27:07.211 --> 01:27:12.211
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the overcoming and the and the </v>

1712
01:27:12.211 --> 01:27:14.141
<v Speaker 2>growth that comes along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the nobility of </v>

1713
01:27:14.141 --> 01:27:14.330
<v Speaker 2>the enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You certainly see that when you go about</v>

1714
01:27:14.331 --> 01:27:15.560
<v Speaker 2>having children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1715
01:27:15.561 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1716
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:19.280
<v Speaker 2>the psychological literature is quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear if,</v>

1717
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:24.390
<v Speaker 2>if you do moment to moment comparisons </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who have kids and people who </v>

1718
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:27.941
<v Speaker 2>don't have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who don't have kids are </v>

1719
01:27:27.941 --> 01:27:29.120
<v Speaker 2>happier and so psychologists who tend to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get things wrong,</v>

1720
01:27:29.121 --> 01:27:31.700
<v Speaker 2>even when they make intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>discoveries like that one,</v>

1721
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:36.860
<v Speaker 2>immediately some of them jumped to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion that because happiness is the</v>

1722
01:27:36.861 --> 01:27:41.861
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that while there's something about </v>

1723
01:27:41.861 --> 01:27:41.930
<v Speaker 2>children that make you unhappy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good,</v>

1724
01:27:41.931 --> 01:27:42.440
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1725
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:45.050
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe that's the wrong metric.</v>

1726
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:50.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course you're less happy once you </v>

1727
01:27:50.050 --> 01:27:50.050
<v Speaker 2>have children because you have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them.</v>

1728
01:27:50.050 --> 01:27:54.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my neighbor down the street who's very </v>

1729
01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:57.131
<v Speaker 2>smart woman said to me once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only be as happy as your </v>

1730
01:27:57.131 --> 01:27:58.520
<v Speaker 2>unhappiest child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thought was really good.</v>

1731
01:27:58.521 --> 01:27:59.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really smart,</v>

1732
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:01.400
<v Speaker 2>but then it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1733
01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:03.140
<v Speaker 2>if having children doesn't make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>

1734
01:28:03.141 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 2>the answer isn't don't have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1735
01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:07.850
<v Speaker 2>don't be so stupid about being happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the answer.</v>

1736
01:28:07.851 --> 01:28:10.490
<v Speaker 2>It's because there's a nobility in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuit,</v>

1737
01:28:10.491 --> 01:28:12.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course now you're responsible,</v>

1738
01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.560
<v Speaker 2>you know you have a new baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think especially if you're a new </v>

1739
01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:17.560
<v Speaker 2>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1740
01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:20.720
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is this and what am I </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do with it?</v>

1741
01:28:20.721 --> 01:28:21.470
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1742
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:24.770
<v Speaker 2>and then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done for the rest of your life.</v>

1743
01:28:24.771 --> 01:28:29.771
<v Speaker 2>You never sleep properly again because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be worried about this </v>

1744
01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:30.290
<v Speaker 2>creature that you have to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1745
01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.880
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell good are you?</v>

1746
01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.930
<v Speaker 2>If you're not doing that or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else equally difficult because you just,</v>

1747
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:40.940
<v Speaker 2>you just have been called out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you take on a responsibility like</v>

1748
01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:45.941
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that life is that happiness is </v>

1749
01:28:45.941 --> 01:28:46.550
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like great for happiness,</v>

1750
01:28:46.551 --> 01:28:47.630
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it comes along,</v>

1751
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:50.570
<v Speaker 2>you should be thrilled that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>visiting you,</v>

1752
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:53.900
<v Speaker 2>but the notion that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's what you should pursue.</v>

1753
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:57.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the weakest possible notion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1754
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:59.360
<v Speaker 2>as soon as something terrible happens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1755
01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:01.770
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like life is to be happy.</v>

1756
01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1757
01:29:02.251 --> 01:29:04.590
<v Speaker 2>now you have cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how's that?</v>

1758
01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:07.110
<v Speaker 2>How the happiness thing work it out for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you now,</v>

1759
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:10.770
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it's not you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1760
01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:15.771
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's your father that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's disease or some damn thing </v>

1761
01:29:15.771 --> 01:29:19.131
<v Speaker 2>and you know it's like it's a rare </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that doesn't have some </v>

1762
01:29:19.131 --> 01:29:19.131
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1763
01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:20.760
<v Speaker 2>one person away from them.</v>

1764
01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.680
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is to be happy.</v>

1765
01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:27.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we can at least derive that from </v>

1766
01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:27.900
<v Speaker 2>these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what they say at all.</v>

1767
01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.500
<v Speaker 2>God's perfectly happy in these stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>to grant the people with whom he forms a</v>

1768
01:29:32.501 --> 01:29:36.480
<v Speaker 2>covenant happiness and prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's never a word that that's the</v>

1769
01:29:36.481 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rule is aim high and get your bloody</v>

1770
01:29:39.991 --> 01:29:41.610
<v Speaker 2>act together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the rule,</v>

1771
01:29:41.611 --> 01:29:46.611
<v Speaker 2>and establish this contractual covenant </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the ultimate ideal and that will </v>

1772
01:29:46.611 --> 01:29:49.260
<v Speaker 2>see you through the catastrophes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a much more mature way of looking</v>

1773
01:29:49.261 --> 01:29:54.261
<v Speaker 2>at life as far as I'm concerned because </v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is have your eyes </v>

1774
01:29:54.261 --> 01:29:57.531
<v Speaker 2>half open and you see that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental reality of life is tragedy </v>

1775
01:29:57.531 --> 01:29:59.550
<v Speaker 2>and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that's inescapable.</v>

1776
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.530
<v Speaker 2>The quest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that it,</v>

1777
01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:06.740
<v Speaker 2>it makes life unbearable or that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes being something that shouldn't </v>

1778
01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:08.010
<v Speaker 2>have existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1779
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:13.010
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it means that you have to contend </v>

1780
01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:16.071
<v Speaker 2>with it and you have to get ready and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the willingness to adopt responsibility </v>

1781
01:30:16.071 --> 01:30:18.510
<v Speaker 2>for yourself and for others is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the precondition for that.</v>

1782
01:30:18.511 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe if you do that properly,</v>

1783
01:30:20.611 --> 01:30:22.380
<v Speaker 2>then now and then you get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

1784
01:30:22.381 --> 01:30:27.381
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sit at the end of the day and </v>

1785
01:30:27.381 --> 01:30:29.121
<v Speaker 2>you have half an hour where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscience is clear and there's nothing </v>

1786
01:30:29.121 --> 01:30:29.850
<v Speaker 2>that you need to be doing and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>relax and think,</v>

1787
01:30:29.851 --> 01:30:31.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's all right.</v>

1788
01:30:31.561 --> 01:30:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Things are okay and thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1789
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.420
<v Speaker 2>that's maybe where you get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness.</v>

1790
01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:41.010
<v Speaker 2>So that's something that's growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1791
01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.170
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1792
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 2>and to not know that and to not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>taught that,</v>

1793
01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:49.500
<v Speaker 2>like everyone should be taught that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so obvious we should be taught that.</v>

1794
01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly what these biblical </v>

1795
01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.451
<v Speaker 2>stories do and I will make my covenant </v>
<v Speaker 2>between me and Thee and will multiply </v>

1796
01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 2>the exceedingly and Abraham fell on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

1797
01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah and God talk with him saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as for me,</v>

1798
01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:07.620
<v Speaker 2>behold my covenant is with Thee and Thou</v>
<v Speaker 2>shall be a father of many nations.</v>

1799
01:31:07.621 --> 01:31:09.630
<v Speaker 2>God says this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tabor them right it.</v>

1800
01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like he has to remind him</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and then.</v>

1801
01:31:11.811 --> 01:31:16.811
<v Speaker 2>And it's not surprising because he keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>going through these unbelievable </v>

1802
01:31:16.811 --> 01:31:16.811
<v Speaker 2>adventures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1803
01:31:16.811 --> 01:31:20.130
<v Speaker 2>that are really psychologically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially shattering.</v>

1804
01:31:20.131 --> 01:31:24.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's a good thing that this reminder </v>
<v Speaker 2>pops up in a fairly frequently.</v>

1805
01:31:24.391 --> 01:31:26.250
<v Speaker 2>But of course Abraham is also open to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1806
01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.650
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean?</v>

1807
01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:33.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk personally for a moment.</v>

1808
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've asked myself a lot of questions </v>

1809
01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:38.420
<v Speaker 2>in the last eight months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1810
01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:42.710
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that and I'm still asking</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself a lot of questions and I've been </v>

1811
01:31:42.710 --> 01:31:45.090
<v Speaker 2>conferring with a lot of people because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I had lots of people who were helping me</v>

1812
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:49.530
<v Speaker 2>negotiate whatever the hell this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening and you know,</v>

1813
01:31:49.531 --> 01:31:54.531
<v Speaker 2>I could ask them how it was doing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would tell me a bunch of things I </v>

1814
01:31:54.531 --> 01:31:54.820
<v Speaker 2>was doing wrong and some things I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing right and I could listen to them.</v>

1815
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 2>And I was asking questions all the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how the hell I should manage this </v>

1816
01:31:59.830 --> 01:32:04.290
<v Speaker 2>properly and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was trying to do and what seemed </v>

1817
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:08.830
<v Speaker 2>to serve me properly was to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do it correctly.</v>

1818
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:14.070
<v Speaker 2>That was the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I didn't really care what </v>

1819
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.070
<v Speaker 2>happened and I guess I really don't care</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens,</v>

1820
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:17.230
<v Speaker 2>but I do care if I do it correctly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to screw it up.</v>

1821
01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to screw things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to be a reasonable goal </v>

1822
01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:22.840
<v Speaker 2>for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1823
01:32:22.841 --> 01:32:27.841
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you like that as a goal that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't screw things up because he </v>

1824
01:32:27.841 --> 01:32:30.790
<v Speaker 2>can't control to your life isn't fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>under your control by any stretch of the</v>

1825
01:32:30.791 --> 01:32:35.791
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it might be nice to not have your </v>

1826
01:32:35.791 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 2>conscience seating at you saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1827
01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:41.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a big opportunity there and you </v>

1828
01:32:41.041 --> 01:32:42.790
<v Speaker 2>mocked it up because you're weak and </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind and he didn't listen.</v>

1829
01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:46.480
<v Speaker 2>That's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cast the catastrophes bad enough,</v>

1830
01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:51.481
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without you being the bloody source of </v>

1831
01:32:51.481 --> 01:32:51.481
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>

1832
01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Well that's Abraham falling on his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1833
01:32:56.911 --> 01:32:59.580
<v Speaker 2>And also communing with God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you do.</v>

1834
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:02.880
<v Speaker 2>He wants to get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to get it right,</v>

1835
01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:06.320
<v Speaker 2>and there's these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things that beckon in promise,</v>

1836
01:33:06.321 --> 01:33:06.490
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1837
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:13.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bloody easy to make a catastrophic </v>

1838
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.550
<v Speaker 2>mistake and he'll do that in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1839
01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:21.860
<v Speaker 2>and maybe humility is one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can prevent that because you can </v>

1840
01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:21.860
<v Speaker 2>look and you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1841
01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:22.980
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What am I doing wrong?</v>

1842
01:33:22.981 --> 01:33:25.710
<v Speaker 2>What can I do better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could I do this properly?</v>

1843
01:33:26.130 --> 01:33:27.960
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

1844
01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:31.140
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the intimation of the proper way</v>

1845
01:33:31.141 --> 01:33:36.141
<v Speaker 2>to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's what protects you when </v>

1846
01:33:36.141 --> 01:33:37.680
<v Speaker 2>things are chaotic and in strife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And who knows what that's worth,</v>

1847
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:42.260
<v Speaker 2>neither shall thy name anymore be called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham,</v>

1848
01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.720
<v Speaker 2>which means high king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I remember correctly,</v>

1849
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:48.080
<v Speaker 2>a Thai name shall be Abraham for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>father of many nations.</v>

1850
01:33:48.081 --> 01:33:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Have I made the oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abrams,</v>

1851
01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.830
<v Speaker 2>hi father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

1852
01:33:52.370 --> 01:33:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Abraham means father of a multitude and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I will make the exceedingly fruitful and</v>

1853
01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I will make nations of the productive </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1854
01:33:58.941 --> 01:34:03.941
<v Speaker 2>Productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to be something that's </v>

1855
01:34:03.941 --> 01:34:06.550
<v Speaker 2>good to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like one of the things that I've </v>

1856
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.550
<v Speaker 2>thought about deeply,</v>

1857
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I thought deeply about death and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>death of my family members and about </v>

1858
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:15.311
<v Speaker 2>funerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought about it partly because I </v>

1859
01:34:15.311 --> 01:34:17.171
<v Speaker 2>had this weird experience once that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think I told you about where I took one </v>

1860
01:34:17.171 --> 01:34:20.021
<v Speaker 2>of my clients to see an embalming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was very strange experience and I </v>

1861
01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:22.940
<v Speaker 2>had a chance to talk to the funeral </v>
<v Speaker 2>directors because they have weird jobs,</v>

1862
01:34:22.941 --> 01:34:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's this idea,</v>

1863
01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:30.760
<v Speaker 2>well the Freudian idea that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer from this terrible death anxiety </v>

1864
01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:34.361
<v Speaker 2>and there's a whole line of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological theory theorizing called </v>

1865
01:34:34.361 --> 01:34:38.261
<v Speaker 2>terror management theory that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on the idea that we defend </v>

1866
01:34:38.261 --> 01:34:39.470
<v Speaker 2>ourselves against death anxiety with our</v>
<v Speaker 2>belief systems.</v>

1867
01:34:39.471 --> 01:34:41.990
<v Speaker 2>And like puppets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ernest Becker's idea,</v>

1868
01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:44.060
<v Speaker 2>he wrote the denial of death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a great book,</v>

1869
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:47.360
<v Speaker 2>but there's a weakness in it because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see some people who aren't like that,</v>

1870
01:34:47.361 --> 01:34:52.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like emergency room nurses aren't like </v>

1871
01:34:52.361 --> 01:34:52.361
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1872
01:34:52.361 --> 01:34:52.361
<v Speaker 2>And palliative care nurses aren't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that might.</v>

1873
01:34:52.361 --> 01:34:54.020
<v Speaker 2>My sister in law is a palliative care </v>
<v Speaker 2>nurse.</v>

1874
01:34:54.170 --> 01:34:56.390
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1875
01:34:56.391 --> 01:35:01.391
<v Speaker 2>because you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're caring for people you have and </v>

1876
01:35:01.391 --> 01:35:01.391
<v Speaker 2>they're in pain and they're on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>last legs.</v>

1877
01:35:01.391 --> 01:35:05.861
<v Speaker 2>You try to make them comfortable and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a relationship with them because </v>

1878
01:35:05.861 --> 01:35:05.861
<v Speaker 2>how the hell are you going to make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable?</v>

1879
01:35:05.861 --> 01:35:10.271
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they go and die on you and that </v>

1880
01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:10.271
<v Speaker 2>just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens every day.</v>

1881
01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's weird is that people can be </v>

1882
01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:14.560
<v Speaker 2>palliative care nurses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1883
01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.251
<v Speaker 2>how do you figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because people can actually thrive in </v>

1884
01:35:18.251 --> 01:35:20.930
<v Speaker 2>the face of death strangely enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like these funeral parlor directors,</v>

1885
01:35:20.931 --> 01:35:23.090
<v Speaker 2>they were interesting to talk to because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all they do,</v>

1886
01:35:23.091 --> 01:35:24.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just deal with.</v>

1887
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:29.600
<v Speaker 2>They deal with death and grief all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and it was very interesting talking</v>

1888
01:35:29.601 --> 01:35:31.370
<v Speaker 2>to them because I talked to two of them.</v>

1889
01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.550
<v Speaker 2>They found their job extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and I asked them,</v>

1890
01:35:34.551 --> 01:35:34.860
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1891
01:35:34.861 --> 01:35:37.160
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that do to your life?</v>

1892
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:42.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saturated with death and </v>

1893
01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:44.321
<v Speaker 2>suffering and there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the same answer that I got </v>

1894
01:35:44.321 --> 01:35:47.690
<v Speaker 2>from the palliative care nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't undermine your life.</v>

1895
01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 2>It enriches it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would guess that?</v>

1896
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1897
01:35:51.291 --> 01:35:53.450
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just doesn't make any sense at all,</v>

1898
01:35:53.451 --> 01:35:58.451
<v Speaker 2>but what it does is speak to human </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility because God only knows how </v>

1899
01:35:58.451 --> 01:35:59.540
<v Speaker 2>tough you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1900
01:35:59.541 --> 01:36:02.060
<v Speaker 2>If you read history and you read about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people have done,</v>

1901
01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:02.930
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1902
01:36:02.931 --> 01:36:05.030
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are.</v>

1903
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I read a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a shipwreck in the Antarctica </v>

1904
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:16.820
<v Speaker 2>100 years ago or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I read the story.</v>

1905
01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.850
<v Speaker 2>It was not a biography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I remember correctly of the,</v>

1906
01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:20.900
<v Speaker 2>of the captain.</v>

1907
01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've got the basic story,</v>

1908
01:36:23.061 --> 01:36:24.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1909
01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:29.500
<v Speaker 2>they had a ship wreck and the Antarctica</v>
<v Speaker 2>was then they were there for a whole </v>

1910
01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:30.290
<v Speaker 2>year in the Antarctic arc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1911
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:32.190
<v Speaker 2>and none of them died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not One.</v>

1912
01:36:32.191 --> 01:36:34.310
<v Speaker 2>He didn't lose a single man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not one.</v>

1913
01:36:34.311 --> 01:36:39.311
<v Speaker 2>He kept the morale high and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>took this boat that was on the ship and </v>

1914
01:36:39.311 --> 01:36:40.910
<v Speaker 2>they crossed like 400 miles of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughest ocean,</v>

1915
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.430
<v Speaker 2>the roughest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frigid ocean in the world.</v>

1916
01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't go in that ocean and then they</v>

1917
01:36:45.951 --> 01:36:50.951
<v Speaker 2>went to an island and they walked across</v>
<v Speaker 2>the island across these mountains that </v>

1918
01:36:50.951 --> 01:36:55.331
<v Speaker 2>no one else has ever climbed since,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they went to the city on the other </v>

1919
01:36:55.641 --> 01:37:00.641
<v Speaker 2>side of the island and they got a boat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they went and rescued their </v>

1920
01:37:00.641 --> 01:37:03.250
<v Speaker 2>compatriots and everyone survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like endurance is the name of the </v>

1921
01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:03.250
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1922
01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.190
<v Speaker 2>You read that book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1923
01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.690
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1924
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:07.810
<v Speaker 2>people are really tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1925
01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.100
<v Speaker 2>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's ridiculous.</v>

1926
01:37:10.101 --> 01:37:15.101
<v Speaker 2>So who knows how tough you are and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find out by going out to find out </v>

1927
01:37:15.101 --> 01:37:16.010
<v Speaker 2>how tough you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1928
01:37:16.011 --> 01:37:19.640
<v Speaker 2>So you take on a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that you think you can master,</v>

1929
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:24.910
<v Speaker 2>just that's just a bit beyond your grasp</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you master it and then you're a </v>

1930
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:24.910
<v Speaker 2>little tougher and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1931
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:28.250
<v Speaker 2>that worked out pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then you're more of a monster and</v>

1932
01:37:28.251 --> 01:37:33.251
<v Speaker 2>then you go out and find another </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge that's even bigger and you </v>

1933
01:37:33.251 --> 01:37:33.251
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I can do that too.</v>

1934
01:37:33.251 --> 01:37:37.600
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden you can and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a little bit bigger and God only </v>

1935
01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.751
<v Speaker 2>knows what the limit is of you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out by pushing yourself against the</v>

1936
01:37:41.181 --> 01:37:46.181
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course that's what Abraham is </v>

1937
01:37:46.181 --> 01:37:46.181
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1938
01:37:46.181 --> 01:37:47.780
<v Speaker 2>And so see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're very pessimistic.</v>

1939
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:51.740
<v Speaker 2>US modern people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were pessimistic about humanity,</v>

1940
01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dismal,</v>

1941
01:37:52.971 --> 01:37:56.850
<v Speaker 2>wretched planet destroying cancer on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet,</v>

1942
01:37:56.851 --> 01:38:01.620
<v Speaker 2>right as the club of Rome described us </v>
<v Speaker 2>so pleasantly back in the 19 sixties,</v>

1943
01:38:01.621 --> 01:38:03.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>

1944
01:38:03.361 --> 01:38:08.361
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're ashamed of the Cold War and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're ashamed of all the </v>

1945
01:38:08.361 --> 01:38:10.690
<v Speaker 2>destruction in the 20th century and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen bomb and you know,</v>

1946
01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:16.150
<v Speaker 2>the continuing catastrophes of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies were deeply ashamed of that </v>

1947
01:38:16.150 --> 01:38:20.211
<v Speaker 2>and ashamed of ourselves personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a hell of a thing to call us a </v>

1948
01:38:20.211 --> 01:38:24.111
<v Speaker 2>cancer on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just no excuse for that because </v>

1949
01:38:24.111 --> 01:38:27.261
<v Speaker 2>what you do with cancer is eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that that's a very </v>

1950
01:38:27.261 --> 01:38:31.521
<v Speaker 2>knowable motive personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it says a lot about the </v>

1951
01:38:31.681 --> 01:38:36.681
<v Speaker 2>people who would use such phraseology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they would dare to conceptualize </v>

1952
01:38:36.681 --> 01:38:36.681
<v Speaker 2>humanity in that manner.</v>

1953
01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:42.380
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be nice if we could be optimistic </v>

1954
01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:43.770
<v Speaker 2>and I think began the problem with being</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimistic is that it's naive.</v>

1955
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.530
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there an optimism that's not naive?</v>

1956
01:38:46.531 --> 01:38:51.531
<v Speaker 2>And I think there is an optimism that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not naive as in just a visualization of </v>

1957
01:38:53.431 --> 01:38:58.380
<v Speaker 2>how strong people can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I tell people,</v>

1958
01:38:58.381 --> 01:39:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I've told my students in my class in </v>
<v Speaker 2>maps of meaning,</v>

1959
01:39:01.890 --> 01:39:05.910
<v Speaker 2>here's a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be the person at the funeral</v>

1960
01:39:05.911 --> 01:39:08.490
<v Speaker 2>of your father that everyone can rely </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1961
01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:14.480
<v Speaker 2>How would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be the person who's broken </v>

1962
01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:14.480
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1963
01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:16.530
<v Speaker 2>and useless and adding to the misery in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the corner.</v>

1964
01:39:16.531 --> 01:39:19.980
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making light of people's grief.</v>

1965
01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:22.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand grief,</v>

1966
01:39:22.630 --> 01:39:25.290
<v Speaker 2>but who do you want to be when there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>

1967
01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:31.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to be the person that </v>

1968
01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:31.300
<v Speaker 2>everyone can turn to for strength?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1969
01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:31.320
<v Speaker 2>why the hell not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

1970
01:39:31.321 --> 01:39:36.321
<v Speaker 2>That is a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a good goal because then </v>

1971
01:39:36.321 --> 01:39:37.620
<v Speaker 2>if there's a crisis and there will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't be such a bloody crisis because</v>

1972
01:39:37.621 --> 01:39:39.240
<v Speaker 2>there'll be someone there that can deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

1973
01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:46.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when I went and talked to these </v>

1974
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.850
<v Speaker 2>people at the funeral home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I envisioned that I thought,</v>

1975
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:50.631
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is something you have to </v>

1976
01:39:50.631 --> 01:39:50.631
<v Speaker 2>contend with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to be alive and adult,</v>

1977
01:39:50.631 --> 01:39:55.370
<v Speaker 2>you have to contend with death and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering and you have to be ready for </v>

1978
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:59.511
<v Speaker 2>it and you have to be there for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person because that's how they're going </v>

1979
01:39:59.511 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 2>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there a goal man.</v>

1980
01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.220
<v Speaker 2>And in this time of nihilism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what's,</v>

1981
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:10.310
<v Speaker 2>what's the point of life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People ask and they're taught that at </v>

1982
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:11.190
<v Speaker 2>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the point of life?</v>

1983
01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Everything's interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humanities.</v>

1984
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.840
<v Speaker 2>A cancer on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1985
01:40:16.050 --> 01:40:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about no?</v>

1986
01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:22.610
<v Speaker 2>How about not that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about the do something to us and I </v>

1987
01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:45.701
<v Speaker 2>will establish my covenant between me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Dan seed after thee in their </v>

1988
01:40:45.701 --> 01:40:46.880
<v Speaker 2>generations for an everlasting covenant </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a God unto Thee,</v>

1989
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:51.910
<v Speaker 2>unto thy seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the and I will give unto thee to </v>

1990
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 2>thy seed after the the land we're in now</v>
<v Speaker 2>art a all</v>

1991
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.280
<v Speaker 1>the land of Canaan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of course Abraham went out into </v>

1992
01:40:59.280 --> 01:40:59.280
<v Speaker 1>the land of strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1993
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:04.480
<v Speaker 1>But it says that he'll master if he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he keeps his covenant,</v>

1994
01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:09.780
<v Speaker 1>he'll master the land of strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a wonderful thing to know and I </v>

1995
01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:11.440
<v Speaker 1>think a true thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1996
01:41:11.441 --> 01:41:12.850
<v Speaker 1>because if you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangers,</v>

1997
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with lots of strange people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>

1998
01:41:15.630 --> 01:41:18.430
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that isn't to say that everyone that</v>

1999
01:41:18.431 --> 01:41:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with was strange because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case,</v>

2000
01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:26.600
<v Speaker 1>but I have encountered some very strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you know,</v>

2001
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.130
<v Speaker 1>the way to deal with strange people is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2002
01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.400
<v Speaker 1>You never lie to a strange person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

2003
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:39.030
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never lie to someone who's paranoid </v>

2004
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.190
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will come back to bite you.</v>

2005
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you're in an extreme situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone who's very unpredictable,</v>

2006
01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.940
<v Speaker 1>the only thing you have that works is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth that works.</v>

2007
01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a little story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in my book.</v>

2008
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:59.790
<v Speaker 1>So I had this landlord in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived next door to me and he was an </v>

2009
01:41:59.790 --> 01:42:03.121
<v Speaker 1>ex hell's angels biker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd spent a lot of time in prison and </v>

2010
01:42:03.121 --> 01:42:06.931
<v Speaker 1>his wife had borderline personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder and she committed suicide when </v>

2011
01:42:06.931 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was a rough guy and he was at Caa</v>

2012
01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Quebec law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spoke ul,</v>

2013
01:42:11.110 --> 01:42:13.620
<v Speaker 1>which I could hardly understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2014
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:17.020
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really know what to make of me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't really know what to make of</v>

2015
01:42:17.021 --> 01:42:18.060
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2016
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:20.860
<v Speaker 1>but we got along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2017
01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I was very careful talking to him as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>

2018
01:42:24.850 --> 01:42:25.920
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2019
01:42:25.921 --> 01:42:26.740
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very.</v>

2020
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:29.950
<v Speaker 1>And we went over to my wife and I went </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there and we had a spaghetti dinner</v>

2021
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:34.951
<v Speaker 1>one night and we sort of communicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I bought a poster from him because </v>

2022
01:42:34.951 --> 01:42:35.800
<v Speaker 1>he made these wooden posters that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>neon on them.</v>

2023
01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:40.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's how he made a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd Kinda trained himself to be a bit </v>

2024
01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.531
<v Speaker 1>of an electronics guy and so we made </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things and he was trying to quit </v>

2025
01:42:43.531 --> 01:42:44.020
<v Speaker 1>drinking and we talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a lot older than me.</v>

2026
01:42:44.021 --> 01:42:47.790
<v Speaker 1>He was like 20 years older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about 25 at this point and uh,</v>

2027
01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:54.330
<v Speaker 1>we got along pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then he'd go out and </v>

2028
01:42:54.330 --> 01:42:56.160
<v Speaker 1>get a drink and he could really drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2029
01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:59.230
<v Speaker 1>like he was one of these guys who could </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink like 60 beer and you think,</v>

2030
01:42:59.231 --> 01:43:01.330
<v Speaker 1>well no one can drink that much and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

2031
01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I studied alcohol for like 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my subjects,</v>

2032
01:43:05.531 --> 01:43:10.531
<v Speaker 1>father's drank 40 ounces of vodka a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and had been doing it for 20 years so </v>

2033
01:43:10.531 --> 01:43:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you can drink a lot and he could drink a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

2034
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:13.180
<v Speaker 1>And what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to,</v>

2035
01:43:13.181 --> 01:43:18.181
<v Speaker 1>not drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'd go out and go on a binge and </v>

2036
01:43:18.181 --> 01:43:20.041
<v Speaker 1>then he'd be gone for like three days </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he drink up all his money and then </v>

2037
01:43:20.710 --> 01:43:25.710
<v Speaker 1>we'd hear him out in the backyard </v>
<v Speaker 1>howling at the moon with this little </v>

2038
01:43:25.710 --> 01:43:25.750
<v Speaker 1>little ugly dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>

2039
01:43:25.751 --> 01:43:29.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'd held and the dog would hell and</v>

2040
01:43:29.051 --> 01:43:30.680
<v Speaker 1>he'd haul them and the dog would haul </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2041
01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:36.020
<v Speaker 1>and it was a rather unsettling and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife nervous and uh,</v>

2042
01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know now,</v>

2043
01:43:39.701 --> 01:43:42.920
<v Speaker 1>and then he'd come to the door at like </v>
<v Speaker 1>three in the morning,</v>

2044
01:43:42.921 --> 01:43:47.921
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he'd knock on the door and he'd be </v>

2045
01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:50.131
<v Speaker 1>standing there and I don't know how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience you've had with rough guys </v>

2046
01:43:50.771 --> 01:43:53.360
<v Speaker 1>who are and who were drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2047
01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:59.320
<v Speaker 1>they can be upright and unconscious at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

2048
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the state that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2049
01:44:01.731 --> 01:44:06.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be just swaying and he asked me if </v>

2050
01:44:06.731 --> 01:44:09.731
<v Speaker 1>I would like to buy his toaster or his </v>
<v Speaker 1>microwave because he needed some money </v>

2051
01:44:09.731 --> 01:44:14.141
<v Speaker 1>to keep drinking and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really want to buy his toaster </v>

2052
01:44:14.141 --> 01:44:14.141
<v Speaker 1>or as microwave.</v>

2053
01:44:14.141 --> 01:44:18.190
<v Speaker 1>But when the x hell's angel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you all speaking 60 beard,</v>

2054
01:44:18.611 --> 01:44:23.611
<v Speaker 1>drunk Quebecois biker shows up at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>door at three in the morning and the </v>

2055
01:44:23.611 --> 01:44:25.760
<v Speaker 1>offers you to sell offers to sell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>his microwave.</v>

2056
01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.960
<v Speaker 1>The easiest thing is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really need a microwave.</v>

2057
01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:36.360
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2058
01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:41.150
<v Speaker 1>I bought the microwave and toaster and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other things,</v>

2059
01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:47.020
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then my wife talked to me and she </v>

2060
01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:48.990
<v Speaker 1>liked my landlord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2061
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:53.000
<v Speaker 1>even though she was afraid of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she liked him and she said,</v>

2062
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:58.030
<v Speaker 1>you can't buy any more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any more appliances because it's not </v>

2063
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:59.240
<v Speaker 1>good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

2064
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting problem,</v>

2065
01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:08.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what the hell am I going to do about </v>

2066
01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:10.181
<v Speaker 1>this because no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to buy your microwave just </v>

2067
01:45:10.181 --> 01:45:11.060
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be the right answer at </v>
<v Speaker 1>three in the morning.</v>

2068
01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:16.480
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one time he took me out on his </v>

2069
01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.220
<v Speaker 1>sevenfifty Honda and he put me on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of it.</v>

2070
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:24.250
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to show me his layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess his hangouts and I got his </v>

2071
01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:27.581
<v Speaker 1>wife's helmet on but it didn't fit it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sit on the top of my head and he </v>

2072
01:45:27.581 --> 01:45:30.530
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the bike and he said if the cops</v>

2073
01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:32.540
<v Speaker 1>chase us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not stopping.</v>

2074
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:36.890
<v Speaker 1>And then away we went and we went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2075
01:45:36.891 --> 01:45:41.891
<v Speaker 1>like these bars downtown on the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were very rough places and he got </v>

2076
01:45:41.891 --> 01:45:44.510
<v Speaker 1>into like four fights that night because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a rough guy,</v>

2077
01:45:44.511 --> 01:45:49.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these kind of punk guys would come </v>

2078
01:45:49.511 --> 01:45:52.121
<v Speaker 1>up to him and sort of challenge them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>act stupidly around him and he was very </v>

2079
01:45:52.121 --> 01:45:55.571
<v Speaker 1>skeptical and if you were acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidly around him for any length of </v>

2080
01:45:55.571 --> 01:45:58.781
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just hit you because he felt that </v>

2081
01:45:58.781 --> 01:45:58.781
<v Speaker 1>that's what you deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps he was right,</v>

2082
01:45:58.781 --> 01:45:59.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

2083
01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:02.450
<v Speaker 1>So I had a firsthand opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>observe him.</v>

2084
01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:05.360
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sure enough,</v>

2085
01:46:05.361 --> 01:46:08.420
<v Speaker 1>about a week or two after we had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

2086
01:46:08.421 --> 01:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>he showed up at the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>

2087
01:46:10.041 --> 01:46:10.700
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>

2088
01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:13.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open the door and they're standing there</v>

2089
01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:17.390
<v Speaker 1>with his eyes half closed and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>swaying and he had.</v>

2090
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the appliance was </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>

2091
01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.030
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to sell it to me and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2092
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not all I can buy this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to buy this because I know</v>

2093
01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.660
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to quit drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I give you this money then you're</v>

2094
01:46:32.661 --> 01:46:36.050
<v Speaker 1>going to go and drink it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not going to be good for you.</v>

2095
01:46:36.051 --> 01:46:41.051
<v Speaker 1>And what else did I tell them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told him as well that this </v>

2096
01:46:42.591 --> 01:46:47.591
<v Speaker 1>whole thing of him coming to my house at</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two in the morning was scaring my </v>

2097
01:46:47.591 --> 01:46:49.620
<v Speaker 1>wife who we liked and that it had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop and believe me,</v>

2098
01:46:49.621 --> 01:46:54.621
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about what I was saying </v>

2099
01:46:54.621 --> 01:46:57.620
<v Speaker 1>because he was watching me like a rough </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy watches you and a rough guy watches </v>

2100
01:46:57.781 --> 01:47:02.781
<v Speaker 1>you like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks if you say one thing that </v>

2101
01:47:02.781 --> 01:47:06.270
<v Speaker 1>indicates contempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to bloody well paid for it.</v>

2102
01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And so I was finding my words like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2103
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I was crossing a swamp and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look for the,</v>

2104
01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:16.650
<v Speaker 1>for the rocks underneath the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said what I had to say very,</v>

2105
01:47:16.651 --> 01:47:20.160
<v Speaker 1>very carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me for about 15 seconds</v>

2106
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:24.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's a long time to be locked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>at three in the morning.</v>

2107
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:30.840
<v Speaker 1>And he laughed and he never came back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell me anything again.</v>

2108
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:36.470
<v Speaker 1>And we got along fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a good seal illustration of </v>

2109
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:40.221
<v Speaker 1>this issue with regards to truth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>success in the strange land.</v>

2110
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Because I was in the strange land when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking to my neighbor,</v>

2111
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:53.750
<v Speaker 1>my landlord Dan and I managed to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>what was true carefully enough so </v>

2112
01:47:55.231 --> 01:48:00.231
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that he was a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>violent person and then he was very </v>

2113
01:48:00.231 --> 01:48:05.091
<v Speaker 1>intoxicated person and then he had every</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to be suspicious of me and we </v>

2114
01:48:05.091 --> 01:48:08.280
<v Speaker 1>couldn't communicate very well and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do what he wanted,</v>

2115
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:13.910
<v Speaker 1>that he took it and he left and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no problem and life went on just </v>

2116
01:48:16.171 --> 01:48:21.171
<v Speaker 1>fine after that and so we don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimate the utility of </v>

2117
01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:28.820
<v Speaker 1>establishing this bounded relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the ideal and attempting to live </v>

2118
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:33.870
<v Speaker 1>with some nobility in truth will aiming </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the highest ideal.</v>

2119
01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:39.050
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's anything but strengthening and </v>

2120
01:48:40.201 --> 01:48:45.201
<v Speaker 1>positive and it's exactly what you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to set against the catastrophe and </v>

2121
01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:50.670
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty of life and as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

2122
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:56.990
<v Speaker 1>that's what these abrahamic stories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to communicate.</v>

2123
01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:01.660
<v Speaker 1>So we'll stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2124
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:17.590
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>

2125
01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I have to make an announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do a talk August 22nd I </v>

2126
01:49:32.781 --> 01:49:34.790
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not sure of the date,</v>

2127
01:49:34.791 --> 01:49:38.390
<v Speaker 1>but I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out with Gad,</v>

2128
01:49:38.391 --> 01:49:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Saad from Concordia and so</v>

2129
01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:49.570
<v Speaker 1>with an x social worker named Serena </v>
<v Speaker 1>sing and with faith Goldie,</v>

2130
01:49:49.571 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I think faith is going to be there as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2131
01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:55.840
<v Speaker 1>So the tickets for that will go on sale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hosting this,</v>

2132
01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:59.860
<v Speaker 1>someone else's dealing with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the tickets for that will go on sale</v>

2133
01:49:59.861 --> 01:50:03.010
<v Speaker 1>within approximately a week and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>post that on my.</v>

2134
01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably make an announcement on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube but I'll twitter,</v>

2135
01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:08.110
<v Speaker 1>tweeter it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter it and all of that.</v>

2136
01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.910
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I mentioned to you guys last</v>

2137
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:15.460
<v Speaker 1>week that I would like to continue this </v>
<v Speaker 1>series,</v>

2138
01:50:15.461 --> 01:50:19.210
<v Speaker 1>but I think I'll do it once a month and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to do it in this theater,</v>

2139
01:50:19.211 --> 01:50:22.390
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't got word from the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who run the theater.</v>

2140
01:50:22.391 --> 01:50:25.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it'll be accessible,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then let's say for questions.</v>

2156
01:51:03.761 --> 01:51:08.761
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to let you ask the first </v>

2157
01:51:08.761 --> 01:51:08.761
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last time was not okay.</v>

2158
01:51:08.761 --> 01:51:10.480
<v Speaker 1>So I will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's make sure again,</v>

2159
01:51:10.481 --> 01:51:15.481
<v Speaker 1>everybody to speak into the Mike clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the youtube people can hear and </v>

2160
01:51:15.810 --> 01:51:17.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ghostly youtube people.</v>

2161
01:51:19.330 --> 01:51:20.590
<v Speaker 1>And so go ahead.</v>

2162
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:24.500
<v Speaker 6>I was quite impressed with your </v>
<v Speaker 6>presentation last week and uh,</v>

2163
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:27.130
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't quite sure where it was going </v>
<v Speaker 6>at one point in,</v>

2164
01:51:27.131 --> 01:51:28.420
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Neither was on.</v>

2165
01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:31.510
<v Speaker 6>And that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because at what point I,</v>

2166
01:51:31.511 --> 01:51:36.511
<v Speaker 6>I listened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought what you basically were </v>

2167
01:51:36.511 --> 01:51:36.511
<v Speaker 6>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what I saw,</v>

2168
01:51:36.511 --> 01:51:40.660
<v Speaker 6>you were embodying mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>body and spirit and bringing it all </v>

2169
01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:41.410
<v Speaker 6>together as one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you touched on it a bit tonight when</v>

2170
01:51:41.411 --> 01:51:42.700
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you talk about truth,</v>

2171
01:51:42.701 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 6>this is where we need to go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2172
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:46.330
<v Speaker 6>And I know you say be positive and all </v>
<v Speaker 6>that and yeah,</v>

2173
01:51:46.331 --> 01:51:47.650
<v Speaker 6>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree.</v>

2174
01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:51.100
<v Speaker 6>It's scary what's going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>However we have the power to stay in the</v>

2175
01:51:51.101 --> 01:51:53.800
<v Speaker 6>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you talked about last week,</v>

2176
01:51:53.801 --> 01:51:58.801
<v Speaker 6>you talked about using our intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I consider our higher self using </v>

2177
01:51:58.801 --> 01:52:00.070
<v Speaker 6>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you made reference,</v>

2178
01:52:00.071 --> 01:52:02.890
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember exactly what you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you said,</v>

2179
01:52:02.891 --> 01:52:07.891
<v Speaker 6>but you held your hand and you talked </v>
<v Speaker 6>about emotions and bringing intellect on</v>

2180
01:52:08.411 --> 01:52:11.080
<v Speaker 6>top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you said emotions,</v>

2181
01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.290
<v Speaker 6>everything just lit up for me because </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking that's our heart Chakra.</v>

2182
01:52:14.291 --> 01:52:17.290
<v Speaker 6>That's what combines our lower self or </v>
<v Speaker 6>physical being,</v>

2183
01:52:17.291 --> 01:52:18.470
<v Speaker 6>the material stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the,</v>

2184
01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.420
<v Speaker 6>all the stuff that doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 6>motivate us with their higher self.</v>

2185
01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.400
<v Speaker 6>And when I'm going to use talked about </v>
<v Speaker 6>emotion,</v>

2186
01:52:24.401 --> 01:52:25.990
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to talk about the emotion of </v>
<v Speaker 6>love.</v>

2187
01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:29.500
<v Speaker 6>And I find so many people are terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a four letter word.</v>

2188
01:52:29.501 --> 01:52:31.450
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't have to be bad.</v>

2189
01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember why when I talked to you </v>

2190
01:52:36.570 --> 01:52:36.570
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I wanted you to ask this question.</v>

2191
01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:37.500
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2192
01:52:37.501 --> 01:52:42.501
<v Speaker 1>So I've talked a lot in this lecture </v>
<v Speaker 1>series about truth and no,</v>

2193
01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a battle in the biblical</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories all the way through between love</v>

2194
01:52:47.661 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 1>and truth in terms of their primacy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2195
01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:53.480
<v Speaker 1>and I've gone to contrasted lot on truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my own thinking,</v>

2196
01:52:53.481 --> 01:52:56.420
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to talk about love because</v>

2197
01:52:56.421 --> 01:52:58.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a word that people have mouth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

2198
01:52:58.370 --> 01:53:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you start talking about love </v>

2199
01:53:03.370 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 1>than people should just go into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different room and listened to you,</v>

2200
01:53:03.561 --> 01:53:04.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>

2201
01:53:04.301 --> 01:53:09.301
<v Speaker 1>it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can get sappy and new age just like </v>

2202
01:53:09.301 --> 01:53:09.920
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't like that at all,</v>

2203
01:53:09.921 --> 01:53:14.921
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still something that has to be </v>

2204
01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:14.921
<v Speaker 1>contended with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think.</v>

2205
01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:17.360
<v Speaker 1>So I've been trying to conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

2206
01:53:17.361 --> 01:53:20.210
<v Speaker 1>what this covenant might might </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitute.</v>

2207
01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:23.360
<v Speaker 1>And I think the love part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's this.</v>

2208
01:53:23.361 --> 01:53:26.960
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this book by Girtha called Faust</v>

2209
01:53:26.961 --> 01:53:30.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's in two volumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First one in to logically enough.</v>

2210
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:33.290
<v Speaker 1>One was written much later than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other hand.</v>

2211
01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Faust basically sells his soul to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>devil for,</v>

2212
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:42.550
<v Speaker 1>for knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the devil in faust is </v>

2213
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:44.891
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mephistopheles is quite a well </v>

2214
01:53:44.891 --> 01:53:46.880
<v Speaker 1>developed character and Gert that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>mephistopheles save what he's about,</v>

2215
01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:51.770
<v Speaker 1>which is really quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the adversary of the world,</v>

2216
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:55.340
<v Speaker 1>evil itself gets a chance to speak and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make its case.</v>

2217
01:53:55.610 --> 01:54:00.610
<v Speaker 1>And [inaudible] thought this was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>important that he actually had </v>

2218
01:54:00.610 --> 01:54:02.921
<v Speaker 1>mephistopheles announced himself once in</v>
<v Speaker 1>faust one and then using the same words </v>

2219
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:06.740
<v Speaker 1>you phrase differently again in part </v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

2220
01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:08.930
<v Speaker 1>It really struck me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really struck me.</v>

2221
01:54:08.931 --> 01:54:13.931
<v Speaker 1>And so what Mephistopheles says is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is such a charter house of </v>

2222
01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:20.570
<v Speaker 1>suffering and destruction that it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be better if it never existed.</v>

2223
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And so that what he's working to is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring existence to an end because it is </v>

2224
01:54:27.201 --> 01:54:30.920
<v Speaker 1>not justified by it's suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's.</v>

2225
01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It's an argument very similar to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that's made by Ivan.</v>

2226
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camera.</v>

2227
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank Russians.</v>

2228
01:54:41.231 --> 01:54:46.231
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't pronounce them or live with </v>

2229
01:54:46.231 --> 01:54:46.231
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

2230
01:54:46.231 --> 01:54:48.800
<v Speaker 1>but he basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an atheist and does a very good job</v>

2231
01:54:48.801 --> 01:54:53.801
<v Speaker 1>of detailing out the atheist argument or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe an anti theist argument and he's </v>

2232
01:54:53.801 --> 01:54:55.800
<v Speaker 1>arguing with his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brother Alioscha,</v>

2233
01:54:55.900 --> 01:55:00.900
<v Speaker 1>who's a monitor monastic novitiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a very good guy but not an </v>

2234
01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:04.361
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan's an intellect and a very powerful </v>

2235
01:55:04.361 --> 01:55:06.000
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he basically tells Lee Osha that the</v>

2236
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:09.050
<v Speaker 1>all of the cosmos isn't worth the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering of one child.</v>

2237
01:55:09.051 --> 01:55:14.051
<v Speaker 1>He tells this story about this and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky took this from a newspaper </v>

2238
01:55:14.051 --> 01:55:17.651
<v Speaker 1>about this parents that lost their four </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old daughter and an outhouse </v>

2239
01:55:17.651 --> 01:55:22.061
<v Speaker 1>overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she screamed about it until she </v>

2240
01:55:22.061 --> 01:55:22.061
<v Speaker 1>froze to death.</v>

2241
01:55:22.061 --> 01:55:25.930
<v Speaker 1>And so Dostoevsky used that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tied that into Ivan's anti theist </v>

2242
01:55:25.930 --> 01:55:27.650
<v Speaker 1>argument against Lee Osha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

2243
01:55:27.651 --> 01:55:32.651
<v Speaker 1>very powerful argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brothers Karamazov is an absolutely </v>

2244
01:55:32.651 --> 01:55:33.560
<v Speaker 1>mind boggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing book.</v>

2245
01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2246
01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the Mephistopheles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective Mr Feeley and prospection.</v>

2247
01:55:40.401 --> 01:55:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's perspective is that being itself is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so corrupted,</v>

2248
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:46.020
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

2249
01:55:46.021 --> 01:55:47.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's fair enough.</v>

2250
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a decent argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's understandable,</v>

2251
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:54.570
<v Speaker 1>but the problem comes when you try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>implement that and what happens when you</v>

2252
01:55:54.571 --> 01:55:56.130
<v Speaker 1>implement it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

2253
01:55:56.131 --> 01:56:01.131
<v Speaker 1>you adopt out messed emphasis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ophelia and attitude of bitterness and </v>

2254
01:56:01.131 --> 01:56:04.251
<v Speaker 1>resentment and destruction is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make all the suffering that you're </v>

2255
01:56:04.251 --> 01:56:07.221
<v Speaker 1>complaining about far worse and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened at the base of </v>

2256
01:56:07.221 --> 01:56:11.751
<v Speaker 1>things in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there was a powerful movement </v>

2257
01:56:11.751 --> 01:56:14.250
<v Speaker 1>among human humanity to bring being </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself to a halt.</v>

2258
01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:18.370
<v Speaker 1>You know what culminated in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of the hydrogen bomb and the</v>

2259
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:23.390
<v Speaker 1>high probability for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many periods of time that we were going </v>

2260
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:26.850
<v Speaker 1>to do something permanent and fatal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems like a bad idea.</v>

2261
01:56:26.851 --> 01:56:28.190
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2262
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:33.200
<v Speaker 1>so what's the opposite of the myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ophelia and attitude and I think the </v>

2263
01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:36.621
<v Speaker 1>opposite of that is what's presented in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biblical stories in the guise of </v>

2264
01:56:36.621 --> 01:56:41.001
<v Speaker 1>love and that is the wish that things </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be good.</v>

2265
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:44.490
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what love is,</v>

2266
01:56:44.491 --> 01:56:49.491
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's the attempt to orient </v>

2267
01:56:49.491 --> 01:56:51.741
<v Speaker 1>yourself towards making things better </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's predicated on something like a </v>

2268
01:56:51.741 --> 01:56:56.400
<v Speaker 1>deep appreciation for being deaf despite</v>
<v Speaker 1>its suffering and deficiencies and maybe</v>

2269
01:56:56.791 --> 01:57:01.791
<v Speaker 1>a decision that you're going to act to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring about things to move things </v>

2270
01:57:01.791 --> 01:57:06.591
<v Speaker 1>towards the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the thing that sets </v>

2271
01:57:06.591 --> 01:57:06.650
<v Speaker 1>the parameters of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

2272
01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:11.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the opposite of the Memphis to and </v>

2273
01:57:11.690 --> 01:57:12.390
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like to work towards the betterment</v>

2274
01:57:12.391 --> 01:57:17.391
<v Speaker 1>of being because you've decided that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to open your heart to </v>

2275
01:57:17.391 --> 01:57:17.391
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2276
01:57:17.391 --> 01:57:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's within that framework that </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth takes place,</v>

2277
01:57:20.250 --> 01:57:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I think is truth has to serve something </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked in.</v>

2278
01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:28.280
<v Speaker 1>True conserve truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be bounded inside </v>

2279
01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:31.101
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what it's bounded </v>

2280
01:57:31.101 --> 01:57:31.101
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2281
01:57:31.101 --> 01:57:32.380
<v Speaker 6>what I was going to refer to it that was</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2282
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:34.440
<v Speaker 6>David Hawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 6>royal power versus force,</v>

2283
01:57:34.650 --> 01:57:37.680
<v Speaker 6>and he put it on a quantifiable scale.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All different emotions.</v>

2284
01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:40.920
<v Speaker 6>He called a consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any put love at 528 hertz.</v>

2285
01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:46.400
<v Speaker 6>He put shame at 20.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure if I've got these 100 </v>

2286
01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:46.400
<v Speaker 6>percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm guilty,</v>

2287
01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.871
<v Speaker 6>I think at 30 fear at 50 and it shows </v>
<v Speaker 6>you how far the people who are really </v>

2288
01:57:50.871 --> 01:57:54.921
<v Speaker 6>knocked down have to get to love and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking if we could quantify love on a </v>

2289
01:57:54.921 --> 01:57:59.391
<v Speaker 6>term,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it means different things to everybody </v>

2290
01:57:59.391 --> 01:58:01.311
<v Speaker 6>and rightly so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but can we get to that frequency and if </v>

2291
01:58:01.311 --> 01:58:02.190
<v Speaker 6>you look at the Solfeggio notes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know the musical notes.</v>

2292
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of.</v>

2293
01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ask you to stop if you </v>

2294
01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:09.280
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I should.</v>

2295
01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I should go to another question if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

2296
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

2297
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:24.500
<v Speaker 1>so you've been an educator through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rise of the smartphone and my question </v>

2298
01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:27.240
<v Speaker 1>basically relates to procrastination and</v>
<v Speaker 1>task delay,</v>

2299
01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:32.720
<v Speaker 1>needless task delay specifically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>given the unprecedented level of </v>

2300
01:58:32.881 --> 01:58:35.040
<v Speaker 1>distraction that we have in today's </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2301
01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to get your perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a psychological standpoint on other</v>

2302
01:58:40.261 --> 01:58:45.261
<v Speaker 1>than cleaning your damn room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you suggest to a student </v>

2303
01:58:45.261 --> 01:58:48.751
<v Speaker 1>who's looking to overcome these lands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2304
01:58:49.181 --> 01:58:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I think with any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it addictive process,</v>

2305
01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:55.750
<v Speaker 1>mean emails powerfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addictive,</v>

2306
01:58:55.751 --> 01:58:56.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly it's a,</v>

2307
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:59.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a slot machine and I mean that </v>
<v Speaker 1>technically,</v>

2308
01:58:59.261 --> 01:59:04.261
<v Speaker 1>so when you pull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a variable ratio reinforcement </v>

2309
01:59:04.261 --> 01:59:04.570
<v Speaker 1>schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

2310
01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:09.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's very addictive because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull on the slot machine arm enough,</v>

2311
01:59:09.611 --> 01:59:14.611
<v Speaker 1>you will win and you never know which </v>
<v Speaker 1>pole will reward you and so not only is </v>

2312
01:59:17.081 --> 01:59:21.040
<v Speaker 1>that addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to extinguish that and so</v>

2313
01:59:22.570 --> 01:59:27.570
<v Speaker 1>emails like that because there's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>something beckoning and now and then </v>

2314
01:59:27.570 --> 01:59:30.601
<v Speaker 1>it's a jackpot and social media is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you know people are posting</v>

2315
01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:35.860
<v Speaker 1>interesting things and so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you overcome an addictive process</v>

2316
01:59:35.861 --> 01:59:39.070
<v Speaker 1>and partly you do it by replacing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with something better,</v>

2317
01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:40.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2318
01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:44.440
<v Speaker 1>So when people study drug and alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

2319
01:59:44.441 --> 01:59:48.280
<v Speaker 1>they often make an elementary mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to try to figure out why people</v>

2320
01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:49.960
<v Speaker 1>use drugs and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

2321
01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:55.140
<v Speaker 1>that's not a smart thing to wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know why people use cocaine.</v>

2322
01:59:56.590 --> 02:00:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Cocaine directly stimulates the systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that produce positive emotion,</v>

2323
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:04.150
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no mystery there.</v>

2324
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Speaker 1>The mystery with cocaine is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very simple.</v>

2325
02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Why don't people take cocaine all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time until they die?</v>

2326
02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the mystery really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can get isolated rats to do </v>

2327
02:00:14.970 --> 02:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>

2328
02:00:14.970 --> 02:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>and for some people alcohol has the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of effect except it's mediated by </v>

2329
02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:24.031
<v Speaker 1>opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often what people have to do to get </v>

2330
02:00:24.031 --> 02:00:27.241
<v Speaker 1>themselves out of an addictive process </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to find something better to do to </v>

2331
02:00:27.241 --> 02:00:30.991
<v Speaker 1>replace it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say the problem with the </v>

2332
02:00:30.991 --> 02:00:34.291
<v Speaker 1>gadgets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean there are amazing things is </v>

2333
02:00:34.291 --> 02:00:36.781
<v Speaker 1>that they interfere with the proximately</v>
<v Speaker 1>interfere with medium to longterm goals </v>

2334
02:00:38.890 --> 02:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

2335
02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the first thing you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do to bring them under control is </v>

2336
02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:46.090
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what it is that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>used is interfering with.</v>

2337
02:00:46.091 --> 02:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>It has to be something important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2338
02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I want to do something important.</v>

2339
02:00:50.630 --> 02:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2340
02:00:52.121 --> 02:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>it could be personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you want to have a relationship.</v>

2341
02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>You want to get married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have kids,</v>

2342
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a career that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

2343
02:00:58.931 --> 02:01:03.931
<v Speaker 1>You know you want to have a life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have an abrahamic adventure </v>

2344
02:01:03.931 --> 02:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>and be the father of nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

2345
02:01:04.241 --> 02:01:09.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be ratting away on your cell </v>

2346
02:01:09.241 --> 02:01:09.241
<v Speaker 1>phone and doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

2347
02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is to set your sights</v>
<v Speaker 1>high ed and make a plan and figure out </v>

2348
02:01:15.101 --> 02:01:20.101
<v Speaker 1>who you could be and see if obsessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilization of smartphone fits into that</v>

2349
02:01:21.671 --> 02:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>vision of nobility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it will,</v>

2350
02:01:23.981 --> 02:01:27.430
<v Speaker 1>partly because there are unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful communication devices.</v>

2351
02:01:27.431 --> 02:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so often it's,</v>

2352
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:34.480
<v Speaker 1>it's for lack of something better to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also interferes.</v>

2353
02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:36.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's about the best I can do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2354
02:01:45.930 --> 02:01:46.900
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2355
02:01:47.150 --> 02:01:52.150
<v Speaker 7>you've been,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've been talking with some of the </v>

2356
02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:55.091
<v Speaker 7>conservative candidates for leadership </v>
<v Speaker 7>this year on know you talked with most </v>

2357
02:01:55.091 --> 02:01:55.280
<v Speaker 7>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2358
02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:57.280
<v Speaker 7>Not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but a number of them.</v>

2359
02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:59.150
<v Speaker 7>You talked with Andrew though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2360
02:01:59.151 --> 02:01:59.780
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did.</v>

2361
02:01:59.781 --> 02:02:01.080
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I'm,</v>

2362
02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:04.700
<v Speaker 7>so something very interesting popped up </v>
<v Speaker 7>in my facebook feed.</v>

2363
02:02:04.701 --> 02:02:08.660
<v Speaker 7>So it was a ad for the Conservative </v>
<v Speaker 7>Party and um,</v>

2364
02:02:08.661 --> 02:02:13.661
<v Speaker 7>it was suggesting that we a cut cut </v>
<v Speaker 7>funding to public universities that </v>

2365
02:02:15.021 --> 02:02:18.260
<v Speaker 7>don't support free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that was probably my fault.</v>

2366
02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:20.900
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>See precisely because,</v>

2367
02:02:20.901 --> 02:02:25.040
<v Speaker 7>because this is something you say in </v>
<v Speaker 7>some of your wild or moments you suggest</v>

2368
02:02:25.041 --> 02:02:30.041
<v Speaker 7>that we should cut the university's </v>
<v Speaker 7>funding by 25 percent and let them </v>

2369
02:02:30.041 --> 02:02:32.720
<v Speaker 7>battle it out for the remains and he's </v>
<v Speaker 7>taken that to,</v>

2370
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:33.650
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his,</v>

2371
02:02:33.651 --> 02:02:37.520
<v Speaker 7>his platform.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But now what you're doing is a will your</v>

2372
02:02:37.610 --> 02:02:39.140
<v Speaker 7>will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One of the things you're doing is you've</v>

2373
02:02:39.141 --> 02:02:41.180
<v Speaker 7>created this website,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2374
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:45.020
<v Speaker 7>that identifies a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the postmodern lexicon and helps people.</v>

2375
02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:49.460
<v Speaker 7>I'm a distinguished between a postmodern</v>
<v Speaker 7>courses and not.</v>

2376
02:02:49.461 --> 02:02:52.430
<v Speaker 7>And so people don't take them or take </v>
<v Speaker 7>them if they want.</v>

2377
02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:55.650
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that's it.</v>

2378
02:02:55.970 --> 02:03:00.970
<v Speaker 7>It'd be interesting to know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like what sort of malevolent </v>

2379
02:03:00.970 --> 02:03:03.290
<v Speaker 7>postmodernist just study you </v>
<v Speaker 7>meticulously and try to use all your,</v>

2380
02:03:03.610 --> 02:03:06.110
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>knowledge of it anyway.</v>

2381
02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:06.830
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2382
02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:11.860
<v Speaker 7>but what you've said though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you said that what we need to do is </v>

2383
02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:11.860
<v Speaker 7>starve it out from the source.</v>

2384
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That look.</v>

2385
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>So when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2386
02:03:15.191 --> 02:03:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know where you're going.</v>

2387
02:03:16.281 --> 02:03:18.980
<v Speaker 1>So about two weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks ago,</v>

2388
02:03:18.981 --> 02:03:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I went up to northern Saskatchewan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents have a cottage up there.</v>

2389
02:03:22.071 --> 02:03:23.750
<v Speaker 1>It's way the hell out in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>

2390
02:03:24.170 --> 02:03:26.030
<v Speaker 1>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no cell phone,</v>

2391
02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:29.750
<v Speaker 1>although we do have internet now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably add in good.</v>

2392
02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:32.120
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to take a bit of a break,</v>

2393
02:03:32.121 --> 02:03:37.121
<v Speaker 1>which was good because I haven't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>been able to think more broadly about w </v>

2394
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:40.610
<v Speaker 1>say what I'm doing because who the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell I'm doing.</v>

2395
02:03:40.611 --> 02:03:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

2396
02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:45.680
<v Speaker 1>this is all very strange and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2397
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:47.930
<v Speaker 1>but one thing I thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out on the lake,</v>

2398
02:03:47.931 --> 02:03:51.920
<v Speaker 1>I was canoeing around and I thought I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about war.</v>

2399
02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:54.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was very irritated.</v>

2400
02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm very irritated about what's happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the universities and there's a hint </v>

2401
02:04:00.471 --> 02:04:05.471
<v Speaker 1>of malevolence about it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan of ideological possession </v>

2402
02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>and I've been set back up on my heels a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot over the last eight months by the,</v>

2403
02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:17.520
<v Speaker 1>the onslaught of what emerged when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that there was words I wouldn't </v>

2404
02:04:18.381 --> 02:04:18.830
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

2405
02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:23.960
<v Speaker 1>And so it's put me into a defensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>posture,</v>

2406
02:04:23.961 --> 02:04:27.290
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have been thinking in terms of war</v>

2407
02:04:27.291 --> 02:04:28.430
<v Speaker 1>metaphors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2408
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>like this is a battleground and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a war going on an ideological </v>

2409
02:04:34.491 --> 02:04:37.010
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe that that's,</v>

2410
02:04:37.650 --> 02:04:42.650
<v Speaker 1>but then I was reading and I did this </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly for this course,</v>

2411
02:04:43.681 --> 02:04:48.681
<v Speaker 1>I was reading the sermon on the mount </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things it says is resist </v>

2412
02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:51.120
<v Speaker 1>not evil and I don't know what to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>about line.</v>

2413
02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:56.720
<v Speaker 1>And so I was talking to a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people about it and reading about it a </v>

2414
02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>lot and trying to figure out what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant.</v>

2415
02:04:56.971 --> 02:04:59.190
<v Speaker 1>And partly what it means is don't waste </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2416
02:05:00.210 --> 02:05:05.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you fighting against </v>

2417
02:05:05.210 --> 02:05:05.210
<v Speaker 1>something then there's something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing.</v>

2418
02:05:05.210 --> 02:05:07.050
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought also when I was out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there on the lake,</v>

2419
02:05:07.051 --> 02:05:12.051
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well do I really want to be in a war </v>

2420
02:05:12.051 --> 02:05:12.051
<v Speaker 1>because war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

2421
02:05:12.051 --> 02:05:12.660
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

2422
02:05:13.650 --> 02:05:16.140
<v Speaker 1>that's not heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

2423
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 1>It's really stressful and people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

2424
02:05:19.410 --> 02:05:24.410
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that's just the wrong way of </v>

2425
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.600
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it even though there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>battleground issue here.</v>

2426
02:05:25.230 --> 02:05:27.840
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well wait a second,</v>

2427
02:05:27.841 --> 02:05:32.841
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the right thing to do in a </v>

2428
02:05:32.841 --> 02:05:35.301
<v Speaker 1>situation like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is maybe something that those </v>

2429
02:05:35.301 --> 02:05:36.090
<v Speaker 1>on the alt right might consider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that</v>

2430
02:05:38.190 --> 02:05:41.100
<v Speaker 1>the right thing to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe is to outline a better way</v>

2431
02:05:42.730 --> 02:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>rather than go out directly on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

2432
02:05:44.981 --> 02:05:49.981
<v Speaker 1>Now that might be seem somewhat at odds </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my idea of the website and perhaps </v>

2433
02:05:50.081 --> 02:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>it is somewhat at odds with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

2434
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm trying to do instead of </v>

2435
02:05:56.910 --> 02:06:01.290
<v Speaker 1>conducting this like a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say is two conducted like a </v>

2436
02:06:01.290 --> 02:06:04.900
<v Speaker 1>movement towards something better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be better.</v>

2437
02:06:04.901 --> 02:06:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Now with regards to cutting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university's funding.</v>

2438
02:06:07.601 --> 02:06:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that too and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

2439
02:06:09.761 --> 02:06:14.761
<v Speaker 1>That's not gonna work out because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inviting political interference into </v>

2440
02:06:14.761 --> 02:06:18.661
<v Speaker 1>higher education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the political interference might be </v>

2441
02:06:18.661 --> 02:06:22.171
<v Speaker 1>over the counter balancing kind because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence that the humanities in </v>

2442
02:06:22.171 --> 02:06:25.831
<v Speaker 1>particular have tilted almost 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent to the left is overwhelming and </v>

2443
02:06:25.831 --> 02:06:30.451
<v Speaker 1>so maybe some counter balance from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right would set things more towards the </v>

2444
02:06:30.451 --> 02:06:34.831
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is is when you open up </v>

2445
02:06:34.831 --> 02:06:35.650
<v Speaker 1>the door to political interference with </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher education content,</v>

2446
02:06:35.651 --> 02:06:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you can't close the door again.</v>

2447
02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And so on reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that it probably was a sub </v>

2448
02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:46.790
<v Speaker 1>optimal idea and that would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead was to and what are,</v>

2449
02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:48.640
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I launched the website,</v>

2450
02:06:48.641 --> 02:06:51.220
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the students who will be using it.</v>

2451
02:06:51.221 --> 02:06:52.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want from university?</v>

2452
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Because here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's your options.</v>

2453
02:06:54.281 --> 02:06:59.281
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can come out ideologically </v>

2454
02:06:59.281 --> 02:06:59.281
<v Speaker 1>possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2455
02:06:59.281 --> 02:07:03.130
<v Speaker 1>You can buy this doctrine is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological doctrine and you can become</v>

2456
02:07:03.131 --> 02:07:08.131
<v Speaker 1>bitter and resentful and you won't learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>to communicate properly and you won't </v>

2457
02:07:08.131 --> 02:07:11.560
<v Speaker 1>read the great works of civilization and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't learn to think and write.</v>

2458
02:07:11.710 --> 02:07:14.800
<v Speaker 1>You won't become knowable in body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit.</v>

2459
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you want the opposite?</v>

2460
02:07:19.441 --> 02:07:24.441
<v Speaker 1>Do you want a real education?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I want to explain what that </v>

2461
02:07:24.441 --> 02:07:27.651
<v Speaker 1>means like I did tonight to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that there's absolute value in </v>

2462
02:07:27.651 --> 02:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>learning how to put yourself together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to communicate and to familiarize </v>

2463
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>yourself with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2464
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:35.070
<v Speaker 1>with the classic works of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want to offer that.</v>

2465
02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to do what I can to offer that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper alternative.</v>

2466
02:07:38.411 --> 02:07:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Instead of staying in school winston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this notion of a battle which is just,</v>

2467
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think it's the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor.</v>

2468
02:07:45.730 --> 02:07:50.730
<v Speaker 1>So either in Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say that I think what </v>

2469
02:07:50.730 --> 02:07:52.240
<v Speaker 1>you're doing is absolutely miraculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's helps change my life.</v>

2470
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:57.550
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>At least raise your hand if Dr Peterson </v>

2471
02:07:57.550 --> 02:07:59.900
<v Speaker 8>has helped change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So for the better or for the worse,</v>

2472
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:02.830
<v Speaker 8>asked him to look.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2473
02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:04.790
<v Speaker 8>it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's about 40 people maybe.</v>

2474
02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:06.020
<v Speaker 8>And that's miraculous</v>

2475
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:09.630
<v Speaker 7>and I think in your thinking is going to</v>
<v Speaker 7>be.</v>

2476
02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:15.020
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's gonna be all over the place in the </v>

2477
02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:18.020
<v Speaker 7>Canadian election in two years and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>think that that's a horrible thing to </v>

2478
02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:18.020
<v Speaker 7>say.</v>

2479
02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:20.940
<v Speaker 8>You better watch out for it buddy and </v>
<v Speaker 8>uni and,</v>

2480
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:21.480
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

2481
02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:24.850
<v Speaker 7>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's gonna be a lot of talk about how</v>

2482
02:08:24.851 --> 02:08:26.380
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how,</v>

2483
02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:31.440
<v Speaker 7>how Andrew Scheer's a political message </v>
<v Speaker 7>is going to stem from yours.</v>

2484
02:08:32.321 --> 02:08:34.420
<v Speaker 7>And I think it's really important that </v>
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>

2485
02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:40.140
<v Speaker 7>he doesn't censor himself like other </v>
<v Speaker 7>conservative politicians are doing and </v>

2486
02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:44.580
<v Speaker 7>because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we need to unite under a valid,</v>

2487
02:08:45.370 --> 02:08:47.440
<v Speaker 7>thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 7>articulate,</v>

2488
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:49.540
<v Speaker 7>conservative voice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And what do we have now?</v>

2489
02:08:49.590 --> 02:08:51.070
<v Speaker 7>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have trump,</v>

2490
02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:52.600
<v Speaker 7>that's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2491
02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:57.250
<v Speaker 7>we don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we don't have any strong articulate male</v>

2492
02:08:57.251 --> 02:08:59.020
<v Speaker 7>voices in our,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in our,</v>

2493
02:08:59.021 --> 02:09:00.910
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in our political discourse right now.</v>

2494
02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:01.810
<v Speaker 7>That's what it feels different.</v>

2495
02:09:01.850 --> 02:09:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Only time for you to develop one.</v>

2496
02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:07.090
<v Speaker 8>So it looks like you're on the right </v>
<v Speaker 8>path.</v>

2497
02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:12.640
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hello</v>

2498
02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:18.660
<v Speaker 9>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 9>thank you for everything you've done </v>

2499
02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:18.660
<v Speaker 9>this past year and I do mean everything,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the political stuff,</v>

2500
02:09:19.530 --> 02:09:21.470
<v Speaker 1>lecture series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it gets you to move just to.</v>

2501
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2502
02:09:23.010 --> 02:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Belted out man.</v>

2503
02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:24.960
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

2504
02:09:24.961 --> 02:09:26.160
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'll try to be succinct.</v>

2505
02:09:26.161 --> 02:09:28.820
<v Speaker 9>I have two comments on one question.</v>
<v Speaker 9>First Common,</v>

2506
02:09:28.821 --> 02:09:33.821
<v Speaker 9>as you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how you were prevented from uploading </v>

2507
02:09:33.821 --> 02:09:33.821
<v Speaker 9>your youtube video from last week.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2508
02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:36.360
<v Speaker 9>I actually attended that lecture and I </v>
<v Speaker 9>make pretty detailed notes.</v>

2509
02:09:36.361 --> 02:09:38.010
<v Speaker 9>So if you want maybe I can email you.</v>

2510
02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:39.190
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got it.</v>

2511
02:09:39.191 --> 02:09:41.660
<v Speaker 1>It's my accounts reinstalled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reinstall,</v>

2512
02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.970
<v Speaker 1>reinstall restored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2513
02:09:45.971 --> 02:09:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

2514
02:09:47.861 --> 02:09:52.861
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's straightened out and I'm going to </v>

2515
02:09:52.861 --> 02:09:54.780
<v Speaker 1>upload all the videos to a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other sites and so this isn't going to </v>

2516
02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:54.780
<v Speaker 1>happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2517
02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:55.450
<v Speaker 1>But I appreciate that.</v>

2518
02:09:56.110 --> 02:09:57.960
<v Speaker 9>Some lectures and I do want to get them </v>
<v Speaker 9>online.</v>

2519
02:09:57.961 --> 02:09:59.850
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>My second comment is about,</v>

2520
02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:04.860
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>sort of kind of going into the </v>

2521
02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:08.121
<v Speaker 9>commentaries of Christian theology is </v>
<v Speaker 9>over over the centuries are like you've </v>

2522
02:10:08.121 --> 02:10:08.121
<v Speaker 9>known yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2523
02:10:08.121 --> 02:10:12.920
<v Speaker 9>I just would like to encourage everybody</v>
<v Speaker 9>to also look at not just western </v>

2524
02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:14.820
<v Speaker 9>Christianity but also eastern </v>
<v Speaker 9>Christianity,</v>

2525
02:10:14.821 --> 02:10:17.970
<v Speaker 9>like the Orthodox writing's a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's a big difference between the two</v>

2526
02:10:17.971 --> 02:10:22.971
<v Speaker 9>in that the western sort of theology </v>
<v Speaker 9>comes out of the Roman Roman law,</v>

2527
02:10:24.270 --> 02:10:29.270
<v Speaker 9>Roman justice.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So there's a lot more of an emphasis on </v>

2528
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.270
<v Speaker 9>can adjust the sin.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Christ came,</v>

2529
02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:32.370
<v Speaker 9>he died on the cross for our sin.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So there's that look kind of like legal,</v>

2530
02:10:32.610 --> 02:10:34.300
<v Speaker 9>a payback.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2531
02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:37.790
<v Speaker 9>Whereas the eastern,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the eastern theology is a lot more,</v>

2532
02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:43.180
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's focused a lot more in love and on </v>

2533
02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:43.860
<v Speaker 9>sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2534
02:10:43.861 --> 02:10:45.200
<v Speaker 9>the positive aspects.</v>

2535
02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:50.440
<v Speaker 9>And if you do read like the first four </v>
<v Speaker 9>centuries of Christianity where there </v>

2536
02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:50.440
<v Speaker 9>was no schism,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

2537
02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:54.080
<v Speaker 9>there's very little mention of a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>sort of a legalistic frame where it gets</v>

2538
02:10:54.081 --> 02:10:55.890
<v Speaker 9>a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know,</v>

2539
02:10:55.891 --> 02:10:58.880
<v Speaker 9>a prosaic are more heartfelt.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I guess.</v>

2540
02:10:58.910 --> 02:11:01.490
<v Speaker 9>So I think it's important that we also </v>
<v Speaker 9>in the West,</v>

2541
02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:04.520
<v Speaker 9>look at the eastern counterpart,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2542
02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:09.820
<v Speaker 9>especially more so now because I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I do perceive a lot of fake love as </v>

2543
02:11:09.891 --> 02:11:12.740
<v Speaker 9>being at the center of this my level and</v>
<v Speaker 9>said you mentioned so like,</v>

2544
02:11:12.741 --> 02:11:17.741
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this whole thing about I'm demonizing </v>

2545
02:11:17.741 --> 02:11:20.321
<v Speaker 9>the opposition saying that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they're heartless to have no love this </v>

2546
02:11:20.321 --> 02:11:21.080
<v Speaker 9>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I perceived that as a lot of fake love.</v>

2547
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:24.350
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I think that we have to keep in mind</v>

2548
02:11:24.351 --> 02:11:26.420
<v Speaker 9>what true love is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Sometimes it looks ugly.</v>

2549
02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:28.490
<v Speaker 9>Like in dealing with psychiatric </v>
<v Speaker 9>patients,</v>

2550
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:31.850
<v Speaker 9>maybe like other countries are not as </v>
<v Speaker 9>liberal as Canada,</v>

2551
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:34.100
<v Speaker 9>but the of results a lot more often </v>
<v Speaker 9>units.</v>

2552
02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:36.260
<v Speaker 9>There's as many psychiatric patients on </v>
<v Speaker 9>the road,</v>

2553
02:11:36.261 --> 02:11:38.120
<v Speaker 9>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in Greece where I'm from.</v>

2554
02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:41.990
<v Speaker 9>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that was kind of my comment that we need</v>

2555
02:11:41.991 --> 02:11:43.910
<v Speaker 9>to focus a little more on what real love</v>
<v Speaker 9>is,</v>

2556
02:11:43.911 --> 02:11:45.050
<v Speaker 9>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and not just the,</v>

2557
02:11:45.051 --> 02:11:50.051
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the kind of love that he put on a scale </v>

2558
02:11:50.051 --> 02:11:50.051
<v Speaker 9>because I don't think that he can put </v>
<v Speaker 9>love on a scale.</v>

2559
02:11:50.051 --> 02:11:51.670
<v Speaker 1>So I've been talking to some of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2560
02:11:51.671 --> 02:11:56.671
<v Speaker 1>to this Guy Jonathan Palio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an Orthodox carver and he started </v>

2561
02:11:56.671 --> 02:12:00.811
<v Speaker 1>a youtube channel and he's talking a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Orthodox issues and I'm pretty </v>

2562
02:12:00.811 --> 02:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>ignorant when it comes to Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

2563
02:12:03.310 --> 02:12:08.310
<v Speaker 1>but from what I understand of it so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty to be learned.</v>

2564
02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:09.580
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2565
02:12:10.050 --> 02:12:13.860
<v Speaker 9>I more than myself just recently came </v>
<v Speaker 9>back to my faith two years ago.</v>

2566
02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:16.620
<v Speaker 9>Basically that was the original </v>
<v Speaker 9>Christianity.</v>

2567
02:12:16.621 --> 02:12:20.510
<v Speaker 9>Then there was a schism of 1054 in </v>
<v Speaker 9>between East and west because of the,</v>

2568
02:12:21.690 --> 02:12:25.470
<v Speaker 9>the conflicts that these new </v>
<v Speaker 9>Christianity Christians have a pope.</v>

2569
02:12:25.650 --> 02:12:30.650
<v Speaker 9>And then after that you also had the </v>
<v Speaker 9>schism internally within the West </v>

2570
02:12:30.650 --> 02:12:31.170
<v Speaker 9>between Catholicism and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and the Protestants.</v>

2571
02:12:31.290 --> 02:12:34.950
<v Speaker 9>So that's kind of like the big </v>
<v Speaker 9>difference said at Christianity actually</v>

2572
02:12:34.951 --> 02:12:39.951
<v Speaker 9>came from the east.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I think that's why it's important </v>

2573
02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:42.561
<v Speaker 9>that we look at demos ancient times </v>
<v Speaker 9>because those were the ones that are </v>

2574
02:12:42.561 --> 02:12:42.840
<v Speaker 9>closest to the original message.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

2575
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:45.200
<v Speaker 9>so not my question,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2576
02:12:47.210 --> 02:12:52.210
<v Speaker 9>it's about atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You might hear a lot of times people </v>

2577
02:12:52.210 --> 02:12:55.611
<v Speaker 9>criticizing anybody that has any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 9>belief in a deity or a God that you're </v>

2578
02:12:56.161 --> 02:12:58.320
<v Speaker 9>just somebody that has an imaginary </v>
<v Speaker 9>friend,</v>

2579
02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:00.230
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like the,</v>

2580
02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:03.810
<v Speaker 9>the heavenly father that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 9>adhere to,</v>

2581
02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:08.210
<v Speaker 9>that you have no world of your own.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So then there's also like,</v>

2582
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:11.460
<v Speaker 9>what are the counter argument be that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

2583
02:13:11.461 --> 02:13:14.880
<v Speaker 9>so if I have a good relationship with my</v>
<v Speaker 9>father and that's why I'm more likely to</v>

2584
02:13:14.881 --> 02:13:17.340
<v Speaker 9>accept a higher degree than I could ever</v>
<v Speaker 9>be,</v>

2585
02:13:17.341 --> 02:13:19.590
<v Speaker 9>that you as an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2586
02:13:19.950 --> 02:13:23.880
<v Speaker 9>maybe you have conflict with your father</v>
<v Speaker 9>and that's why you're an adverse to kind</v>

2587
02:13:23.881 --> 02:13:27.030
<v Speaker 9>of submitting to a higher being that </v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm,</v>

2588
02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:29.740
<v Speaker 9>the kind of dictates your life while </v>
<v Speaker 9>you're,</v>

2589
02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:33.630
<v Speaker 1>you're attempting a psychoanalysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheism,</v>

2590
02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2591
02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:38.910
<v Speaker 1>and there's many factors that go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheism.</v>

2592
02:13:39.290 --> 02:13:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that you could make that </v>

2593
02:13:44.290 --> 02:13:44.850
<v Speaker 1>case in some situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in all.</v>

2594
02:13:45.190 --> 02:13:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think though,</v>

2595
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:50.520
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is perhaps where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is stemming from,</v>

2596
02:13:50.521 --> 02:13:55.521
<v Speaker 1>is that it's no fluke that at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that one of the consequences of the</v>

2597
02:14:00.781 --> 02:14:05.781
<v Speaker 1>death of God that Nietzsche announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the late 18 hundreds is the all </v>

2598
02:14:05.781 --> 02:14:09.000
<v Speaker 1>out assault on masculinity that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring in our culture now.</v>

2599
02:14:09.930 --> 02:14:14.930
<v Speaker 1>And those things are associated and I do</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that does have to do with a lack </v>

2600
02:14:15.001 --> 02:14:20.001
<v Speaker 1>of faith in the masculine spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very bad thing because </v>

2601
02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:25.140
<v Speaker 1>what's a bad thing for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously because women have a partially</v>

2602
02:14:25.141 --> 02:14:28.410
<v Speaker 1>masculine spirit and they have to put up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with men.</v>

2603
02:14:28.650 --> 02:14:32.940
<v Speaker 1>And so to demolish that or to fail to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nurture it,</v>

2604
02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:37.941
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly what's occurring is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a pathway to absolute disaster.</v>

2605
02:14:38.850 --> 02:14:40.460
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2606
02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:49.410
<v Speaker 7>Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this is the type of question that you</v>

2607
02:14:49.411 --> 02:14:51.630
<v Speaker 7>hate because it's in the category of </v>
<v Speaker 7>why,</v>

2608
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:54.070
<v Speaker 7>why you believe what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2609
02:14:54.330 --> 02:14:56.250
<v Speaker 7>it's a type of question that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 7>say,</v>

2610
02:14:56.251 --> 02:15:01.251
<v Speaker 7>if I have it right from the last time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the hell makes you think it's any </v>

2611
02:15:01.251 --> 02:15:01.340
<v Speaker 7>of your business on?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2612
02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:05.490
<v Speaker 7>Try to frame it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I'm asking this lecture 10 of 12 and</v>

2613
02:15:05.491 --> 02:15:08.100
<v Speaker 7>after having listened to quite a few </v>
<v Speaker 7>hours of you year and elsewhere,</v>

2614
02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:11.520
<v Speaker 7>and so in your second interview with </v>
<v Speaker 7>transluminal media,</v>

2615
02:15:11.521 --> 02:15:13.470
<v Speaker 7>you lay out a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have some quotes here,</v>

2616
02:15:13.471 --> 02:15:18.471
<v Speaker 7>I'll skip them for brevity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get to the point where you're </v>

2617
02:15:18.471 --> 02:15:20.310
<v Speaker 7>discussing the embodiment of the logos </v>
<v Speaker 7>by Christ as a historical figure,</v>

2618
02:15:20.910 --> 02:15:22.650
<v Speaker 7>and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>quote,</v>

2619
02:15:22.710 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 7>is this resurrection real?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did his body resurrect?</v>

2620
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:29.110
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In today's lecture you,</v>

2621
02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:34.200
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you alluded to the fact that there are </v>

2622
02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:34.200
<v Speaker 7>states of consciousness that perhaps we </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't know how to access anymore,</v>

2623
02:15:34.290 --> 02:15:36.250
<v Speaker 7>and let's say that I'm with you there.</v>

2624
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:41.270
<v Speaker 7>Let's say I'm with the idea that there </v>
<v Speaker 7>are unknown or unknown ways to get </v>

2625
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:44.151
<v Speaker 7>intimations of the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That the embodiment of the logos is </v>

2626
02:15:44.151 --> 02:15:44.390
<v Speaker 7>associated with physiological </v>
<v Speaker 7>transformations,</v>

2627
02:15:44.850 --> 02:15:49.850
<v Speaker 7>the upper limits of which are unknown </v>
<v Speaker 7>and that we might currently classify as </v>

2628
02:15:49.850 --> 02:15:53.271
<v Speaker 7>paranormal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But to dump it right back down to my </v>

2629
02:15:53.271 --> 02:15:55.941
<v Speaker 7>level,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm asking about the guy commonly </v>

2630
02:15:55.941 --> 02:15:58.370
<v Speaker 7>depicted with long hair nailed to a </v>
<v Speaker 7>cross until that is a door knob and all </v>

2631
02:15:58.370 --> 02:16:02.481
<v Speaker 7>of this goes to the heart of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>question of literalism and religious </v>

2632
02:16:02.481 --> 02:16:03.330
<v Speaker 7>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It goes to the heart of what we're doing</v>

2633
02:16:03.331 --> 02:16:08.331
<v Speaker 7>here at this lecture series.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are we examining the psychological </v>

2634
02:16:08.331 --> 02:16:11.151
<v Speaker 7>significance of these stories?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are we entertaining the possibility of </v>

2635
02:16:11.151 --> 02:16:11.730
<v Speaker 7>these fantastical events?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I might be struggling with the concept,</v>

2636
02:16:11.731 --> 02:16:15.900
<v Speaker 7>but I haven't been able to square away </v>
<v Speaker 7>and reconcile those statements by you.</v>

2637
02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:20.901
<v Speaker 7>So the question is on the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the question of the resurrection of </v>

2638
02:16:20.901 --> 02:16:21.690
<v Speaker 7>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why is your answer to your own question?</v>

2639
02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:24.150
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Instead of at the very least,</v>

2640
02:16:24.330 --> 02:16:25.080
<v Speaker 7>probably not.</v>

2641
02:16:30.750 --> 02:16:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're definitely right about me hating </v>

2642
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:37.591
<v Speaker 1>that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2643
02:16:42.221 --> 02:16:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I called this series the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance of the biblical stories for</v>

2644
02:16:46.391 --> 02:16:47.370
<v Speaker 1>a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2645
02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:52.440
<v Speaker 1>and the reason was that I'm partially </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualified to talk about such things.</v>

2646
02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:00.840
<v Speaker 1>When I step outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm not where I should be.</v>

2647
02:17:04.670 --> 02:17:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2648
02:17:11.671 --> 02:17:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get this right.</v>

2649
02:17:14.671 --> 02:17:19.671
<v Speaker 1>I can't get the words exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't about what I believe </v>

2650
02:17:19.671 --> 02:17:23.481
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly because I don't know what I </v>

2651
02:17:23.481 --> 02:17:24.060
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I believe.</v>

2652
02:17:24.450 --> 02:17:29.450
<v Speaker 1>The world's a very strange place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had some very strange experiences </v>

2653
02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:32.991
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's helpful for me to </v>

2654
02:17:32.991 --> 02:17:36.890
<v Speaker 1>step outside my jurisdiction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculate precisely.</v>

2655
02:17:37.820 --> 02:17:42.820
<v Speaker 1>The easiest thing would be to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I said,</v>

2656
02:17:44.871 --> 02:17:49.871
<v Speaker 1>but I had to say today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that we know what the </v>

2657
02:17:49.871 --> 02:17:52.380
<v Speaker 1>upper limits of human possibility are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means.</v>

2658
02:17:52.381 --> 02:17:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Metaphysically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I do understand from the gospels is</v>

2659
02:17:55.171 --> 02:18:00.171
<v Speaker 1>that even the accounts of Christ's </v>
<v Speaker 1>resurrection are complex and difficult </v>

2660
02:18:00.171 --> 02:18:00.480
<v Speaker 1>to understand.</v>

2661
02:18:03.130 --> 02:18:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I think from reading you in large part </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can make a very strong case for</v>

2662
02:18:08.531 --> 02:18:11.110
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic meaning of the death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resurrection.</v>

2663
02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it does stand for the capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human logos to die and resurrect </v>

2664
02:18:16.181 --> 02:18:21.181
<v Speaker 1>continually as it strives upward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not willing to say that that's all </v>

2665
02:18:21.761 --> 02:18:26.761
<v Speaker 1>it means because I don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything means and I don't know about </v>

2666
02:18:28.451 --> 02:18:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental metaphysics of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

2667
02:18:30.911 --> 02:18:35.911
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that it's accurate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>construe being as a battle ground </v>

2668
02:18:35.911 --> 02:18:37.240
<v Speaker 1>between good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

2669
02:18:37.630 --> 02:18:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I believe that is the most accurate way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of representing being.</v>

2670
02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:44.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not the most accurate way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing the objective world.</v>

2671
02:18:44.770 --> 02:18:49.770
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being is that set of experiences which </v>

2672
02:18:49.770 --> 02:18:54.541
<v Speaker 1>we inhabit and that's only partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective and it's not obviously </v>

2673
02:18:54.541 --> 02:18:59.461
<v Speaker 1>reduceable to the material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not any straightforward way because we </v>

2674
02:18:59.461 --> 02:19:00.610
<v Speaker 1>don't understand the material substrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being at all.</v>

2675
02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's and when we do attempt to </v>

2676
02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:06.060
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say at the quantum level,</v>

2677
02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:08.740
<v Speaker 1>we run into mysteries that that baffle </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

2678
02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:14.400
<v Speaker 1>the most intelligent of us and aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to have to leave the </v>

2679
02:19:14.471 --> 02:19:19.471
<v Speaker 1>question hanging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but partly because partly because I </v>

2680
02:19:19.471 --> 02:19:20.980
<v Speaker 1>don't know what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but partly because</v>

2681
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.400
<v Speaker 1>there has to be aligned between what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>

2682
02:19:26.490 --> 02:19:29.530
<v Speaker 1>what what I can communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2683
02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:33.200
<v Speaker 1>what you believe is beyond your capacity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to articulate.</v>

2684
02:19:33.201 --> 02:19:36.020
<v Speaker 1>If you the most at the deepest levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

2685
02:19:36.021 --> 02:19:41.021
<v Speaker 1>and I can only share with you what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have actually come to understand and </v>

2686
02:19:41.021 --> 02:19:43.190
<v Speaker 1>there's things that I don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's definitely one of them.</v>

2687
02:19:44.220 --> 02:19:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to draw a line between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic significance of the </v>

2688
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:54.490
<v Speaker 1>biblical events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the symbolic and psychological </v>

2689
02:19:54.490 --> 02:19:57.071
<v Speaker 1>significance of the biblical events and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the metaphysics that's underneath them </v>

2690
02:19:57.071 --> 02:19:59.900
<v Speaker 1>and I think you see the same thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>young because when you own rights,</v>

2691
02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:01.190
<v Speaker 1>technically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>informally,</v>

2692
02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:04.490
<v Speaker 1>he never talks about God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always talks about the image of God,</v>

2693
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:09.670
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The image of God would be your </v>

2694
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:12.761
<v Speaker 1>subjective experience of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says nothing about the objective </v>

2695
02:20:12.761 --> 02:20:16.391
<v Speaker 1>reality of God because your subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience can't say much about </v>

2696
02:20:16.391 --> 02:20:17.570
<v Speaker 1>objective reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even in young you get this mix.</v>

2697
02:20:17.570 --> 02:20:19.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's psychological,</v>

2698
02:20:19.821 --> 02:20:23.000
<v Speaker 1>but then he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes a metaphysical move and I think</v>

2699
02:20:23.001 --> 02:20:28.001
<v Speaker 1>that reflected also his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the limits of his knowledge because </v>

2700
02:20:28.001 --> 02:20:29.210
<v Speaker 1>young had profound revelatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

2701
02:20:29.211 --> 02:20:31.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a very strange person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2702
02:20:31.731 --> 02:20:36.620
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2703
02:20:36.621 --> 02:20:41.621
<v Speaker 1>I think what's best for me is to stay on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground that I'm competent on and to </v>

2704
02:20:42.291 --> 02:20:47.291
<v Speaker 1>say what I can say about the psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to reach beyond that briefly when </v>

2705
02:20:47.961 --> 02:20:50.180
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other than that to leave it the hell</v>

2706
02:20:50.181 --> 02:20:54.860
<v Speaker 1>alone until I understand it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that I ever do so</v>

2707
02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:10.900
<v Speaker 10>because of these lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've been reading the Bible and </v>

2708
02:21:10.900 --> 02:21:11.090
<v Speaker 10>obviously not finished,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I'm fairly familiar with,</v>

2709
02:21:11.770 --> 02:21:14.840
<v Speaker 10>with how it goes and the.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I've been thinking about two parts of it</v>

2710
02:21:14.841 --> 02:21:19.841
<v Speaker 10>in specific,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is the story of Isaac and the </v>

2711
02:21:19.841 --> 02:21:23.410
<v Speaker 10>Crucifixion of Christ and particularly </v>
<v Speaker 10>one of the things that Christ says on </v>

2712
02:21:23.410 --> 02:21:25.430
<v Speaker 10>the cross,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which is my God,</v>

2713
02:21:25.431 --> 02:21:26.840
<v Speaker 10>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 10>why have you forsaken me?</v>

2714
02:21:27.290 --> 02:21:32.290
<v Speaker 10>And I've been trying to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 10>because that's one hell of a thing for </v>

2715
02:21:32.290 --> 02:21:32.290
<v Speaker 10>the son of God to say.</v>

2716
02:21:32.290 --> 02:21:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And you think that would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>edited out.</v>

2717
02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2718
02:21:34.601 --> 02:21:35.680
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2719
02:21:35.681 --> 02:21:37.270
<v Speaker 1>why isn't that gone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2720
02:21:37.271 --> 02:21:37.570
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2721
02:21:37.571 --> 02:21:38.290
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2722
02:21:38.390 --> 02:21:40.250
<v Speaker 1>it's very inconvenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2723
02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:42.940
<v Speaker 10>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 10>well we haven't,</v>

2724
02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:44.930
<v Speaker 10>you haven't touched on the story of </v>
<v Speaker 10>Isaac yet,</v>

2725
02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:47.630
<v Speaker 10>but there's this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the cold topology,</v>

2726
02:21:47.631 --> 02:21:50.900
<v Speaker 10>which I'm sure you're aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but basically the idea that what's going</v>

2727
02:21:50.901 --> 02:21:55.901
<v Speaker 10>on in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he served the laying out of types for </v>

2728
02:21:55.901 --> 02:21:58.361
<v Speaker 10>Christ and that Isaac is essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 10>type of Christ because they have all </v>

2729
02:21:58.361 --> 02:22:02.531
<v Speaker 10>these similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so I've been thinking about it in </v>

2730
02:22:02.531 --> 02:22:06.131
<v Speaker 10>that context and thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 10>parallels between them in between Isaac </v>

2731
02:22:06.471 --> 02:22:11.471
<v Speaker 10>and Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And one of the things that also struck </v>

2732
02:22:11.471 --> 02:22:11.471
<v Speaker 10>me was mostly the differences between as</v>
<v Speaker 10>I can Christ.</v>

2733
02:22:11.471 --> 02:22:16.231
<v Speaker 10>And the main difference it seems to me </v>
<v Speaker 10>is sort of a difference in direction of </v>

2734
02:22:16.231 --> 02:22:19.571
<v Speaker 10>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So the sacrifices of Abraham is Abraham </v>

2735
02:22:19.571 --> 02:22:23.111
<v Speaker 10>sacrificing his son to God and then the </v>
<v Speaker 10>sacrifice of Jesus is God sacrificing </v>

2736
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:28.870
<v Speaker 10>his son to.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I've been trying to understand </v>

2737
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:31.230
<v Speaker 10>basically how that works and in relation</v>
<v Speaker 10>to the,</v>

2738
02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:35.500
<v Speaker 1>in Western civilization for 2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2739
02:22:35.730 --> 02:22:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Well there is these transformations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>

2740
02:22:38.221 --> 02:22:43.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next thing that happens in these </v>

2741
02:22:43.221 --> 02:22:46.641
<v Speaker 1>stories is that the circumcision </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumcision starts to come in as a </v>

2742
02:22:46.651 --> 02:22:51.651
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to be something like the </v>

2743
02:22:51.651 --> 02:22:52.740
<v Speaker 1>beginnings of replacement for sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>of animals.</v>

2744
02:22:52.750 --> 02:22:53.550
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2745
02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:56.740
<v Speaker 1>there's this psychology ization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

2746
02:22:56.741 --> 02:22:58.830
<v Speaker 1>So first it's pure external,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enact it out,</v>

2747
02:22:58.831 --> 02:23:01.410
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more conceptual,</v>

2748
02:23:01.530 --> 02:23:03.960
<v Speaker 1>like it becomes embodied in the form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the circumcision,</v>

2749
02:23:03.961 --> 02:23:08.961
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes more conceptual and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that conceptual transformation keeps </v>

2750
02:23:08.961 --> 02:23:08.961
<v Speaker 1>occurring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2751
02:23:08.961 --> 02:23:13.870
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it culminates to some degree in </v>

2752
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:15.240
<v Speaker 1>this idea of the sacrifice of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

2753
02:23:15.570 --> 02:23:18.150
<v Speaker 1>who's God sacrificing his son to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind?</v>

2754
02:23:18.151 --> 02:23:20.340
<v Speaker 1>But the sacrifice is much more complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

2755
02:23:20.341 --> 02:23:25.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also Christ sacrificing himself to </v>

2756
02:23:25.341 --> 02:23:28.581
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the issue there is </v>

2757
02:23:28.581 --> 02:23:30.360
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2758
02:23:30.390 --> 02:23:33.690
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're supposed to offer up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best that you have to God.</v>

2759
02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:38.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens with the high </v>

2760
02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:39.060
<v Speaker 1>quality animals that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Abel sacrifices.</v>

2761
02:23:39.061 --> 02:23:44.061
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something better than the </v>

2762
02:23:44.061 --> 02:23:44.061
<v Speaker 1>best that you own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2763
02:23:44.061 --> 02:23:44.700
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2764
02:23:44.850 --> 02:23:46.800
<v Speaker 1>part of it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2765
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the relationships you have with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you willing to sacrifice them to </v>

2766
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:55.911
<v Speaker 1>pursue the highest good will?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then are you willing to sacrifice </v>

2767
02:23:55.911 --> 02:23:58.200
<v Speaker 1>yourself or your son like your son might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>

2768
02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:03.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand the idea of sacrificing</v>

2769
02:24:03.211 --> 02:24:08.211
<v Speaker 1>yourself better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still wrestling with this story of </v>

2770
02:24:08.211 --> 02:24:11.811
<v Speaker 1>Isaiah obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's such a complicated story </v>

2771
02:24:11.811 --> 02:24:11.970
<v Speaker 1>and I do think it's reasonable to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it as a form of foreshadowing.</v>

2772
02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:17.180
<v Speaker 1>At least the way the Bible is set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course people who aren't Christian </v>

2773
02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:17.180
<v Speaker 1>would agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

2774
02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:18.070
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2775
02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:21.810
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you would offer yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a sacrifice to God,</v>

2776
02:24:21.890 --> 02:24:24.270
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me to follow quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>logically because,</v>

2777
02:24:25.020 --> 02:24:30.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you have nothing greater to </v>

2778
02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:30.020
<v Speaker 1>give them the best of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2779
02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:31.860
<v Speaker 1>So you sacrifice yourself to the highest</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2780
02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:35.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the way in which humanity</v>

2781
02:24:35.521 --> 02:24:37.410
<v Speaker 1>is redeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense to me.</v>

2782
02:24:37.411 --> 02:24:39.910
<v Speaker 1>That just seems like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2783
02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:42.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological truth.</v>

2784
02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:43.650
<v Speaker 1>The son issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2785
02:24:44.190 --> 02:24:47.220
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot tougher thing to wrestle </v>
<v Speaker 1>with because</v>

2786
02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:49.300
<v Speaker 10>one of the things I was thinking with </v>
<v Speaker 10>the,</v>

2787
02:24:49.310 --> 02:24:54.310
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>with what Jesus says on the cross is </v>

2788
02:24:54.310 --> 02:24:58.170
<v Speaker 10>that one of the interpretations of that </v>
<v Speaker 10>is basically that Jesus in that moment </v>

2789
02:24:58.170 --> 02:24:59.160
<v Speaker 10>is human,</v>
<v Speaker 10>basically is not the,</v>

2790
02:24:59.410 --> 02:25:03.070
<v Speaker 10>not just Jesus the human,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right.</v>

2791
02:25:03.490 --> 02:25:08.490
<v Speaker 10>But that always kind of felt a little </v>
<v Speaker 10>bit like avoiding the question to me </v>

2792
02:25:08.490 --> 02:25:11.110
<v Speaker 10>because you can just pause it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>something like the trinity and then say,</v>

2793
02:25:11.170 --> 02:25:16.170
<v Speaker 10>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but in this moment that doesn't go </v>

2794
02:25:16.170 --> 02:25:16.170
<v Speaker 10>right,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that doesn't count.</v>

2795
02:25:16.170 --> 02:25:16.800
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but if,</v>

2796
02:25:16.850 --> 02:25:21.850
<v Speaker 10>if we think about it in that way of like</v>
<v Speaker 10>the difference in the direction of </v>

2797
02:25:21.911 --> 02:25:26.911
<v Speaker 10>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And it seems to me that in the </v>

2798
02:25:26.911 --> 02:25:27.460
<v Speaker 10>sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 10>whoever's making the sacrifice surf aims</v>

2799
02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:32.520
<v Speaker 10>toward something so Abraham is so </v>
<v Speaker 10>reaching for the divine when he </v>

2800
02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:34.030
<v Speaker 10>sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when he's going to sacrifice his son.</v>

2801
02:25:34.750 --> 02:25:39.580
<v Speaker 10>And so that would mean maybe God is </v>
<v Speaker 10>reaching towards the human.</v>

2802
02:25:39.930 --> 02:25:44.930
<v Speaker 10>And so that would make some sense of </v>
<v Speaker 10>that interpretation that Christ is only </v>

2803
02:25:44.930 --> 02:25:44.930
<v Speaker 10>human in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Right?</v>

2804
02:25:44.930 --> 02:25:49.120
<v Speaker 10>That it's the sacrifices accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 10>then the richmond down accomplished.</v>

2805
02:25:49.870 --> 02:25:53.110
<v Speaker 10>But I'm still left with a question.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What do I make of that?</v>

2806
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:55.780
<v Speaker 10>Because that's one intuitive.</v>

2807
02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's useful to have a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that because it gives you something</v>

2808
02:25:59.671 --> 02:26:01.260
<v Speaker 1>to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2809
02:26:01.330 --> 02:26:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Something to study further and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a major.</v>

2810
02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:07.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a major problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole issue of,</v>

2811
02:26:07.710 --> 02:26:08.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say,</v>

2812
02:26:08.730 --> 02:26:13.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the relationship between the </v>

2813
02:26:13.730 --> 02:26:15.321
<v Speaker 1>divine and the human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously brought to the </v>

2814
02:26:15.321 --> 02:26:15.321
<v Speaker 1>forefront and the idea of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2815
02:26:15.321 --> 02:26:19.641
<v Speaker 1>But it's a personal issue because part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the issue is what's the relationship </v>

2816
02:26:19.641 --> 02:26:23.901
<v Speaker 1>between you as a finite entity and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent infinity that surrounds you</v>

2817
02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:29.720
<v Speaker 1>while there's some relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because here you are and the </v>

2818
02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:32.520
<v Speaker 1>transcendent infinity around you exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a relationship.</v>

2819
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:34.800
<v Speaker 1>The question is what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>

2820
02:26:34.801 --> 02:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2821
02:26:37.490 --> 02:26:41.940
<v Speaker 1>and it's dramatized in that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I mean,</v>

2822
02:26:41.941 --> 02:26:46.941
<v Speaker 1>partly the reason that there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict and confusion in that story is </v>

2823
02:26:48.271 --> 02:26:50.340
<v Speaker 1>because it's trying to bring opposing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things together,</v>

2824
02:26:50.341 --> 02:26:50.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2825
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:53.340
<v Speaker 1>How can something be God and man at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>

2826
02:26:53.490 --> 02:26:57.030
<v Speaker 1>it's just like the genie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the root word of genius.</v>

2827
02:26:57.031 --> 02:27:02.031
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genie is this incredibly powerful </v>

2828
02:27:02.031 --> 02:27:03.150
<v Speaker 1>force that can grant wishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2829
02:27:03.510 --> 02:27:05.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's constrained in this tiny little</v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

2830
02:27:05.641 --> 02:27:09.480
<v Speaker 1>There is an intimation there that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to be real,</v>

2831
02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:13.170
<v Speaker 1>it has to straddle the divide between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the finite and the infinite,</v>

2832
02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:16.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's what human beings do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to some degree,</v>

2833
02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:21.620
<v Speaker 1>and that's dramatized in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that we understand </v>

2834
02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:24.891
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you know that sometimes you're </v>

2835
02:27:24.891 --> 02:27:25.620
<v Speaker 1>going to feel that way when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>called upon to make a sacrifice.</v>

2836
02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:29.560
<v Speaker 1>You're going to feel that you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayed by everything,</v>

2837
02:27:29.561 --> 02:27:31.080
<v Speaker 1>and I'm in the store is set up that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2838
02:27:31.081 --> 02:27:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Christ is betrayed by tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's betrayed by his best friends.</v>

2839
02:27:34.651 --> 02:27:39.651
<v Speaker 1>He's betrayed by his mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's an archetypal story because,</v>

2840
02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:42.810
<v Speaker 1>and he's innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the story can't be any worse.</v>

2841
02:27:42.811 --> 02:27:47.340
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's our temple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean the story says to some degree</v>

2842
02:27:47.341 --> 02:27:51.450
<v Speaker 1>that under such conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even God himself would have doubt.</v>

2843
02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:54.270
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

2844
02:27:54.930 --> 02:27:58.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a powerful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very powerful idea.</v>

2845
02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:01.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's the best I can make out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for now.</v>

2846
02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:08.520
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

2847
02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:14.520
<v Speaker 1>We have to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll convene again in a week.</v>

2848
02:28:15.101 --> 02:28:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

2849
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:19.380
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>
