1
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much for showing up </v>

3
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:41.251
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good to see everybody </v>

4
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:41.251
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

5
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:41.251
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

6
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing as a consequence of going </v>

7
00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 2>through these stories is that</v>

8
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 2>the degree to which there are about </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals is quite remarkable and I </v>

9
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 2>think that's really telling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

10
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons I prefer Dostoevsky </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolstoy because tolstoy is more of a </v>

11
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 2>sociologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's more interested in the relationship</v>

12
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 2>between groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an oversimplification because </v>

13
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.571
<v Speaker 2>obviously total story's a great author,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd like to stfc better because he </v>

14
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 2>really delves into the souls of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals and I think it's remarkable.</v>

15
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.150
<v Speaker 2>The degree to which all of the stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've covered so far in genesis are</v>

16
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 2>about individuals and they're quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic,</v>

17
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 2>which is quite remarkable to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not really romanticized to any </v>

18
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 2>great degree because all of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are regardless,</v>

19
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 2>regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say as patriarchal or matriarchal </v>

20
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.741
<v Speaker 2>figures in genesis have no shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical Gif.</v>

21
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:50.991
<v Speaker 2>No shortage of ethical flaws and also no</v>
<v Speaker 2>shortage of difficulties in their life </v>

22
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 2>and the difficulties are realistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

23
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Their major league problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:59.181
<v Speaker 2>like familial catastrophes and famine </v>
<v Speaker 2>and war and revenge and hatred and all </v>

25
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a.</v>

26
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not a pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a pretty book and that's one of</v>

27
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:10.101
<v Speaker 2>the things that makes it great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the things that </v>

28
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:10.101
<v Speaker 2>characterize this great literature </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

29
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 2>is that it doesn't present you with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whitewash view of,</v>

30
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of humanity or of existence.</v>

31
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's really a relief I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as you all know,</v>

32
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 2>because you're alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as a whitewash.</v>

33
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Existence like your to be alive is to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>in trouble.</v>

34
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Ethically and existentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been reading this book recently.</v>

35
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about it a little bit later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called better never to have been </v>

36
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 2>and it was written by a philosopher in </v>
<v Speaker 2>South Africa in Cape Town named Bennett.</v>

37
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.480
<v Speaker 2>That's his last name and he basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>argues,</v>

38
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a specious argument and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's artificially constructed,</v>

39
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 2>but he basically argues that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is so of suffering,</v>

40
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 3>even good lives are very much full of </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

41
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.480
<v Speaker 3>That it's wrong to bring children into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world because the suffering </v>

42
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 3>outweighs the good even in good lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's actually wrong.</v>

43
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.210
<v Speaker 3>It would also be better not to exist for</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same reason and my sense in </v>

44
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:24.331
<v Speaker 3>reading the book is that he came to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusion and then wrote the book to </v>

45
00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 3>justify it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is actually the reverse of the way</v>

46
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:30.631
<v Speaker 3>that you should write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should do when you're writing a </v>

47
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:30.631
<v Speaker 3>book is you should have a question and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should.</v>

48
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 3>It should be a real question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

49
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:37.201
<v Speaker 3>It should be one you don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer to and then you should be </v>

50
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:40.321
<v Speaker 3>studying and writing like mad and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading everything you can get your </v>

51
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:43.501
<v Speaker 3>hands on to see if you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>grapple with the problem and come to </v>

52
00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:47.161
<v Speaker 3>some solution and you should walk the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reader as well through your process of </v>

53
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 3>thinking so that they can come to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

54
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily to the same conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least track what you're doing and</v>

55
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's what he did.</v>

56
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 3>I think he wrote it backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then.</v>

57
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 3>And so I was thinking about it a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's actually a question that </v>

58
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:07.291
<v Speaker 3>I've contended with in my writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are Memphis to Ophelia and are </v>

59
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 3>satanic figures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

60
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 3>in girth is faust and also Ivan in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the brothers Karamazov who basically </v>

61
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 3>make the same case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

62
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.630
<v Speaker 3>that existence is so rife with trouble </v>
<v Speaker 3>and suffering that it would be better if</v>

63
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 3>it didn't exist at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem I've had with that,</v>

64
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 3>there's a variety of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the problems I've had with </v>

65
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 3>that is what happens if you start to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that way?</v>

66
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Because what I've observed is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who begin to think that way,</v>

67
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 3>that isn't where they stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they get angry at existence,</v>

68
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 3>which is what happened to cane as we saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Cain and Abel Story.</v>

69
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 3>And then the next step is to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking revenge against existence.</v>

70
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 3>And that cascades until it's revenge </v>
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>

71
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.210
<v Speaker 3>While I think the best way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it as revenge against God for the </v>

72
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.601
<v Speaker 3>crime of being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is I think the deepest sort of </v>

73
00:04:57.601 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 3>hatred that you can entertain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

74
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.080
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

75
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 3>and when you're in the grip of a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep emotion,</v>

76
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 3>like a really profound emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right at the bottom of emotions,</v>

77
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.420
<v Speaker 3>you're in something that's like a quasi </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious state and that's more or less </v>

78
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 3>independent of your belief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say in a transcendent deity.</v>

79
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can be in a profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional state that's as deep as it can</v>

80
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.951
<v Speaker 3>be and it can have religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance without that necessarily </v>

81
00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 3>signifying anything about a transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

82
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

83
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 3>but then I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

84
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that argument is you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can gerrymander it endlessly,</v>

85
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because first of all,</v>

86
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 3>how do you measure suffering and how do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you measure happiness?</v>

87
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like how do you assign weights to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and God,</v>

88
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 3>there's just no way of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to do it arbitrarily and so you</v>

89
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 3>can make an argument that the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 3>outweighs the happiness.</v>

90
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:46.651
<v Speaker 3>You just wait the suffering more heavily</v>
<v Speaker 3>than you wait the happiness and that's </v>

91
00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:46.651
<v Speaker 3>the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

92
00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>

93
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 3>But I think there's a deeper problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was reading this other book a </v>

94
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 3>while back as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was written by the guy who ran the</v>

95
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 3>human genome project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't remember exactly what it was</v>

96
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:07.541
<v Speaker 3>called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was something like a scientist's </v>

97
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:07.541
<v Speaker 3>case for God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something like that.</v>

98
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:11.650
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things he referred to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which didn't strike me as hard as it </v>

99
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.830
<v Speaker 3>should have to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the he,</v>

100
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thought that one of the phenomena say</v>

101
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:22.961
<v Speaker 3>that justified a belief in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent being with something like </v>

102
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 3>the moral intuition of human beings that</v>
<v Speaker 3>know we have a sense of right and wrong.</v>

103
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

104
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.330
<v Speaker 3>certainly what happens in genesis and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the story of Adam and eve is that,</v>

105
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that story announces the coming of the </v>

106
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 3>sense of right and wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

107
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.501
<v Speaker 3>The knowledge of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't something we ascribe to </v>

108
00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.931
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that's unique to human </v>

109
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Animals can be predators and you know,</v>

110
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 3>and they can be gentle and and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a relationship with them,</v>

111
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 3>but you never think of an evil cat or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

112
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:53.190
<v Speaker 3>or an evil wolf even though they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

113
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 3>they're predatory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but human beings,</v>

114
00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 3>we have this capacity to judge between </v>
<v Speaker 3>good and evil,</v>

115
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:06.131
<v Speaker 3>right and wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's really an integral part of our </v>

116
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 3>being and I think you can make an </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary case for that,</v>

117
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:12.311
<v Speaker 3>a biological case for that as you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a biological case for most of what </v>

118
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 3>is relevant about human beings because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we are biological creatures,</v>

119
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 3>but we don't really understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance of that.</v>

120
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 3>Like what happens in the story of Adam </v>
<v Speaker 3>and eve is that that's that realization </v>

121
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.141
<v Speaker 3>that coming to the knowledge of good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>evil is actually represented as a shift </v>

122
00:07:29.141 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 3>of cosmic significance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

123
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:34.391
<v Speaker 3>It puts a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it puts a permanent fracture in the </v>

124
00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:37.031
<v Speaker 3>structure of being and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think of human beings as </v>

125
00:07:37.031 --> 00:07:40.841
<v Speaker 3>insignificant and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tiny dust mote in the middle of an </v>

126
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 3>infinite cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cosmos that cares less for us,</v>

127
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 3>then who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally,</v>

128
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:50.480
<v Speaker 3>if human beings have the knowledge to </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguish between good and evil,</v>

129
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:55.481
<v Speaker 3>but if you give consciousness a central </v>
<v Speaker 3>role in being and you can make a </v>

130
00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 3>perfectly reasonable case for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because without consciousness there's no</v>

131
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:03.041
<v Speaker 3>being as far as anyone can determine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it may be much more central than we </v>

132
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:05.160
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and I,</v>

133
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 3>I really don't think there's a counter </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument to that,</v>

134
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 3>like not a solid one.</v>

135
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 3>You can state that consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 3>empathy,</v>

136
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:16.511
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal and that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally materialistic and it </v>

137
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 3>doesn't matter that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

138
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:21.521
<v Speaker 3>You can state that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can make an equally credible </v>

139
00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:22.830
<v Speaker 3>case the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And certainly our lived experiences,</v>

140
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.850
<v Speaker 3>that consciousness is crucial obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we treat each other as if most of </v>

141
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:33.311
<v Speaker 3>the time we're valuable conscious beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we wouldn't give up our </v>

142
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:35.030
<v Speaker 3>consciousness even though it's often </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness of suffering.</v>

143
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.360
<v Speaker 3>And so then I think another problem with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the book is that it's,</v>

144
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of predicated on the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is for happiness and I don't think </v>

145
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.751
<v Speaker 3>that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think that's how people </v>

146
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:51.641
<v Speaker 3>experience life and I might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to me that people </v>

147
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 3>experience life as something like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a series of ethical decisions.</v>

148
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

149
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:04.070
<v Speaker 3>when I just can't imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm being naive about this,</v>

150
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:09.801
<v Speaker 3>but I can't imagine that I can't imagine</v>
<v Speaker 3>another being that's like me in most </v>

151
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:17.001
<v Speaker 3>senses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't constantly wrestling in some </v>

152
00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 3>sense with what the next proper thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do is.</v>

153
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.740
<v Speaker 3>It's not like it's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not bloody obvious and it doesn't </v>

154
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 3>mean you'll do the right thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't lot lots of times and you know</v>

155
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 3>that by your own judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

156
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:31.230
<v Speaker 3>Because you're making mistakes all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

157
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you don't know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe</v>

158
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:38.901
<v Speaker 3>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who's to say that isn't what I'm </v>

159
00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:41.181
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about when you know that </v>

160
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:41.181
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is wrong and you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead and do it anyways.</v>

161
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:44.230
<v Speaker 3>People do that all the time and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>also extremely peculiar.</v>

162
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.280
<v Speaker 3>Bloody well think that if you knew it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was wrong and you told yourself that it </v>

163
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.791
<v Speaker 3>was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that would be sufficient so that </v>

164
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:52.791
<v Speaker 3>you would just wouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't what you're like at all.</v>

165
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:57.681
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can tell yourself something is </v>

166
00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 3>wrong a 50 times and you'll do it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>51st time and then you'll feel,</v>

167
00:09:58.501 --> 00:09:59.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

168
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 3>like you deserve to feel probably and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't stop you.</v>

169
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.200
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then I think the other problem with </v>

170
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.290
<v Speaker 3>the viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the suffering of life </v>

171
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:16.310
<v Speaker 3>eradicates its utility is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated on the idea that happiness or</v>

172
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:21.621
<v Speaker 3>lack of suffering even is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the right criteria by which to judge </v>

173
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.330
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that's how we actually</v>

174
00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:29.331
<v Speaker 3>experience life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what we do instead is put </v>

175
00:10:29.331 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 3>ourselves through a series of </v>
<v Speaker 3>excruciating moral choices.</v>

176
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when.</v>

177
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant about the biblical stories,</v>

178
00:10:37.381 --> 00:10:42.381
<v Speaker 3>and I think about the the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>implicit philosophy you know that's </v>

179
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 3>embedded in the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that that's how life is presented in,</v>

180
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.160
<v Speaker 3>in the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is all of these individuals first </v>

181
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 3>through individuals to not groups and </v>
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>

182
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.700
<v Speaker 3>they're agonizing over their moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>choices all the time,</v>

183
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.910
<v Speaker 3>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have a relationship with God </v>

184
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.100
<v Speaker 3>and but it's not a.</v>

185
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not a directive relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

186
00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Even the people to whom God speaks </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly,</v>

187
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 3>which I suspect is not something you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>would exactly want to have happen,</v>

188
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:17.540
<v Speaker 3>is it's there's still even the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a direct relationship with God</v>

189
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:24.621
<v Speaker 3>doesn't stop them from being tormented </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually by their moral choices and </v>

190
00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 3>so the world is presented as a a moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape,</v>

191
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.800
<v Speaker 3>not as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not as a place that justifies itself by </v>

192
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.041
<v Speaker 3>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's presented as a more landscape and </v>

193
00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:39.801
<v Speaker 3>people are presented as creatures who </v>
<v Speaker 3>traverse through the moral landscape,</v>

194
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:45.200
<v Speaker 3>making ethical decisions that determine </v>
<v Speaker 3>the course of the world and that seems </v>

195
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:51.021
<v Speaker 3>to me to be right and that's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the same as happiness by any </v>

196
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 3>stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a whole different category of being</v>

197
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:54.090
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

198
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that I've thought that through a lot</v>

199
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:02.701
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we do make choices and what we do </v>

200
00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:06.001
<v Speaker 3>is contend with the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The future seems to appear to us as a </v>

201
00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:10.291
<v Speaker 3>realm of possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a more accurate way of thinking </v>

202
00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:14.491
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then then that the future presents </v>

203
00:12:14.491 --> 00:12:16.441
<v Speaker 3>itself to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to us as a realm of determined thinks </v>

204
00:12:16.441 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's presents itself as a realm of </v>

205
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.191
<v Speaker 3>possibility and there's good choices in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that realm and there's poor choices or </v>

206
00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:27.121
<v Speaker 3>even evil choices in that realm and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're negotiating continually deciding </v>

207
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 3>which of those choices we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring into being.</v>

208
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.940
<v Speaker 3>That seems to me to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenologically,</v>

209
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:38.010
<v Speaker 3>indisputable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we certainly treat each other as if </v>

210
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.040
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're doing because we hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other responsible for our actions,</v>

211
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:44.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some exceptions and that we're </v>

212
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 3>deciding each moment whether to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>things better or worse.</v>

213
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:52.110
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to me to be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's what these </v>

214
00:12:53.121 --> 00:12:57.290
<v Speaker 3>stories illustrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't say that directly,</v>

215
00:12:57.291 --> 00:13:02.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I think it gets more and more </v>

216
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:02.480
<v Speaker 3>explicit as the narrative unfolds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

217
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.310
<v Speaker 3>and then part of the realism of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories is that,</v>

218
00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:05.370
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

219
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 3>the people aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are being presented are </v>

220
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.150
<v Speaker 3>by no means good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean maybe with the exception of Noah.</v>

221
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.770
<v Speaker 3>Noah was seemed to be a pretty good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they did,</v>

222
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.110
<v Speaker 3>he did get drunk and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

223
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.270
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and end up naked exposed to his sons and</v>

224
00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:22.040
<v Speaker 3>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

225
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.200
<v Speaker 3>But I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he isn't talked about a lot as a </v>

226
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a pretty compressed story.</v>

227
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:33.241
<v Speaker 3>But Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Abraham had plenty of problems </v>

228
00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:34.590
<v Speaker 3>not least of which was his inability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave home and then you know,</v>

229
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.870
<v Speaker 3>his lying about his wife and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of mistakes.</v>

230
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 3>And then Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who we're going to talk about tonight is</v>

231
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 3>an even more morally ambivalent </v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

232
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.760
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially at the beginning of the </v>

233
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:50.760
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

234
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:50.810
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

235
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.450
<v Speaker 3>he isn't the sort of person that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would pick out.</v>

236
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.220
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you were a hack writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't pick him out as the hero of</v>

237
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:05.221
<v Speaker 3>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of things that are really </v>

238
00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:06.580
<v Speaker 3>pretty reprehensible and takes them an </v>
<v Speaker 3>awful long time to learn better,</v>

239
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.820
<v Speaker 3>and yet he's the person who's put </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward as the father of the 12 tribes </v>

240
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.681
<v Speaker 3>of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from this flawed person that the </v>

241
00:14:16.681 --> 00:14:20.221
<v Speaker 3>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe that whose story you might </v>

242
00:14:20.221 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 3>say is at the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constitutes the fundamental underpinning</v>

243
00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:25.740
<v Speaker 3>of our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

244
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 3>it's from this deeply flawed individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that group emerges.</v>

245
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.800
<v Speaker 3>And so you might think about as a relief</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

246
00:14:32.801 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're no knight in shining armor,</v>

247
00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

248
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a pure moral past.</v>

249
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:44.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people make mistakes of catastrophic </v>

250
00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:44.851
<v Speaker 3>proportions nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

251
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 3>and that also means that these stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>put forward.</v>

252
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Something approximating hope because in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their realism,</v>

253
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:56.690
<v Speaker 3>in their moral realism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they present heroes.</v>

254
00:14:56.691 --> 00:14:58.560
<v Speaker 3>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the heroes of renown,</v>

255
00:14:58.561 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Patriarchs of old,</v>

256
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are realistic,</v>

257
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:08.381
<v Speaker 3>people who have fits of anger and rage </v>
<v Speaker 3>and who are murderous at times and who </v>

258
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:13.571
<v Speaker 3>are deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply embroiled with family dispute </v>

259
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:14.330
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and who,</v>

260
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.630
<v Speaker 3>who have adulterous affairs and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do all of the terrible things that </v>

261
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.870
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the weird thing is,</v>

262
00:15:21.871 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 3>is that God is still with them and</v>

263
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't obvious what that means or even</v>

264
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.460
<v Speaker 3>if it means anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very,</v>

265
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:38.490
<v Speaker 3>it's not disputable as far as I can tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a we're conscious and that </v>

266
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.410
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is a transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomena which,</v>

267
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:45.150
<v Speaker 3>which we do not understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that the landscape that we traversed</v>

268
00:15:45.151 --> 00:15:48.160
<v Speaker 3>through his moral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like every store you ever watch,</v>

269
00:15:48.161 --> 00:15:51.160
<v Speaker 3>anything that grips your imagination on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the screen or in the theater,</v>

270
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.910
<v Speaker 3>like any story that grabs you is a story</v>
<v Speaker 3>of moral striving.</v>

271
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just not interesting otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

272
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.820
<v Speaker 3>The person has to be confronted with </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex moral choices.</v>

273
00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:02.520
<v Speaker 3>And then you see the outcome and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

274
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.220
<v Speaker 3>the good guy does it right and the bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy does it badly and things don't go so</v>

275
00:16:06.221 --> 00:16:09.730
<v Speaker 3>well for the bad guy generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it's a bit more sophisticated,</v>

276
00:16:09.731 --> 00:16:12.310
<v Speaker 3>the good and the bad are in the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

277
00:16:12.311 --> 00:16:12.970
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

278
00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:17.971
<v Speaker 3>that's a more compelling story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so we could say,</v>

279
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

280
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.700
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could make the assumption that it </v>

281
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:27.700
<v Speaker 3>might be worthwhile thinking of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world as a,</v>

282
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:32.590
<v Speaker 3>as it has been thought of classically as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a theater upon which the forces of good </v>

283
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:37.031
<v Speaker 3>and evil continually strive for </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance and I,</v>

284
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.940
<v Speaker 3>for the life of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially after I started reading </v>

285
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.270
<v Speaker 3>deeply into 20th century history and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the terrible things that happened in the</v>

286
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:49.271
<v Speaker 3>20th century and all the terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably incomprehensible things </v>

287
00:16:49.271 --> 00:16:54.101
<v Speaker 3>that people did to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't see seeing things any </v>

288
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 3>other way is realistic now because</v>

289
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that you can immerse </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in 20th century history without</v>

290
00:17:01.891 --> 00:17:04.050
<v Speaker 3>coming to the conclusion that evil is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

291
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.200
<v Speaker 3>And if it's a reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on what you mean by reality.</v>

292
00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:11.390
<v Speaker 3>But it's fundamental enough reality for </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

293
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.840
<v Speaker 3>And if it's a reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I don't see how you can escape from</v>

294
00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:19.841
<v Speaker 3>the conclusion that the cosmos as we </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced it at least is a place of </v>

295
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:24.380
<v Speaker 3>moral striving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>

296
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>illustrated in the story of Jacob.</v>

297
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.440
<v Speaker 3>And I found that quite striking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

298
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.670
<v Speaker 3>so the last time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>last lecture,</v>

299
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.940
<v Speaker 3>I ended with the abrahamic stories with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the death of Sarah Abraham's wife,</v>

300
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.700
<v Speaker 3>and so we're going to continue from from</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

301
00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.090
<v Speaker 3>Remember Abraham had a son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isaac,</v>

302
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 3>and he was asked by God to sacrifice his</v>
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>

303
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:59.181
<v Speaker 3>which we talked about in in some depth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was attempting to make the case </v>

304
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:06.171
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of sacrifice was one of human </v>

305
00:18:06.171 --> 00:18:09.320
<v Speaker 3>kinds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great discoveries because it meant the </v>

306
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 3>discovery of the future essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also meant the discovery that the</v>

307
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:16.431
<v Speaker 3>future was something that you could make</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bargain with and that you could give </v>

308
00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 3>up something now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something impulsive,</v>

309
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.310
<v Speaker 3>some pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even a deep pleasure in the moment,</v>

310
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.730
<v Speaker 3>and you could strive and hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could make a covenant to bargain </v>

311
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:30.141
<v Speaker 3>with the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if your sacrifices were acceptable </v>

312
00:18:30.141 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 3>and that seemed to mean an ethically </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptable,</v>

313
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.120
<v Speaker 3>you had to sacrifice the right thing.</v>

314
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.390
<v Speaker 3>That that vastly increased the </v>
<v Speaker 3>probability that not only you would be </v>

315
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.730
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

316
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.930
<v Speaker 3>but that your descendants would be too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that that's an </v>

317
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.360
<v Speaker 3>irrational proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

318
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:50.570
<v Speaker 3>you have to leave in it a bit with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>realization that sometimes you know you </v>

319
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.870
<v Speaker 3>get sliced off at the knees no matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

320
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:56.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because life has an arbitrary element </v>

321
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.300
<v Speaker 3>and and that can be tossed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but building in the arbitrary element </v>

322
00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 3>will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still want to think,</v>

323
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your best bet?</v>

324
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:08.180
<v Speaker 3>Given a certain amount of randomness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it seems to me that conscious self </v>

325
00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 3>aware sacrifice and proper ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>striving is your best bet.</v>

326
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:17.721
<v Speaker 3>And you know there another idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always explained it when I've </v>

327
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:23.721
<v Speaker 3>explained it to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always used the movie Pinocchio as </v>

328
00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:26.691
<v Speaker 3>an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that when Japan was trying to </v>

329
00:19:26.691 --> 00:19:29.360
<v Speaker 3>make his puppet into a self aware and </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous moral agent,</v>

330
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.720
<v Speaker 3>which is what he wants above all else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he aims at the highest good.</v>

331
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:40.850
<v Speaker 3>That he can conceive w which is the star</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he prays to essentially and hopes </v>

332
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.591
<v Speaker 3>for the transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's also something in that </v>

333
00:19:45.591 --> 00:19:48.051
<v Speaker 3>that's unalterably profound and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is somewhat independent of the idea</v>

334
00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:53.721
<v Speaker 3>that you have to believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would also say that what it means to </v>

335
00:19:53.721 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 3>believe in God in the Old Testament is </v>
<v Speaker 3>by no means clear,</v>

336
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.440
<v Speaker 3>and that's something I also really want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk about tonight.</v>

337
00:19:58.441 --> 00:20:03.441
<v Speaker 3>It's not obvious what it means and well </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan know what he does,</v>

338
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:09.060
<v Speaker 3>at least his aim at the highest good of </v>
<v Speaker 3>which he can conceive,</v>

339
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:14.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that's actually been a </v>

340
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 3>philosophical definition of God upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>occasion that God is the highest good of</v>

341
00:20:15.031 --> 00:20:20.031
<v Speaker 3>which you conceive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's different than the idea of a </v>

342
00:20:21.571 --> 00:20:23.610
<v Speaker 3>transcendent being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Precisely,</v>

343
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:28.611
<v Speaker 3>but it's in line with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in line with certain interesting </v>

344
00:20:28.611 --> 00:20:28.611
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalytic speculations.</v>

345
00:20:28.611 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the things I really liked</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Carl Young,</v>

346
00:20:30.391 --> 00:20:32.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young was so radical,</v>

347
00:20:32.351 --> 00:20:33.870
<v Speaker 3>a thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just beyond belief.</v>

348
00:20:33.871 --> 00:20:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Like I've read a lot of critics of young</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've always,</v>

349
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.570
<v Speaker 3>I've always got a kick out of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the things they accuse young of </v>

350
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.810
<v Speaker 3>are so trivial compared to the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that young actually did that it's like </v>

351
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.831
<v Speaker 3>accusing a murderer of jaywalking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like because young was unbelievably </v>

352
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 3>radical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like here's one of his ideas.</v>

353
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:54.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thought that it was necessary.</v>

354
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 3>He believed that psychotherapy could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced by a supreme moral effort and </v>

355
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:04.111
<v Speaker 3>so the moral effort would be something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like aiming after good and then trying </v>

356
00:21:04.111 --> 00:21:07.501
<v Speaker 3>to integrate yourself around that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the good at which you aim would be </v>

357
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:14.251
<v Speaker 3>something approximating what you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like if you manifested your full </v>

358
00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:18.250
<v Speaker 3>potential and that you have a glimmering</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what that full potential was,</v>

359
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:21.370
<v Speaker 3>so that would be the potential future </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and he thought of that.</v>

360
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 3>He thought of people as four dimensional</v>
<v Speaker 3>entities,</v>

361
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:28.981
<v Speaker 3>especially essentially that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>stretched across time and that you as a </v>

362
00:21:28.981 --> 00:21:33.481
<v Speaker 3>totality across time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including your potential manifested </v>

363
00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:36.901
<v Speaker 3>yourself also in the here and now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that part of what your potential </v>

364
00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:41.610
<v Speaker 3>manifested itself was something like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>voice of conscious conscience or </v>

365
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.000
<v Speaker 3>intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing idea.</v>

366
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

367
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:46.360
<v Speaker 3>Because it's like what you could be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future,</v>

368
00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:51.361
<v Speaker 3>beckons to you in the present and helps </v>
<v Speaker 3>you determine the difference between </v>

369
00:21:51.361 --> 00:21:53.620
<v Speaker 3>good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mind boggling idea and you know,</v>

370
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:58.621
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's an idea you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>contend with and then he went further </v>

371
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:00.190
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

372
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.110
<v Speaker 3>this is also remarkable idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

373
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:09.150
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was interested in this symbolic </v>

374
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 3>representation of Christ and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically speaking,</v>

375
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:14.551
<v Speaker 3>and he thought of Christ as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of the ideal potential </v>

376
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

377
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.330
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a symbolic,</v>

378
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.430
<v Speaker 3>at minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what Christ was,</v>

379
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 3>is a symbolic representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideal potential of a human being.</v>

380
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 3>And so for young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no difference between,</v>

381
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:32.190
<v Speaker 3>there was no psychological difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between who you could be in the future </v>

382
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:36.451
<v Speaker 3>beckoning to you and the prey in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>present and orienting yourself in </v>

383
00:22:36.451 --> 00:22:39.760
<v Speaker 3>relationship to Christ psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were the same thing.</v>

384
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.510
<v Speaker 3>And then so that's a pretty mindboggling</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

385
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

386
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:46.320
<v Speaker 3>that's a mind boggling idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

387
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 3>especially when you add the </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological idea that the.</v>

388
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that characterize as </v>
<v Speaker 3>your ideal future self is the ability to</v>

389
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:55.240
<v Speaker 3>make sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

390
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.310
<v Speaker 3>And the deeper the sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better.</v>

391
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.070
<v Speaker 3>And then also to recover from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice,</v>

392
00:23:00.071 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the death and rebirth.</v>

393
00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 3>So the part of you that's most essential</v>
<v Speaker 3>to your full flowering as a,</v>

394
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.450
<v Speaker 3>as a being is your ability to let things</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

395
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.500
<v Speaker 3>And then spring back from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to die in some sense and to be reborn</v>

396
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.050
<v Speaker 3>in the service of a higher good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

397
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:22.350
<v Speaker 3>well then the next part of that is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the direction of the world depends on </v>

398
00:23:22.841 --> 00:23:27.841
<v Speaker 3>you doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not only your own life but your </v>

399
00:23:27.841 --> 00:23:30.631
<v Speaker 3>family's life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because we're networked so intently </v>

400
00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:30.631
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

401
00:23:30.631 --> 00:23:35.011
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole panoply of human kind and </v>

402
00:23:35.011 --> 00:23:35.500
<v Speaker 3>maybe the structure of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the cosmos.</v>

403
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:36.730
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might think,</v>

404
00:23:36.731 --> 00:23:38.350
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

405
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.960
<v Speaker 3>it's not so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so simple.</v>

406
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one person can wreak an awful lot of,</v>

407
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.380
<v Speaker 3>there's absolutely no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as we get more technologically </v>

408
00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.621
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that becomes even more relevant and </v>

409
00:23:53.621 --> 00:23:53.621
<v Speaker 3>important and crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

410
00:23:53.621 --> 00:23:58.570
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you said was that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had to wake up because we are too </v>

411
00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.160
<v Speaker 3>technologically powerful to be as </v>
<v Speaker 3>morally asleep as we are.</v>

412
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to me just to be self </v>
<v Speaker 3>evident.</v>

413
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.430
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

414
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.420
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

415
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.740
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

416
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.370
<v Speaker 3>we're half asleep with nuclear bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good idea.</v>

417
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 3>It's seriously not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so.</v>

418
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you might ask yourself too,</v>

419
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:19.420
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

420
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:24.430
<v Speaker 3>what is the ultimate potential of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fully developed human being?</v>

421
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.790
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we certainly know that you have </v>

422
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:31.340
<v Speaker 3>admiration for people who are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed rather than less developed.</v>

423
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:36.341
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just happens automatic or </v>

424
00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:36.341
<v Speaker 3>resentment that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's okay.</v>

425
00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:37.640
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter,</v>

426
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like you can't identify </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

427
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.360
<v Speaker 3>You can identify them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

428
00:24:41.361 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're put forward to you in,</v>

429
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:48.210
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in drama and fiction and all of that </v>

430
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.231
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's another form of moral </v>

431
00:24:50.231 --> 00:24:50.231
<v Speaker 3>intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

432
00:24:50.231 --> 00:24:53.861
<v Speaker 3>you can read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can discern the wheat from the </v>

433
00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:53.861
<v Speaker 3>chaff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

434
00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:53.861
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so</v>

435
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 3>the other thing that I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it's worth consideration too,</v>

436
00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:06.470
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

437
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 3>and maybe this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe this is petty,</v>

438
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:14.380
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody asked me the other day if I </v>

439
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.990
<v Speaker 3>believed in miracles and I hate being </v>
<v Speaker 3>asked questions like that,</v>

440
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:20.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

441
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.920
<v Speaker 3>it's also people ask me to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in God and I'm like,</v>

442
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they mean when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>say that.</v>

443
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what to answer because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think we're taught necessarily </v>

444
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.731
<v Speaker 3>going to talk about the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in any case I said yes and I have a </v>

445
00:25:33.731 --> 00:25:34.790
<v Speaker 3>variety of reasons for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of them is that,</v>

446
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

447
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.500
<v Speaker 3>the consensus among physicists is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can track the origin of the cosmos to</v>

448
00:25:44.801 --> 00:25:49.801
<v Speaker 3>something like 100 million of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>millionth of a second after the big </v>

449
00:25:49.801 --> 00:25:53.971
<v Speaker 3>bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's so close to the big bang </v>

450
00:25:53.971 --> 00:25:55.780
<v Speaker 3>that the difference is literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinitesimal.</v>

451
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.800
<v Speaker 3>But the consensus is that before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that is,</v>

452
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.260
<v Speaker 3>the laws of physics themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakdown,</v>

453
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.170
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

454
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.080
<v Speaker 4>What do you call an event that</v>

455
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.480
<v Speaker 3>exists outside the laws of physics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That by definition that's a miracle.</v>

456
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a transcendent daddy that caused</v>

457
00:26:17.371 --> 00:26:19.080
<v Speaker 3>the event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a separate issue,</v>

458
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:24.950
<v Speaker 3>but it does imply a barrier of some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond which we can't go where some </v>

459
00:26:26.611 --> 00:26:31.611
<v Speaker 3>other set of rules apply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I find that interesting as well.</v>

460
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:37.630
<v Speaker 4>So all right,</v>

461
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:47.910
<v Speaker 2>so dies and Abraham makes a bargain with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hittites to purchase a burial place </v>

462
00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:55.520
<v Speaker 2>for her and they offer it as a gift and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he insists upon paying for it.</v>

463
00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a little story that basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicates two things that Abraham was </v>

464
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.940
<v Speaker 2>the kind of guy that you trust pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much when you see them and that even if </v>

465
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:10.041
<v Speaker 2>something is offered to him as a gift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to do everything to be </v>

466
00:27:10.041 --> 00:27:13.881
<v Speaker 2>reciprocal about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not a massively important </v>

467
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:14.870
<v Speaker 2>part of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

468
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 2>it's in keeping with the same narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>flow.</v>

469
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.270
<v Speaker 2>And so if Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a hittite,</v>

470
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 2>offers a burial place as a gift and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham says,</v>

471
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:24.520
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

472
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 2>you have to let me pay for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone says he will.</v>

473
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:33.201
<v Speaker 2>And that works out very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he has a burial place for his </v>

474
00:27:33.201 --> 00:27:37.161
<v Speaker 2>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Abraham decides that Isaac </v>

475
00:27:38.641 --> 00:27:39.450
<v Speaker 2>needs a wife.</v>

476
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:45.170
<v Speaker 2>And so he sends his eldest servant to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamia to find a wife for Isaac.</v>

477
00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:53.070
<v Speaker 2>And there's this strange ritual that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>performed.</v>

478
00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:58.071
<v Speaker 2>So it says in the story that the servant</v>
<v Speaker 2>places his hand under Abraham's thigh </v>

479
00:27:58.201 --> 00:28:00.840
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to swear,</v>

480
00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't really what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that he places his hand.</v>

481
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly how to say this </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

482
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use your imagination.</v>

483
00:28:09.331 --> 00:28:14.331
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that as far as I can </v>

484
00:28:14.331 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 2>tell that he's swearing on the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's swearing on future people.</v>

485
00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:19.160
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

486
00:28:19.161 --> 00:28:20.940
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of what testified means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

487
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Think about the route while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding,</v>

488
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what that is the derivation,</v>

489
00:28:27.871 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it is the derivation.</v>

490
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:30.690
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

491
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

492
00:28:32.221 --> 00:28:37.221
<v Speaker 2>this is a serious issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that servant has to go and find </v>

493
00:28:37.221 --> 00:28:40.641
<v Speaker 2>Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good wife and he wants him to find </v>

494
00:28:40.641 --> 00:28:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wife who is willing to accept the same</v>

495
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:48.410
<v Speaker 2>fundamental belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something like the belief in a </v>

496
00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:49.380
<v Speaker 2>God that's a unity rather than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plurality.</v>

497
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:54.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that young was very </v>

498
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.361
<v Speaker 2>insistent upon was that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between polytheism and </v>

499
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:04.140
<v Speaker 2>psychological confusion and monotheism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and psychological unification.</v>

500
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:09.350
<v Speaker 2>And I really liked that idea too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know that that what you're </v>

501
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.320
<v Speaker 2>trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you are a plurality,</v>

502
00:29:10.321 --> 00:29:15.321
<v Speaker 2>that that's one of the things the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysts were really good at </v>

503
00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:16.650
<v Speaker 2>figuring out that the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists haven't touched yet as far as</v>

504
00:29:16.651 --> 00:29:21.651
<v Speaker 2>I can tell they're way behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysts and that element of </v>

505
00:29:21.651 --> 00:29:24.321
<v Speaker 2>thinking is that you are composed of sub</v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities which all have their own </v>

506
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.660
<v Speaker 2>desires and their own viewpoint in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own thoughts and their own perceptions </v>

507
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>and they're in a war with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>

508
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.350
<v Speaker 2>maybe even a Darwinian war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been.</v>

509
00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:39.410
<v Speaker 2>It's been portrayed that way by certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientists and that that one of the</v>

510
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 2>goals of life is to</v>

511
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.190
<v Speaker 3>integrate all of that plurality into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchical ethical structure that has </v>

512
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:51.710
<v Speaker 3>some canonical ethic at the pinnacle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

513
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:56.820
<v Speaker 3>We've talked a little bit about that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not obvious what should be at the </v>

514
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.970
<v Speaker 3>pinnacle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can guess at it.</v>

515
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that which we admire.</v>

516
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.100
<v Speaker 3>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that that describes fair play </v>

517
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.301
<v Speaker 3>across a sequence of games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another good way of thinking </v>

518
00:30:09.301 --> 00:30:09.301
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

519
00:30:09.301 --> 00:30:11.800
<v Speaker 3>it's the heroic ideal that's another way</v>
<v Speaker 3>of thinking about it,</v>

520
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:14.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's combined with generosity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

521
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Speaker 3>because the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mythological hero goes out into the </v>

522
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Speaker 3>unknown and slays the dragon and gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gold,</v>

523
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.110
<v Speaker 3>but then comes back to the community and</v>
<v Speaker 3>distributes what's found.</v>

524
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:26.440
<v Speaker 3>And so it's courage plus generosity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

525
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:32.190
<v Speaker 3>and so all of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that interior struggling that </v>

526
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.121
<v Speaker 3>you're doing is an attempt to hang </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself against the world with </v>

527
00:30:36.121 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 3>challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly to hit everything together,</v>

528
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:41.260
<v Speaker 3>like you're beating on a piece of iron </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

529
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.400
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

530
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.140
<v Speaker 3>to cure it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

531
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.040
<v Speaker 3>so that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not an internal contradiction.</v>

532
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:53.040
<v Speaker 3>You're not massive competing God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that because it's just </v>

533
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.941
<v Speaker 3>too psychologically stressful and hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>on everyone else and impossible for them</v>

534
00:30:56.981 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 3>to get along with you if you're one </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

535
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:00.460
<v Speaker 3>one moment and another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another moment.</v>

536
00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 3>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

537
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:09.091
<v Speaker 3>Abraham insists that Isaac find a wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>from among people who are likely to </v>

538
00:31:09.281 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 3>carry off forward the monotheistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition.</v>

539
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not sure that the monotheistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition is actually indistinguishable,</v>

540
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 3>is actually distinguishable from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individualistic tradition.</v>

541
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 3>I think they might be the same thing at </v>
<v Speaker 3>different levels of analysis,</v>

542
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:28.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so because individual means and divided </v>

543
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 3>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

544
00:31:28.931 --> 00:31:33.931
<v Speaker 3>To be an individual means to be one </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and the other thing that mitigates</v>

545
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:39.541
<v Speaker 3>against the idea of life is happiness is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't obvious to me that it's </v>

546
00:31:39.541 --> 00:31:41.210
<v Speaker 3>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is what molds you and shapes you.</v>

547
00:31:41.211 --> 00:31:46.211
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something more like optimal </v>

548
00:31:46.211 --> 00:31:46.300
<v Speaker 3>challenge voluntarily undertaken at </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

549
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's echoed in the idea </v>

550
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 3>that everyone has a moral obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 3>raise their cross,</v>

551
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:57.120
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to accept the fact of their mortality </v>

552
00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.450
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that that's the case and I do </v>

553
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.231
<v Speaker 3>actually think that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>prerequisite to proper psychological </v>

554
00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:07.411
<v Speaker 3>development because if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to take your mortality on </v>

555
00:32:07.411 --> 00:32:12.391
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're kicking and fighting </v>

556
00:32:12.391 --> 00:32:12.970
<v Speaker 3>about it constantly and you have every </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason to don't get me wrong,</v>

557
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 3>then you can't act forthrightly in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

558
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be afraid and when </v>

559
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.911
<v Speaker 3>you're afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can't voluntarily take on a </v>

560
00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:27.061
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you can't take voluntarily </v>

561
00:32:27.061 --> 00:32:27.061
<v Speaker 3>take on a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can't develop.</v>

562
00:32:27.061 --> 00:32:30.961
<v Speaker 3>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the life seems to be something like if </v>

563
00:32:30.961 --> 00:32:35.011
<v Speaker 3>it's a proper life is a voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntary taking on of great challenges </v>

564
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.420
<v Speaker 3>and maybe that's better than happiness.</v>

565
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Like it's certainly more noble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

566
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:41.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not a word we use very much </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

567
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.470
<v Speaker 3>The idea of nobility because we're so </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with happiness.</v>

568
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.260
<v Speaker 3>But I think happiness is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it comes along,</v>

569
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:48.920
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

570
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:50.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful.</v>

571
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't take it lightly or for granted </v>

572
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.860
<v Speaker 3>because it's fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that that's what you should</v>

573
00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:01.320
<v Speaker 3>be for in some sense to seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

574
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.890
<v Speaker 3>if that's what life is for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe it shouldn't be.</v>

575
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.130
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's correct because that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>what life is,</v>

576
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.790
<v Speaker 3>but it also doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't obvious to me that that's what </v>

577
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:12.790
<v Speaker 3>life should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

578
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really loved someone like your </v>

579
00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:16.931
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

580
00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:17.120
<v Speaker 3>would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

581
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:19.490
<v Speaker 3>I hope he has a happy life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or would you say,</v>

582
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:25.420
<v Speaker 3>I hope he accomplishes great things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that that's better than </v>

583
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:25.420
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

584
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.750
<v Speaker 3>The accomplishing of great things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's admirable.</v>

585
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:34.780
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a happy person is a happy </v>

586
00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.941
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a noble person has an admirable </v>

587
00:33:36.941 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 3>person and and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's better at man,</v>

588
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.240
<v Speaker 3>and so maybe there are better things </v>
<v Speaker 3>than happiness and so you can't judge </v>

589
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.300
<v Speaker 3>being on the basis of the ratio of </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering to pleasure,</v>

590
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.390
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

591
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:52.810
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe we do that be comedians </v>

592
00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:52.810
<v Speaker 3>are happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

593
00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:57.251
<v Speaker 3>But everyone doesn't aspire to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian and you don't watch comedy all </v>

594
00:33:57.251 --> 00:33:58.160
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though you could laugh nonstop more</v>

595
00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:03.161
<v Speaker 3>or less if the comedians funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to get your teeth into </v>

596
00:34:03.161 --> 00:34:04.610
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also seems to me that this is one of</v>

597
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:07.010
<v Speaker 3>the reasons I liked existential </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy was that,</v>

598
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:13.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the existentialists believed it's sort </v>

599
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.550
<v Speaker 3>of an original sin idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believe that we came into the world</v>

600
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.400
<v Speaker 3>with an ethical burden already laid upon</v>
<v Speaker 3>us something,</v>

601
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that we had a felt sense that it was</v>

602
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:22.910
<v Speaker 3>necessary for us to justify our being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if we didn't do that,</v>

603
00:34:22.911 --> 00:34:26.930
<v Speaker 3>then we weren't authentic to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We weren't moving towards individuality.</v>

604
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 3>We weren't sustaining the community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We weren't living properly and that and </v>

605
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:36.011
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that idea was deeply embedded in people </v>

606
00:34:36.011 --> 00:34:38.771
<v Speaker 3>as part of their ordinary experience and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that also seems to me to be accurate and</v>

607
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've dealt with lots of people say in my</v>

608
00:34:41.751 --> 00:34:42.900
<v Speaker 3>clinical practice and</v>

609
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.230
<v Speaker 3>they don't really cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

610
00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.960
<v Speaker 3>they will come and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I wasn't so unhappy,</v>

611
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:54.530
<v Speaker 3>but they don't usually come and say I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wish I was happier and those things </v>

612
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.620
<v Speaker 3>aren't the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when,</v>

613
00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:00.640
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talk to people who are having </v>

614
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:00.640
<v Speaker 3>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

615
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.160
<v Speaker 3>they want to straighten things out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to do them right.</v>

616
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

617
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.230
<v Speaker 3>and that that's the primary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their primary goal.</v>

618
00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:07.410
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

619
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:22.800
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham sends his eldest servant off to </v>

620
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.930
<v Speaker 3>his place that God has granted him to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find a wife.</v>

621
00:35:25.931 --> 00:35:27.930
<v Speaker 3>And interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

622
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:33.420
<v Speaker 3>the borders of the promised land under </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite similar to the current borders of </v>

623
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

624
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.500
<v Speaker 3>these are estimates right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Based on the biblical and didn't mean </v>

625
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.381
<v Speaker 3>that's not a fluke obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's interesting to see the </v>

626
00:35:42.381 --> 00:35:46.260
<v Speaker 3>concordance between these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories in the present day world.</v>

627
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.660
<v Speaker 3>So I thought that was very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it shows once again that the past,</v>

628
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.090
<v Speaker 3>you think the past is the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

629
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:57.150
<v Speaker 3>it's still here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's embedded in the present,</v>

630
00:35:57.151 --> 00:36:02.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the future in somehow in some </v>

631
00:36:02.151 --> 00:36:02.550
<v Speaker 3>ways is folded up inside the president </v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting to unfold.</v>

632
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.370
<v Speaker 3>The past is all folded up inside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>present too.</v>

633
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.870
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the servant goes to</v>

634
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.780
<v Speaker 3>the land that he's been charged to go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>an end.</v>

635
00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:25.380
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

636
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.920
<v Speaker 3>he's trying to figure out how in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world am I going to find a good wife for</v>

637
00:36:28.921 --> 00:36:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Isaac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know any of these people.</v>

638
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:34.470
<v Speaker 3>And so he has this little dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's presented in the form of a prayer</v>

639
00:36:34.471 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

640
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.830
<v Speaker 3>and he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

641
00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the place where you water,</v>

642
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.210
<v Speaker 3>where people get water and water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the animals.</v>

643
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:47.211
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's a place where everyone </v>

644
00:36:47.211 --> 00:36:47.211
<v Speaker 3>gathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a good place to find someone.</v>

645
00:36:47.211 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

646
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.960
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a place of fun and lightness </v>

647
00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.130
<v Speaker 3>and relaxation and impulsivity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a place of,</v>

648
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.770
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of life sustaining work.</v>

649
00:36:55.771 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 3>And then he thinks something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

650
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:02.610
<v Speaker 3>what would a decent girl do at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>watering place?</v>

651
00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 3>And he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

652
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:08.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe she would offer a stranger some </v>
<v Speaker 3>water and also offer to water the camels</v>

653
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:16.970
<v Speaker 3>because that would be brave to approach </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stranger and then generous and then </v>

654
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.980
<v Speaker 3>indicative of the willingness to make an</v>
<v Speaker 3>effort.</v>

655
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.450
<v Speaker 3>And when you know that a camel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he took 10 camels.</v>

656
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.180
<v Speaker 3>It was quite a few camels anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just one.</v>

657
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.050
<v Speaker 3>And that accountable can drink 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>gallons of water.</v>

658
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 3>And Rebecca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was drawing water from the wet turns</v>

659
00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:36.570
<v Speaker 3>out to be Rebecca is drawing water from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the well,</v>

660
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 3>which is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

661
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.300
<v Speaker 3>Because water's heavy and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lift it up and it's 10 camels.</v>

662
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:44.520
<v Speaker 3>And so that's like 200 gallons of water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

663
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has to put herself out a fair bit in</v>

664
00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:51.180
<v Speaker 3>order to make this stranger happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what happens.</v>

665
00:37:51.181 --> 00:37:56.181
<v Speaker 3>And then the service has brought along </v>
<v Speaker 3>gifts and that sort of thing.</v>

666
00:37:57.731 --> 00:38:00.880
<v Speaker 3>And any ways to make a long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

667
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:06.300
<v Speaker 3>Rebecca agrees to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to come back with the servant and marry </v>

668
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Isaac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

669
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:16.920
<v Speaker 3>then she has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she gets pregnant and she has twins and </v>

670
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.610
<v Speaker 3>this is an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The twins fight inside her,</v>

671
00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.580
<v Speaker 3>she can tell that they're not getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>along.</v>

672
00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.200
<v Speaker 3>And this is an echo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

673
00:38:23.201 --> 00:38:28.201
<v Speaker 3>It's an echo of Cain and Abel and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological motif that the unions have </v>

674
00:38:28.451 --> 00:38:30.850
<v Speaker 3>called the hostile brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hostile brothers,</v>

675
00:38:30.851 --> 00:38:34.150
<v Speaker 3>and you see them all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Batman and the joker or hostile brothers</v>

676
00:38:34.151 --> 00:38:38.710
<v Speaker 3>and thor and or hostile brothers and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an unbelievably common motif.</v>

677
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:44.400
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate hostile brothers or Christ </v>

678
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:44.400
<v Speaker 3>and Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the,</v>

679
00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.380
<v Speaker 3>that's the archetipal representation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hostile brothers,</v>

680
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ultimate good and the ultimate evil.</v>

681
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.590
<v Speaker 3>And so and so it's an echo of the Cain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Abel Story.</v>

682
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Although it's a little more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say from a literary point of </v>

683
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 3>view because it isn't obvious which of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these brothers,</v>

684
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:06.040
<v Speaker 3>his cane and which of them is able,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have parts of both in each of them.</v>

685
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:11.430
<v Speaker 3>So Esau,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's turns out to be one of the </v>

686
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.630
<v Speaker 3>brothers and Jacob who turns out to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other oath,</v>

687
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.980
<v Speaker 3>have they're admirable qualities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their fault.</v>

688
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Esau comes is born first,</v>

689
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:24.330
<v Speaker 3>but Jacob hasn't by the heel and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a fight within the womb to see</v>

690
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:30.601
<v Speaker 3>who would emerge first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's relevant because the </v>

691
00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:33.960
<v Speaker 3>firstborn had a special status.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While it has a special status in many </v>

692
00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.680
<v Speaker 3>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially agricultural communities,</v>

693
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 3>and there's a reason these people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>more hurts people.</v>

694
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:44.041
<v Speaker 3>But if you divide your property equally </v>
<v Speaker 3>among all your children that had like </v>

695
00:39:44.041 --> 00:39:47.641
<v Speaker 3>three generations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has one goat and everybody </v>

696
00:39:47.641 --> 00:39:47.641
<v Speaker 3>starves to death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

697
00:39:47.641 --> 00:39:50.610
<v Speaker 3>or the same thing happens with land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the ways that,</v>

698
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:55.670
<v Speaker 3>that traditional communities solve that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is they just give almost everything to </v>

699
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.010
<v Speaker 3>the first board and then the everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else knows,</v>

700
00:39:57.011 --> 00:40:00.310
<v Speaker 3>well you go out and do whatever you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's kind of arbitrary and unfair,</v>

701
00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:05.311
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it's predictably arbitrary and </v>

702
00:40:05.311 --> 00:40:07.210
<v Speaker 3>unfair instead of doom over four </v>
<v Speaker 3>generations,</v>

703
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:12.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it actually mattered to be the first </v>

704
00:40:12.211 --> 00:40:12.920
<v Speaker 3>born and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and God generally favors the first born.</v>

705
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:14.650
<v Speaker 3>And then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

706
00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:18.920
<v Speaker 3>what is it about being born first that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so relevant apart from the,</v>

707
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.860
<v Speaker 3>the cultural practice of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of aboard.</v>

708
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Generous inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say,</v>

709
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:27.040
<v Speaker 3>well the first born is something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the model for the leader of the family,</v>

710
00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:29.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the first born child should be,</v>

711
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:34.710
<v Speaker 3>if there's a number of siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a should take care of the siblings at </v>

712
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:38.671
<v Speaker 3>least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also should be a role model for </v>

713
00:40:38.671 --> 00:40:41.341
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a natural position of </v>

714
00:40:41.341 --> 00:40:41.341
<v Speaker 3>leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a cycle,</v>

715
00:40:41.341 --> 00:40:45.260
<v Speaker 3>there's a cycle psychology ization of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the first board in these </v>

716
00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.931
<v Speaker 3>stories because God often passes over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the firstborn in favor of a later born </v>

717
00:40:49.031 --> 00:40:50.400
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

718
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.250
<v Speaker 3>he seems to do that on the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral character essentially.</v>

719
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:56.430
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

720
00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.440
<v Speaker 3>there's a natural proclivity towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>leadership that's just a biological fact</v>

721
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:03.730
<v Speaker 3>that would be associated with being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>first born.</v>

722
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:09.030
<v Speaker 3>But there's an element of </v>
<v Speaker 3>characterological development that </v>

723
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.250
<v Speaker 3>transcends that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that you,</v>

724
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.750
<v Speaker 3>it's more important to be spiritually a </v>
<v Speaker 3>firstborn,</v>

725
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.080
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than to be biologically a first born.</v>

726
00:41:14.081 --> 00:41:19.081
<v Speaker 3>And God recognizes that continually in </v>
<v Speaker 3>these stories and inverts the natural </v>

727
00:41:19.421 --> 00:41:21.640
<v Speaker 3>order and favors a later board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who's,</v>

728
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:25.840
<v Speaker 3>who's done more work with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 3>characterological development.</v>

729
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:27.670
<v Speaker 3>And that's also interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

730
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:33.210
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to lots of business people </v>
<v Speaker 3>about leadership and there's a </v>

731
00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 3>literature on leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a good literature.</v>

732
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:36.060
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

733
00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:41.070
<v Speaker 3>partly because it's not that easy to </v>
<v Speaker 3>define leadership and partly because </v>

734
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:41.070
<v Speaker 3>there are different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

735
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.770
<v Speaker 3>people have different temperaments and </v>
<v Speaker 3>different temperaments can be leaders.</v>

736
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.800
<v Speaker 3>They just do it in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's something in common about </v>

737
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.910
<v Speaker 3>being a leader though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say one is that if you're an</v>

738
00:41:51.911 --> 00:41:54.050
<v Speaker 3>actual leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually know where you're going,</v>

739
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

740
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Because what are you going to do lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in circles.</v>

741
00:41:57.321 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like maybe they'll follow you but </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not a leader,</v>

742
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:04.301
<v Speaker 3>you're just a charlotte.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to know where you're </v>

743
00:42:04.301 --> 00:42:05.750
<v Speaker 3>going and then you have to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate that and then people have to</v>

744
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:10.751
<v Speaker 3>trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you actually have to be honest </v>

745
00:42:10.751 --> 00:42:10.751
<v Speaker 3>because people aren't that stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least not for a long period of time.</v>

746
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.360
<v Speaker 3>And then where are you going has to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>some value because otherwise why would </v>

747
00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.170
<v Speaker 3>anyone want to go along with you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

748
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.580
<v Speaker 3>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

749
00:42:19.581 --> 00:42:24.581
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the attributes that make you a </v>

750
00:42:24.581 --> 00:42:24.581
<v Speaker 3>leader?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say,</v>

751
00:42:24.581 --> 00:42:24.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're characterological fundamentally,</v>

752
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 3>and this is not naive optimism or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

753
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.480
<v Speaker 3>or casual moralizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has nothing to do with that.</v>

754
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know,</v>

755
00:42:33.561 --> 00:42:38.561
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that conscientious notice that the </v>

756
00:42:38.561 --> 00:42:40.390
<v Speaker 3>personality trait is a good predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm success in,</v>

757
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:43.010
<v Speaker 3>in most occupations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all but most,</v>

758
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.130
<v Speaker 3>and that one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with conscientiousness is the</v>

759
00:42:46.131 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 3>people keep their word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trustworthy.</v>

760
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 3>And that's certainly one element of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>leader,</v>

761
00:42:50.391 --> 00:42:52.430
<v Speaker 3>especially across any reasonable amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>

762
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.580
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to trust the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can even be harsh,</v>

763
00:42:55.581 --> 00:43:00.581
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter because you can see </v>

764
00:43:00.581 --> 00:43:02.081
<v Speaker 3>harsh leaders and kind leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as long as they do what they say </v>

765
00:43:02.081 --> 00:43:05.591
<v Speaker 3>they will do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then then you can follow them and you </v>

766
00:43:05.591 --> 00:43:06.440
<v Speaker 3>know that the future payoff is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

767
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.570
<v Speaker 3>is secure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

768
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.890
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>logical development is more important to</v>

769
00:43:12.891 --> 00:43:16.190
<v Speaker 3>leadership than primogenitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the right word,</v>

770
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.760
<v Speaker 3>a primal genesis anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a first born,</v>

771
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:25.690
<v Speaker 3>that's a very crucial psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>realization that it's characterological </v>

772
00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 3>development that makes you favored of </v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

773
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:32.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I do think we've forgotten this in </v>

774
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.651
<v Speaker 3>many ways because there isn't a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>emphasis in our education system on </v>

775
00:43:35.651 --> 00:43:37.640
<v Speaker 3>characterological development and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

776
00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:40.970
<v Speaker 3>very surprising to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe it's partly because in our</v>

777
00:43:40.971 --> 00:43:45.971
<v Speaker 3>fractured society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't agree on what constitutes a </v>

778
00:43:45.971 --> 00:43:49.691
<v Speaker 3>reasonable characterological goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we just throw up our hands and don't </v>

779
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.760
<v Speaker 3>educate our kids to any degree at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in schools about what an </v>

780
00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.140
<v Speaker 3>admirable person is like or even let </v>
<v Speaker 3>them know that,</v>

781
00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you should actually try to be one.</v>

782
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:04.211
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's actually the most important </v>

783
00:44:04.211 --> 00:44:04.211
<v Speaker 3>possible thing that you could learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

784
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.790
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I also think,</v>

785
00:44:11.791 --> 00:44:16.791
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is laid out very </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoroughly in the biblical stories as </v>

786
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:20.571
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if there are enough people who are </v>

787
00:44:20.571 --> 00:44:22.220
<v Speaker 3>admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then things work and if there aren't,</v>

788
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.860
<v Speaker 3>then things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things are terrible.</v>

789
00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:31.130
<v Speaker 3>You get wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember when Abraham is bargaining </v>

790
00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:32.880
<v Speaker 3>with God with regards to Sodom and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gomorrah,</v>

791
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.460
<v Speaker 3>he asked God to save the city if there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 40 admirable people,</v>

792
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Respectable,</v>

793
00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.130
<v Speaker 3>but let's say admirable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

794
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say good because good is</v>

795
00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:46.140
<v Speaker 3>being corrupted in some sense by casual </v>
<v Speaker 3>usage.</v>

796
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean admirable noble people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

797
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I think Abraham bargains God down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 10.</v>

798
00:44:52.861 --> 00:44:57.861
<v Speaker 3>If there's 10 of them in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the city won't be destroyed and that </v>

799
00:44:57.861 --> 00:45:01.291
<v Speaker 3>that's not very many in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's an interesting idea there </v>

800
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:04.371
<v Speaker 3>which is that there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there doesn't have to be that many </v>

801
00:45:04.371 --> 00:45:04.530
<v Speaker 3>people in a group who have their act </v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

802
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:09.740
<v Speaker 3>but zero is the wrong number and if it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero then then we're seriously in </v>

803
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:11.640
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

804
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.290
<v Speaker 3>And I think that goes along with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the Preto principle in economics</v>

805
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:21.291
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that it's a small minority of </v>

806
00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:21.291
<v Speaker 3>people who do most of the productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>work in any given domain,</v>

807
00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:26.240
<v Speaker 3>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a small number of properly behaving </v>

808
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.530
<v Speaker 3>people might have enough of an impact to</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep everything moving.</v>

809
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:30.540
<v Speaker 3>And that might also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might actually be true,</v>

810
00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:35.541
<v Speaker 3>but it can't fall below some crucial </v>
<v Speaker 3>level and I do think that we're in some </v>

811
00:45:35.541 --> 00:45:39.771
<v Speaker 3>danger of allowing it to fall below some</v>
<v Speaker 3>crucial level because our society seems </v>

812
00:45:39.771 --> 00:45:44.061
<v Speaker 3>to be at war in some ways against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the individual and individual </v>

813
00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:48.240
<v Speaker 3>character per se.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's absolutely.</v>

814
00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.900
<v Speaker 3>I think that's absolutely catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's part of the reason that I'm </v>

815
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 3>doing these biblical lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

816
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:59.990
<v Speaker 3>because I think that I've known for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time that the moral presuppositions</v>

817
00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:04.500
<v Speaker 3>of a culture are instantiated in its </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

818
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.440
<v Speaker 3>They're not instantiated and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>explicit philosophy.</v>

819
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:11.100
<v Speaker 3>There might be a layer of explicit </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy and of course there is in the</v>

820
00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:16.101
<v Speaker 3>west and a layer of explicit law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but underneath that there are stories </v>

821
00:46:16.101 --> 00:46:18.570
<v Speaker 3>and there isn't anything under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories except maybe behavior,</v>

822
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's so implicit.</v>

823
00:46:20.131 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even actually count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a cognitive operation.</v>

824
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:29.210
<v Speaker 3>And so this is the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the stories that are </v>

825
00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.590
<v Speaker 3>underneath our culture and so there </v>
<v Speaker 3>better be something to them.</v>

826
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.590
<v Speaker 3>That's what we hope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And but more importantly,</v>

827
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:39.950
<v Speaker 3>maybe we shouldn't toss them away </v>
<v Speaker 3>without knowing what they mean because </v>

828
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:44.030
<v Speaker 3>if we toss them away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we are throwing everything that we </v>

829
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.050
<v Speaker 3>depend on a way as far as I can tell and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll we will pay for it.</v>

830
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.360
<v Speaker 3>We'll pay for it individually because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll be weak,</v>

831
00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:53.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you're not firm in your </v>

832
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.000
<v Speaker 3>convictions than someone else who's from</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their convictions,</v>

833
00:46:54.001 --> 00:46:56.160
<v Speaker 3>can your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their puppet like instantly.</v>

834
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.260
<v Speaker 3>And then you're also the puppet of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own doubts,</v>

835
00:46:58.261 --> 00:47:00.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because unless you have convictions,</v>

836
00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 3>you're going to generate doubts like mad</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everyone does.</v>

837
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.680
<v Speaker 3>And then the doubts when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll be paralyzed because there'll</v>

838
00:47:07.681 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

839
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:11.400
<v Speaker 3>50 percent of you moving forward in 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of you frozen,</v>

840
00:47:11.401 --> 00:47:15.120
<v Speaker 3>stiff and that'll be enough just to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lodge you in place.</v>

841
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.980
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

842
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:22.440
<v Speaker 3>so there's a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creation of the idea of leadership,</v>

843
00:47:22.441 --> 00:47:27.441
<v Speaker 3>which is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's associated with the idea </v>

844
00:47:27.441 --> 00:47:29.901
<v Speaker 3>of character or logical development and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's associated with the idea of </v>

845
00:47:29.901 --> 00:47:29.901
<v Speaker 3>struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not happiness.</v>

846
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 3>And it's also associated with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>abrahamic idea,</v>

847
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:37.651
<v Speaker 3>which I really liked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was something that's been very </v>

848
00:47:37.651 --> 00:47:39.640
<v Speaker 3>useful to me as a consequence of doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>these lectures because remember,</v>

849
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:41.380
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning of the abrahamic </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>

850
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Abraham's like a stay at home guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

851
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:45.550
<v Speaker 3>He's like the guy who's 40 years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in his,</v>

852
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.080
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his mother's basement,</v>

853
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.470
<v Speaker 3>and God says like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>

854
00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.620
<v Speaker 3>get the hell out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

855
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:51.430
<v Speaker 3>get out in the world where you belong.</v>

856
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Go do something difficult because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing isn't acceptable.</v>

857
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.060
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing he does is go somewhere,</v>

858
00:47:58.061 --> 00:48:00.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a terrible famine and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes somewhere.</v>

859
00:48:00.011 --> 00:48:01.180
<v Speaker 3>There's a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

860
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:02.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

861
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:07.320
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He follows God's call and it's not like </v>

862
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.380
<v Speaker 3>sweetness and light and paradise </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

863
00:48:08.381 --> 00:48:09.500
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

864
00:48:09.501 --> 00:48:12.280
<v Speaker 3>it's instantaneous combat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

865
00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:15.070
<v Speaker 3>of the most difficult kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

866
00:48:15.071 --> 00:48:20.071
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Abraham does in fact follow that </v>

867
00:48:20.071 --> 00:48:20.650
<v Speaker 3>impulse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

868
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.720
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

869
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:27.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another thing that made me a </v>

870
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:28.720
<v Speaker 3>really an advocate of psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking it.</v>

871
00:48:28.721 --> 00:48:33.721
<v Speaker 3>It was the sort of thing that started to</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrify me about what the human psyche </v>

872
00:48:33.721 --> 00:48:37.561
<v Speaker 3>was actually like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started to understand that not only </v>

873
00:48:37.561 --> 00:48:39.991
<v Speaker 3>were we like an amalgam of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of relatively autonomous </v>

874
00:48:39.991 --> 00:48:44.221
<v Speaker 3>subpersonalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of which had the possibility of </v>

875
00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:47.431
<v Speaker 3>gaining control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that we're also victim,</v>

876
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:52.890
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or beneficiary of impulses that were </v>

877
00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 3>beyond our conscious formulation or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

878
00:48:55.511 --> 00:48:58.090
<v Speaker 3>or understanding or capacity to resist.</v>

879
00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.520
<v Speaker 3>So here's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a funny story.</v>

880
00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:05.521
<v Speaker 3>So I was talking to one of my patron </v>
<v Speaker 3>people online this week and he said he's</v>

881
00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:11.161
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a committed atheist and that's </v>

882
00:49:11.161 --> 00:49:11.161
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

883
00:49:11.161 --> 00:49:13.860
<v Speaker 3>lots of atheists are very honest people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're atheist because they don't </v>

884
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:17.071
<v Speaker 3>know how to reconcile what they know </v>
<v Speaker 3>with traditional claims,</v>

885
00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:22.471
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're not willing to just mangled </v>

886
00:49:22.471 --> 00:49:22.471
<v Speaker 3>them together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

887
00:49:22.471 --> 00:49:23.800
<v Speaker 3>and there might be cynicism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all data associated with it as well.</v>

888
00:49:23.801 --> 00:49:28.801
<v Speaker 3>But he said he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he was entranced by these </v>

889
00:49:28.801 --> 00:49:28.801
<v Speaker 3>biblical lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

890
00:49:28.801 --> 00:49:30.190
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

891
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:35.191
<v Speaker 3>if someone would have told him a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago that he was going to like be </v>

892
00:49:35.191 --> 00:49:35.350
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with a sequence of biblical </v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures,</v>

893
00:49:35.351 --> 00:49:37.120
<v Speaker 3>he would have told them that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>mad.</v>

894
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:42.660
<v Speaker 3>And so we had a bit of a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that because this is an </v>

895
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:42.660
<v Speaker 3>interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

896
00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:43.720
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he mentioned this,</v>

897
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:47.170
<v Speaker 3>he said it was something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't choose your interests.</v>

898
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:52.170
<v Speaker 3>They choose you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's really worth thinking about </v>

899
00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:52.170
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

900
00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:55.861
<v Speaker 3>because you know it's really hard to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in something you're not </v>

901
00:49:55.861 --> 00:49:59.191
<v Speaker 3>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you know there's a good reason </v>

902
00:49:59.191 --> 00:49:59.191
<v Speaker 3>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're studying for an exam,</v>

903
00:49:59.191 --> 00:50:03.210
<v Speaker 3>you find the material boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know anything will be more </v>

904
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:03.970
<v Speaker 3>interesting than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than this studying.</v>

905
00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:06.100
<v Speaker 3>Even though you know that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to do.</v>

906
00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:09.850
<v Speaker 3>You can't voluntarily grab yourself by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the scruff of the neck,</v>

907
00:50:09.851 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shake yourself and say,</v>

908
00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 3>sit down and concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your mind will just go everywhere.</v>

909
00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.630
<v Speaker 3>But then if you're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

910
00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.330
<v Speaker 3>and even if it's something you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>be interested in,</v>

911
00:50:19.331 --> 00:50:24.331
<v Speaker 3>because that happens all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's like you're a laser focused </v>

912
00:50:24.331 --> 00:50:24.430
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can pay attention forever,</v>

913
00:50:24.431 --> 00:50:26.860
<v Speaker 3>you can work until you're exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't even notice it.</v>

914
00:50:26.861 --> 00:50:28.670
<v Speaker 3>Then you remember everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

915
00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:31.880
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't control your interest,</v>

916
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 3>what does?</v>

917
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:37.220
<v Speaker 3>And now I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think about that for a very long</v>

918
00:50:37.221 --> 00:50:42.221
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you talked about the spirit </v>

919
00:50:42.221 --> 00:50:42.221
<v Speaker 3>Mercurius,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

920
00:50:42.221 --> 00:50:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Mercury's the wing messenger of the gods</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

921
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.920
<v Speaker 3>and here's how he conceptualized it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychologically,</v>

922
00:50:45.921 --> 00:50:50.921
<v Speaker 3>he thought this is what the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who thought about mercury as the </v>

923
00:50:50.921 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 3>winged messenger of the gods were trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to state psychologically,</v>

924
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

925
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:59.050
<v Speaker 3>your interest flits around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's something that </v>

926
00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:00.170
<v Speaker 3>captures it and that moves your interest</v>
<v Speaker 3>from place to place.</v>

927
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:01.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you walk into a bookstore,</v>

928
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:03.350
<v Speaker 3>you'll get interested in a particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

929
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:07.320
<v Speaker 3>It's as if the book grips you because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know why you're interested in.</v>

930
00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:12.400
<v Speaker 3>You might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but often you don't know why you're </v>

931
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:12.400
<v Speaker 3>interested in that book and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>your interest is flitting around.</v>

932
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.230
<v Speaker 3>And so that's mercury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that makes your interest flick</v>

933
00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:20.260
<v Speaker 3>flick around his mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the winged messenger of the gods and </v>

934
00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:24.160
<v Speaker 3>mercury is the messenger of the gods </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's the things behind the </v>

935
00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.671
<v Speaker 3>scenes psychologically that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulating your attention and for </v>

936
00:51:27.671 --> 00:51:29.150
<v Speaker 3>young those were equivalent in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense to the last gods.</v>

937
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:34.510
<v Speaker 3>And so for young your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your interest was being manipulated </v>

938
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:39.250
<v Speaker 3>behind the scenes by unseen forces that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were associated with your character or </v>

939
00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:41.210
<v Speaker 3>logical development across time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the manifestation of the self.</v>

940
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:45.890
<v Speaker 3>So the self is this the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the potential you let's say,</v>

941
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:51.280
<v Speaker 3>and the way it operates in the present </v>
<v Speaker 3>is by gripping your interest in </v>

942
00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.431
<v Speaker 3>directing it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the instinct of self </v>

943
00:51:54.431 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 3>realization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a mind boggling idea,</v>

944
00:51:55.431 --> 00:51:56.000
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>

945
00:51:56.001 --> 00:51:57.920
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's correct.</v>

946
00:51:57.921 --> 00:52:02.921
<v Speaker 3>I can't see how it can't be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean I understand it </v>

947
00:52:02.921 --> 00:52:05.801
<v Speaker 3>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it certainly seems </v>

948
00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:07.751
<v Speaker 3>phenomenologically correct and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>the potential that you are has to </v>

949
00:52:07.751 --> 00:52:11.360
<v Speaker 3>manifest itself somehow in the here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now it has to.</v>

950
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.390
<v Speaker 3>And what better way than by directing </v>
<v Speaker 3>your attention,</v>

951
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:19.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it seems like this might be </v>

952
00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.101
<v Speaker 3>useful for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe you get attracted to this </v>

953
00:52:21.101 --> 00:52:21.101
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

954
00:52:21.101 --> 00:52:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you admire this person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens with kids a lot.</v>

955
00:52:21.561 --> 00:52:26.561
<v Speaker 3>They'll admire someone and then copy </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and you can see that that's </v>

956
00:52:26.561 --> 00:52:27.200
<v Speaker 3>obviously part of their developmental </v>
<v Speaker 3>progression,</v>

957
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a form of hero worship,</v>

958
00:52:29.061 --> 00:52:34.061
<v Speaker 3>but kids are very imitative and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear a worship at the drop of a hat and </v>

959
00:52:34.061 --> 00:52:37.961
<v Speaker 3>so they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're entranced by the next stage of </v>

960
00:52:37.961 --> 00:52:42.731
<v Speaker 3>development.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they see someone who embodies </v>

961
00:52:42.731 --> 00:52:44.861
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's in the zone of </v>

962
00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:46.691
<v Speaker 3>proximal development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's some something they could achieve </v>

963
00:52:46.691 --> 00:52:48.440
<v Speaker 3>stretching a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They find someone who embodies that next</v>

964
00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:53.441
<v Speaker 3>stage of development and then they start</v>
<v Speaker 3>to imitate them and act like them while </v>

965
00:52:53.441 --> 00:52:55.010
<v Speaker 3>we're adults are no different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're no different.</v>

966
00:52:55.011 --> 00:53:00.011
<v Speaker 3>We're just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do it at a perhaps more abstract and </v>

967
00:53:00.011 --> 00:53:00.620
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>

968
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:05.680
<v Speaker 3>so Jacob and Esau are are hostile </v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers.</v>

969
00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:10.900
<v Speaker 3>They're like Cain and Abel except the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mixture of Cain and Abel and they're </v>

970
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:10.900
<v Speaker 3>very different.</v>

971
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Esau was red and covered with hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a hunter and a man of the field.</v>

972
00:53:13.911 --> 00:53:15.770
<v Speaker 3>So he's like your basic jock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

973
00:53:15.771 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 3>He's extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's outgoing,</v>

974
00:53:17.211 --> 00:53:20.570
<v Speaker 3>he's really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like extraordinarily masculine.</v>

975
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.510
<v Speaker 3>He haunts and he's a real favorite of </v>
<v Speaker 3>his father.</v>

976
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:24.760
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

977
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:29.260
<v Speaker 3>and Jacob isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a dweller intense and um,</v>

978
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

979
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

980
00:53:31.801 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it says Isaac loved Esau,</v>

981
00:53:35.071 --> 00:53:37.740
<v Speaker 3>but Rebecca loved Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's a problem,</v>

982
00:53:37.741 --> 00:53:39.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big problem.</v>

983
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:40.860
<v Speaker 3>And that there's a freudian element to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

984
00:53:40.861 --> 00:53:44.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like this family is now divided </v>
<v Speaker 3>because one child is the favorite of the</v>

985
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:48.810
<v Speaker 3>mother and that's Jacob and one child is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the favorite of the father.</v>

986
00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:53.811
<v Speaker 3>And so Jacob is kind of a mother's boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess to use an arc rather archaic </v>

987
00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:58.821
<v Speaker 3>phrase and certainly not as admirable </v>
<v Speaker 3>from his father's perspective as Esau </v>

988
00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:02.210
<v Speaker 3>who was a tough guy who goes out with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bow and Arrow and like,</v>

989
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:07.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanders around in the plains and brings </v>

990
00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:07.610
<v Speaker 3>animals home.</v>

991
00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:07.980
<v Speaker 3>And he's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a tough guy.</v>

992
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.110
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

993
00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:15.170
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's this discord in the family </v>

994
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:16.560
<v Speaker 3>because one parent prefers one child and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other parent prefers the other.</v>

995
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:21.740
<v Speaker 3>And it's obvious from the story that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents do not communicate about this </v>

996
00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.750
<v Speaker 3>because they really take sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a split in the family and</v>

997
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:29.780
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think very realistic because one of </v>

998
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:29.780
<v Speaker 3>the things that you do learn if you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a family,</v>

999
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.340
<v Speaker 3>and of course most of you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you also think about families,</v>

1000
00:54:32.341 --> 00:54:37.341
<v Speaker 3>is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's deep divisions within families </v>

1001
00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:41.121
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very frequently that no one will ever </v>

1002
00:54:41.121 --> 00:54:43.251
<v Speaker 3>talk about and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even think about often because it's </v>

1003
00:54:43.251 --> 00:54:43.790
<v Speaker 3>too painful to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1004
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Freud himself said Freud was clearly his</v>
<v Speaker 3>mother's favorite and the family </v>

1005
00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:53.181
<v Speaker 3>sacrificed a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including some of the potential </v>

1006
00:54:53.181 --> 00:54:56.241
<v Speaker 3>ambitions of the other children in order</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a </v>

1007
00:54:56.241 --> 00:54:56.241
<v Speaker 3>pedestal.</v>

1008
00:54:56.241 --> 00:54:57.210
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and advanced is education.</v>

1009
00:54:57.211 --> 00:54:58.230
<v Speaker 3>And it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1010
00:54:58.231 --> 00:54:58.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1011
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he turned into a great man,</v>

1012
00:55:00.271 --> 00:55:05.271
<v Speaker 3>but there was a cost to his siblings and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freud himself said that there was </v>

1013
00:55:05.271 --> 00:55:08.901
<v Speaker 3>something about being the favorite of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mother that gave a person additional</v>

1014
00:55:09.931 --> 00:55:12.690
<v Speaker 3>confidence throughout their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1015
00:55:12.691 --> 00:55:14.850
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something to be said about that.</v>

1016
00:55:14.851 --> 00:55:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Even someone like Eric Erickson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1017
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.330
<v Speaker 3>he noted that he was very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>child development,</v>

1018
00:55:19.331 --> 00:55:22.080
<v Speaker 3>that that first bonding with the mother </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the,</v>

1019
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 3>was the place where trust was </v>
<v Speaker 3>established,</v>

1020
00:55:24.511 --> 00:55:29.511
<v Speaker 3>maybe trust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in the goodness of existence was </v>

1021
00:55:29.511 --> 00:55:29.511
<v Speaker 3>established.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so anyways,</v>

1022
00:55:29.511 --> 00:55:33.711
<v Speaker 3>Jacob is Rachel's favorite and a Isa was</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isaac's favorite.</v>

1023
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Now Esau being extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1024
00:55:43.291 --> 00:55:45.990
<v Speaker 3>is also a bit impulsive and maybe he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1025
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.780
<v Speaker 3>He's a man of action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a forward thinker,</v>

1026
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.450
<v Speaker 3>but he's also doing hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1027
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes out and he's hunting and he's </v>

1028
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.311
<v Speaker 3>worn out and he comes home and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>faint with hunger and Jacob is at home.</v>

1029
00:55:59.821 --> 00:56:03.370
<v Speaker 3>Cooking is boiling up lentils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>red lentils and um,</v>

1030
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Esau comes in from the Honda at east,</v>

1031
00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:10.470
<v Speaker 3>like half starved to death and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there and the aroma of these red</v>

1032
00:56:10.471 --> 00:56:14.250
<v Speaker 3>lentils reaches them and he's exhausted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1033
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he tells Jacob that he wants some of</v>

1034
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:24.171
<v Speaker 3>this stew and Jacob who's being a pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the neck,</v>

1035
00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:27.640
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally have basically says no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1036
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:31.600
<v Speaker 3>there's a teasing thing going on here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and won't give them any.</v>

1037
00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:32.100
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1038
00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:37.310
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to imagine this because it's </v>

1039
00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:40.051
<v Speaker 3>not laid out explicitly in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some dispute about whether </v>

1040
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.510
<v Speaker 3>Esau gets to have lunch and Jacob </v>
<v Speaker 3>finally says,</v>

1041
00:56:43.511 --> 00:56:44.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you some,</v>

1042
00:56:44.231 --> 00:56:49.231
<v Speaker 3>but you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to give me your birthright and </v>

1043
00:56:49.231 --> 00:56:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Esau,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think he must say something like,</v>

1044
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.280
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hell with it,</v>

1045
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.460
<v Speaker 3>take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1046
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 3>you son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it.</v>

1047
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Just give me some damn stew at something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1048
00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.450
<v Speaker 3>So that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1049
00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:04.180
<v Speaker 3>with these archaic people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once he made a statement like that,</v>

1050
00:57:04.181 --> 00:57:05.050
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were done.</v>

1051
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:07.950
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm.</v>

1052
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Esau sells his birthright and this turns</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to be incredibly significant.</v>

1053
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:17.530
<v Speaker 3>Benson who wrote Biblical commentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1054
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bit of a twist to it.</v>

1055
00:57:19.931 --> 00:57:23.650
<v Speaker 3>So Esau eats the red lentils and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>from then on,</v>

1056
00:57:23.651 --> 00:57:27.640
<v Speaker 3>his name is red and you've got to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>your imagination a bit.</v>

1057
00:57:27.641 --> 00:57:29.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are making fun of him,</v>

1058
00:57:29.921 --> 00:57:31.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're calling them red.</v>

1059
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's already read because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>established that,</v>

1060
00:57:34.091 --> 00:57:35.920
<v Speaker 3>but no one was calling them read before </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1061
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:38.700
<v Speaker 3>And so for the rest of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1062
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:41.230
<v Speaker 3>every time he goes out amongst his </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends and family,</v>

1063
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:43.720
<v Speaker 3>they call them red and sort of snicker </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's the,</v>

1064
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:48.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half famished idiot who sold his </v>

1065
00:57:48.721 --> 00:57:48.721
<v Speaker 3>birthright for a bowl of lentils.</v>

1066
00:57:48.721 --> 00:57:49.150
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1067
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:54.360
<v Speaker 3>it's not that funny actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so Esau is not happy about this and </v>

1068
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.770
<v Speaker 3>it actually turns out that this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what does it mean?</v>

1069
00:57:56.771 --> 00:58:01.771
<v Speaker 3>It means don't sell the future for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desires of the present and don't be </v>

1070
00:58:01.771 --> 00:58:05.551
<v Speaker 3>casual about what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's an archetype will </v>

1071
00:58:05.551 --> 00:58:05.551
<v Speaker 3>element to this too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Benson says,</v>

1072
00:58:05.551 --> 00:58:08.170
<v Speaker 3>various have been the opinions what this</v>
<v Speaker 3>birthright was,</v>

1073
00:58:08.171 --> 00:58:13.171
<v Speaker 3>which Esau sold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the most probable is that together </v>

1074
00:58:13.171 --> 00:58:15.730
<v Speaker 3>with the right of sacrificing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So determining what should be sacrificed</v>

1075
00:58:15.731 --> 00:58:18.280
<v Speaker 3>and when and being the priest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

1076
00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:22.420
<v Speaker 3>it included the peculiar blessing </v>
<v Speaker 3>promised to the seed of Abraham,</v>

1077
00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:27.660
<v Speaker 3>that of being the progenitor of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Messiah and the error of the special </v>

1078
00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.410
<v Speaker 3>promises of God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>respecting Christ's kingdom.</v>

1079
00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.530
<v Speaker 3>It was at least typical of spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 3>privileges.</v>

1080
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:35.410
<v Speaker 3>Those of the firstborn that are written </v>
<v Speaker 3>in heaven.</v>

1081
00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot harsher than meets the eye </v>

1082
00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:47.461
<v Speaker 3>to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so there's a very interesting deep </v>

1083
00:58:47.461 --> 00:58:49.390
<v Speaker 3>moral story there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1084
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.160
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of Esau does the opposite of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice.</v>

1085
00:58:54.161 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 3>It's the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1086
00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.520
<v Speaker 3>He sacrifices the future for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>

1087
00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:03.360
<v Speaker 3>And so the story basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way it's laid out across stories is </v>

1088
00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:07.831
<v Speaker 3>that if you're the sort of person that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices the future to the present,</v>

1089
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:13.230
<v Speaker 3>then that eradicates the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you will bring the most noble being</v>

1090
00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.780
<v Speaker 3>into existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means.</v>

1091
00:59:16.781 --> 00:59:18.160
<v Speaker 3>And you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1092
00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.610
<v Speaker 3>this is the psychological significance </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the biblical stories.</v>

1093
00:59:21.611 --> 00:59:21.770
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1094
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:26.270
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad thing to do if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize your potential.</v>

1095
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you don't do reverse </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices,</v>

1096
00:59:29.061 --> 00:59:34.061
<v Speaker 3>that's a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so esl really did himself in by </v>

1097
00:59:34.061 --> 00:59:38.510
<v Speaker 3>being too attached to the present </v>
<v Speaker 3>without a vision of the future.</v>

1098
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:40.190
<v Speaker 3>So he's too in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1099
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:43.280
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he pays a heavy price for it.</v>

1100
00:59:43.281 --> 00:59:44.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the,</v>

1101
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:49.630
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loses his birthright and his double </v>

1102
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:52.391
<v Speaker 3>inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a practical consequence and </v>

1103
00:59:52.391 --> 00:59:52.391
<v Speaker 3>then there's a spiritual consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he's,</v>

1104
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.860
<v Speaker 3>while he's been made a fool of by his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother,</v>

1105
00:59:54.861 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Jacob means supplanter by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the name means.</v>

1106
00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.490
<v Speaker 3>And Jacob is always trying to usurp esl </v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

1107
01:00:02.491 --> 01:00:07.491
<v Speaker 3>as we see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so Jacob gets one over on them and </v>

1108
01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:07.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

1109
01:00:07.491 --> 01:00:09.710
<v Speaker 3>doesn't make an older brother happy when</v>
<v Speaker 3>a younger brother gets something over on</v>

1110
01:00:09.711 --> 01:00:10.460
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1111
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.180
<v Speaker 3>And then he loses the opportunity to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the progenitor of the Messiah,</v>

1112
01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:19.181
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably didn't realize that </v>

1113
01:00:19.181 --> 01:00:19.181
<v Speaker 3>precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems to be,</v>

1114
01:00:19.181 --> 01:00:19.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of rough.</v>

1115
01:00:19.181 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1116
01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:25.610
<v Speaker 3>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a statement in Matthew Sixteen,</v>

1117
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:29.420
<v Speaker 3>26 for what is a man profited if he </v>
<v Speaker 3>shall gain the whole world and loses his</v>

1118
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:32.810
<v Speaker 3>own soul or what shall a man give in </v>
<v Speaker 3>exchange for a soul?</v>

1119
01:00:32.811 --> 01:00:34.790
<v Speaker 3>It's an echo of the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1120
01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:35.480
<v Speaker 3>when you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1121
01:00:35.481 --> 01:00:39.320
<v Speaker 3>what is this idea of soul mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not intellect.</v>

1122
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.430
<v Speaker 3>And it said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something like consciousness allied</v>

1123
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.840
<v Speaker 3>with character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1124
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:50.080
<v Speaker 3>And I think the reason that it's valued </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much is that because he got to ask </v>

1125
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:50.080
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1126
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.110
<v Speaker 3>what do you really have when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to it?</v>

1127
01:00:51.111 --> 01:00:52.580
<v Speaker 3>So life is suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1128
01:00:52.581 --> 01:00:56.360
<v Speaker 3>and you know you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pile up worldly goods,</v>

1129
01:00:56.361 --> 01:01:01.361
<v Speaker 3>and the God in the Old Testament doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem to have anything against that </v>

1130
01:01:01.361 --> 01:01:01.361
<v Speaker 3>radiate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1131
01:01:01.361 --> 01:01:03.920
<v Speaker 3>The people who he favors seem to prosper</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite nicely in the world,</v>

1132
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:09.190
<v Speaker 3>but they also have to make a choice </v>
<v Speaker 3>between whether they're going to </v>

1133
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:12.641
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally sustain their character or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're going to prosper in the </v>

1134
01:01:12.641 --> 01:01:16.481
<v Speaker 3>world when push comes to shove and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of constantly is that really what </v>

1135
01:01:16.481 --> 01:01:20.471
<v Speaker 3>you have in the world that allows you </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best possible defense against the </v>

1136
01:01:21.231 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 3>suffering that's intrinsic to being as </v>
<v Speaker 3>your character.</v>

1137
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

1138
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.480
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think there is anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's more psychologically true than </v>

1139
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:31.480
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1140
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.060
<v Speaker 3>because everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1141
01:01:32.061 --> 01:01:34.780
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your relationships with others depending</v>

1142
01:01:34.781 --> 01:01:39.781
<v Speaker 3>on your character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And certainly this is part of the story </v>

1143
01:01:39.781 --> 01:01:39.781
<v Speaker 3>of Noah's Ark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1144
01:01:39.781 --> 01:01:43.601
<v Speaker 3>because his generations were perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had a very tight familial </v>

1145
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.010
<v Speaker 3>arrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone trusted each other.</v>

1146
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:48.650
<v Speaker 3>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you hit a rocky patch in your life,</v>

1147
01:01:48.651 --> 01:01:53.651
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's character that it's character </v>

1148
01:01:53.651 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 3>that determines that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're generous and honest and all of</v>

1149
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 3>those things and people know they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>rely on you,</v>

1150
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:59.540
<v Speaker 3>assuming they're not resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a whole different story.</v>

1151
01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:01.700
<v Speaker 3>Then they're going to come to your aid </v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1152
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.760
<v Speaker 3>when it's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to pull it together with </v>

1153
01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.101
<v Speaker 3>you and you know when people are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>after you for one reason or another and </v>

1154
01:02:09.101 --> 01:02:13.181
<v Speaker 3>they're accusing you of all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and you're guilty because you </v>

1155
01:02:13.181 --> 01:02:14.080
<v Speaker 3>have a past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's laden with character,</v>

1156
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:19.100
<v Speaker 3>logical errors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's very easy for people to take </v>

1157
01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.360
<v Speaker 3>you down because they'll poke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hit a place where you're guilty and</v>

1158
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:26.361
<v Speaker 3>then you're done because you'll do </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in with your own judgment and </v>

1159
01:02:26.361 --> 01:02:28.780
<v Speaker 3>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He makes a very big mistake and</v>

1160
01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.920
<v Speaker 3>there's a sacrificial idea here too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1161
01:02:35.921 --> 01:02:37.780
<v Speaker 3>you know now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're going to be faced with a</v>

1162
01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:41.290
<v Speaker 3>situation where it's something you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really want or your character.</v>

1163
01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:46.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you'll have to lie about something</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know and you'll think are what </v>

1164
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.710
<v Speaker 3>difference does it make you know a lie </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1165
01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.470
<v Speaker 3>Jacob does this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem,</v>

1166
01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.480
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of problems with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that,</v>

1167
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you know that you're the sort of </v>

1168
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:59.311
<v Speaker 3>person that will in fact deceive </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself about the nature of reality if </v>

1169
01:02:59.311 --> 01:03:00.550
<v Speaker 3>something shiny is dangled in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1170
01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:05.850
<v Speaker 3>and that's not good because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>undermines your faith in yourself and </v>

1171
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:09.001
<v Speaker 3>when you're really in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call that the dark night of the </v>

1172
01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:09.001
<v Speaker 3>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're really in trouble,</v>

1173
01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 3>that's what you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got whether or not you can trust </v>

1174
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.030
<v Speaker 3>yourself and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when things are really harsh,</v>

1175
01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.850
<v Speaker 3>and so if you've betrayed yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that manner,</v>

1176
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:22.390
<v Speaker 3>then you weaken yourself under the worst</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible circumstances.</v>

1177
01:03:22.391 --> 01:03:24.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really not a good thing.</v>

1178
01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:29.290
<v Speaker 3>So this is very practical advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1179
01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:33.430
<v Speaker 3>it's not casual moralizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very little casual moralizing in</v>

1180
01:03:33.431 --> 01:03:33.970
<v Speaker 3>these stores.</v>

1181
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
<v Speaker 3>In the next part of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some parallels with Abraham and </v>

1182
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.860
<v Speaker 3>that's built into the narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think because Isaac is Abraham's </v>

1183
01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:48.811
<v Speaker 3>descendant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we have to keep the narrative </v>

1184
01:03:48.811 --> 01:03:52.740
<v Speaker 3>echoing forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise it loses its continuity and </v>

1185
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:57.910
<v Speaker 3>there was a famine in the land that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Isaacson and God tells him to stay the </v>

1186
01:03:58.121 --> 01:04:01.720
<v Speaker 3>course anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>repeating the promise he gave Abraham,</v>

1187
01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:06.760
<v Speaker 3>although Isaac goes to check also </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling the king and people that Rebecca</v>

1188
01:04:06.761 --> 01:04:11.761
<v Speaker 3>was his sister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what Abraham did when </v>

1189
01:04:11.761 --> 01:04:11.830
<v Speaker 3>he went to Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's another echo there of the</v>

1190
01:04:11.831 --> 01:04:13.480
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same.</v>

1191
01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.980
<v Speaker 3>It's as if the story is being told for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>second time essentially.</v>

1192
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:19.930
<v Speaker 3>And that's supposed to remind you of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1193
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:23.050
<v Speaker 3>of the previous story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're careless.</v>

1194
01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:27.310
<v Speaker 3>The king sees that Rebecca and Isaac are</v>
<v Speaker 3>intimate together.</v>

1195
01:04:27.311 --> 01:04:32.311
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>luckily he doesn't have them put to </v>

1196
01:04:32.311 --> 01:04:32.311
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

1197
01:04:32.311 --> 01:04:33.850
<v Speaker 3>He just tells everybody in the kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there to be left the hell alone.</v>

1198
01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:39.180
<v Speaker 3>And then Isaac prospers in Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like Abraham did in Egypt until the</v>

1199
01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Philistines ask him to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just getting too rich and powerful.</v>

1200
01:04:43.271 --> 01:04:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Things are going too well for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's asked,</v>

1201
01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.130
<v Speaker 3>he's asked to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1202
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.530
<v Speaker 3>in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Esau gets married,</v>

1203
01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.560
<v Speaker 3>and this is a funny little story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says he marries two women who give </v>

1204
01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.260
<v Speaker 3>grief to Isaac and Rebecca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so whoever he saw Mary's,</v>

1205
01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:02.140
<v Speaker 3>they're not popular with his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their in laws,</v>

1206
01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:07.170
<v Speaker 3>not in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That actually becomes relevant a little </v>

1207
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:07.450
<v Speaker 3>later because they drive rebecca quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>mad.</v>

1208
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:10.240
<v Speaker 3>So I get a kick out of that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very common,</v>

1209
01:05:10.241 --> 01:05:15.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not easy to integrate new people </v>

1210
01:05:15.241 --> 01:05:16.870
<v Speaker 3>into your family and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hope that that will go smoothly.</v>

1211
01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the real catastrophes</v>

1212
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:19.270
<v Speaker 2>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1213
01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:24.271
<v Speaker 2>You have a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you get along with them and maybe </v>

1214
01:05:24.271 --> 01:05:24.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's assume you do,</v>

1215
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:29.761
<v Speaker 2>but then they marry someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just don't like and or maybe you think </v>

1216
01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:30.370
<v Speaker 2>is wrong for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1217
01:05:30.371 --> 01:05:35.371
<v Speaker 2>that's really rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what are you going to do about </v>

1218
01:05:35.371 --> 01:05:35.371
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1219
01:05:35.371 --> 01:05:36.850
<v Speaker 2>because you're basically screwed both </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

1220
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:41.851
<v Speaker 2>If you have the person you love around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to put up with this </v>

1221
01:05:41.851 --> 01:05:41.920
<v Speaker 2>horrendous creature that they allied </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves with.</v>

1222
01:05:41.921 --> 01:05:44.530
<v Speaker 2>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get rid of them completely,</v>

1223
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>well then you know you don't have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>child anymore.</v>

1224
01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:49.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult position.</v>

1225
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:51.820
<v Speaker 2>And so that's another example of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>realism,</v>

1226
01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the stories.</v>

1227
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.190
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isaac,</v>

1228
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:58.720
<v Speaker 2>who's hypothetically on his deathbed </v>
<v Speaker 2>asks Esau to hunt for Venison because he</v>

1229
01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:03.721
<v Speaker 2>likes fitness and he's happy that his </v>
<v Speaker 2>son is a hunter and Rebecca overhears </v>

1230
01:06:03.721 --> 01:06:05.530
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she conspires with Jacob,</v>

1231
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:07.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1232
01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:13.380
<v Speaker 2>to slaughter to small goats and make his</v>
<v Speaker 2>father some stew because he wants to </v>

1233
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.060
<v Speaker 2>make them stew out of venison.</v>

1234
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.100
<v Speaker 2>But Rebecca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's being,</v>

1235
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say slightly deceitful or horribly</v>

1236
01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:26.050
<v Speaker 2>lying that would be more accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she conspires with Jacob.</v>

1237
01:06:26.051 --> 01:06:29.920
<v Speaker 2>So Jacob kills two little goats kids and</v>
<v Speaker 2>boils up a stew.</v>

1238
01:06:29.921 --> 01:06:31.390
<v Speaker 2>And then he puts on some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1239
01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goatskins because Esau was a hairy </v>

1240
01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1241
01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.500
<v Speaker 2>and Rebecca Dresses Isaac in east </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothing because Isaac can't see very </v>

1242
01:06:41.441 --> 01:06:46.441
<v Speaker 2>well at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then Jacob goes into his father </v>

1243
01:06:46.441 --> 01:06:48.790
<v Speaker 2>with the stew and he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disguise his voice,</v>

1244
01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:53.791
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Isaac asks him to come close and </v>

1245
01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Jacob puts out his arm with the goat </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin on it.</v>

1246
01:06:56.201 --> 01:06:58.180
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Isaac smells them too.</v>

1247
01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:00.990
<v Speaker 2>And he smells like Esl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1248
01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:03.220
<v Speaker 2>which maybe wasn't the best thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1249
01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:05.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feels like,</v>

1250
01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:05.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1251
01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.820
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1252
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.100
<v Speaker 2>because Isaac thinks he's on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>deathbed,</v>

1253
01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.470
<v Speaker 2>he decides to deliver a blessing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically to east south.</v>

1254
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.770
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's Jacob.</v>

1255
01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:20.920
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a big deal too because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blessing is actually,</v>

1256
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.140
<v Speaker 2>as I said before with these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1257
01:07:23.141 --> 01:07:25.870
<v Speaker 2>it appeared as though once you said </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1258
01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:27.880
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get to take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't say,</v>

1259
01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:31.690
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've deceived me so it doesn't count.</v>

1260
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:37.290
<v Speaker 2>It was like they weren't maybe as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1261
01:07:39.341 --> 01:07:40.990
<v Speaker 2>Week might be one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1262
01:07:40.991 --> 01:07:43.720
<v Speaker 2>but another way is they weren't quite as</v>
<v Speaker 2>attentive to context,</v>

1263
01:07:43.721 --> 01:07:46.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if I make you a deal and then it</v>

1264
01:07:46.001 --> 01:07:51.001
<v Speaker 2>turns out that you've betrayed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may feel that the deal is no longer </v>

1265
01:07:51.001 --> 01:07:52.900
<v Speaker 2>valid because the assumption was you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were being honest to begin with.</v>

1266
01:07:52.901 --> 01:07:56.710
<v Speaker 2>And that violates the whole spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't how these people thought.</v>

1267
01:07:56.711 --> 01:07:58.750
<v Speaker 2>They said once he promised man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you promised.</v>

1268
01:07:58.751 --> 01:08:02.950
<v Speaker 2>And that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Isaac Blesses Jacob.</v>

1269
01:08:02.951 --> 01:08:07.951
<v Speaker 2>He says that God gives you the dew of </v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven and the fatness of the earth and </v>

1270
01:08:07.951 --> 01:08:12.181
<v Speaker 2>plenty of corn and wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let people serve you and nations bow </v>

1271
01:08:12.181 --> 01:08:12.610
<v Speaker 2>down to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Lord over thy brethren,</v>

1272
01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be rough on Esl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let thy mother's sons bow down</v>

1273
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:21.010
<v Speaker 3>to the cursive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be everyone that curses and blessings </v>

1274
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:21.010
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He blesses it,</v>

1275
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:24.110
<v Speaker 3>and so there's a credit remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 3>painting of that.</v>

1276
01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:29.710
<v Speaker 3>So there's Rebecca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's looking pretty old and Isaac's </v>

1277
01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:33.761
<v Speaker 3>Look Pretty Blind and Jacob's taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>directions from his mother and we might </v>

1278
01:08:33.761 --> 01:08:36.800
<v Speaker 3>say he's perhaps a little old to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking moral lessons from his mother,</v>

1279
01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:41.801
<v Speaker 3>especially given how she's acting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a pretty ugly scene </v>

1280
01:08:41.801 --> 01:08:45.221
<v Speaker 3>altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially that we also know that Jacob </v>

1281
01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:48.850
<v Speaker 3>already tricked Esau out of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>birthright and so now he's taken the </v>

1282
01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:52.860
<v Speaker 3>birthright and he's taken the blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so as I said that Jacob,</v>

1283
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:59.501
<v Speaker 3>he turns out to be the father of Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's a reprehensible </v>

1284
01:08:59.501 --> 01:09:03.311
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are major league betrayals that </v>

1285
01:09:03.311 --> 01:09:03.350
<v Speaker 3>he's engaging and it's not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He really,</v>

1286
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.040
<v Speaker 3>really pulls the rug out from under his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother and you know,</v>

1287
01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:07.670
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1288
01:09:07.671 --> 01:09:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Esl is not as awake as he might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1289
01:09:10.641 --> 01:09:15.320
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of a wild man and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly seems to me that the,</v>

1290
01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.310
<v Speaker 3>the predominant moral error falls on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jacob's shoulders.</v>

1291
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.740
<v Speaker 3>It's very treacherous behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's doing.</v>

1292
01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:27.940
<v Speaker 3>So then Esau shows up and he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice stag for his dad and it's like </v>

1293
01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:33.520
<v Speaker 3>little late for that and he states that </v>
<v Speaker 3>his brother was rightly named Jacob,</v>

1294
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:37.670
<v Speaker 3>which means supplanter because he's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>deceived twice and Isaac says,</v>

1295
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Isaac answered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's asking a yes.</v>

1296
01:09:41.830 --> 01:09:44.810
<v Speaker 3>I was asking fundamentally if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything at all left over for him,</v>

1297
01:09:44.811 --> 01:09:49.811
<v Speaker 3>and Isaac can't give them the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>blessing because that's already been </v>

1298
01:09:49.811 --> 01:09:50.300
<v Speaker 3>given.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he has to think of something else.</v>

1299
01:09:50.301 --> 01:09:53.180
<v Speaker 3>And I'm Isaac says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold.</v>

1300
01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:57.440
<v Speaker 3>I've made him my lord and all his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brothers I've given to him for servants,</v>

1301
01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.930
<v Speaker 3>which includes you and with corn and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wine.</v>

1302
01:09:59.931 --> 01:10:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Have I sustained him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What shall I now do on tv?</v>

1303
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:06.890
<v Speaker 3>My son and Esau said unto his father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how have you even one blessing for me?</v>

1304
01:10:06.891 --> 01:10:11.891
<v Speaker 3>My father and bless me also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and an esl lifted up his voice and wept </v>

1305
01:10:11.891 --> 01:10:16.541
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we already know that Esau is a pretty </v>

1306
01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:16.541
<v Speaker 3>tough guy by all appearances and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1307
01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 3>he's out there hunting on his own and </v>
<v Speaker 3>camping and it's like he's no pushover,</v>

1308
01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:24.701
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that this reduces him to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tears is an indication of the magnitude </v>

1309
01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:24.770
<v Speaker 3>of the betrayal.</v>

1310
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:28.370
<v Speaker 3>And Isaac says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness</v>

1311
01:10:28.371 --> 01:10:31.640
<v Speaker 3>of the earth and of the dew of heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from above and by Thy Sword,</v>

1312
01:10:31.641 --> 01:10:34.640
<v Speaker 3>thou shall live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and thou shalt serve your brother and it</v>

1313
01:10:34.641 --> 01:10:38.090
<v Speaker 3>she'll come to pass when you will have </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dominion and you'll break the yolk.</v>

1314
01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:43.091
<v Speaker 3>His yoke off from died neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Esol hated Jacob because of the </v>

1315
01:10:43.091 --> 01:10:43.670
<v Speaker 3>blessing where with his father blessed </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1316
01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:49.210
<v Speaker 3>And Esau said in his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the days of mourning for my father are </v>

1317
01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:50.270
<v Speaker 3>at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I will slay my brother Jacob.</v>

1318
01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.610
<v Speaker 3>So fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1319
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:56.570
<v Speaker 3>if Isaac dies or when he dies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we'll mourn for him.</v>

1320
01:10:56.571 --> 01:11:00.310
<v Speaker 3>And then Jacob better look the hell out </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like it's,</v>

1321
01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:04.720
<v Speaker 3>it's serious death coming his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1322
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.320
<v Speaker 3>he's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a point,</v>

1323
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:10.850
<v Speaker 3>he's in Dante's inferno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I mentioned this at one point.</v>

1324
01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:13.710
<v Speaker 3>So Dante's inferno is a very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1325
01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:18.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a descent into hell and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually one of the places that we sort </v>

1326
01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:22.420
<v Speaker 3>of derive the popular conception of hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>was partly based on Dante's,</v>

1327
01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:27.740
<v Speaker 3>on dmts imagination on his work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what Dante was trying to do was to </v>

1328
01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 3>discover the hierarchical structure of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil.</v>

1329
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:34.790
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might think there's a hierarchical </v>

1330
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:36.531
<v Speaker 3>structure of good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some things are better than other </v>

1331
01:11:36.531 --> 01:11:38.631
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also a hierarchical </v>

1332
01:11:38.631 --> 01:11:38.631
<v Speaker 3>structure of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some evils are greater than other evils.</v>

1333
01:11:38.631 --> 01:11:40.440
<v Speaker 3>And he put the trail in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1334
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 3>in the lowest part of health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1335
01:11:42.781 --> 01:11:46.080
<v Speaker 3>So if you were betraying people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were right beside Satan himself.</v>

1336
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:48.360
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's good,</v>

1337
01:11:48.361 --> 01:11:51.210
<v Speaker 3>that's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While Dante was a genius after all,</v>

1338
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:56.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the reason for that is that </v>

1339
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.760
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone trusts you,</v>

1340
01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:59.580
<v Speaker 3>they're laying their vulnerability open </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

1341
01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Now they might just be naive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

1342
01:12:01.471 --> 01:12:04.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we won't think about that because you're</v>

1343
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:05.880
<v Speaker 3>just a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're naive,</v>

1344
01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:09.090
<v Speaker 3>you can still be betrayed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're an adult and you trust,</v>

1345
01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:11.640
<v Speaker 3>it's often because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're an actual adult,</v>

1346
01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 3>is you willingly open yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that you could be hurt,</v>

1347
01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:17.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're not naive anymore.</v>

1348
01:12:17.371 --> 01:12:22.371
<v Speaker 3>So you decided to trust and you see all </v>
<v Speaker 3>open myself up and I know that I'm </v>

1349
01:12:22.801 --> 01:12:27.050
<v Speaker 3>leaving myself open to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you choose to use that power and then</v>

1350
01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.230
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1351
01:12:28.231 --> 01:12:31.260
<v Speaker 3>if you've been hurt as a child hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a naive person,</v>

1352
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:31.800
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1353
01:12:31.801 --> 01:12:34.560
<v Speaker 3>why should I ever trust to get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is a really good question.</v>

1354
01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.020
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is the reason you trust,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1355
01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:39.180
<v Speaker 3>once you're an adult is because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>courageous.</v>

1356
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.100
<v Speaker 3>You're courageous.</v>

1357
01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:46.100
<v Speaker 3>It's an act of courage to trust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason it's useful is because if</v>

1358
01:12:46.201 --> 01:12:51.201
<v Speaker 3>you trust someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you opened the door to reciprocity and </v>

1359
01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:54.530
<v Speaker 3>negotiation and cooperation and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>entice the best part of the person </v>

1360
01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:57.000
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's A.</v>

1361
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a courageous act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then if you betray someone,</v>

1362
01:13:00.301 --> 01:13:03.510
<v Speaker 3>then what you've done is you've taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best part of them,</v>

1363
01:13:03.511 --> 01:13:07.470
<v Speaker 3>which is the part that will courageously</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust it with open eyes.</v>

1364
01:13:07.471 --> 01:13:10.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've stuck a dagger in that.</v>

1365
01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:13.680
<v Speaker 3>And so you've purposefully damaged the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best part of the.</v>

1366
01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why it's such a egregious </v>
<v Speaker 3>fault.</v>

1367
01:13:17.011 --> 01:13:20.610
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's often people don't recover from</v>

1368
01:13:20.611 --> 01:13:23.370
<v Speaker 3>that sort of blanket you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you be betray someone badly enough,</v>

1369
01:13:23.371 --> 01:13:28.371
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can damage them like you can give </v>

1370
01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:28.371
<v Speaker 3>them posttraumatic stress disorder if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>

1371
01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:32.040
<v Speaker 3>if you really put your mind to it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that's not just a psychological</v>

1372
01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:32.640
<v Speaker 3>disorder.</v>

1373
01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.540
<v Speaker 3>If you have posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 3>disorder,</v>

1374
01:13:34.541 --> 01:13:39.180
<v Speaker 3>it produces permanent neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>alterations that make you more neurotic,</v>

1375
01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:42.390
<v Speaker 3>more sensitive to negative emotion </v>
<v Speaker 3>really for the rest of your life.</v>

1376
01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:46.290
<v Speaker 3>Like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can recover from it to some degree,</v>

1377
01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:50.370
<v Speaker 3>but stress will tend to re instantiate </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ptsd.</v>

1378
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:55.790
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hurt someone and it's not merely </v>

1379
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.790
<v Speaker 3>cycled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

1380
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:58.230
<v Speaker 3>not that psychological is merely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not merely psychological,</v>

1381
01:13:58.231 --> 01:13:58.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1382
01:13:58.890 --> 01:14:03.810
<v Speaker 3>it's fundamental physiological damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>

1383
01:14:03.811 --> 01:14:08.811
<v Speaker 3>Jacobs smart enough to get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And which is also not really a testament</v>

1384
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:11.100
<v Speaker 3>to his integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1385
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:16.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's done these terrible things at the </v>

1386
01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:17.420
<v Speaker 3>behest of his mother because he wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and,</v>

1387
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:19.960
<v Speaker 3>and he wants to get it without deserving</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1388
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:24.640
<v Speaker 3>And then he finally goes too far and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>hightails it out of there to his,</v>

1389
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:28.240
<v Speaker 3>to another family member,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to his mother's brother.</v>

1390
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.600
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not exactly the world's most</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroic story,</v>

1391
01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.110
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1392
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:40.380
<v Speaker 3>And so now there's an interlude here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a really interesting </v>

1393
01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.530
<v Speaker 3>interlude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the story of Jacob's ladder.</v>

1394
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:45.100
<v Speaker 3>So he's off to visit la ban or lab and </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

1395
01:14:45.101 --> 01:14:46.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1396
01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:48.970
<v Speaker 3>his mother's brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on the way he,</v>

1397
01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:54.380
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a sleep and he lighted upon a </v>

1398
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:57.601
<v Speaker 3>certain place and tarried there all </v>
<v Speaker 3>night because the sun was set and he </v>

1399
01:14:57.601 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 3>took of the stones of that place and put</v>
<v Speaker 3>them for his pillows,</v>

1400
01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:03.050
<v Speaker 3>which seems to indicate very bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>planning on his part and,</v>

1401
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.730
<v Speaker 3>and lay down in that place to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he dreamed and behold,</v>

1402
01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:11.731
<v Speaker 3>a ladder set up on the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the top of it reached to heaven and </v>

1403
01:15:11.731 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 3>beheld the angels of God ascending and </v>
<v Speaker 3>descending on it.</v>

1404
01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:14.860
<v Speaker 3>And behold the lord stood above it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1405
01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I am the Lord God of Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thy father and the god of Isaac,</v>

1406
01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:22.570
<v Speaker 3>the land we're on to the I will give it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to thy seed.</v>

1407
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:28.950
<v Speaker 3>And so this story of Jacob's ladder has </v>
<v Speaker 3>really possessed the imagination of the </v>

1408
01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:31.210
<v Speaker 3>West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a reason for that.</v>

1409
01:15:31.211 --> 01:15:36.211
<v Speaker 3>It's because it's an archetypal story </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the idea of a ladder that </v>

1410
01:15:36.211 --> 01:15:37.630
<v Speaker 3>reaches to heaven is one of the oldest </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas of mankind.</v>

1411
01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:40.930
<v Speaker 3>So you'll find it widely distributed </v>
<v Speaker 3>among the shamanic cultures,</v>

1412
01:15:40.931 --> 01:15:45.931
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a hallmark of psychedelic </v>

1413
01:15:45.931 --> 01:15:45.931
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about it,</v>

1414
01:15:45.931 --> 01:15:50.790
<v Speaker 3>which is a very peculiar thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's one representation of the </v>

1415
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:54.310
<v Speaker 3>ladder you see got up at the top there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm peeking out from the clouds.</v>

1416
01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:55.680
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1417
01:15:55.690 --> 01:16:00.670
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of where we get the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that God is in heaven and the heavens up</v>

1418
01:16:00.671 --> 01:16:02.170
<v Speaker 3>in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1419
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:05.880
<v Speaker 3>and that's an easy story to make fun of </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

1420
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.800
<v Speaker 3>we've gone up to the moon and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>god there and,</v>

1421
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:09.730
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1422
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:14.790
<v Speaker 3>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not a reasonable way of </v>

1423
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:16.510
<v Speaker 3>conceptualizing what these experiences </v>
<v Speaker 3>are about,</v>

1424
01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.980
<v Speaker 3>these experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what this is the opening up there that's</v>

1425
01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:23.860
<v Speaker 3>more like an opening into an alternate </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension.</v>

1426
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.210
<v Speaker 3>That's a better way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1427
01:16:25.211 --> 01:16:28.120
<v Speaker 3>It's beyond like from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the Judeo Christian perspective,</v>

1428
01:16:28.121 --> 01:16:31.360
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you have to understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that God is beyond space and time.</v>

1429
01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:36.570
<v Speaker 3>He's not in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's outside the universe in some </v>

1430
01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:39.901
<v Speaker 3>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the idea that that you have an </v>

1431
01:16:39.901 --> 01:16:42.550
<v Speaker 3>experience of God and it's up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't the AAP is the best that the human</v>

1432
01:16:42.551 --> 01:16:47.551
<v Speaker 3>imagination can do with what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially a form of extra dimensional </v>

1433
01:16:47.551 --> 01:16:50.560
<v Speaker 3>experience or that's the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualize it.</v>

1434
01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:52.690
<v Speaker 3>And these experiences aren't rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1435
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:53.830
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they make the,</v>

1436
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:56.470
<v Speaker 3>they make up the core of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the shamanic tradition.</v>

1437
01:16:56.471 --> 01:16:59.770
<v Speaker 3>And so there's an intrusion of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient shamanic tradition,</v>

1438
01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 3>which is tens of thousands of years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the biblical stories at this point.</v>

1439
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:09.420
<v Speaker 3>Now why Jacob had a essentially shamonic</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience is very difficult to tell </v>

1440
01:17:09.981 --> 01:17:12.380
<v Speaker 3>because we don't know what these old </v>
<v Speaker 3>people we're up to.</v>

1441
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't know how much of the </v>

1442
01:17:17.410 --> 01:17:17.410
<v Speaker 3>archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>traditioned,</v>

1443
01:17:17.410 --> 01:17:20.900
<v Speaker 3>archaic religious tradition was still </v>
<v Speaker 3>extent at that at that point in time,</v>

1444
01:17:20.901 --> 01:17:25.901
<v Speaker 3>but we certainly do know that our </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient forebears were using psychedelic</v>

1445
01:17:26.311 --> 01:17:28.880
<v Speaker 3>substances constantly like am Anita </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mascara,</v>

1446
01:17:28.881 --> 01:17:29.960
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1447
01:17:29.961 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 3>which were widely used in India before </v>
<v Speaker 3>they became extinct.</v>

1448
01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:38.051
<v Speaker 3>That's the theory anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that seemed to be the basis of the </v>

1449
01:17:38.051 --> 01:17:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Chemical Soma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which a much has been written about,</v>

1450
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:45.100
<v Speaker 3>and so we hear it over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a dream or has the vision and </v>

1451
01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:49.541
<v Speaker 3>perhaps that's what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but perhaps that wasn't what it was </v>

1452
01:17:49.541 --> 01:17:52.211
<v Speaker 3>either and perhaps it was an experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was induced by by the same </v>

1453
01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:59.710
<v Speaker 3>processes that shamonic people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>always induced these experiences and so </v>

1454
01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:00.350
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go through this a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1455
01:18:00.351 --> 01:18:02.300
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's A.</v>

1456
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:04.820
<v Speaker 3>There's a connection between heaven and </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth that opens up.</v>

1457
01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:05.660
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1458
01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.270
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the vision,</v>

1459
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.220
<v Speaker 3>and there's messengers moving up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1460
01:18:10.221 --> 01:18:15.221
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one way you can conceptualize that is </v>

1461
01:18:15.221 --> 01:18:15.221
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we already discussed,</v>

1462
01:18:15.221 --> 01:18:19.421
<v Speaker 3>that you know there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are forces within you that are </v>

1463
01:18:19.421 --> 01:18:23.591
<v Speaker 3>active and alive and you can think of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in some sense as messengers of the </v>

1464
01:18:23.591 --> 01:18:28.211
<v Speaker 3>higher self and so you could think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this as an image of a psychological </v>

1465
01:18:28.211 --> 01:18:30.830
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but and so we can stick with that,</v>

1466
01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:32.300
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1467
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:36.680
<v Speaker 3>here's some of the representations that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been made.</v>

1468
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:40.250
<v Speaker 3>I really liked the one on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's William Blake.</v>

1469
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:45.251
<v Speaker 3>I liked the helix idea and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's a fluke.</v>

1470
01:18:45.741 --> 01:18:48.650
<v Speaker 3>There are helixes and double helix is in</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of images,</v>

1471
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:53.710
<v Speaker 3>imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very ancient and very modern that are </v>

1472
01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:54.380
<v Speaker 3>associated with both healing and with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of vision.</v>

1473
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:58.100
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see the blake representation.</v>

1474
01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:03.430
<v Speaker 3>God is associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well really with the sun and with light </v>

1475
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:07.310
<v Speaker 3>and you see that on the left as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wherever God is is where light is.</v>

1476
01:19:07.311 --> 01:19:10.580
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a very interesting idea as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as I'm concerned as well.</v>

1477
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.360
<v Speaker 3>There's some other representations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one by chagall.</v>

1478
01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 3>So now there's this idea that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the possibility of opening up a </v>

1479
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:31.140
<v Speaker 3>line of communication between the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>psyche and the transcendent divine,</v>

1480
01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:36.560
<v Speaker 3>and there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a great image of Christ as </v>

1481
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Panto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so creative.</v>

1482
01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.210
<v Speaker 3>The world at just one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>mosaics,</v>

1483
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:41.270
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I wish I knew,</v>

1484
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:42.810
<v Speaker 3>remember where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>

1485
01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:48.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very interesting image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a carving of it made at the </v>

1486
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:51.771
<v Speaker 3>moment by a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you see Christ face it portrayed in </v>

1487
01:19:53.311 --> 01:19:55.080
<v Speaker 3>a medieval manner and he's holding a </v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

1488
01:19:55.081 --> 01:19:58.470
<v Speaker 3>So it symbolizes the importance of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>

1489
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:03.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a means of transmitting wisdom and </v>

1490
01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.580
<v Speaker 3>his face is very asymmetrical and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes are different.</v>

1491
01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:10.610
<v Speaker 3>One side and the other and half of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>face represents the human part and the </v>

1492
01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:12.810
<v Speaker 3>other side of the face represents the </v>
<v Speaker 3>divine part.</v>

1493
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:17.810
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think about that psychologically </v>

1494
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:20.961
<v Speaker 3>because I do think that that's the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to conceptualize human beings is </v>

1495
01:20:21.421 --> 01:20:25.110
<v Speaker 3>that there's an aspect of us mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human and limited.</v>

1496
01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:28.350
<v Speaker 3>But there's an aspect of us that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent and divine as well.</v>

1497
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:33.500
<v Speaker 3>And it's latent in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are times when it manifests </v>

1498
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.800
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not speculation,</v>

1499
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:40.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like the oldest experience of </v>

1500
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:43.341
<v Speaker 3>human beings now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessarily an easy experience </v>

1501
01:20:43.341 --> 01:20:46.521
<v Speaker 3>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's reported everywhere and it can </v>

1502
01:20:46.521 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 3>be reliably induced as we've discussed </v>
<v Speaker 3>before by chemical means,</v>

1503
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:50.430
<v Speaker 3>which and I don't know what that means </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1504
01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:53.220
<v Speaker 3>We've talked a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin mushrooms for example,</v>

1505
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:58.221
<v Speaker 3>and you could say that the mystical </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences that have been invoked in </v>

1506
01:20:58.221 --> 01:21:01.881
<v Speaker 3>the newest experiments down at at Johns </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopkins are derangements or forms of </v>

1507
01:21:02.521 --> 01:21:07.521
<v Speaker 3>psychosis because they have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>similarity to psychosis psychotic </v>

1508
01:21:07.521 --> 01:21:08.010
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

1509
01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:12.960
<v Speaker 3>Although psychotic people were given lsd</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sixties and they always said that</v>

1510
01:21:12.961 --> 01:21:17.961
<v Speaker 3>that was something different than what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were having and if you give </v>

1511
01:21:17.961 --> 01:21:18.840
<v Speaker 3>psychotic people I'm fed up means you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can make them worse.</v>

1512
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.700
<v Speaker 3>So there biochemically separate and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that.</v>

1513
01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:25.830
<v Speaker 3>But also the thing that's so interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the psilocybin experiences is that</v>

1514
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:31.400
<v Speaker 3>they reliably produce mystical </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences that the people rate as </v>

1515
01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:31.950
<v Speaker 3>among the most important experiences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their life.</v>

1516
01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:36.030
<v Speaker 3>And among those who have the psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

1517
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.720
<v Speaker 3>positive things happen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that kind of messes with the </v>

1518
01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:41.720
<v Speaker 3>whole psychosis theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1519
01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Because what are you gonna do you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna claim that you give someone a pale</v>

1520
01:21:44.911 --> 01:21:46.950
<v Speaker 3>and they have a psychotic break and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're healthier.</v>

1521
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1522
01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:52.020
<v Speaker 3>that isn't how psychotic breaks work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not healthier after having one.</v>

1523
01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:57.260
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a broken Haig and it's not easy </v>

1524
01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:57.260
<v Speaker 3>to put you back together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1525
01:21:57.710 --> 01:22:02.710
<v Speaker 3>and we know that people all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world have discovered every manner of </v>

1526
01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:03.420
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic substance that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly,</v>

1527
01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.720
<v Speaker 3>while you imagine there's lots of hungry</v>
<v Speaker 3>people wandering the earth for a long </v>

1528
01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.570
<v Speaker 3>time and they eat every damn thing they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could get their hands on and now,</v>

1529
01:22:09.571 --> 01:22:12.990
<v Speaker 3>and then something very peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened as a consequence.</v>

1530
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:14.130
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1531
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:19.520
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to tell you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the harmonic,</v>

1532
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:25.310
<v Speaker 3>a tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's associated with Jacob's </v>

1533
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.310
<v Speaker 3>ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1534
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:26.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to Eliana Mircea Eliade,</v>

1535
01:22:26.981 --> 01:22:30.490
<v Speaker 3>who was a great historian of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a compatriot of viewings and,</v>

1536
01:22:30.491 --> 01:22:35.491
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the influenced each other quite </v>

1537
01:22:35.491 --> 01:22:37.521
<v Speaker 3>substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eliana believe that shamanism that used </v>

1538
01:22:37.521 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics was a degeneration from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>original,</v>

1539
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:44.570
<v Speaker 3>more pure shamanism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think later scholarship has </v>

1540
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 3>demonstrated that that's incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that the romantic ritual per se,</v>

1541
01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:51.891
<v Speaker 3>was a direct consequence of the use </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovery of an and ritualistic use of </v>

1542
01:22:52.321 --> 01:22:54.180
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic substances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1543
01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Eliana identified three pathways to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shamanism and the Sherman in it,</v>

1544
01:23:00.221 --> 01:23:05.221
<v Speaker 3>in a tribe was more educated than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>typical person with a larger vocabulary </v>

1545
01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:12.930
<v Speaker 3>and was the repository of the oral </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition and so learned all the stories</v>

1546
01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:18.241
<v Speaker 3>that had been passed down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Word of mouth and people by the way are </v>

1547
01:23:18.241 --> 01:23:18.241
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1548
01:23:18.450 --> 01:23:23.450
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very accurately tell the same story </v>

1549
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:23.450
<v Speaker 3>across generations.</v>

1550
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:24.670
<v Speaker 3>That's been quite well documented so </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1551
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:29.671
<v Speaker 3>and people who can't read really can </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember because what else are they </v>

1552
01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:33.691
<v Speaker 3>going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their memories are far greater than </v>

1553
01:23:33.691 --> 01:23:36.780
<v Speaker 3>modern peoples memories because we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>forget everything because we can just </v>

1554
01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:39.601
<v Speaker 3>look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they remembered things because they </v>

1555
01:23:39.601 --> 01:23:42.631
<v Speaker 3>had no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My father knew someone who was </v>

1556
01:23:42.631 --> 01:23:42.631
<v Speaker 3>illiterate and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1557
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:46.660
<v Speaker 3>and couldn't use numbers either when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he grew up in Saskatchewan,</v>

1558
01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:48.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 years ago,</v>

1559
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:51.550
<v Speaker 3>and he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a sheep,</v>

1560
01:23:51.551 --> 01:23:54.130
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and although he couldn't count,</v>

1561
01:23:54.131 --> 01:23:59.131
<v Speaker 3>he knew if one of his sheep was missing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he knew all the sheep and so he </v>

1562
01:23:59.131 --> 01:24:00.820
<v Speaker 3>could tell just by looking if one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sheep was missing,</v>

1563
01:24:00.821 --> 01:24:05.821
<v Speaker 3>but he couldn't count and so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people who don't have our particular </v>

1564
01:24:05.821 --> 01:24:06.970
<v Speaker 3>set of skills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1565
01:24:06.971 --> 01:24:10.500
<v Speaker 3>they're not stupid and second they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>other skills that we don't understand to</v>

1566
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:11.500
<v Speaker 3>fill in the gaps.</v>

1567
01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.950
<v Speaker 3>So Eliana identified spontaneous </v>
<v Speaker 3>vocation.</v>

1568
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.830
<v Speaker 3>So you were just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had this spirit of a showman,</v>

1569
01:24:17.831 --> 01:24:22.831
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're probably extremely high in </v>

1570
01:24:22.831 --> 01:24:22.831
<v Speaker 3>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say from a modern perspective,</v>

1571
01:24:22.831 --> 01:24:24.320
<v Speaker 3>hereditary transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1572
01:24:24.321 --> 01:24:27.310
<v Speaker 3>your father was a showman and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandfather was a showman and so forth,</v>

1573
01:24:27.311 --> 01:24:32.311
<v Speaker 3>and you got initiated into that process </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a personal quest in Siberia.</v>

1574
01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:39.180
<v Speaker 3>This is from Eliana in Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The youth who is called to be a showman </v>

1575
01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:40.540
<v Speaker 3>attracts attention by his strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

1576
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:42.490
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seeks solitude,</v>

1577
01:24:42.491 --> 01:24:47.491
<v Speaker 3>becomes absent minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loves to roam in the woods or </v>

1578
01:24:47.491 --> 01:24:47.491
<v Speaker 3>unfrequently places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has visions,</v>

1579
01:24:47.491 --> 01:24:48.010
<v Speaker 3>and sings in his sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1580
01:24:48.011 --> 01:24:51.100
<v Speaker 3>if you put someone in a in a place </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's deprived,</v>

1581
01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:54.970
<v Speaker 3>that's where you're deprived from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensory perspective,</v>

1582
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 3>it fit normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will hallucinate quite quickly,</v>

1583
01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:03.270
<v Speaker 3>so it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens is that if you dampen down </v>

1584
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:05.761
<v Speaker 3>the sensory input,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you start to become aware of the </v>

1585
01:25:05.761 --> 01:25:05.761
<v Speaker 3>background processes of your mind.</v>

1586
01:25:05.761 --> 01:25:07.780
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the signal to noise ratio.</v>

1587
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:12.760
<v Speaker 3>I got to get this right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the noise decreases,</v>

1588
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:16.690
<v Speaker 3>some of the noise become signal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the background noise become signal,</v>

1589
01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.960
<v Speaker 3>and you start to become aware of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own internal psychological processes.</v>

1590
01:25:19.961 --> 01:25:23.320
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has visions and sings in his sleep.</v>

1591
01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:28.620
<v Speaker 3>In some instances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this period of incubation is marked by </v>

1592
01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:31.291
<v Speaker 3>quite serious symptoms among the Yakut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The young man sometimes has fits of </v>

1593
01:25:31.291 --> 01:25:32.890
<v Speaker 3>theory and easily loses consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hides in the forest,</v>

1594
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:38.100
<v Speaker 3>feeds on the bark of trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throws himself into water and fire and </v>

1595
01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:38.260
<v Speaker 3>cutting themselves with knives.</v>

1596
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:45.510
<v Speaker 3>We went to a potlatch in northern </v>
<v Speaker 3>northern Vancouver Island about a year </v>

1597
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:50.161
<v Speaker 3>ago and they had this one dance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the Kwakwaka'wakw natives and </v>

1598
01:25:50.161 --> 01:25:52.810
<v Speaker 3>they had this interesting dance that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dance of the wild man.</v>

1599
01:25:52.811 --> 01:25:57.811
<v Speaker 3>And so the person who invited us was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild man and he was dressed up in tree </v>

1600
01:25:58.121 --> 01:26:03.121
<v Speaker 3>branches and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he was the person who'd been in </v>

1601
01:26:03.121 --> 01:26:05.971
<v Speaker 3>the Bush too long and he in as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannibal and there there was genuine </v>

1602
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:09.650
<v Speaker 3>cannibalistic rites among these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not so long ago.</v>

1603
01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:14.700
<v Speaker 3>He came in as a cannibal and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to wear this like cedar head dress </v>

1604
01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.921
<v Speaker 3>because if you had a cedar headdress on </v>
<v Speaker 3>then the Cannibal wouldn't take a bite </v>

1605
01:26:17.921 --> 01:26:21.521
<v Speaker 3>out of you and they actually took this </v>
<v Speaker 3>route as seriously so you should have </v>

1606
01:26:21.521 --> 01:26:23.510
<v Speaker 3>your Cedar headdress on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's looking around the crowd and</v>

1607
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:26.920
<v Speaker 3>there's like 400 people in this place </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he could really act two.</v>

1608
01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.920
<v Speaker 3>And so he's doing this wild man dance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all the women stood up and </v>

1609
01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.430
<v Speaker 3>started to kind of dancing place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

1610
01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:37.640
<v Speaker 3>And they were taming him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was really cool.</v>

1611
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:40.940
<v Speaker 3>It was really interesting to see that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because those people are about,</v>

1612
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:43.310
<v Speaker 3>they've had an unbroken culture for </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 13,000</v>

1613
01:26:43.311 --> 01:26:48.311
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say That's how long they've been out on </v>

1614
01:26:48.311 --> 01:26:51.051
<v Speaker 3>the island there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was very interesting to see that </v>

1615
01:26:51.051 --> 01:26:53.441
<v Speaker 3>dramatization of the domestication of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of man by women laid out in that dance </v>

1616
01:26:53.871 --> 01:26:58.871
<v Speaker 3>in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was also interesting in </v>

1617
01:26:58.871 --> 01:27:00.080
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the shamanic tradition </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he came in as a wild man,</v>

1618
01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:05.081
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had to be re civilized in some </v>

1619
01:27:05.081 --> 01:27:06.500
<v Speaker 3>sense and brought back down to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1620
01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:12.300
<v Speaker 3>but by whatever method he may have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>designated as Sharman is recognized as </v>

1621
01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:16.121
<v Speaker 3>such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only after having received two methods </v>

1622
01:27:16.121 --> 01:27:16.121
<v Speaker 3>of instruction.</v>

1623
01:27:16.121 --> 01:27:17.870
<v Speaker 3>The first is ecstatic dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trances visions.</v>

1624
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:22.640
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that this guy told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no reason to doubt him.</v>

1625
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:26.330
<v Speaker 3>He's also not illiterate person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1626
01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:31.660
<v Speaker 3>and so has a great memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does carving traditional carving and </v>

1627
01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:35.531
<v Speaker 3>he's very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He carved a 53 foot totem pole that's </v>

1628
01:27:35.531 --> 01:27:37.460
<v Speaker 3>now in front of the Museum of art in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in downtown Montreal.</v>

1629
01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.500
<v Speaker 3>So if you ever go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go see it,</v>

1630
01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:41.960
<v Speaker 3>I won't be there forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's there right now.</v>

1631
01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:47.860
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was taught to carve by his </v>

1632
01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.171
<v Speaker 3>grandparents and he said that he dreamed</v>
<v Speaker 3>in what the Haida images look like.</v>

1633
01:27:51.231 --> 01:27:53.470
<v Speaker 3>So the Kwakwaka'wakw kind of like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>

1634
01:27:53.471 --> 01:27:56.960
<v Speaker 3>that same sort of imagery he told me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he dreamed in those images.</v>

1635
01:27:57.350 --> 01:28:02.350
<v Speaker 3>So when he dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the forum that the things he </v>

1636
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:06.041
<v Speaker 3>dreams about takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he also said that he would talk to </v>

1637
01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:06.041
<v Speaker 3>his grandparents and his dream.</v>

1638
01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:08.690
<v Speaker 3>So if he was working on a piece of wood </v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying to figure out how to carve it</v>

1639
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:11.120
<v Speaker 3>and he ran into a particularly difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>

1640
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:16.270
<v Speaker 3>he dream in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd have a conversation with his </v>

1641
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.270
<v Speaker 3>grandparents and they'd help them figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to solve the problem.</v>

1642
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:17.270
<v Speaker 3>And then he'd wake up and he could go </v>
<v Speaker 3>carve the.</v>

1643
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:21.110
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is he told me these things</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of matter of factly,</v>

1644
01:28:21.111 --> 01:28:21.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1645
01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:23.090
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1646
01:28:23.091 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like he was telling me these </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird things that happened to him,</v>

1647
01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:29.000
<v Speaker 3>although he was doing that to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree.</v>

1648
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:34.120
<v Speaker 3>I asked him a lot of questions about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he carved and what it all meant and</v>

1649
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1650
01:28:35.991 --> 01:28:38.900
<v Speaker 3>that was just part of his explanation of</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he did it and he,</v>

1651
01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:43.940
<v Speaker 3>he carved me a couple of doors that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have in my house and one of them is </v>

1652
01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:44.450
<v Speaker 3>quite interesting.</v>

1653
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:45.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1654
01:28:45.291 --> 01:28:50.291
<v Speaker 3>to make a panel and they're an </v>
<v Speaker 3>underwater scene and under the water </v>

1655
01:28:50.331 --> 01:28:55.331
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of mythical monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are killer whales and I </v>

1656
01:28:55.331 --> 01:28:57.980
<v Speaker 3>think there's an octopus down there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>carved in this particular style.</v>

1657
01:28:57.981 --> 01:29:01.350
<v Speaker 3>And he said that the other thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to him when he dreams as he goes</v>

1658
01:29:01.351 --> 01:29:05.160
<v Speaker 3>down to the bottom of the water where </v>
<v Speaker 3>these mythical creatures are and he gets</v>

1659
01:29:05.161 --> 01:29:10.161
<v Speaker 3>inspiration from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I thought that was extremely </v>

1660
01:29:10.161 --> 01:29:10.330
<v Speaker 3>interesting to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1661
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:14.280
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what a mind that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyper civilized,</v>

1662
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:19.310
<v Speaker 3>let's say hyper literate like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like our minds are because we're so </v>

1663
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 3>bombarded by external stimuli can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea what the natural mind is</v>

1664
01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:26.010
<v Speaker 3>like really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it was quite interesting to,</v>

1665
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:31.760
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to listen to that and also to see the </v>

1666
01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.220
<v Speaker 3>consequences because you quite a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's quite a great carver.</v>

1667
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:36.270
<v Speaker 3>So the first is ecstatic dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trances visions.</v>

1668
01:29:36.271 --> 01:29:38.670
<v Speaker 3>The second is traditional shamanic </v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques,</v>

1669
01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:42.540
<v Speaker 3>names and functions of the spirits and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythology and genealogy of the clan.</v>

1670
01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:47.670
<v Speaker 3>A secret language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This twofold teaching imparted by the </v>

1671
01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:48.510
<v Speaker 3>spirits and the old masters Sherman's </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitutes initiation.</v>

1672
01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:49.470
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1673
01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern people have a problem with that </v>

1674
01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:54.920
<v Speaker 3>because we don't really get initiated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say</v>

1675
01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:57.860
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1676
01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:05.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that we're each on a quest of </v>

1677
01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:05.200
<v Speaker 3>some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be here,</v>

1678
01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't think if you weren't because why</v>
<v Speaker 3>else would you be here,</v>

1679
01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.910
<v Speaker 3>can you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're on a quest of some sort to</v>

1680
01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.820
<v Speaker 3>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to struggle with the meaning of life,</v>

1681
01:30:13.821 --> 01:30:18.821
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you don't want to do that alone </v>

1682
01:30:18.821 --> 01:30:20.570
<v Speaker 3>because you only last 70 years and good </v>
<v Speaker 3>luck figuring it out on your,</v>

1683
01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:22.370
<v Speaker 3>on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not going to happen.</v>

1684
01:30:22.371 --> 01:30:25.070
<v Speaker 3>It's too complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'll be too isolated,</v>

1685
01:30:25.130 --> 01:30:26.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's just you,</v>

1686
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:29.510
<v Speaker 3>that's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's no one can stand that.</v>

1687
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:33.230
<v Speaker 3>And so you hope that other people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to tell you and that your culture</v>

1688
01:30:33.231 --> 01:30:34.460
<v Speaker 3>has something to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1689
01:30:34.461 --> 01:30:39.461
<v Speaker 3>so you're on a quest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not with the same intensity as a </v>

1690
01:30:39.461 --> 01:30:39.950
<v Speaker 3>shamonic initiate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1691
01:30:39.951 --> 01:30:44.951
<v Speaker 3>let's give you some credit and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're also trying to understand the </v>

1692
01:30:44.951 --> 01:30:45.800
<v Speaker 3>wisdom of the past.</v>

1693
01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:47.990
<v Speaker 3>And that's the second part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1694
01:30:47.991 --> 01:30:52.991
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you're a human being and human </v>

1695
01:30:52.991 --> 01:30:52.991
<v Speaker 3>beings have been telling stories for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long period of time trying to figure out</v>

1696
01:30:52.991 --> 01:30:57.521
<v Speaker 3>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how to orient </v>

1697
01:30:57.521 --> 01:30:57.521
<v Speaker 3>themselves in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

1698
01:30:57.521 --> 01:31:01.840
<v Speaker 3>partly what you're doing here is exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the shamonic initiate does in the </v>

1699
01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.321
<v Speaker 3>second part of the process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to expose yourself to the </v>

1700
01:31:05.321 --> 01:31:08.240
<v Speaker 3>degree that you can to names and </v>
<v Speaker 3>functions of the spirits,</v>

1701
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:12.290
<v Speaker 3>mythology and genealogy of the clan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the secret language.</v>

1702
01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:17.800
<v Speaker 3>This twofold teaching imparted by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirits and the old master shamans </v>

1703
01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.460
<v Speaker 3>constitutes initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1704
01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.660
<v Speaker 3>that's the rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1705
01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:25.550
<v Speaker 3>That's what initiation is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's being born again and,</v>

1706
01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:28.460
<v Speaker 3>and that's the birth of the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than over the body.</v>

1707
01:31:28.461 --> 01:31:31.430
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's the rebirth of an integrated</v>

1708
01:31:31.431 --> 01:31:36.431
<v Speaker 3>psyche that's one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and a psyche that's that's </v>

1709
01:31:36.431 --> 01:31:39.230
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also grounded in common humanity and</v>

1710
01:31:39.231 --> 01:31:42.500
<v Speaker 3>the wisdom of common humanity and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you strong,</v>

1711
01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:47.920
<v Speaker 3>or at least it makes you stronger </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's a limit to your </v>

1712
01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.831
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but God only knows to some degree what </v>

1713
01:31:50.831 --> 01:31:50.831
<v Speaker 3>that limit is.</v>

1714
01:31:50.831 --> 01:31:51.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can be unbelievably tough,</v>

1715
01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:55.910
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's even more admirable for</v>

1716
01:31:55.911 --> 01:32:00.610
<v Speaker 3>human beings to be tough because we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>so conscious of we can be hurt and we're</v>

1717
01:32:00.611 --> 01:32:03.580
<v Speaker 3>so conscious of what that hurt can lead </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1718
01:32:03.581 --> 01:32:06.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have your family taken away from</v>

1719
01:32:06.011 --> 01:32:11.011
<v Speaker 3>you and you can be destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that you can be courageous </v>

1720
01:32:11.011 --> 01:32:13.150
<v Speaker 3>in the face of that at all is something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is absolutely unbelievable.</v>

1721
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people deserve a lot more credit,</v>

1722
01:32:15.431 --> 01:32:20.431
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than people give themselves because the </v>

1723
01:32:20.431 --> 01:32:23.740
<v Speaker 3>fact that we can be honorable under </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions of life and death,</v>

1724
01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of suffering.</v>

1725
01:32:25.271 --> 01:32:30.271
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a testament to the human spirit </v>

1726
01:32:30.271 --> 01:32:33.450
<v Speaker 3>and there's a profound anti human ethos </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that pervades our culture.</v>

1727
01:32:34.571 --> 01:32:39.571
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that considers human beings cancers on </v>

1728
01:32:39.571 --> 01:32:39.571
<v Speaker 3>the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

1729
01:32:39.571 --> 01:32:40.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there should be less of us.</v>

1730
01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:45.600
<v Speaker 3>It's the same spirit that motivated the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who wrote the book about it better </v>

1731
01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.100
<v Speaker 3>to have never been and it's like I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>see it that way.</v>

1732
01:32:48.101 --> 01:32:48.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1733
01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:52.390
<v Speaker 3>I think people do pretty well for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1734
01:32:52.391 --> 01:32:55.640
<v Speaker 3>for having their leg caught in a bear </v>
<v Speaker 3>trap and their head caught in advice.</v>

1735
01:32:55.690 --> 01:32:59.380
<v Speaker 3>They're actually doing pretty well </v>
<v Speaker 3>because life is really hard and the fact</v>

1736
01:32:59.381 --> 01:33:04.381
<v Speaker 3>that we're not absolutely brutal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderous all the time is really </v>

1737
01:33:04.381 --> 01:33:06.670
<v Speaker 3>something remarkable given what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually have to contend with it.</v>

1738
01:33:06.671 --> 01:33:11.671
<v Speaker 3>We can go out of our way to be honest </v>
<v Speaker 3>and generous and altruistic and to care </v>

1739
01:33:11.671 --> 01:33:16.591
<v Speaker 3>for each other and under unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>dire circumstances and to act nobody </v>

1740
01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.790
<v Speaker 3>sometimes under the most trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions,</v>

1741
01:33:18.791 --> 01:33:21.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and soldier in the Gulag archipelago.</v>

1742
01:33:21.131 --> 01:33:24.420
<v Speaker 3>He tells story after story of people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>acted a bismal Lee,</v>

1743
01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:29.670
<v Speaker 3>but also people who under the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>threats imaginable never sacrificed </v>

1744
01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:30.820
<v Speaker 3>their character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1745
01:33:30.821 --> 01:33:32.260
<v Speaker 3>in reading about that is really.</v>

1746
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:37.810
<v Speaker 3>While it really makes you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it does,</v>

1747
01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:43.650
<v Speaker 3>the future shamans among the tongue </v>
<v Speaker 3>tongass as they approach maturity go </v>

1748
01:33:43.650 --> 01:33:46.951
<v Speaker 3>through a hysterical or history crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes their vocation manifests </v>

1749
01:33:46.951 --> 01:33:47.050
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At an earlier age,</v>

1750
01:33:47.290 --> 01:33:50.560
<v Speaker 3>the boy runs away into the mountains and</v>
<v Speaker 3>remains there for a week or more feeding</v>

1751
01:33:50.561 --> 01:33:52.960
<v Speaker 3>on animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he tears to pieces with his teeth.</v>

1752
01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.940
<v Speaker 3>He returns to the village filthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodstained,</v>

1753
01:33:56.950 --> 01:34:01.950
<v Speaker 3>and it's only after 10 or more days that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have passed that he begins to babble </v>

1754
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:04.300
<v Speaker 3>incoherent words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The strange behavior of future showman's</v>

1755
01:34:04.301 --> 01:34:09.301
<v Speaker 3>has not failed to attract the attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>of scholars and from the middle of the </v>

1756
01:34:09.301 --> 01:34:13.290
<v Speaker 3>past century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>several attempts have been made to </v>

1757
01:34:13.290 --> 01:34:13.290
<v Speaker 3>explain the phenomena as a mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>disorder,</v>

1758
01:34:13.290 --> 01:34:14.710
<v Speaker 3>but the problem was wrongly put four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the one hand,</v>

1759
01:34:14.711 --> 01:34:19.711
<v Speaker 3>it is not true that showman's always are</v>
<v Speaker 3>always have to be neuropathic in </v>

1760
01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 3>mentally deranged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

1761
01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:27.660
<v Speaker 3>and this is the critical issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those among them who had been able to </v>

1762
01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:28.600
<v Speaker 3>become shamans precisely because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had succeeded in becoming cured,</v>

1763
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.890
<v Speaker 3>so it was.</v>

1764
01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:35.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not the descent into this strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>subterranean psychological state that </v>

1765
01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:38.650
<v Speaker 3>constitutes the transformation that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes the showman,</v>

1766
01:34:38.651 --> 01:34:43.651
<v Speaker 3>but it's the emergence back out of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a journey to the underworld </v>

1767
01:34:43.651 --> 01:34:43.651
<v Speaker 3>and and a rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1768
01:34:43.651 --> 01:34:48.451
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this great book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a great book by a guy named </v>

1769
01:34:48.451 --> 01:34:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Henri Ellenberger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay,</v>

1770
01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:52.840
<v Speaker 3>and he was an existential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychoanalyst and philosopher,</v>

1771
01:34:52.841 --> 01:34:55.420
<v Speaker 3>and he wrote a book called the discovery</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the unconscious,</v>

1772
01:34:55.421 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 3>which I would highly recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on my list of recommended readings.</v>

1773
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:02.960
<v Speaker 3>It is a great book if you want to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the psychoanalytic tradition,</v>

1774
01:35:04.210 --> 01:35:09.210
<v Speaker 3>it's the best introduction there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he discusses Adler and young and </v>

1775
01:35:09.210 --> 01:35:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Freud and does a very credible job of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all three,</v>

1776
01:35:11.331 --> 01:35:15.350
<v Speaker 3>but also takes the history of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalytic thought back three or 400</v>

1777
01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:18.680
<v Speaker 3>years before Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's very engaging,</v>

1778
01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:20.040
<v Speaker 3>reading and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1779
01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:21.740
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and very interesting.</v>

1780
01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:26.100
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things Ellenberg shape </v>
<v Speaker 3>points out quite clearly is an.</v>

1781
01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:31.150
<v Speaker 3>And he associates this to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the shamanic tradition that both </v>

1782
01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:34.541
<v Speaker 3>Freud and young union particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>underwent very intense periods of </v>

1783
01:35:34.541 --> 01:35:36.530
<v Speaker 3>psychological disturbance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

1784
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:40.670
<v Speaker 3>And I would say what was happening is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because they were questioning their</v>

1785
01:35:40.671 --> 01:35:45.671
<v Speaker 3>axioms at the most fundamental level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were deranging their cognitive and </v>

1786
01:35:45.671 --> 01:35:46.760
<v Speaker 3>perceptual structures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1787
01:35:46.761 --> 01:35:51.761
<v Speaker 3>And Ewan was also experimenting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginative techniques with visionary </v>

1788
01:35:51.761 --> 01:35:55.721
<v Speaker 3>techniques which he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he did a lot and there was a </v>

1789
01:35:55.721 --> 01:35:56.720
<v Speaker 3>period of his life where he was having </v>
<v Speaker 3>constant,</v>

1790
01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.960
<v Speaker 3>a constant stream of visions which you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote down in a book called the red </v>

1791
01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.151
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time he was still </v>

1792
01:36:05.151 --> 01:36:06.350
<v Speaker 3>functioning as a psychiatrist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>operating normally in the world.</v>

1793
01:36:06.351 --> 01:36:07.080
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1794
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:10.460
<v Speaker 3>people have suggested that what he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a psychotic break.</v>

1795
01:36:10.461 --> 01:36:12.260
<v Speaker 3>But that's ridiculous because you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1796
01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:14.060
<v Speaker 3>that's not how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1797
01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.500
<v Speaker 3>If you're having a psychotic break,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1798
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:17.600
<v Speaker 3>you're not being an effective </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrist.</v>

1799
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:22.750
<v Speaker 3>Those things do not go together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially not for a long period of </v>

1800
01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:22.750
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there,</v>

1801
01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:27.070
<v Speaker 3>there's the possibility of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience without cyclocross </v>

1802
01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.510
<v Speaker 3>psychopathology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1803
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:31.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Burgy,</v>

1804
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.420
<v Speaker 3>he says much the same thing about Freud </v>
<v Speaker 3>and about Charles Darwin as well,</v>

1805
01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:38.030
<v Speaker 3>who underwent a terrible period of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1806
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:42.560
<v Speaker 3>of mental confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

1807
01:36:42.561 --> 01:36:45.500
<v Speaker 3>as a consequence of formulating his </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory of evolution,</v>

1808
01:36:45.501 --> 01:36:47.210
<v Speaker 3>which was really hard on him because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a,</v>

1809
01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.660
<v Speaker 3>he was a die hard Christian and he knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he knew,</v>

1810
01:36:50.661 --> 01:36:52.880
<v Speaker 3>what the implications of his theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

1811
01:36:52.881 --> 01:36:54.470
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know what to do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1812
01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.210
<v Speaker 3>so it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard on him.</v>

1813
01:36:56.211 --> 01:37:01.160
<v Speaker 3>So it's quite common for people of </v>
<v Speaker 3>genius to go through an intense crisis,</v>

1814
01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:04.580
<v Speaker 3>psychological crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then resolve that.</v>

1815
01:37:04.581 --> 01:37:06.650
<v Speaker 3>And the genius is in the resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1816
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.800
<v Speaker 3>The precondition for the genius is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>disillusion in some sense because you </v>

1817
01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.491
<v Speaker 3>have to be obsessed with a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to grip you completely before </v>

1818
01:37:15.491 --> 01:37:19.031
<v Speaker 3>you're going to concentrate on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So obsessively that you might come up </v>

1819
01:37:19.031 --> 01:37:21.941
<v Speaker 3>with a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's the people who come up with a </v>

1820
01:37:21.941 --> 01:37:24.140
<v Speaker 3>solution that are the prophets in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharmane and so forth and so on and,</v>

1821
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:25.940
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's not.</v>

1822
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:28.760
<v Speaker 3>This isn't something that only </v>
<v Speaker 3>characterizes our cultures.</v>

1823
01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:31.610
<v Speaker 3>We just don't recognize it in our own </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture properly,</v>

1824
01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.730
<v Speaker 3>and that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1825
01:37:34.731 --> 01:37:37.670
<v Speaker 3>sometimes we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1826
01:37:37.671 --> 01:37:38.710
<v Speaker 3>You remember that in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1827
01:37:38.730 --> 01:37:39.860
<v Speaker 3>in the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1828
01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.890
<v Speaker 3>That he shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the chairman,</v>

1829
01:37:41.891 --> 01:37:42.480
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1830
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:47.510
<v Speaker 3>he brings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he brings a Simba down that tunnel dark </v>

1831
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:48.770
<v Speaker 3>tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the dark night of the soul.</v>

1832
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:52.730
<v Speaker 3>He has them reflect upon himself in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pool when he reflects upon himself,</v>

1833
01:37:52.731 --> 01:37:57.731
<v Speaker 3>deeply sees the reflection of his father</v>
<v Speaker 3>then becomes a core thing of cosmic </v>

1834
01:37:57.731 --> 01:38:01.851
<v Speaker 3>significance and his father appears in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sky just like God appears to Jacob </v>

1835
01:38:02.491 --> 01:38:07.491
<v Speaker 3>and basically tells them that it's time </v>
<v Speaker 3>for him to grow the hell up and to </v>

1836
01:38:07.491 --> 01:38:09.900
<v Speaker 3>return to the devastated kingdom and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>set it right.</v>

1837
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so and that's right.</v>

1838
01:38:12.931 --> 01:38:14.160
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1839
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:19.190
<v Speaker 3>we live in the devastated kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an eternal truth and it's the </v>

1840
01:38:19.190 --> 01:38:22.941
<v Speaker 3>responsibility of the individual to grow</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hell up and to set it right because </v>

1841
01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.860
<v Speaker 3>when it's devastated and when things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in place,</v>

1842
01:38:25.861 --> 01:38:30.861
<v Speaker 3>then everyone suffers too much and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good and there's no excuse </v>

1843
01:38:30.861 --> 01:38:34.620
<v Speaker 3>for not doing something about it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have anything better to do so.</v>

1844
01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:39.360
<v Speaker 3>And even like children's movies tell you</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1845
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:44.870
<v Speaker 3>So this is a fun one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is from the ead wind salter,</v>

1846
01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:49.800
<v Speaker 3>ninth to twelfth century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how Adam and eve,</v>

1847
01:38:49.801 --> 01:38:54.300
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is speculation that the fruit that</v>

1848
01:38:54.301 --> 01:38:57.360
<v Speaker 3>they're eating there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see these psilocybin mushrooms,</v>

1849
01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:03.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they're the only kind of </v>

1850
01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:04.911
<v Speaker 3>mushroom that girl like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty wild you might say.</v>

1851
01:39:06.210 --> 01:39:11.210
<v Speaker 3>And then this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called banisteriopsis vine </v>

1852
01:39:11.210 --> 01:39:12.240
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's what Iowasca is made out of and</v>

1853
01:39:12.241 --> 01:39:14.490
<v Speaker 3>it has this double helix forum which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1854
01:39:14.970 --> 01:39:15.960
<v Speaker 3>very interesting.</v>

1855
01:39:16.230 --> 01:39:17.730
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that natives,</v>

1856
01:39:17.731 --> 01:39:21.000
<v Speaker 3>nobody could figure out how the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>they made this Iowasca which,</v>

1857
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:24.480
<v Speaker 3>which transports people spiritually in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very intense manner.</v>

1858
01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:26.220
<v Speaker 3>And there's a whole religion based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1859
01:39:26.770 --> 01:39:31.770
<v Speaker 3>like a modern religion as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>archaic religion and to to to make this </v>

1860
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:35.811
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to take two plants that don't </v>

1861
01:39:35.811 --> 01:39:37.581
<v Speaker 3>grow anywhere near each other and like </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a million plants in the </v>

1862
01:39:37.581 --> 01:39:38.490
<v Speaker 3>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like how do you figure that out?</v>

1863
01:39:38.491 --> 01:39:43.491
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to cook them in this </v>

1864
01:39:43.491 --> 01:39:45.741
<v Speaker 3>very particular way for a particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of time before you produce this </v>

1865
01:39:45.741 --> 01:39:47.610
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the plants has dmt in it,</v>

1866
01:39:47.611 --> 01:39:51.240
<v Speaker 3>which is a very intense psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very short acting and the other</v>

1867
01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:56.241
<v Speaker 3>has a Mao inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you take the DMT and you take the </v>

1868
01:39:56.241 --> 01:39:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Mao inhibitor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the DMT trip lasts for much longer.</v>

1869
01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:01.470
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what these Amazonian </v>
<v Speaker 3>natives figured out.</v>

1870
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:04.620
<v Speaker 3>No one has any idea how they managed it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you ask them,</v>

1871
01:40:04.621 --> 01:40:06.780
<v Speaker 3>they tell you that the plants told them </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to do it,</v>

1872
01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.320
<v Speaker 3>which isn't much of an explanation as </v>
<v Speaker 3>far as modern people are concerned.</v>

1873
01:40:10.321 --> 01:40:14.700
<v Speaker 3>But then when modern people take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>IOWASCA and the plant,</v>

1874
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.800
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts to talk to them.</v>

1875
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:21.910
<v Speaker 3>There are a little less leery of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole theory that the plants had </v>

1876
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:22.120
<v Speaker 3>something to do with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1877
01:40:22.121 --> 01:40:26.370
<v Speaker 3>and these things that these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm loath to talk about this because I'm</v>

1878
01:40:26.371 --> 01:40:29.580
<v Speaker 3>not an advocate for drug use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by the same token,</v>

1879
01:40:29.581 --> 01:40:32.610
<v Speaker 3>you can't ignore empirical data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not reasonable,</v>

1880
01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:38.240
<v Speaker 3>and the empirical data that psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>substances can produce mystical </v>

1881
01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:40.110
<v Speaker 3>experiences and that those often have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformative effect.</v>

1882
01:40:40.111 --> 01:40:45.111
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the latest study showed that if </v>

1883
01:40:45.111 --> 01:40:46.941
<v Speaker 3>you took people who were dying of cancer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you and you gave them silicide been </v>

1884
01:40:46.941 --> 01:40:50.270
<v Speaker 3>in a sufficient dose to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mystical experience that you radically.</v>

1885
01:40:50.271 --> 01:40:53.560
<v Speaker 3>It decreased their fear of death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

1886
01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:56.290
<v Speaker 2>you gotta think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1887
01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:58.390
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's tough.</v>

1888
01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:01.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just wouldn't expect that,</v>

1889
01:41:01.431 --> 01:41:06.431
<v Speaker 2>that you think you take someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do range them intensely and then </v>

1890
01:41:06.431 --> 01:41:08.380
<v Speaker 2>when they come back they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though they're dying,</v>

1891
01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:10.800
<v Speaker 2>they're not nearly as afraid of dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1892
01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:14.170
<v Speaker 2>you got to kind of wake up and smell the</v>
<v Speaker 2>roses when you see something like that.</v>

1893
01:41:14.171 --> 01:41:17.140
<v Speaker 2>And the people who are doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>research are very reliable people.</v>

1894
01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:22.040
<v Speaker 2>So there's the Amanita Mascara,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1895
01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:24.080
<v Speaker 2>there's this old idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite a funny idea.</v>

1896
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Toadstools so flies like avenue to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mascara and there are some,</v>

1897
01:41:29.490 --> 01:41:32.510
<v Speaker 2>this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some evidence that they actually</v>

1898
01:41:32.511 --> 01:41:36.200
<v Speaker 2>liked getting stoned so because animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>will eat these,</v>

1899
01:41:36.201 --> 01:41:39.590
<v Speaker 2>like reindeer will eat these things too </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they get pretty tripped out by them.</v>

1900
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:42.920
<v Speaker 2>And so I have this book on psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>use among animals,</v>

1901
01:41:42.921 --> 01:41:44.540
<v Speaker 2>which is a small book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1902
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.930
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's that,</v>

1903
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea that toads used to sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the they haven't eaten miscarry </v>

1904
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.230
<v Speaker 2>and wait for the stone flies to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>bought badly around them and then snap </v>

1905
01:41:57.230 --> 01:41:58.670
<v Speaker 2>them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty funny.</v>

1906
01:41:58.910 --> 01:42:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I think can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1907
01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.380
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are mushrooms in,</v>

1908
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:07.760
<v Speaker 2>in the US that are the oldest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oldest organisms on the planet.</v>

1909
01:42:07.761 --> 01:42:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one mushroom,</v>

1910
01:42:08.841 --> 01:42:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it covers something like,</v>

1911
01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1912
01:42:12.861 --> 01:42:17.861
<v Speaker 2>like square hundreds of square miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this huge thing because it's </v>

1913
01:42:17.861 --> 01:42:17.900
<v Speaker 2>all underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1914
01:42:17.901 --> 01:42:20.150
<v Speaker 2>And they have these very complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>networks of,</v>

1915
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:24.740
<v Speaker 2>of Mycelia they're called and they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is like 150,000</v>

1916
01:42:24.741 --> 01:42:26.090
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1917
01:42:26.091 --> 01:42:29.630
<v Speaker 2>So there's plenty of things about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that we don't know,</v>

1918
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:34.990
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the chemical makeup of the </v>

1919
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 2>classic psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see they all have the same </v>

1920
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 2>fundamental structure.</v>

1921
01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.730
<v Speaker 2>This is Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one of the major brain </v>

1922
01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:45.611
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens with the </v>

1923
01:42:45.611 --> 01:42:46.100
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they alter the,</v>

1924
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:49.540
<v Speaker 2>they alter the brain function by </v>
<v Speaker 2>altering the,</v>

1925
01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:53.480
<v Speaker 2>the neurochemical utilization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin.</v>

1926
01:42:53.570 --> 01:42:56.480
<v Speaker 2>They changed the manner in which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonergic systems work.</v>

1927
01:42:56.510 --> 01:43:01.510
<v Speaker 2>And that is the serotonin system is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic system may because when you're an </v>

1928
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:05.441
<v Speaker 2>embryo and your brain is developing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the serotonin projections that </v>

1929
01:43:05.441 --> 01:43:06.830
<v Speaker 2>basically orchestrate the development of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain.</v>

1930
01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.440
<v Speaker 2>So they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're very archaic circuits,</v>

1931
01:43:09.441 --> 01:43:10.940
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very archaic circuits.</v>

1932
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:15.390
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the paper,</v>

1933
01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:18.420
<v Speaker 2>I think I stole this from silicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Griffiths,</v>

1934
01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:21.030
<v Speaker 2>who's been doing a lot of this research </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide can occasion,</v>

1935
01:43:21.031 --> 01:43:26.031
<v Speaker 2>mystical type experiences having </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantial and sustained personal </v>

1936
01:43:26.031 --> 01:43:28.850
<v Speaker 2>meaning and spiritual significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why,</v>

1937
01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:31.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1938
01:43:31.411 --> 01:43:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Like so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's a question for you.</v>

1939
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:37.500
<v Speaker 2>It is beyond dispute that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>are capable of religious experience.</v>

1940
01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

1941
01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1942
01:43:42.731 --> 01:43:47.731
<v Speaker 2>you can associate with psychosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't work is the theory </v>

1943
01:43:47.731 --> 01:43:48.610
<v Speaker 2>doesn't hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The theory doesn't hold water.</v>

1944
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:51.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why is it there?</v>

1945
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:54.310
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

1946
01:43:54.311 --> 01:43:56.710
<v Speaker 2>it's not an easy thing to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been trying to figure.</v>

1947
01:43:56.711 --> 01:43:59.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm always trying to figure it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological explanation for everything,</v>

1948
01:43:59.321 --> 01:44:01.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you want to find something to</v>

1949
01:44:01.211 --> 01:44:03.300
<v Speaker 2>stand on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to make sure that it can resist</v>

1950
01:44:03.301 --> 01:44:08.301
<v Speaker 2>a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if I can find an explanation for </v>

1951
01:44:08.301 --> 01:44:08.950
<v Speaker 2>something that's reductionistic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>materialistic and biological,</v>

1952
01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:11.500
<v Speaker 2>then I'm going for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a tough one.</v>

1953
01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness is a tough one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moral sense is a tough one.</v>

1954
01:44:15.611 --> 01:44:18.490
<v Speaker 2>They're not easy things to crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Big Bang is a tough one.</v>

1955
01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:19.660
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1956
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:28.950
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A cynic might say that maybe sometimes </v>

1957
01:44:29.401 --> 01:44:32.940
<v Speaker 2>when people are close to suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have a mystical experience,</v>

1958
01:44:32.941 --> 01:44:34.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you maybe you say,</v>

1959
01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:39.561
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a last ditch attempt of your brain </v>

1960
01:44:39.561 --> 01:44:40.620
<v Speaker 2>to delude you into thinking that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life has some significance,</v>

1961
01:44:40.621 --> 01:44:43.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that's a plausible theory,</v>

1962
01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:48.420
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it accounts for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>generality of the phenomena.</v>

1963
01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:52.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't buy it.</v>

1964
01:44:56.950 --> 01:45:01.950
<v Speaker 2>What happens in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manic experiences that the Scherman has </v>

1965
01:45:02.611 --> 01:45:06.000
<v Speaker 2>the experience of being reduced to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeleton first.</v>

1966
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:11.510
<v Speaker 2>So death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a death experience on very realistic </v>

1967
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:14.931
<v Speaker 2>death experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing that happens is </v>

1968
01:45:14.931 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 2>that he finds himself in a place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's communing with his ancestral,</v>

1969
01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:22.560
<v Speaker 2>the ancestral spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after that there's the climbing</v>

1970
01:45:22.631 --> 01:45:25.720
<v Speaker 2>of something like the ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jacob's ladder say,</v>

1971
01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:30.190
<v Speaker 2>and an encounter with God for all </v>
<v Speaker 2>intents and purposes.</v>

1972
01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.880
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very widespread phenomena.</v>

1973
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:39.870
<v Speaker 2>It's the world tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought about this a lot,</v>

1974
01:45:39.871 --> 01:45:40.830
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what this,</v>

1975
01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:47.560
<v Speaker 2>what this represents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to a Yak who'd informant </v>

1976
01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.100
<v Speaker 2>that's in Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spirits carry the future showman to </v>

1977
01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:50.240
<v Speaker 2>hell and shove them in a house for three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1978
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Here he undergoes is initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The spirits cut off his head,</v>

1979
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:56.000
<v Speaker 2>which they set off to one side for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>novice,</v>

1980
01:45:56.001 --> 01:45:58.850
<v Speaker 2>must watch his own dismemberment with </v>
<v Speaker 2>his own eyes,</v>

1981
01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:02.060
<v Speaker 2>disillusion to the primary elements in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense,</v>

1982
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:07.270
<v Speaker 2>and hack his body to bits which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>later distributed among the spirits of </v>

1983
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:10.481
<v Speaker 2>various sicknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only on this condition that the </v>

1984
01:46:10.481 --> 01:46:13.271
<v Speaker 2>future showman will obtain the power of </v>
<v Speaker 2>healing his bones then covered with new </v>

1985
01:46:13.271 --> 01:46:15.050
<v Speaker 2>flesh and his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some Casey has also given new blood,</v>

1986
01:46:15.110 --> 01:46:20.110
<v Speaker 2>so there's a death and resurrection </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that's associated with this </v>

1987
01:46:20.110 --> 01:46:23.161
<v Speaker 2>shamanic ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're here in the presence of a very </v>

1988
01:46:25.211 --> 01:46:27.940
<v Speaker 2>ancient religious idea which belongs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hunter culture.</v>

1989
01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Bone symbolizes the final route of </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal life.</v>

1990
01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:33.520
<v Speaker 2>The mold from which the flesh </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually rises.</v>

1991
01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:36.820
<v Speaker 2>It is from the bone that men and animals</v>
<v Speaker 2>are reborn for a time.</v>

1992
01:46:36.821 --> 01:46:39.310
<v Speaker 2>They maintain themselves in an existence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the flesh.</v>

1993
01:46:39.311 --> 01:46:44.311
<v Speaker 2>Then they die and their life is reduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the essence concentrated in the </v>

1994
01:46:44.311 --> 01:46:44.860
<v Speaker 2>skeleton from which they will be born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1995
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:52.020
<v Speaker 2>a good graphic representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1996
01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:57.480
<v Speaker 2>It's an old painting by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Hieronymus Bosch,</v>

1997
01:46:57.481 --> 01:47:02.481
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really liked that because it's </v>

1998
01:47:02.481 --> 01:47:05.430
<v Speaker 2>reminiscent of the near death </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences that you hear people </v>

1999
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.430
<v Speaker 2>describe and they're quite common as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2000
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:06.420
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2001
01:47:06.421 --> 01:47:09.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a very weird experience once.</v>

2002
01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've told you this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2003
01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:16.980
<v Speaker 2>I was assessing someone who had gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a car windshield and he was very</v>

2004
01:47:16.981 --> 01:47:19.260
<v Speaker 2>depressed and had happened a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

2005
01:47:19.290 --> 01:47:22.830
<v Speaker 2>but he was very depressed and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance company was basically accusing</v>

2006
01:47:22.831 --> 01:47:26.970
<v Speaker 2>him of a malingering because he'd been </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed for so long and you know,</v>

2007
01:47:26.971 --> 01:47:30.390
<v Speaker 2>he'd sort of healed up and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if your left hemisphere is damaged,</v>

2008
01:47:30.391 --> 01:47:32.340
<v Speaker 2>especially the frontal part of your left</v>
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere,</v>

2009
01:47:32.341 --> 01:47:35.970
<v Speaker 2>then you can be in a chronic state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression because the left hemisphere,</v>

2010
01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:39.300
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is responsible for positive emotion.</v>

2011
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:42.330
<v Speaker 2>And so if it isn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's like negative emotion for you.</v>

2012
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:45.780
<v Speaker 2>And so I went and assessed him and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving him this,</v>

2013
01:47:45.930 --> 01:47:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the MMPI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Minnesota multiphasic personality </v>

2014
01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:52.020
<v Speaker 2>inventory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a kind of a standard,</v>

2015
01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:56.790
<v Speaker 2>a path personality test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half psychopathology test.</v>

2016
01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.460
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was filling it out.</v>

2017
01:47:59.461 --> 01:48:01.380
<v Speaker 2>He was a very serious guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle aged guy.</v>

2018
01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:04.860
<v Speaker 2>Nothing about him was new age in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>

2019
01:48:04.861 --> 01:48:09.861
<v Speaker 2>He was like an accountant I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in fact he was an accountant if </v>

2020
01:48:09.861 --> 01:48:09.861
<v Speaker 2>I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2021
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:15.950
<v Speaker 2>and there was one question and it said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my spirit has left my body.</v>

2022
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:18.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very close.</v>

2023
01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:22.110
<v Speaker 2>And he stopped and he asked me what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2024
01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.910
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure how to answer this.</v>

2025
01:48:23.911 --> 01:48:26.130
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2026
01:48:26.131 --> 01:48:26.850
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

2027
01:48:26.851 --> 01:48:29.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I went through the car windshield,</v>

2028
01:48:29.101 --> 01:48:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I was in a coma for three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2029
01:48:32.250 --> 01:48:37.250
<v Speaker 2>And I died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said he died three times and </v>

2030
01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:40.821
<v Speaker 2>he said that he could remember he </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't remember anything during that </v>

2031
01:48:40.821 --> 01:48:41.880
<v Speaker 2>period of time and he couldn't remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>the car accident.</v>

2032
01:48:41.881 --> 01:48:44.970
<v Speaker 2>That's retrograde amnesia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite common with head injuries.</v>

2033
01:48:45.450 --> 01:48:48.480
<v Speaker 2>And he said that during one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

2034
01:48:48.481 --> 01:48:50.190
<v Speaker 2>and this is all he remembered from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital,</v>

2035
01:48:50.191 --> 01:48:55.191
<v Speaker 2>was that he came out of his body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>went down the tunnel of light.</v>

2036
01:48:56.251 --> 01:49:01.251
<v Speaker 2>You've heard these near death </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences and then saw his family </v>

2037
01:49:01.251 --> 01:49:01.950
<v Speaker 2>members there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the heavenly light,</v>

2038
01:49:01.951 --> 01:49:06.030
<v Speaker 2>and then realize that it wasn't his time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and came back to his body.</v>

2039
01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Now what was interesting about this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that,</v>

2040
01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:09.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2041
01:49:10.050 --> 01:49:12.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't ask him about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2042
01:49:12.271 --> 01:49:17.271
<v Speaker 2>He basically volunteered this story and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was instigated by this question and,</v>

2043
01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:22.200
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't know that anybody else had</v>
<v Speaker 2>any hey,</v>

2044
01:49:22.201 --> 01:49:27.201
<v Speaker 2>ever had an experience like that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked him if he'd ever heard anything </v>

2045
01:49:27.201 --> 01:49:27.201
<v Speaker 2>about like that.</v>

2046
01:49:27.201 --> 01:49:28.230
<v Speaker 2>And he said No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was interesting.</v>

2047
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:31.830
<v Speaker 2>But what really was interesting is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell did he remember that?</v>

2048
01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he had amnesia during that </v>

2049
01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:37.970
<v Speaker 2>entire period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in a bloody coma.</v>

2050
01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:40.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like he didn't remember anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>but he remembered that.</v>

2051
01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:46.280
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well those experiences are more common </v>

2052
01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:47.610
<v Speaker 2>than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a,</v>

2053
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:50.090
<v Speaker 2>there's a painting of one which is quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

2054
01:49:50.091 --> 01:49:53.500
<v Speaker 2>And that's like a tunnel to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same basic idea.</v>

2055
01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:56.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit more suffering going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on in this one I think.</v>

2056
01:49:56.050 --> 01:49:58.540
<v Speaker 2>But that's pretty much typical of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hieronymus Bosch.</v>

2057
01:49:58.541 --> 01:50:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what was up with that guy,</v>

2058
01:50:00.191 --> 01:50:03.340
<v Speaker 2>but he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one strange character.</v>

2059
01:50:04.690 --> 01:50:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Now the scandinavians have this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the world is a tree,</v>

2060
01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:14.550
<v Speaker 2>and I've been thinking about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the tree idea tree is </v>

2061
01:50:15.551 --> 01:50:19.450
<v Speaker 2>something that is grounded in in matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

2062
01:50:19.451 --> 01:50:22.540
<v Speaker 2>and that reaches up to heaven in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scandinavian tree at the bottom.</v>

2063
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.250
<v Speaker 2>There's quite a cool idea at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

2064
01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:29.460
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tree is constantly being nod by </v>

2065
01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.741
<v Speaker 2>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can sort of see the snakes at the </v>

2066
01:50:31.741 --> 01:50:33.841
<v Speaker 2>bottom and at the same time it's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>watered and the water makes the tree </v>

2067
01:50:33.841 --> 01:50:34.810
<v Speaker 2>grow at the same rate that the snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2068
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:37.420
<v Speaker 2>on its roots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a Yin Yang idea.</v>

2069
01:50:37.421 --> 01:50:42.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's continual chaotic </v>

2070
01:50:42.421 --> 01:50:43.180
<v Speaker 2>destruction and replacement at the basis</v>
<v Speaker 2>of whatever this process is.</v>

2071
01:50:43.450 --> 01:50:45.730
<v Speaker 2>But the tree seems to me to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation,</v>

2072
01:50:45.731 --> 01:50:50.080
<v Speaker 2>not so much of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a different dimensional space.</v>

2073
01:50:50.081 --> 01:50:52.030
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's trying to be represented.</v>

2074
01:50:52.031 --> 01:50:54.880
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your structured,</v>

2075
01:50:55.600 --> 01:51:00.600
<v Speaker 2>if you take powers of 10 magnification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say human beings are boat in the middle </v>

2076
01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.640
<v Speaker 2>of the tiniest thing and the largest </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing if you do it by,</v>

2077
01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.940
<v Speaker 2>by powers of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you know,</v>

2078
01:51:05.941 --> 01:51:10.760
<v Speaker 2>you have a subatomic level and an atomic</v>
<v Speaker 2>level molecular level and you know,</v>

2079
01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:11.500
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2080
01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:17.340
<v Speaker 2>that are maybe the level of organs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's you and then there's your </v>

2081
01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:21.010
<v Speaker 2>family and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way up the tree fundamentally.</v>

2082
01:51:21.070 --> 01:51:26.070
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that what this tree </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents and this is the things that </v>

2083
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:28.150
<v Speaker 2>thing that the shaman moves up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it represents.</v>

2084
01:51:28.151 --> 01:51:30.160
<v Speaker 2>It's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this different view of,</v>

2085
01:51:30.810 --> 01:51:33.280
<v Speaker 2>of its dimensionality at something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2086
01:51:33.281 --> 01:51:38.281
<v Speaker 2>And I think that what happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experiences that </v>

2087
01:51:38.281 --> 01:51:38.350
<v Speaker 2>consciousness can travel up and down </v>
<v Speaker 2>that structure.</v>

2088
01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.320
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe not only up and down it,</v>

2089
01:51:41.321 --> 01:51:45.160
<v Speaker 2>but maybe right through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a radical claim.</v>

2090
01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:48.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a really radical claim and it might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be wrong,</v>

2091
01:51:48.610 --> 01:51:52.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably wrong even because </v>
<v Speaker 2>most radical claims are wrong,</v>

2092
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:54.980
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2093
01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:05.870
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not so sure it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's something cool.</v>

2094
01:52:07.230 --> 01:52:12.230
<v Speaker 2>So that's the Scandinavian world tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was drawn by an anthropologist </v>

2095
01:52:12.641 --> 01:52:15.940
<v Speaker 2>who visited the tribes in the Amazon who</v>
<v Speaker 2>use IOWASCA.</v>

2096
01:52:21.250 --> 01:52:23.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it's a snake.</v>

2097
01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:25.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a tree with snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2098
01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:30.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's reminiscent of the story of Adam </v>

2099
01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.510
<v Speaker 2>and Eve obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also reminiscent of our primate</v>

2100
01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:32.530
<v Speaker 2>dwelling place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2101
01:52:32.531 --> 01:52:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Because that was basically our ancestral</v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

2102
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:40.000
<v Speaker 2>a tree surrounded by snakes and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes like to eat us and this is a long</v>

2103
01:52:40.001 --> 01:52:41.050
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like</v>

2104
01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 2>50 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really a long time ago.</v>

2105
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:50.090
<v Speaker 2>And so we don't know where these images </v>
<v Speaker 2>come from precisely,</v>

2106
01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:55.480
<v Speaker 2>but I do have the suspicion that we use </v>
<v Speaker 2>the circuitry that we developed to </v>

2107
01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:02.500
<v Speaker 2>detect snakes to represent the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 2>as such because it like a snake is </v>

2108
01:53:03.141 --> 01:53:06.200
<v Speaker 2>something that comes out of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like we evolved,</v>

2109
01:53:06.201 --> 01:53:11.201
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all evolved out of an animal </v>

2110
01:53:11.201 --> 01:53:12.980
<v Speaker 2>substructure and so we had to get our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our biological cognitive structure from </v>

2111
01:53:13.971 --> 01:53:18.971
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and we have this capacity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the absolute unknown and </v>

2112
01:53:18.971 --> 01:53:19.810
<v Speaker 2>the terrorists that are involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2113
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:24.870
<v Speaker 2>that the horrors that can emerge from </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we don't understand and it stands </v>

2114
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:27.620
<v Speaker 2>perfectly the reason that we would use </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuits that were already pre developed</v>

2115
01:53:27.621 --> 01:53:32.621
<v Speaker 2>for that and that this is a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the existential </v>

2116
01:53:32.621 --> 01:53:34.340
<v Speaker 2>structure of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2117
01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think I might've showed you this </v>

2118
01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:41.830
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it never ceases to amaze me this,</v>

2119
01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:45.640
<v Speaker 2>this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my son drew this when he was nine,</v>

2120
01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:50.700
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on the right you see mushroom </v>

2121
01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:53.521
<v Speaker 2>houses and they have the names of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>his friends on them and so that's order,</v>

2122
01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:59.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on the left side you see chaos </v>

2123
01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:02.761
<v Speaker 2>there and that little orange thing is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bug and then there's a river that runs </v>

2124
01:54:02.761 --> 01:54:03.460
<v Speaker 2>right down the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's like the,</v>

2125
01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:09.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Yin Yang symbol with the divided in </v>

2126
01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:09.420
<v Speaker 2>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's quite cool.</v>

2127
01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:09.730
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is,</v>

2128
01:54:09.731 --> 01:54:12.820
<v Speaker 2>there's Jacob's ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jack and the beanstalk,</v>

2129
01:54:12.821 --> 01:54:17.821
<v Speaker 2>which is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another variant of the same shamonic </v>

2130
01:54:17.821 --> 01:54:20.800
<v Speaker 2>story and there are bugs going up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>down it and then they're taking messages</v>

2131
01:54:20.801 --> 01:54:25.801
<v Speaker 2>from heaven and then up there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't got the sun and there's St Peter</v>

2132
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:28.600
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know where in the world he </v>
<v Speaker 2>got this.</v>

2133
01:54:28.601 --> 01:54:30.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he had a lot of religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

2134
01:54:30.701 --> 01:54:33.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean despite me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2135
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:39.390
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the pearly gates up there and </v>

2136
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:41.201
<v Speaker 2>then that was the world as far as his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a very well ordered psyche I </v>

2137
01:54:41.201 --> 01:54:43.270
<v Speaker 2>would say and still does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he drew that,</v>

2138
01:54:43.271 --> 01:54:47.320
<v Speaker 2>it just absolutely blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I had it laminated and it's in my</v>

2139
01:54:47.321 --> 01:54:49.960
<v Speaker 2>office because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2140
01:54:49.961 --> 01:54:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell do you make of that?</v>

2141
01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:52.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2142
01:54:53.010 --> 01:54:55.060
<v Speaker 2>that's why so.</v>

2143
01:55:06.750 --> 01:55:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Well you sort of get the picture there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2144
01:55:08.461 --> 01:55:13.461
<v Speaker 2>the cathedral is the great cathedrals of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe or they're like the forest in </v>

2145
01:55:14.011 --> 01:55:14.850
<v Speaker 2>stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2146
01:55:14.851 --> 01:55:19.851
<v Speaker 2>And they try to represent the light </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming through the leaves and so it's </v>

2147
01:55:19.851 --> 01:55:21.360
<v Speaker 2>sort of our ancestral forest home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2148
01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.600
<v Speaker 2>it's transformed into these great </v>
<v Speaker 2>sculptures of stone and you know,</v>

2149
01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.800
<v Speaker 2>they produce all because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of light and darkness and </v>

2150
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:34.371
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also I think for the same reason </v>

2151
01:55:34.371 --> 01:55:34.440
<v Speaker 2>that huge trees produce Roi and people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2152
01:55:34.441 --> 01:55:37.440
<v Speaker 2>and we don't want them cut down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem sacred in some sense.</v>

2153
01:55:37.441 --> 01:55:42.140
<v Speaker 2>And perhaps they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>

2154
01:55:42.190 --> 01:55:43.800
<v Speaker 2>And it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2155
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:48.810
<v Speaker 4>this is an intuition that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the architects of these great cathedrals</v>

2156
01:55:48.811 --> 01:55:53.811
<v Speaker 4>were trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to express something </v>

2157
01:55:53.811 --> 01:55:54.570
<v Speaker 4>that's deep and structural heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying,</v>

2158
01:55:54.571 --> 01:55:56.580
<v Speaker 4>trying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to express the idea that if being</v>

2159
01:55:56.581 --> 01:56:01.581
<v Speaker 4>was constituted properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it would be organized from the </v>

2160
01:56:01.581 --> 01:56:05.580
<v Speaker 4>subatomic level all the way up to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highest cosmic level perfectly.</v>

2161
01:56:05.581 --> 01:56:09.620
<v Speaker 4>So every layer stacked on top of each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other without any contradictions.</v>

2162
01:56:09.621 --> 01:56:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Now that would be an ideal mode of being</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything would come together under</v>

2163
01:56:14.131 --> 01:56:19.131
<v Speaker 4>those circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what's being expressed in </v>

2164
01:56:19.131 --> 01:56:22.041
<v Speaker 4>these cathedrals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not all that's being expressed </v>

2165
01:56:22.041 --> 01:56:22.041
<v Speaker 4>because they're also shaped like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cross.</v>

2166
01:56:22.041 --> 01:56:26.061
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that the center of the </v>

2167
01:56:26.061 --> 01:56:26.061
<v Speaker 4>Cross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the center of suffering,</v>

2168
01:56:26.061 --> 01:56:29.070
<v Speaker 4>is also the place of the individual and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the place where the transformation takes</v>

2169
01:56:29.071 --> 01:56:34.071
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all built into the architecture </v>

2170
01:56:34.071 --> 01:56:34.071
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2171
01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:41.910
<v Speaker 2>then there's the tree like structures </v>
<v Speaker 2>that make us up.</v>

2172
01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:48.680
<v Speaker 2>It's stretched down to the tiniest </v>
<v Speaker 2>realities,</v>

2173
01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.050
<v Speaker 2>the microcosm,</v>

2174
01:56:57.010 --> 01:56:58.810
<v Speaker 2>and there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea,</v>

2175
01:56:58.811 --> 01:57:00.730
<v Speaker 2>it's all represented in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2176
01:57:00.731 --> 01:57:03.700
<v Speaker 2>it's this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the Mandela up in the top,</v>

2177
01:57:03.701 --> 01:57:08.701
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea of perfection of </v>

2178
01:57:08.701 --> 01:57:10.630
<v Speaker 2>crystalline structure and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Yogis are trying to attain when they</v>

2179
01:57:10.631 --> 01:57:13.480
<v Speaker 2>organize their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to get every single layer</v>

2180
01:57:13.481 --> 01:57:16.750
<v Speaker 2>of there being aligned properly and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

2181
01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:19.450
<v Speaker 2>and you can kind of see an echo of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the.</v>

2182
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:24.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a Tibetan sand painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly on the on the </v>

2183
01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:29.880
<v Speaker 2>bottom left idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you get yourself aligned </v>

2184
01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:30.700
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the information can flow along that</v>

2185
01:57:30.701 --> 01:57:33.160
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's you without,</v>

2186
01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:36.970
<v Speaker 2>without impediment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

2187
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:42.270
<v Speaker 2>And that would be like a state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimal health and that both physical </v>

2188
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:47.191
<v Speaker 2>and spiritual exercises can put you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that state and that's while those are </v>

2189
01:57:47.191 --> 01:57:49.840
<v Speaker 2>all clouds of ideas that surround this </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of a ladder to heaven.</v>

2190
01:57:51.970 --> 01:57:56.270
<v Speaker 2>So Jacob is talking to God and God says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behold,</v>

2191
01:57:56.271 --> 01:58:01.271
<v Speaker 2>I am with thee and I will keep the in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all places where you go and bring you </v>

2192
01:58:01.271 --> 01:58:05.501
<v Speaker 2>again into this land for I won't leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>you until I have done that which I have </v>

2193
01:58:05.501 --> 01:58:07.160
<v Speaker 2>spoken to you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob awakened out of his sleep</v>

2194
01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:10.840
<v Speaker 2>had he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surely the Lord is in this place.</v>

2195
01:58:10.841 --> 01:58:12.670
<v Speaker 2>And I knew what not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was afraid and said,</v>

2196
01:58:12.671 --> 01:58:17.671
<v Speaker 2>how dreadful is this place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is none other but the house of God </v>

2197
01:58:17.671 --> 01:58:17.980
<v Speaker 2>and this is the gate of heaven.</v>

2198
01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:21.500
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob rose up early in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and took the stone.</v>

2199
01:58:21.501 --> 01:58:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Then he had put for his pillows and set </v>
<v Speaker 2>it up for a pillar and poured oil on top</v>

2200
01:58:25.251 --> 01:58:26.960
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sacrifice.</v>

2201
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:29.690
<v Speaker 2>And he called the name of that place </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bethel,</v>

2202
01:58:29.691 --> 01:58:32.060
<v Speaker 2>but the name of the city was called Luz </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the first.</v>

2203
01:58:32.061 --> 01:58:37.061
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob vowed a vow saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if God will be with me and will keep me </v>

2204
01:58:37.061 --> 01:58:41.111
<v Speaker 2>in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I go and will give me bread to eat </v>

2205
01:58:41.111 --> 01:58:42.790
<v Speaker 2>and Raymond to put on so that I come </v>
<v Speaker 2>again to my father's house in peace,</v>

2206
01:58:42.791 --> 01:58:45.670
<v Speaker 2>then shall the Lord be my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this stone,</v>

2207
01:58:45.671 --> 01:58:47.920
<v Speaker 2>which I have said for a pillar shall be </v>
<v Speaker 2>God's house.</v>

2208
01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:50.410
<v Speaker 2>And they'll have all of that that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>given to me.</v>

2209
01:58:50.411 --> 01:58:55.411
<v Speaker 2>I will surely give the 10th unto Thee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a pretty good place to stop.</v>

2210
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:59.950
<v Speaker 2>So now I'll just</v>

2211
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:06.440
<v Speaker 2>conclude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have this very morally ambivalent</v>

2212
01:59:06.441 --> 01:59:11.441
<v Speaker 2>character who's so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everything he's done that </v>

2213
01:59:11.441 --> 01:59:13.560
<v Speaker 2>we're familiar with is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>

2214
01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:15.890
<v Speaker 2>he's betrayed his brother horribly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice,</v>

2215
01:59:15.891 --> 01:59:20.891
<v Speaker 2>badly enough so that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his brother wants to kill him and </v>

2216
01:59:20.891 --> 01:59:21.770
<v Speaker 2>everyone can kind of sympathize with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

2217
01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:27.340
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he runs away essentially </v>

2218
01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:30.100
<v Speaker 2>because his mother tells him to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not exactly a testament to his </v>

2219
01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:30.560
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And despite that,</v>

2220
01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:34.130
<v Speaker 2>strangely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has this experience,</v>

2221
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:37.130
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's heartening,</v>

2222
01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:39.410
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the point,</v>

2223
01:59:39.411 --> 01:59:44.411
<v Speaker 2>is that people are predisposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible error.</v>

2224
01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:49.780
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet when I was writing my latest </v>

2225
01:59:51.081 --> 01:59:52.340
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend of mine,</v>

2226
01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Norman Doidge wrote the foreword and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Norman has written a couple of great </v>

2227
01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:02.501
<v Speaker 2>books and he's Jewish and he read some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what I'd written and he took me to </v>

2228
02:00:03.321 --> 02:00:06.410
<v Speaker 2>task for making the God of the Old </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>

2229
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:07.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a Christian perspective,</v>

2230
02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:13.060
<v Speaker 2>too harsh and unforgiving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I rewrote a fair bit of it because </v>

2231
02:00:13.191 --> 02:00:16.160
<v Speaker 2>of his criticism and because of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned doing these lectures.</v>

2232
02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:18.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2233
02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:22.100
<v Speaker 2>What happens in the Old Testament is if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you screw up,</v>

2234
02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:27.160
<v Speaker 2>especially if you know you do and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide that you're not going to do </v>

2235
02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:27.530
<v Speaker 2>anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's conscious and deliberate,</v>

2236
02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:32.980
<v Speaker 2>then look the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are in serious trouble and I </v>

2237
02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:34.460
<v Speaker 2>actually think that's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically accurate.</v>

2238
02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:39.490
<v Speaker 2>One of the things young pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's always struck me was that if </v>

2239
02:00:39.490 --> 02:00:41.600
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually in the gospel of Thomas</v>

2240
02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:43.160
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly enough,</v>

2241
02:00:43.161 --> 02:00:48.161
<v Speaker 2>is one of the gnostic gospels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ tells his followers something </v>

2242
02:00:48.161 --> 02:00:48.530
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make a mistake and you don't know</v>

2243
02:00:48.531 --> 02:00:50.750
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'll be forgiven for it,</v>

2244
02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:55.130
<v Speaker 2>but if you make a mistake knowing what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing and you do it anyways,</v>

2245
02:00:55.131 --> 02:00:57.910
<v Speaker 2>then like good luck to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2246
02:00:58.440 --> 02:00:58.910
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2247
02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:00.710
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

2248
02:01:01.250 --> 02:01:03.020
<v Speaker 2>that's psychologically accurate.</v>

2249
02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2250
02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:12.590
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the judgemental God in</v>

2251
02:01:12.591 --> 02:01:17.591
<v Speaker 2>the Old Testament however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that he can be bargained with and </v>

2252
02:01:17.591 --> 02:01:21.760
<v Speaker 2>even if you make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're unconscious of </v>

2253
02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:22.130
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't learned yet,</v>

2254
02:01:22.131 --> 02:01:27.131
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you will always have the </v>

2255
02:01:27.131 --> 02:01:27.680
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to return to the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

2256
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get cynical about that because </v>

2257
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:35.261
<v Speaker 2>there's no this mostly Christian idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could live a terribly sinful </v>

2258
02:01:35.261 --> 02:01:35.970
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you repented on your deathbed,</v>

2259
02:01:36.050 --> 02:01:37.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like heaven for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2260
02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:39.740
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like great deal,</v>

2261
02:01:39.741 --> 02:01:44.741
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can do whatever the hell </v>

2262
02:01:44.741 --> 02:01:46.901
<v Speaker 2>you want until just before you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you might not know when that </v>

2263
02:01:46.901 --> 02:01:46.901
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a problem.</v>

2264
02:01:46.901 --> 02:01:47.780
<v Speaker 2>You then you can just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2265
02:01:47.781 --> 02:01:49.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know everything's forgiven,</v>

2266
02:01:49.761 --> 02:01:54.761
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with being cynical about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing is that it's no </v>

2267
02:01:54.761 --> 02:01:55.900
<v Speaker 2>trivial matter to repent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2268
02:01:55.940 --> 02:02:00.940
<v Speaker 2>because to repent means a figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you actually did and the worst </v>

2269
02:02:01.130 --> 02:02:06.130
<v Speaker 2>things that you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more horrible it is to figure it </v>

2270
02:02:06.130 --> 02:02:06.130
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2271
02:02:06.130 --> 02:02:06.320
<v Speaker 2>It's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2272
02:02:06.321 --> 02:02:11.321
<v Speaker 2>And there's no genuine repentance </v>
<v Speaker 2>without understanding of the depth of </v>

2273
02:02:11.321 --> 02:02:15.010
<v Speaker 2>your depravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you lived to particularly </v>

2274
02:02:15.010 --> 02:02:17.690
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible life and you come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it,</v>

2275
02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:20.300
<v Speaker 2>I think that in and of itself could kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2276
02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:24.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrible thing to wake up and see</v>

2277
02:02:24.471 --> 02:02:27.380
<v Speaker 2>what you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If what you've done is truly terrible,</v>

2278
02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:31.970
<v Speaker 2>so there's no easy way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an easy out.</v>

2279
02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:36.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just pure cynicism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To associate that idea with an easy out.</v>

2280
02:02:36.111 --> 02:02:41.111
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is that positive idea that </v>

2281
02:02:41.111 --> 02:02:45.460
<v Speaker 2>it's continually represented is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual is the source of moral choice</v>

2282
02:02:46.130 --> 02:02:51.130
<v Speaker 2>and the individual is prone to genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>error and temptation in a believable and</v>

2283
02:02:53.361 --> 02:02:58.361
<v Speaker 2>realistic way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that that doesn't sever the </v>

2284
02:02:58.361 --> 02:02:59.510
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the individual and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the divine.</v>

2285
02:02:59.570 --> 02:03:02.510
<v Speaker 2>And the possibility of further growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I would say,</v>

2286
02:03:02.511 --> 02:03:04.520
<v Speaker 2>well thank God for that because without </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2287
02:03:04.521 --> 02:03:06.290
<v Speaker 2>like who would have a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2288
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Who would have a chance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that the daddy as </v>

2289
02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>presented the infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say as presented in the Old </v>

2290
02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is merely judgmental,</v>

2291
02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:17.890
<v Speaker 2>is definitely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2292
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 2>and is in fact something that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>contend with and arguing with.</v>

2293
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll close with one thing.</v>

2294
02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:29.380
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I learned while I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going through this was the meaning </v>

2295
02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:31.650
<v Speaker 2>of the name Israel because Jacob </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually it gets named Israel and,</v>

2296
02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:35.060
<v Speaker 2>and I'm jumping ahead a little bit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next lecture,</v>

2297
02:03:35.061 --> 02:03:40.061
<v Speaker 2>but Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's also the father of Israel </v>

2298
02:03:40.061 --> 02:03:42.230
<v Speaker 2>and the father of the 12 sons who make </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the 12 tribes of Israel.</v>

2299
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:45.350
<v Speaker 2>But what Israel means is he who </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggles with God.</v>

2300
02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:50.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's such an interesting idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's again a psychological idea.</v>

2301
02:03:50.241 --> 02:03:55.241
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I said earlier that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't obvious in the old testament what </v>

2302
02:03:55.241 --> 02:03:55.760
<v Speaker 2>it means to believe in God.</v>

2303
02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Because what Jacob does a struggle with </v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

2304
02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's a really good </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterization of an ethical life </v>

2305
02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.180
<v Speaker 2>because if you're trying to lead an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical life,</v>

2306
02:04:05.181 --> 02:04:10.181
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're doing is you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're struggling like blind belief </v>

2307
02:04:10.181 --> 02:04:11.690
<v Speaker 2>isn't helpful because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're believing in,</v>

2308
02:04:11.691 --> 02:04:15.440
<v Speaker 2>like it's just not that helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're possessed by,</v>

2309
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:18.530
<v Speaker 2>by the desire to orient yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

2310
02:04:18.531 --> 02:04:23.531
<v Speaker 2>but also confused by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the existential structure of the </v>

2311
02:04:23.531 --> 02:04:23.531
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we all are,</v>

2312
02:04:23.531 --> 02:04:28.160
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what you're doing when you're </v>

2313
02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:28.850
<v Speaker 2>trying to orient yourself properly in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is struggling ethically.</v>

2314
02:04:29.530 --> 02:04:32.510
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob actually gets quite hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrestles with God.</v>

2315
02:04:32.511 --> 02:04:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Literally God dislocates his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

2316
02:04:35.810 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 2>his thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so know the idea there is</v>

2317
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:39.990
<v Speaker 3>watch the hail out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2318
02:04:39.991 --> 02:04:43.260
<v Speaker 3>The thing that you're contending with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his powerful,</v>

2319
02:04:43.261 --> 02:04:46.290
<v Speaker 3>although you can contend with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing that's so interesting,</v>

2320
02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:48.780
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it at some genuine peril,</v>

2321
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:52.140
<v Speaker 3>which I think is exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that Israel.</v>

2322
02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:54.270
<v Speaker 3>So there's Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the state,</v>

2323
02:04:54.271 --> 02:04:56.340
<v Speaker 3>let's say in Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the promised land and all of that,</v>

2324
02:04:56.341 --> 02:04:58.530
<v Speaker 3>but there's this more important idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is again,</v>

2325
02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:01.560
<v Speaker 3>a psychological idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the state of Israel,</v>

2326
02:05:01.561 --> 02:05:06.561
<v Speaker 3>which is the promised land is the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>that everyone who wrestles with God </v>

2327
02:05:06.561 --> 02:05:10.980
<v Speaker 3>exists in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not happy,</v>

2328
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:14.370
<v Speaker 3>naive belief in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2329
02:05:14.371 --> 02:05:16.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an eternally blessed afterlife.</v>

2330
02:05:16.951 --> 02:05:19.170
<v Speaker 3>It's not that it's not a wish </v>
<v Speaker 3>fulfillment,</v>

2331
02:05:19.171 --> 02:05:24.171
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to be actively engaged in life and </v>

2332
02:05:24.171 --> 02:05:25.230
<v Speaker 3>the difficulties of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2333
02:05:25.410 --> 02:05:30.360
<v Speaker 3>And trying to find the path because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what wrestling with God is trying</v>

2334
02:05:30.361 --> 02:05:31.500
<v Speaker 3>to find the path.</v>

2335
02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:36.380
<v Speaker 3>And that seems to me what belief means </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally in the Old Testament,</v>

2336
02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:41.400
<v Speaker 3>perhaps in the new testament as well as </v>
<v Speaker 3>that belief is expressed in trying to </v>

2337
02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:46.251
<v Speaker 3>find the path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's an ethical struggle and it's </v>

2338
02:05:46.251 --> 02:05:46.530
<v Speaker 3>a real struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the struggle of life.</v>

2339
02:05:46.531 --> 02:05:49.350
<v Speaker 3>So as long as you're willing to engage </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that struggle,</v>

2340
02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:53.250
<v Speaker 3>then hypothetically you have the divine </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind you.</v>

2341
02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:59.120
<v Speaker 3>And so I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's true because the other </v>

2342
02:06:00.241 --> 02:06:04.290
<v Speaker 3>thing I see is that the people who set </v>
<v Speaker 3>things right,</v>

2343
02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:06.060
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2344
02:06:06.061 --> 02:06:07.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2345
02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:11.360
<v Speaker 3>the horrible forces of cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction don't do us see,</v>

2346
02:06:11.361 --> 02:06:16.361
<v Speaker 3>and the people who are trying to set </v>
<v Speaker 3>things right are the ones that are </v>

2347
02:06:16.361 --> 02:06:19.341
<v Speaker 3>struggling ethically and so and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a redemptive element to that </v>

2348
02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:22.320
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think there's any way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being cynical about that.</v>

2349
02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:25.870
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2350
02:06:25.890 --> 02:06:26.850
<v Speaker 3>so thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will.</v>

2351
02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2352
02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:54.930
<v Speaker 3>So remember to speak right into the mic </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there are all these other people</v>

2353
02:06:54.931 --> 02:06:57.540
<v Speaker 3>watching that will hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will hear us.</v>

2354
02:06:58.440 --> 02:06:59.250
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2355
02:07:00.610 --> 02:07:04.000
<v Speaker 5>Hi Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So with the story of Jacob today,</v>

2356
02:07:04.001 --> 02:07:09.001
<v Speaker 5>there was a theme of betrayal and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can see that from the beginning because </v>

2357
02:07:09.001 --> 02:07:10.900
<v Speaker 5>he was very angry and jealous of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>brother and I was thinking are there any</v>

2358
02:07:10.901 --> 02:07:13.720
<v Speaker 5>stores or Wakening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say about betrayal that does come from a</v>

2359
02:07:13.721 --> 02:07:14.800
<v Speaker 5>loved one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2360
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:18.340
<v Speaker 5>Where it's not from a place of soul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>black and white of anger,</v>

2361
02:07:18.370 --> 02:07:20.730
<v Speaker 5>resentment and bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how the parties,</v>

2362
02:07:21.130 --> 02:07:23.560
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of recover from that.</v>

2363
02:07:23.561 --> 02:07:26.210
<v Speaker 5>Or is there any way to renamed up or is </v>
<v Speaker 5>it as black and whites?</v>

2364
02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:29.240
<v Speaker 5>If you'll be traced on one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it's like Jacob where he's.</v>

2365
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:30.340
<v Speaker 5>He was bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was born</v>

2366
02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:31.250
<v Speaker 3>hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2367
02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:36.280
<v Speaker 3>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this story it's not black and white </v>

2368
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:36.400
<v Speaker 3>because we know we're only halfway</v>

2369
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:40.990
<v Speaker 2>through it and one of the things I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed as a clinician,</v>

2370
02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:46.050
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that an as an observer of people in </v>

2371
02:07:46.050 --> 02:07:49.111
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I've never ever seen anyone get </v>

2372
02:07:49.111 --> 02:07:50.800
<v Speaker 2>away with anything and Jacob doesn't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>away with any of this.</v>

2373
02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:54.790
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2374
02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:59.791
<v Speaker 2>he's humbled by his eventual experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he learns that he did it wrong and </v>

2375
02:08:00.131 --> 02:08:03.520
<v Speaker 2>there's reconciliation that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the story of Jacob.</v>

2376
02:08:04.090 --> 02:08:09.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's minor betrayals and major </v>

2377
02:08:09.090 --> 02:08:09.090
<v Speaker 2>betrayals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2378
02:08:09.090 --> 02:08:12.601
<v Speaker 2>that some of them have tremendously </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious consequences in some of them </v>

2379
02:08:12.601 --> 02:08:16.111
<v Speaker 2>have lesser consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is an underlying idea that </v>

2380
02:08:16.111 --> 02:08:17.470
<v Speaker 2>things can still be set right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though it's.</v>

2381
02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes Jacob some 20 years,</v>

2382
02:08:21.971 --> 02:08:26.320
<v Speaker 2>something like that to set things right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even then it's like touch and go.</v>

2383
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:30.070
<v Speaker 2>So if I answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2384
02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2385
02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:37.380
<v Speaker 2>you speak frequently in your lectures </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2386
02:08:37.470 --> 02:08:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I guess the war between good and evil or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the struggle of life really is a </v>

2387
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:47.121
<v Speaker 2>struggle between good and evil being at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the core of a conscious lived existence </v>

2388
02:08:47.610 --> 02:08:52.610
<v Speaker 2>and I guess on that note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were 100 percent certain that </v>

2389
02:08:56.581 --> 02:09:01.581
<v Speaker 2>there was no afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you still be able to preach that </v>

2390
02:09:01.581 --> 02:09:02.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a positive meeting in life?</v>

2391
02:09:03.090 --> 02:09:08.090
<v Speaker 2>If you're a 100 percent certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some atheists seem to be 100 percent </v>

2392
02:09:08.090 --> 02:09:10.710
<v Speaker 2>certain and yet they still preach that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some positive meaning to life.</v>

2393
02:09:10.711 --> 02:09:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Would you be one of those or would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn into cane?</v>

2394
02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:15.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so cynical.</v>

2395
02:09:15.870 --> 02:09:18.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as far as I'm concerned,</v>

2396
02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:23.900
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 2>studying 20th century history is that </v>

2397
02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:27.360
<v Speaker 2>like even if the idea that even if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take the most cynical of ideas,</v>

2398
02:09:27.361 --> 02:09:32.361
<v Speaker 2>let's say that life is irredeemable </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering and and perhaps isn't even </v>

2399
02:09:32.361 --> 02:09:37.131
<v Speaker 2>justified because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still seems to me that you have an </v>

2400
02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:40.170
<v Speaker 2>ethical duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

2401
02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:45.570
<v Speaker 2>to live in a manner that reduces that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the degree that that's possible.</v>

2402
02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:49.170
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that can be experienced</v>

2403
02:09:49.171 --> 02:09:54.171
<v Speaker 2>as meaningful in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>independently of the transcendent </v>

2404
02:09:54.171 --> 02:09:57.500
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't exactly know how to strip </v>

2405
02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:00.351
<v Speaker 2>off the transcendent context because one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things I would say that's </v>

2406
02:10:00.351 --> 02:10:02.850
<v Speaker 2>happened to me is because I've spent so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much time looking at the horrible things</v>

2407
02:10:02.851 --> 02:10:06.940
<v Speaker 2>that people have done is that it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>young said that he wanted.</v>

2408
02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:08.550
<v Speaker 2>This is one of his famous quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2409
02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:12.990
<v Speaker 2>no tree can reach up to heaven unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>its roots reached down to hell.</v>

2410
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:17.760
<v Speaker 2>And so as I've dug deeper into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>depravity of human beings,</v>

2411
02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:22.650
<v Speaker 2>my sense of the possibility of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings has also grown.</v>

2412
02:10:24.210 --> 02:10:29.210
<v Speaker 2>What would you say in proportion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>until I've become convinced actually </v>

2413
02:10:29.611 --> 02:10:31.740
<v Speaker 2>that good is a more powerful force than </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

2414
02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evil is an powerful force.</v>

2415
02:10:35.210 --> 02:10:37.490
<v Speaker 2>And so I can't really strip the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcended way.</v>

2416
02:10:37.491 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Now whether what bearing that has on </v>
<v Speaker 2>eternity say on an afterlife?</v>

2417
02:10:41.271 --> 02:10:42.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2418
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2419
02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't say anything about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I guess I can say is that</v>

2420
02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:51.620
<v Speaker 2>there are many things about being that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand in the least.</v>

2421
02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:56.090
<v Speaker 2>And we don't understand the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness or the nature of time.</v>

2422
02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:58.350
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2423
02:10:58.530 --> 02:11:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't despair about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

2424
02:11:00.621 --> 02:11:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I think that life can still be </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful without,</v>

2425
02:11:03.230 --> 02:11:06.920
<v Speaker 2>without there being a necessity of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterlife.</v>

2426
02:11:07.190 --> 02:11:11.480
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2427
02:11:11.481 --> 02:11:11.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2428
02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:12.690
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2429
02:11:17.530 --> 02:11:21.040
<v Speaker 6>By Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So since studying your work,</v>

2430
02:11:21.041 --> 02:11:26.041
<v Speaker 6>one of the things that I found most </v>
<v Speaker 6>fascinating is your analysis of the </v>

2431
02:11:26.041 --> 02:11:29.380
<v Speaker 6>story of Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And my question is,</v>

2432
02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:31.900
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

2433
02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:37.020
<v Speaker 6>if cain got to the point that he did </v>
<v Speaker 6>right before a killing his brother </v>

2434
02:11:38.801 --> 02:11:43.801
<v Speaker 6>murdering his ideal and decided that </v>
<v Speaker 6>that was something he didn't want to do,</v>

2435
02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:48.910
<v Speaker 6>what advice or guidance would you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would you give a person that got to that</v>

2436
02:11:48.911 --> 02:11:49.180
<v Speaker 6>point?</v>

2437
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a story I read called the </v>

2438
02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:04.760
<v Speaker 2>cocktail party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've mentioned this before by ts Elliot </v>

2439
02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:07.260
<v Speaker 2>in the cocktail party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a scene to play where this woman</v>

2440
02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:11.850
<v Speaker 2>approaches a psychiatrist in and starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to him about her problems.</v>

2441
02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:14.010
<v Speaker 2>And she said something that surprises </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2442
02:12:14.011 --> 02:12:16.710
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that I'm the problem.</v>

2443
02:12:17.110 --> 02:12:17.760
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2444
02:12:17.761 --> 02:12:19.650
<v Speaker 2>why would you hope that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>

2445
02:12:19.651 --> 02:12:20.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it a lot.</v>

2446
02:12:20.821 --> 02:12:24.990
<v Speaker 2>And if the world is the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm done because I can't change the</v>

2447
02:12:24.991 --> 02:12:26.460
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm the problem,</v>

2448
02:12:26.461 --> 02:12:31.461
<v Speaker 2>then maybe there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself I can change and I can undo this </v>

2449
02:12:31.461 --> 02:12:35.550
<v Speaker 2>terrible situation that I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say that's repentance.</v>

2450
02:12:35.551 --> 02:12:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there if,</v>

2451
02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:44.140
<v Speaker 2>and I say this carefully because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that people are susceptible </v>

2452
02:12:44.221 --> 02:12:46.200
<v Speaker 2>to bad fortune.</v>

2453
02:12:48.630 --> 02:12:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Sin and ignorance can make that worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but independently of that like good </v>

2454
02:12:53.630 --> 02:12:55.920
<v Speaker 2>people suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make no mistake about it,</v>

2455
02:12:56.700 --> 02:13:01.700
<v Speaker 2>but if things aren't right for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're resentful about being because </v>

2456
02:13:04.921 --> 02:13:09.921
<v Speaker 2>that's the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the deepest way of </v>

2457
02:13:09.921 --> 02:13:12.831
<v Speaker 2>thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you read the writings of the people </v>

2458
02:13:12.831 --> 02:13:13.410
<v Speaker 2>who do the mass killings for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you see over and over.</v>

2459
02:13:13.411 --> 02:13:18.411
<v Speaker 2>It's cane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they are angry beyond </v>

2460
02:13:18.411 --> 02:13:21.800
<v Speaker 2>comprehension at the intolerability of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being and they're angry at God.</v>

2461
02:13:22.350 --> 02:13:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Even if they don't say it exactly like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2462
02:13:23.911 --> 02:13:26.270
<v Speaker 2>they come so close to saying it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2463
02:13:26.271 --> 02:13:28.170
<v Speaker 2>that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no difference.</v>

2464
02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:35.120
<v Speaker 2>You know what God says?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain is look to yourself first before </v>

2465
02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:38.511
<v Speaker 2>you criticize being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that strikes me is right.</v>

2466
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:42.720
<v Speaker 2>It's because to not do that as arrogant </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond belief.</v>

2467
02:13:42.721 --> 02:13:47.721
<v Speaker 2>That's satanic arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally if something like that can be </v>

2468
02:13:47.721 --> 02:13:51.381
<v Speaker 2>literal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like don't make yourself the judge </v>

2469
02:13:51.381 --> 02:13:53.010
<v Speaker 2>of being before you clean up your your </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

2470
02:13:53.310 --> 02:13:58.310
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it because the other thing too is </v>

2471
02:13:58.310 --> 02:14:03.030
<v Speaker 2>this is something I learned in some part</v>
<v Speaker 2>from soldier Nixon when he was in the </v>

2472
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:06.411
<v Speaker 2>prison camps and trying to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>how these heroic people he saw could </v>

2473
02:14:06.411 --> 02:14:06.411
<v Speaker 2>possibly manage it.</v>

2474
02:14:06.411 --> 02:14:11.120
<v Speaker 2>One of the exercises he undertook and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>really viewed this within a Christian </v>

2475
02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox context of Repentance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>redemption,</v>

2476
02:14:13.230 --> 02:14:18.230
<v Speaker 2>is he said he went over his life with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine tooth comb and tried to imagine all</v>

2477
02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:24.651
<v Speaker 2>of the ethical mistakes he made in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire life that he knew were mistakes.</v>

2478
02:14:24.841 --> 02:14:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2479
02:14:25.230 --> 02:14:27.540
<v Speaker 2>there was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a soul search.</v>

2480
02:14:27.570 --> 02:14:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't relying on external standards of </v>

2481
02:14:32.570 --> 02:14:33.750
<v Speaker 2>morality except in so far as we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitably influenced by those.</v>

2482
02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:39.020
<v Speaker 2>And then his idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there something I could do right now </v>

2483
02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:41.460
<v Speaker 2>to put that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the right question.</v>

2484
02:14:41.461 --> 02:14:46.461
<v Speaker 2>Like if things aren't going your way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that means that you're </v>

2485
02:14:46.461 --> 02:14:50.331
<v Speaker 2>resentful and arrogant and deceitful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the three things that clump </v>

2486
02:14:50.331 --> 02:14:50.730
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that,</v>

2487
02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:53.340
<v Speaker 2>that constitute the core of evil at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2488
02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:57.390
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're possessed by that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a hell,</v>

2489
02:14:57.900 --> 02:14:59.640
<v Speaker 2>then it's repentance.</v>

2490
02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:04.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is you have to </v>

2491
02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:05.340
<v Speaker 2>figure out what you did wrong and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to pay for it,</v>

2492
02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:07.920
<v Speaker 2>and then at least you could think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

2493
02:15:07.921 --> 02:15:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I can try that with all of my soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say and see what happens.</v>

2494
02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:15.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could it be an experiment?</v>

2495
02:15:15.031 --> 02:15:17.190
<v Speaker 2>And then I would also say that that's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>act of faith.</v>

2496
02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:22.340
<v Speaker 2>It's an act of faith to conduct that </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment because you put yourself on </v>

2497
02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:22.340
<v Speaker 2>the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2498
02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's what an act of faith is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know the outcome,</v>

2499
02:15:24.630 --> 02:15:26.100
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know the outcome of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2500
02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:28.730
<v Speaker 2>So live in some sense as an act of </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith.</v>

2501
02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:32.310
<v Speaker 2>If you're putting faith in something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's why you're moving forward.</v>

2502
02:15:32.311 --> 02:15:34.710
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't move forward without an act</v>
<v Speaker 2>of faith.</v>

2503
02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:36.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people say,</v>

2504
02:15:36.331 --> 02:15:41.331
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only move forward on the basis of the </v>

2505
02:15:41.331 --> 02:15:41.331
<v Speaker 2>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2506
02:15:41.331 --> 02:15:44.151
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you select the facts and there's an </v>

2507
02:15:44.151 --> 02:15:44.151
<v Speaker 2>infinity of facts and they don't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you what to do.</v>

2508
02:15:44.151 --> 02:15:48.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a credible answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in that situation,</v>

2509
02:15:48.271 --> 02:15:52.600
<v Speaker 2>it's like look to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2510
02:15:52.930 --> 02:15:57.930
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things about soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 2>nets that's a bloody amazing is that's </v>

2511
02:15:57.930 --> 02:16:01.161
<v Speaker 2>what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he wrote the Gulag archipelago </v>

2512
02:16:01.161 --> 02:16:03.441
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took an ax to the intellectual and </v>

2513
02:16:03.441 --> 02:16:05.880
<v Speaker 2>moral substructure of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the totalitarian communist states.</v>

2514
02:16:06.450 --> 02:16:11.450
<v Speaker 2>So while he was redeeming himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say he was simultaneously </v>

2515
02:16:11.450 --> 02:16:14.190
<v Speaker 2>redeeming the world and you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

2516
02:16:14.191 --> 02:16:15.720
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to wake up,</v>

2517
02:16:15.721 --> 02:16:16.590
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2518
02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:22.090
<v Speaker 2>that was really something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2519
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:33.870
<v Speaker 7>Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have a lot of questions that arise </v>

2520
02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:33.870
<v Speaker 7>from your comments that the bell for 100</v>
<v Speaker 7>event,</v>

2521
02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:38.401
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm one of three video your recent </v>

2522
02:16:38.401 --> 02:16:40.111
<v Speaker 7>discussion with Ayaan Hirsi Ali and your</v>
<v Speaker 7>comments on Islam and the West in </v>

2523
02:16:40.111 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 7>general.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And in your comments there's this common</v>

2524
02:16:41.111 --> 02:16:43.420
<v Speaker 7>theme that one of these things is not </v>
<v Speaker 7>like the other.</v>

2525
02:16:43.421 --> 02:16:47.470
<v Speaker 7>You put the Judeo Christian tradition on</v>
<v Speaker 7>the one side and Islam on the other,</v>

2526
02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:52.800
<v Speaker 7>specifically the quote complex problem </v>
<v Speaker 7>of Islam and the quote as a quote </v>

2527
02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:54.220
<v Speaker 7>totalizing system.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Before I go further,</v>

2528
02:16:54.221 --> 02:16:58.300
<v Speaker 7>let me state that if hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a final analysis of Islam resulted in as</v>

2529
02:16:58.301 --> 02:17:02.110
<v Speaker 7>total denunciation as your analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 7>postmodernism or neo Marxism,</v>

2530
02:17:02.350 --> 02:17:03.790
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't be personally offended at </v>
<v Speaker 7>all.</v>

2531
02:17:03.791 --> 02:17:08.791
<v Speaker 7>This isn't a a personal question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In your recent interview with ion or </v>

2532
02:17:08.791 --> 02:17:13.220
<v Speaker 7>shelly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>she said Western values are superior to </v>

2533
02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:14.080
<v Speaker 7>Islamic law and Islamic values.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I agree with that.</v>

2534
02:17:14.110 --> 02:17:15.730
<v Speaker 7>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>certainly in the context of,</v>

2535
02:17:15.731 --> 02:17:17.080
<v Speaker 7>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>current global affairs.</v>

2536
02:17:17.530 --> 02:17:19.450
<v Speaker 7>I'll skip the quote from reason magazine</v>
<v Speaker 7>interview,</v>

2537
02:17:19.451 --> 02:17:24.451
<v Speaker 7>but you should read them because hers is</v>
<v Speaker 7>a worldview which is very much the west </v>

2538
02:17:24.451 --> 02:17:25.510
<v Speaker 7>versus Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not Radical Islam,</v>

2539
02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:30.570
<v Speaker 7>but Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 7>including necessarily the military </v>

2540
02:17:30.570 --> 02:17:32.881
<v Speaker 7>option.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So my question is at the level of </v>

2541
02:17:32.881 --> 02:17:35.161
<v Speaker 7>psychological significance of these </v>
<v Speaker 7>stories at the level of mythology and </v>

2542
02:17:35.161 --> 02:17:38.161
<v Speaker 7>archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how Islam so different from thej </v>

2543
02:17:38.161 --> 02:17:38.650
<v Speaker 7>Christian tradition because Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Adam,</v>

2544
02:17:38.710 --> 02:17:40.240
<v Speaker 7>eve of Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shaytan,</v>

2545
02:17:40.270 --> 02:17:42.430
<v Speaker 7>so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything from the fall to the flood.</v>

2546
02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:48.780
<v Speaker 7>A lot of what you've discussed in this </v>
<v Speaker 7>lecture series is necessarily part of </v>

2547
02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:48.780
<v Speaker 7>Islam as well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and in fact,</v>

2548
02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:53.311
<v Speaker 7>I think one of the strongest criticism </v>
<v Speaker 7>of Islam is that it's perhaps pretty </v>

2549
02:17:53.311 --> 02:17:56.101
<v Speaker 7>unoriginal tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You said that the moral presuppositions </v>

2550
02:17:56.101 --> 02:17:57.970
<v Speaker 7>of a culture and instantiated in its </v>
<v Speaker 7>stories.</v>

2551
02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:01.210
<v Speaker 7>I see a lot of the same stories.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So current global fairs aside,</v>

2552
02:18:01.211 --> 02:18:06.211
<v Speaker 7>I'm asking it the deepest levels.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How different are these stories in the </v>

2553
02:18:06.211 --> 02:18:06.211
<v Speaker 7>moral presuppositions?</v>

2554
02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

2555
02:18:07.550 --> 02:18:11.990
<v Speaker 2>that's a killer question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2556
02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:17.500
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I would say is </v>

2557
02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:17.500
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2558
02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:22.780
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the reason that I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I'm planning to do is </v>

2559
02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:25.430
<v Speaker 2>to have a series of discussions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of people have contacted me about</v>

2560
02:18:25.431 --> 02:18:28.340
<v Speaker 2>discussing with Ion Hirsi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ali has,</v>

2561
02:18:28.350 --> 02:18:33.350
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has powerful and serious fobs and </v>

2562
02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:38.540
<v Speaker 2>they're not happy with her black and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white distinction.</v>

2563
02:18:39.620 --> 02:18:43.670
<v Speaker 2>And so now I read infidel and I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>liked that book.</v>

2564
02:18:43.671 --> 02:18:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2565
02:18:44.450 --> 02:18:47.150
<v Speaker 2>my sense was that she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a heroin.</v>

2566
02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Now what that means in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

2567
02:18:50.690 --> 02:18:53.120
<v Speaker 2>that's a different story because she </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out of a,</v>

2568
02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:55.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2569
02:18:55.570 --> 02:19:00.570
<v Speaker 2>a totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say family structure in a </v>

2570
02:19:00.570 --> 02:19:04.511
<v Speaker 2>relatively totalitarian society and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could make the case that there is a </v>

2571
02:19:04.671 --> 02:19:07.970
<v Speaker 2>correspondence between that in Islam and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could make the case that there isn't</v>

2572
02:19:08.030 --> 02:19:13.030
<v Speaker 2>in and of course that's the critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue and so there's a couple of things </v>

2573
02:19:14.271 --> 02:19:19.271
<v Speaker 2>that I can't wrap my head around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>hap wrapped my head around easily in </v>

2574
02:19:19.271 --> 02:19:24.011
<v Speaker 2>relationship to Islam and so one is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see as the failure to separate church </v>

2575
02:19:25.431 --> 02:19:29.060
<v Speaker 2>from state and a problem.</v>

2576
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Now it may not be a problem as such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly a problem in </v>

2577
02:19:35.770 --> 02:19:39.521
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the relation between </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam and the West because we separate </v>

2578
02:19:39.521 --> 02:19:43.361
<v Speaker 2>church from state now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fundamentalists in the United </v>

2579
02:19:43.361 --> 02:19:44.150
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian fundamentalists who think that</v>

2580
02:19:44.151 --> 02:19:48.410
<v Speaker 2>that separation is a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not only,</v>

2581
02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:53.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not only an idea that's rooted in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam that those should be united,</v>

2582
02:19:54.010 --> 02:19:59.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to our coexistence because </v>

2583
02:19:59.010 --> 02:19:59.560
<v Speaker 2>that's a fundamentally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>presumption.</v>

2584
02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's problem number one.</v>

2585
02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Problem number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

2586
02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:07.210
<v Speaker 2>and again this may be a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my ignorance,</v>

2587
02:20:07.211 --> 02:20:12.211
<v Speaker 2>which I'm trying to rectify.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed was a warlord and I,</v>

2588
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:18.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do about that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one thing you can say about Christ </v>

2589
02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:25.560
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say I'm not talking about a </v>

2590
02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:27.670
<v Speaker 2>historical reality necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I'm not denying it either,</v>

2591
02:20:28.030 --> 02:20:33.030
<v Speaker 2>is that of all the things he was war </v>
<v Speaker 2>lord was definitely not one of them and </v>

2592
02:20:34.811 --> 02:20:39.811
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to do about that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know how to reconcile that </v>

2593
02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:46.960
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know how to reconcile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like not only was Mohammed a warlord,</v>

2594
02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:51.620
<v Speaker 2>which I don't think is an unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to proclaim.</v>

2595
02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:58.780
<v Speaker 2>The expansion that he initiated was </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably successful.</v>

2596
02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean within 600 years it was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest empire the world had ever seen </v>

2597
02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:10.260
<v Speaker 2>and a demolished Byzantine Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that western people </v>

2598
02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:11.450
<v Speaker 2>don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2599
02:21:11.451 --> 02:21:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I've read thinkers who said that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>west was so traumatized culturally,</v>

2600
02:21:15.981 --> 02:21:20.840
<v Speaker 2>let's say by the demolition of Byzantine</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity that we can't even study it</v>

2601
02:21:20.841 --> 02:21:24.410
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't know if that's true,</v>

2602
02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:29.440
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know that it's not true </v>
<v Speaker 2>either and the Buddhists were wiped out </v>

2603
02:21:29.961 --> 02:21:32.000
<v Speaker 2>of Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2604
02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:37.240
<v Speaker 2>and we saw that echoed in the Taliban's </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction of those great Buddhist </v>

2605
02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:38.720
<v Speaker 2>monuments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2606
02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:44.860
<v Speaker 2>so what I'm hoping is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bridge</v>

2607
02:21:46.530 --> 02:21:51.120
<v Speaker 2>there better be a bridge and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to have these discussions because</v>

2608
02:21:51.121 --> 02:21:53.610
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to understand if there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bridge.</v>

2609
02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:58.760
<v Speaker 2>And so lots of people have sent me </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who I should talk to who they </v>

2610
02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:03.171
<v Speaker 2>think represent Islam far better than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>on her Zellie and perhaps they're </v>

2611
02:22:03.171 --> 02:22:07.970
<v Speaker 2>correct and hopefully I'll get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to talk to them because I </v>

2612
02:22:07.970 --> 02:22:11.901
<v Speaker 2>would like to know why I would like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know if what I think is wrong because if</v>

2613
02:22:12.111 --> 02:22:14.580
<v Speaker 2>it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important that I know it's wrong.</v>

2614
02:22:15.450 --> 02:22:19.620
<v Speaker 2>But at the moment I don't a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's wrong.</v>

2615
02:22:19.621 --> 02:22:21.810
<v Speaker 2>And B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see.</v>

2616
02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:31.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what it signifies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2617
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:33.350
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think anyone is sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2618
02:22:33.351 --> 02:22:38.351
<v Speaker 2>Because we have this entangled </v>
<v Speaker 2>entangling of the civilizations.</v>

2619
02:22:39.430 --> 02:22:40.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's other things too,</v>

2620
02:22:40.701 --> 02:22:44.090
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not very happy with the Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabs in the wall.</v>

2621
02:22:44.091 --> 02:22:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Hobbies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there are allies.</v>

2622
02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:53.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how any Western woman can </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly think that there are allies and</v>

2623
02:22:53.971 --> 02:22:58.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm not happy with the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>petro dollars that we send them are </v>

2624
02:22:58.971 --> 02:23:02.360
<v Speaker 2>transformed in substantial part into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of propaganda that's definitely a </v>

2625
02:23:04.711 --> 02:23:09.090
<v Speaker 2>threat to the west and I'm not very </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy with the fact that our politicians</v>

2626
02:23:09.690 --> 02:23:13.470
<v Speaker 2>appear stupidly blind to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2627
02:23:13.471 --> 02:23:16.020
<v Speaker 2>That may again be a consequence of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance.</v>

2628
02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:20.210
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those are the sorts of things that</v>

2629
02:23:22.510 --> 02:23:27.510
<v Speaker 2>that I can't reconcile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

2630
02:23:29.740 --> 02:23:34.740
<v Speaker 2>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've also seen parallels between the </v>

2631
02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:35.990
<v Speaker 2>ideas that I'm presenting here and other</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious traditions,</v>

2632
02:23:35.991 --> 02:23:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Taoism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddhism,</v>

2633
02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Hinduism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's harder for me to bridge the gap </v>

2634
02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:46.421
<v Speaker 2>with Islam and I'm not sure why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it has something to do with the </v>

2635
02:23:46.421 --> 02:23:49.850
<v Speaker 2>things that I just laid out now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I don't know about Islam would feel</v>

2636
02:23:49.851 --> 02:23:54.851
<v Speaker 2>very many volumes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of which I have sitting on my </v>

2637
02:23:54.851 --> 02:23:55.160
<v Speaker 2>shelves at home right now because I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do the reading,</v>

2638
02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:57.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I progressed through this,</v>

2639
02:23:57.591 --> 02:23:57.980
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2640
02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

2641
02:24:10.850 --> 02:24:13.700
<v Speaker 8>Dr Pearson.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thanks for continuing this series.</v>

2642
02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:17.840
<v Speaker 8>Even as atheists appreciate the </v>
<v Speaker 8>interaction and the,</v>

2643
02:24:17.841 --> 02:24:19.220
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2644
02:24:19.221 --> 02:24:20.930
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>conversation.</v>

2645
02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:26.560
<v Speaker 8>I wanted to ask you something that is </v>
<v Speaker 8>both emotional and analytical because </v>

2646
02:24:27.291 --> 02:24:32.291
<v Speaker 8>oftentimes you're basically pegged as </v>
<v Speaker 8>seeing things very analytically.</v>

2647
02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.830
<v Speaker 8>So you were talking earlier about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2648
02:24:38.390 --> 02:24:39.890
<v Speaker 8>you were talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2649
02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:44.920
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the juxtaposition between happiness and </v>

2650
02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:46.440
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2651
02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:49.910
<v Speaker 8>honor even though I don't think they're </v>
<v Speaker 8>mutually exclusive personally,</v>

2652
02:24:49.911 --> 02:24:54.911
<v Speaker 8>but if there's a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 8>let's say someone is truly in love with </v>

2653
02:24:56.121 --> 02:24:59.000
<v Speaker 8>someone else and they loved them for </v>
<v Speaker 8>many years and decades.</v>

2654
02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:04.420
<v Speaker 8>They have a whole history together and </v>
<v Speaker 8>then someone and then one of the people </v>

2655
02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:06.890
<v Speaker 8>in this grouping,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2656
02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:12.580
<v Speaker 8>start falling in love with someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's not that there's less love for </v>

2657
02:25:14.331 --> 02:25:19.331
<v Speaker 8>the original partner.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How analytically and emotionally do you </v>

2658
02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:24.160
<v Speaker 8>take care of a situation like that when </v>
<v Speaker 8>you feel</v>

2659
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:27.460
<v Speaker 2>that you want to stay honorable and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy?</v>

2660
02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I would say is the </v>

2661
02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:33.600
<v Speaker 2>devil's always in the details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2662
02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:38.071
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that I'm not happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>about with much modern moral theorizing </v>

2663
02:25:40.091 --> 02:25:45.091
<v Speaker 2>is that it takes a story like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then tries to extract out a general </v>

2664
02:25:45.821 --> 02:25:50.821
<v Speaker 2>moral principle and often that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible because the particulars of </v>

2665
02:25:50.921 --> 02:25:54.700
<v Speaker 2>the situation are very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But having said that,</v>

2666
02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:57.520
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me think about that for a minute.</v>

2667
02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:03.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that it's possible to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>honorable in a situation like that </v>

2668
02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:07.471
<v Speaker 2>because I think that you've acted out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the violation already and having acted </v>

2669
02:26:07.991 --> 02:26:11.770
<v Speaker 2>out the violation to confess it might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right thing to do,</v>

2670
02:26:11.771 --> 02:26:14.320
<v Speaker 2>although perhaps not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2671
02:26:14.321 --> 02:26:19.321
<v Speaker 2>because if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't obvious to me that if you'd be </v>

2672
02:26:19.321 --> 02:26:20.140
<v Speaker 2>trained someone then you get to have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to tell them about it.</v>

2673
02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're not,</v>

2674
02:26:22.721 --> 02:26:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2675
02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

2676
02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:27.880
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2677
02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:35.910
<v Speaker 2>my observation has been that if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a tight relationship and if one party </v>

2678
02:26:36.401 --> 02:26:38.230
<v Speaker 2>has betrayed by the other in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner,</v>

2679
02:26:38.530 --> 02:26:42.430
<v Speaker 2>that it's almost always irreconcilable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It breaks it.</v>

2680
02:26:43.490 --> 02:26:45.160
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2681
02:26:45.161 --> 02:26:50.161
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've helped people try to struggle </v>

2682
02:26:50.161 --> 02:26:51.961
<v Speaker 2>through that bone on both sides of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person who was betrayed and the </v>

2683
02:26:51.961 --> 02:26:52.910
<v Speaker 2>person who did the betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2684
02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people grow up and not do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2685
02:26:55.781 --> 02:26:58.420
<v Speaker 2>And this was in situations where their </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner didn't know.</v>

2686
02:26:58.930 --> 02:27:03.930
<v Speaker 2>And in a couple of those situations it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to me that it might've even been </v>

2687
02:27:03.930 --> 02:27:06.640
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary learning experience for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who did it,</v>

2688
02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:07.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2689
02:27:07.390 --> 02:27:09.430
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helped them develop.</v>

2690
02:27:09.610 --> 02:27:14.350
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean I'm justifying it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but life is complicated.</v>

2691
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:19.710
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that society works better.</v>

2692
02:27:20.761 --> 02:27:22.290
<v Speaker 2>All things considered</v>

2693
02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:25.370
<v Speaker 2>when you make a promise and you stick to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2694
02:27:26.060 --> 02:27:28.670
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading young,</v>

2695
02:27:28.671 --> 02:27:30.230
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really liked was,</v>

2696
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believed that he had his affairs too.</v>

2697
02:27:35.901 --> 02:27:38.420
<v Speaker 2>So you might think about it as somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypocritical,</v>

2698
02:27:38.421 --> 02:27:43.421
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that people can make </v>

2699
02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:45.140
<v Speaker 2>mistakes without having what they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily be wrong.</v>

2700
02:27:45.620 --> 02:27:50.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that there were things in a </v>

2701
02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:50.620
<v Speaker 2>marriage that you can't have unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all in.</v>

2702
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:53.630
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>

2703
02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:57.830
<v Speaker 2>And so if there's a back door open or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the like to begin with,</v>

2704
02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:02.860
<v Speaker 2>or a backdoor opens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I think that there's something </v>

2705
02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:03.740
<v Speaker 2>about the relationship that is lacking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least,</v>

2706
02:28:03.741 --> 02:28:05.840
<v Speaker 2>and I think you pay a big price for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2707
02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:11.740
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it depends on whether you </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard to marriage as a practical </v>

2708
02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:15.060
<v Speaker 2>arrangement or a spiritual arrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now really it's both,</v>

2709
02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:16.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both are important,</v>

2710
02:28:17.970 --> 02:28:21.090
<v Speaker 2>but if it's a spiritual arrangement or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological arrangement above,</v>

2711
02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:27.340
<v Speaker 2>then I do think that you don't get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation without being all in.</v>

2712
02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:33.220
<v Speaker 2>And if you violate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then even if you can work it out with </v>

2713
02:28:33.220 --> 02:28:36.491
<v Speaker 2>your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something that you will never </v>

2714
02:28:36.491 --> 02:28:37.010
<v Speaker 2>get as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2715
02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2716
02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:47.030
<v Speaker 9>Last question.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

2717
02:28:47.460 --> 02:28:49.820
<v Speaker 9>I hope I'll make this good.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Thanks.</v>

2718
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:54.830
<v Speaker 9>Also for continuing to electric series.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I haven't listened to all of the </v>

2719
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:56.190
<v Speaker 9>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it seems like you focus very much on</v>

2720
02:28:56.250 --> 02:29:00.510
<v Speaker 9>the appeal of the biblical stories to </v>
<v Speaker 9>the individual psychology.</v>

2721
02:29:01.290 --> 02:29:06.290
<v Speaker 9>Do you have any thoughts on the relative</v>
<v Speaker 9>importance of crowd psychology to the </v>

2722
02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:10.570
<v Speaker 9>appeal instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 9>power of the Bible and also the the </v>

2723
02:29:10.570 --> 02:29:13.520
<v Speaker 9>reason why the Bible or the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 9>stories took precedence over other </v>

2724
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:16.020
<v Speaker 9>ideologies which could have taken its </v>
<v Speaker 9>place?</v>

2725
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2726
02:29:17.421 --> 02:29:19.370
<v Speaker 2>let's go to the second one first.</v>

2727
02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same thing that happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone both creates an edits,</v>

2728
02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:36.870
<v Speaker 2>a great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no one knows like imagine how many </v>

2729
02:29:37.661 --> 02:29:39.040
<v Speaker 2>choices are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>integrate movie.</v>

2730
02:29:39.041 --> 02:29:44.041
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's an animated movie because</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everything in an animated </v>

2731
02:29:44.041 --> 02:29:46.900
<v Speaker 2>movie as constructed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's God only knows how many choices.</v>

2732
02:29:46.901 --> 02:29:51.901
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe there's millions of choices </v>
<v Speaker 2>and each choice is guided by some </v>

2733
02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:58.230
<v Speaker 2>intuition of narrative suitability or </v>
<v Speaker 2>beauty or there's some higher ideal </v>

2734
02:29:58.930 --> 02:30:00.760
<v Speaker 2>motivating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2735
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:03.330
<v Speaker 2>The desire to produce a masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's it.</v>

2736
02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:05.260
<v Speaker 2>That was certainly the case with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Disney movies,</v>

2737
02:30:05.261 --> 02:30:10.261
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that that aspiration then then </v>

2738
02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:13.720
<v Speaker 2>makes the decisions and so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2739
02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:19.560
<v Speaker 2>something like that guided the writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the selection of the stories in the </v>

2740
02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:24.391
<v Speaker 2>biblical Canon now could have there been</v>
<v Speaker 2>other stories included while the </v>

2741
02:30:24.971 --> 02:30:29.971
<v Speaker 2>Catholics and the Protestants don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same biblical tradition and neither </v>

2742
02:30:29.971 --> 02:30:33.361
<v Speaker 2>do the Jews and the Christians and so it</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't exactly clear what to make of </v>

2743
02:30:33.361 --> 02:30:33.880
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2744
02:30:34.090 --> 02:30:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a can in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the discussion we just had about </v>

2745
02:30:39.090 --> 02:30:42.961
<v Speaker 2>Islam and Christianity are in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've left that aside,</v>

2746
02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:50.490
<v Speaker 2>that specific question except in so far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I've just answered because I'm trying</v>

2747
02:30:50.491 --> 02:30:55.491
<v Speaker 2>to take what we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I know is at the root of our </v>

2748
02:30:55.491 --> 02:30:56.370
<v Speaker 2>culture and to figure out what it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have,</v>

2749
02:30:57.090 --> 02:30:58.710
<v Speaker 2>why it is that we have at.</v>

2750
02:31:00.690 --> 02:31:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made some attempt to explain that in </v>

2751
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:07.110
<v Speaker 2>the manner that I just described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have a final answer.</v>

2752
02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:08.790
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It have been different.</v>

2753
02:31:11.930 --> 02:31:13.550
<v Speaker 2>It could have been different at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>

2754
02:31:13.551 --> 02:31:15.520
<v Speaker 2>but the same at others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2755
02:31:15.530 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean one of the things that scholars </v>
<v Speaker 2>of comparative religion who haven't been</v>

2756
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:24.600
<v Speaker 3>infected fatally with postmodernism have</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely realized so young,</v>

2757
02:31:24.601 --> 02:31:29.601
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Eliana and people who are interested </v>

2758
02:31:29.601 --> 02:31:30.930
<v Speaker 3>in grand narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things they pointed out quite</v>

2759
02:31:30.931 --> 02:31:32.520
<v Speaker 3>clearly is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2760
02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:37.560
<v Speaker 3>there's a set of common mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>themes across many cultures and I tried </v>

2761
02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:41.220
<v Speaker 3>to outline that in maps of meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that worked out quite nicely for me</v>

2762
02:31:41.221 --> 02:31:46.221
<v Speaker 3>at least as far as I was concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>because once I had the basic </v>

2763
02:31:46.221 --> 02:31:48.951
<v Speaker 3>architectural structure mapped out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it opened up all sorts of stories to me </v>

2764
02:31:48.951 --> 02:31:51.240
<v Speaker 3>from all sorts of different cultures and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been unbelievably useful.</v>

2765
02:31:51.241 --> 02:31:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Like the Mesopotamian story of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The enuma elish when,</v>

2766
02:31:54.490 --> 02:31:57.060
<v Speaker 3>when I figured out what that meant as </v>
<v Speaker 3>far as I was concerned,</v>

2767
02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:01.470
<v Speaker 3>like I've never forgotten that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just seared itself into my memory.</v>

2768
02:32:01.471 --> 02:32:04.290
<v Speaker 3>And the same with the Egyptian stories </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2769
02:32:04.380 --> 02:32:06.410
<v Speaker 3>some Buddhist writings that I've read in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some.</v>

2770
02:32:06.610 --> 02:32:11.610
<v Speaker 3>The Tao Te Ching is also very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that things can be different </v>

2771
02:32:11.821 --> 02:32:16.821
<v Speaker 3>on one level and the same at another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that humanity kind of coalesces on </v>

2772
02:32:16.821 --> 02:32:21.141
<v Speaker 3>what's the same over a reasonable period</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time because there isn't that many </v>

2773
02:32:21.141 --> 02:32:25.611
<v Speaker 3>ways that human beings can live properly</v>
<v Speaker 3>as individuals and as groups together.</v>

2774
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:31.870
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this constant force that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes our ethical presuppositions </v>

2775
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:34.800
<v Speaker 3>converge and then that's automatically </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressed in the stories.</v>

2776
02:32:35.370 --> 02:32:40.370
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an imperfect process and it's full </v>

2777
02:32:40.370 --> 02:32:40.370
<v Speaker 3>of error.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2778
02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2779
02:32:45.500 --> 02:32:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2780
02:32:50.460 --> 02:32:53.880
<v Speaker 3>Just one announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well two announcements.</v>

2781
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.310
<v Speaker 3>The next lecture I believe is November </v>
<v Speaker 3>14th,</v>

2782
02:32:56.311 --> 02:32:58.740
<v Speaker 3>so I'll hopefully finish off the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Jacob.</v>

2783
02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:03.800
<v Speaker 3>Looks like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm also appearing on a panel </v>

2784
02:33:03.800 --> 02:33:06.210
<v Speaker 3>with Gad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saad and slash or an amateur on November</v>

2785
02:33:06.211 --> 02:33:11.211
<v Speaker 3>11th.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's still quite a few tickets </v>

2786
02:33:11.211 --> 02:33:13.791
<v Speaker 3>available for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're interested you could go to </v>

2787
02:33:13.791 --> 02:33:14.460
<v Speaker 3>my website and pick up those tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it should be.</v>

2788
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:16.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully it'll be interesting.</v>

2789
02:33:16.471 --> 02:33:19.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it will be and it might be too </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

2790
02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:23.190
<v Speaker 3>That's one possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll see.</v>

2791
02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:28.260
<v Speaker 3>But I'm going to do two more of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>this year and I hope I get through the </v>

2792
02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:30.450
<v Speaker 3>story of Joseph and then I can start in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the new year with,</v>

2793
02:33:30.670 --> 02:33:35.670
<v Speaker 3>with exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a story that I know quite </v>

2794
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:37.100
<v Speaker 3>well and the exodus and leviticus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the one after that?</v>

2795
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2796
02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2797
02:33:39.930 --> 02:33:44.930
<v Speaker 3>so I'm very much looking forward to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that is one killer story </v>

2798
02:33:44.930 --> 02:33:44.930
<v Speaker 3>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2799
02:33:44.930 --> 02:33:44.960
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2800
02:33:45.060 --> 02:33:47.070

<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2801
02:33:47.071 --> 02:33:50.190
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
