1
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I thought this time that I would </v>

2
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.121
<v Speaker 1>actually cover some of the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories so,</v>

3
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully a number of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said last time,</v>

4
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go through this while as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast as I am able to,</v>

5
00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:34.201
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it as completed job as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible and of course the probability </v>

6
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 1>that I'll get through the entire Bible </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very low,</v>

7
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get through a lot of the major</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in the beginning of it.</v>

8
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

9
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that this all goes well then </v>

10
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.140
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll try to do the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>again either in the fall or next year.</v>

11
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>So I'm assuming I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is still working out properly</v>

12
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 1>next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long ways away.</v>

13
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

14
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we'll start.</v>

15
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>So last week I talked to you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>aligned in the new testament that was </v>

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.151
<v Speaker 1>from John and it was a line that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to parallel the opening of </v>

17
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:15.781
<v Speaker 1>genesis and it's a really important line</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I would reemphasize it </v>

18
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>because the Bible is a book that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>written forward and backwards in time in</v>

19
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:29.281
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most books because if you write a </v>

20
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:29.281
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course when you get to the end,</v>

21
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're the writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can adjust the beginning and so on.</v>

22
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 1>So it has this odd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has this appearance of linearity,</v>

23
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't linear.</v>

24
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like your God in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing outside of time.</v>

25
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.580
<v Speaker 1>That's your book and you can play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>time anywhere along it.</v>

26
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 1>And the people who put the book together</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the books together,</v>

27
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took full advantage of that.</v>

28
00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

29
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>and that makes the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives the story odd parallels in,</v>

30
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.300
<v Speaker 1>in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many places in a very large number of </v>

31
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the major parallels,</v>

32
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.560
<v Speaker 1>at least from the perspective of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian interpretation of the Bible,</v>

33
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>which of course includes the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament and so there's this strange </v>

34
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.831
<v Speaker 1>idea that Christ was the same factor or </v>
<v Speaker 1>force that God used at the beginning of </v>

35
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:22.930
<v Speaker 1>time to speak habitable order into </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

36
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange idea.</v>

37
00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>You know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

38
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that can be just </v>

39
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>easily dismissed as superstition.</v>

40
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Partly because it's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it,</v>

41
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

42
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even fit the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a superstitious belief.</v>

43
00:02:37.661 --> 00:02:42.661
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dream like belief in some sense </v>

44
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:45.421
<v Speaker 1>and what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I see many of the ideas in the </v>

45
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Bible as is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is these dreamlike ideas that,</v>

46
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>that underlie our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our normative cognition and that </v>

47
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>constitute the ground from which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more articulate and articulated and,</v>

48
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 1>and explicit ideas have emerged in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

49
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea is so complicated that it's </v>

50
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.901
<v Speaker 1>still mostly embedded in dreamlike form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to have something to do </v>

51
00:03:06.901 --> 00:03:10.471
<v Speaker 1>with the primacy of consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the biggest issues </v>

52
00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>regarding the structure of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>

53
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>because everyone from physicists to </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurobiologists debates this,</v>

54
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:21.211
<v Speaker 1>there's there's the the stumbling block </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a purely objective view of the world</v>

55
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:27.151
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to be consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness has all sorts of strange </v>

56
00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:27.151
<v Speaker 1>properties.</v>

57
00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:31.620
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious what constitutes time </v>

58
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.951
<v Speaker 1>or at least duration in the absence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and it isn't also easy to </v>

59
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:40.081
<v Speaker 1>understand what constitutes being in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of consciousness because it </v>

60
00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>seems to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>if a movie is running and there's no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch it,</v>

62
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds like the tree in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest idea,</v>

63
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

64
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not that idea at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If if a movie is watching is running and</v>

65
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:55.891
<v Speaker 1>no one's watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what sense is can you say that </v>

66
00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:59.370
<v Speaker 1>there's even a movie running because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie seems to be the experience of the </v>

67
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.081
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the objective elements of the movie </v>

68
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:06.991
<v Speaker 1>and there's something about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in so far as we're in it as </v>

69
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:12.541
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is dependent on conscious </v>

70
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:12.541
<v Speaker 1>experience of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

71
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:17.191
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take consciousness out of the </v>

72
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:17.191
<v Speaker 1>world and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 1>if none of us were here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was no such thing as </v>

74
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>consciousness than the cosmos would </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue running the way it is running,</v>

75
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:26.821
<v Speaker 1>but of course it depends on what exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean by the cosmos when you make a </v>

76
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:31.320
<v Speaker 1>statement like that because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about the subjective </v>

77
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>experience of reality that gives it </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

78
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 1>or at least that's one way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and since we're all pretty enamored </v>

79
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.151
<v Speaker 1>of our own consciousness as although </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're painful because they define our </v>

80
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:42.151
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

81
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:47.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not unreasonable to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness a kind of metaphysical </v>

82
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.650
<v Speaker 1>primacy now and it's deeper than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>on steeper idea than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there are physicists and they're</v>

84
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>not trivial physicists like John Wheeler</v>
<v Speaker 1>who believes that in some sense,</v>

85
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.080
<v Speaker 1>consciousness plays a constitute of role</v>
<v Speaker 1>in transforming the chaotic potential of</v>

86
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>being into the actuality of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he actually thinks about it.</v>

87
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.130
<v Speaker 1>He's not alive anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he actually thought about it as,</v>

88
00:05:08.131 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>as playing a constitutive role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:15.241
<v Speaker 1>and then from the neuro biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective or from the scientific </v>

90
00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like consciousness is not something</v>

91
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:21.961
<v Speaker 1>we understand that I don't think we </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it at all with something we </v>

92
00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>can't get a handle on with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental materialist philosophy and I</v>

93
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:29.851
<v Speaker 1>don't know why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite frustrating if you're a </v>

94
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:29.851
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't clear to me that we've made</v>

95
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:34.381
<v Speaker 1>any progress whatsoever in understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness even though while we've </v>

96
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:38.881
<v Speaker 1>been trying to understand it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of years and even those </v>

97
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurobiologists and so forth have really</v>

98
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
<v Speaker 1>like put a lot of effort into </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding consciousness from a </v>

99
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective in the last 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

100
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.140
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

101
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.420
<v Speaker 1>what it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me is the idea that,</v>

102
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>that God used the word to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to extract order out of habitable order,</v>

103
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>out of chaos</v>

104
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is roughly the right way of </v>

105
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.991
<v Speaker 2>thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me deeply aligned with the </v>

106
00:06:04.991 --> 00:06:07.350
<v Speaker 2>idea that what it is that we do as human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings is his encounter.</v>

107
00:06:07.351 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Something like a formless and potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

108
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not omniscient obviously,</v>

109
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:16.931
<v Speaker 2>and we can't just do whatever we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we encounter a formless and chaotic </v>

110
00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:21.401
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always what we're grappling with </v>

111
00:06:21.401 --> 00:06:24.490
<v Speaker 2>and somehow we use our consciousness to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give that form and this is how people </v>

112
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.230
<v Speaker 2>act like if it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at how they regard </v>

113
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's how they act because you say things</v>

114
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 2>to people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

115
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:36.161
<v Speaker 2>you should live up to your potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you make a case that there's </v>

116
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:39.791
<v Speaker 2>something about a person that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than what is that yet could be if only </v>

117
00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:44.741
<v Speaker 2>they participated in the process </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly and everyone knows what that </v>

118
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 2>means and no one acts like a mystery has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been honored.</v>

119
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.490
<v Speaker 2>When you say that and you can see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation in your own life that's full </v>

120
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 2>of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are often extremely excited when you</v>

121
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.300
<v Speaker 2>encounter something that's full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential because what you see is </v>

122
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.170
<v Speaker 2>something that could be you see a future</v>
<v Speaker 2>beckoning for you.</v>

123
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.320
<v Speaker 2>That could be if only you interacted </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it properly and it activates your </v>

124
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.191
<v Speaker 2>nervous system right in in a in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic way and we even understand how </v>

125
00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:10.430
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the degree that we understand how the</v>

126
00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 2>nervous system works because the systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mediate positive emotion,</v>

127
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 2>which are governed roughly by Dopa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the neurochemical,</v>

128
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 2>dopamine and which have their roots way </v>
<v Speaker 2>down in the ancient hypothalamus,</v>

129
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very archaic and fundamental part of the</v>

130
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:30.521
<v Speaker 2>brain that responds to potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the possibility of accruing </v>

131
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.920
<v Speaker 2>something new and valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It responds to potential with active </v>

132
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 2>movement forward and engagement.</v>

133
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 2>And so we're engaged in the world as </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential and looks like consciousness </v>

134
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 2>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this idea that,</v>

135
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 2>and this is the main idea that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>is being put forth in genesis one.</v>

136
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 2>It's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see this in mythology,</v>

137
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>like from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I've been able to gather </v>

138
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.881
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always three causal elements </v>

139
00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:00.191
<v Speaker 2>that make up being at the bottom of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of world mythology and one is the </v>

140
00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:04.870
<v Speaker 2>formless potential that makes up being </v>
<v Speaker 2>once it's interacted with and that's </v>

141
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.730
<v Speaker 2>generally given a feminine nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

142
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's because it's like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>source from which all things emerge and </v>

143
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 2>rise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

144
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 2>It's more complicated than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something like that.</v>

145
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.350
<v Speaker 2>And then there's some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretive structure that has to </v>

146
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.261
<v Speaker 2>grapple with that form potential and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's I think that's the sort of thing </v>

147
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:27.521
<v Speaker 2>that was alluded to by a manual count </v>
<v Speaker 2>when when he was criticizing the notion </v>

148
00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 2>that all of our information comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>census data,</v>

149
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 2>which would be the pure empirical </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

150
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

151
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.310
<v Speaker 2>Because when you encounter the world you</v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter with a cognitive structure </v>

152
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.931
<v Speaker 2>that already has shape and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already in you this structure and </v>

153
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:45.610
<v Speaker 2>without that a priority structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to take the </v>

154
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.551
<v Speaker 2>formulas potential and give it structure</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's something that it's </v>

155
00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 2>akin in some way to the idea of God the </v>
<v Speaker 2>father and I'll try to develop that idea</v>

156
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

157
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:57.881
<v Speaker 2>it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the notion that there's something </v>

158
00:08:57.881 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 2>in all of us that transcends all of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's deeply structural.</v>

159
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:04.641
<v Speaker 2>That's part of this ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I would say evolutionary and </v>

160
00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 2>cultural process that enables us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grapple with the formulas,</v>

161
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 2>potential and bring forth reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

162
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.310
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the final element and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that element seems to be something like </v>

163
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.030
<v Speaker 2>consciousness itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The consciousness that actually inheres </v>

164
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.630
<v Speaker 2>in the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not only that you have the </v>

165
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.630
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the structure,</v>

166
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 2>has the capacity for action in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like it's,</v>

167
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 2>it's you're this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're this spirit that gives the dead </v>

168
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 2>structure life.</v>

169
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and as far as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can tell,</v>

170
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:38.450
<v Speaker 2>that trinitarian notion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize this Christianity is </v>

171
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:38.450
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

172
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.281
<v Speaker 2>formless potential which has never given</v>
<v Speaker 2>a the status of a deity in Christianity </v>

173
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:47.601
<v Speaker 2>and then the notion that there's an a </v>
<v Speaker 2>priori interpretive structure that's a </v>

174
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 2>consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our ancient existence as as beings.</v>

175
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:56.241
<v Speaker 2>It goes back as far in time as you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>go though the notion of a structure and </v>

176
00:09:56.551 --> 00:10:01.551
<v Speaker 2>then the idea of a consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the is the tool of that </v>

177
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 2>structure and that interacts with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and gives it and gives it reality.</v>

178
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's the word as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell.</v>

179
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:13.161
<v Speaker 2>And so the notion is is that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>father and that's the structure and </v>

180
00:10:13.161 --> 00:10:16.191
<v Speaker 2>there's a son that's transcendent that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize as consciousness itself and</v>

181
00:10:16.681 --> 00:10:19.770
<v Speaker 2>that it's the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speaking of the sun.</v>

182
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.570
<v Speaker 2>That is the active principle that turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos into order and God,</v>

183
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:28.560
<v Speaker 2>it's such a sophisticated ideas as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm concerned because,</v>

184
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about it that's at </v>

185
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.031
<v Speaker 2>least phenomenologically accurate </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you do have an interpretive </v>

186
00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 2>structure and you couldn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything without it.</v>

187
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Your very body is an interpretive </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

188
00:10:38.551 --> 00:10:39.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been crafted over,</v>

189
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 2>let's say 3 billion years of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without that,</v>

190
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:49.101
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be able to perceive </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything and it's taken a lot of death </v>

191
00:10:49.101 --> 00:10:52.550
<v Speaker 2>and struggle and tragedy to produce you </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that's capable of encountering</v>

192
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 2>this immense chaos that surrounds us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to transform it into habitable order and</v>

193
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.030
<v Speaker 2>then there's the idea too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

194
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:02.880
<v Speaker 2>it's deeply embedded in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>chapters of genesis,</v>

195
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 2>which is a staggering idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

196
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 2>and and certainly not one that's likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings were made in the image</v>

197
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:14.241
<v Speaker 2>of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both male and female were made in the </v>

198
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:14.241
<v Speaker 2>image of God.</v>

199
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's of course a very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to understand,</v>

200
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:20.060
<v Speaker 2>partly because the god that's referred </v>
<v Speaker 2>to in the in those chapters has it kind </v>

201
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.561
<v Speaker 2>of polytheistic element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it's an element that's moving </v>

202
00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:28.851
<v Speaker 2>rapidly towards a unified monotheism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not also obvious to me why </v>

203
00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:33.711
<v Speaker 2>people would come up with that concept </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't really think that when </v>

204
00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:34.510
<v Speaker 2>we think about each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we immediately think God,</v>

205
00:11:34.511 --> 00:11:39.511
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the notion that every single human </v>

206
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:43.071
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of their peculiarities and </v>

207
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 2>strangeness is and Sins and Crimes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that has something divine in them</v>

208
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 2>that needs to be regarded with respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that plays an integral role,</v>

209
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 2>at least an analogy analogous role in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the creation of habitable order,</v>

210
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 2>out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a magnificent,</v>

211
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 2>remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy idea.</v>

212
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.740
<v Speaker 2>And yet we developed it and I do firmly </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that it sits at the base of our </v>

213
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.270
<v Speaker 2>legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is the cornerstone of our </v>

214
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:09.270
<v Speaker 2>legal system.</v>

215
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 2>That's the notion that everyone is equal</v>
<v Speaker 2>before God,</v>

216
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 2>which is of course it completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a strange idea.</v>

217
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:19.231
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to understand how </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody could have ever come up with </v>

218
00:12:19.231 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 2>that idea because the manifold </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences between people are so,</v>

219
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.700
<v Speaker 2>so obvious and so evident that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the natural way of viewing someone </v>

220
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:31.801
<v Speaker 2>is or human beings is in this extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical manner where some people </v>

221
00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:36.121
<v Speaker 2>are contemptible and and and easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>brushed off as as pointless and </v>

222
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.340
<v Speaker 2>pathological and and without value </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever,</v>

223
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:41.950
<v Speaker 2>and all the power accrues to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>

224
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.210
<v Speaker 2>no aristocratic minority at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the way that the idea</v>

225
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:53.581
<v Speaker 2>of the individual sovereignty developed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clear that it unfolded over </v>

226
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:57.961
<v Speaker 2>thousands and perhaps 10 thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years before it became something firmly </v>

227
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:02.971
<v Speaker 2>fixed in the imagination that each </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual had something of transcendent</v>

228
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:04.960
<v Speaker 2>value about them and man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell Ya,</v>

229
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:10.140
<v Speaker 2>we dispense with that idea at our </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious peril and so if you're going to </v>

230
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.731
<v Speaker 2>take that idea seriously then which you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do because you acted out because </v>

231
00:13:14.731 --> 00:13:15.520
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you wouldn't be law abiding </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizens,</v>

232
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:15.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

233
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.590
<v Speaker 2>You Act that idea out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

234
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

235
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.910
<v Speaker 2>it's firmly shared by everyone who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who acts in a civilized manner.</v>

236
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why in the world do you believe it?</v>

237
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Assuming that you believe what you act </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

238
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:32.860
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a really good way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally defining beliefs,</v>

239
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.890
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

240
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.810
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the sort of ideas that there's</v>

241
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:42.811
<v Speaker 2>this god of tradition and structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's God the father who uses the sun,</v>

242
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:46.170
<v Speaker 2>which is more of an active force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

243
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.970
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and primarily something that's verbal,</v>

244
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:53.971
<v Speaker 2>which I also think is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because it's associated not </v>

245
00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:55.900
<v Speaker 2>with thought precisely but with speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason for that is,</v>

246
00:13:55.901 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 2>is that there's something to speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more than mere thought.</v>

247
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think part of the reason for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that speeches of public utterance,</v>

248
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.590
<v Speaker 2>and at least in principle speech is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's shaped by the existence</v>

249
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:10.870
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of everywhere of everyone else,</v>

250
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>at least across time.</v>

251
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Because when you speak you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your speeches is put forward in the </v>

252
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 2>world as a causal element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also subject to criticism and,</v>

253
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.180
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cooperation and mutual shaping.</v>

254
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.360
<v Speaker 2>And so there's an idea here to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech is that that the cognitive </v>

255
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:35.431
<v Speaker 2>processes that bring habitable reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of out of uninhabitable chaos have </v>

256
00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 2>this collective and public element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

257
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.280
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the reason by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm an advocate of free speech,</v>

258
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.650
<v Speaker 2>let's say above all because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

259
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Speaker 2>although it is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

260
00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:51.030
<v Speaker 2>in the Canadian bill of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that every single right has equal value.</v>

261
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:56.050
<v Speaker 2>That's the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an idiotic theory because it's </v>

262
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.180
<v Speaker 2>absolutely impossible for a large set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights to have absolutely equal </v>

263
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.621
<v Speaker 2>standards stances that cannot happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way that that could never </v>

264
00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:02.930
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is the legal judgment.</v>

265
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:07.931
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's a huge mistake because </v>
<v Speaker 2>free speech has this while this divine </v>

266
00:15:07.931 --> 00:15:08.930
<v Speaker 2>quality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

267
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:14.170
<v Speaker 2>that you can't escape from because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that manufacturers everything </v>

268
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:14.170
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

269
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so.</v>

270
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:20.530
<v Speaker 2>And I do think that the dream that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could think of as encapsulated in the </v>

271
00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:25.931
<v Speaker 2>stories in genesis is the dream by which</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings dreamed up.</v>

272
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:29.090
<v Speaker 2>The idea that we would now consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

273
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took us a long time to figure out the</v>

274
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 2>word consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's bloody obvious it who</v>

275
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:40.781
<v Speaker 2>knows how many thousands of years or or </v>
<v Speaker 2>or who knows what struggles we had to </v>

276
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:45.941
<v Speaker 2>undertake to abstract out something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and how we had to </v>

277
00:15:45.941 --> 00:15:49.841
<v Speaker 2>represent that dramatically say or </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolically or in a dreamlike fashion </v>

278
00:15:49.841 --> 00:15:54.821
<v Speaker 2>before we could actually formulate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>term and and localize that to some </v>

279
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 2>degree in people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very sophisticated.</v>

280
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.930
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so John makes the case that while </v>

281
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:06.311
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an emanation of God or an </v>

282
00:16:06.311 --> 00:16:07.760
<v Speaker 2>element of God that transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

283
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:11.140
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that that acts </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly and in,</v>

284
00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:16.141
<v Speaker 2>in this sort of living way with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the underlying potential of the </v>

285
00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:16.141
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

286
00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenologically accurate.</v>

287
00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:21.440
<v Speaker 2>And I do think that that's the way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard our lights.</v>

288
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think about it too,</v>

289
00:16:24.141 --> 00:16:29.141
<v Speaker 2>we tend to think that what you encounter</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at the world is the </v>

290
00:16:29.141 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 2>material world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't how you act.</v>

291
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.080
<v Speaker 2>You do act as if you're in a place of </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential and also in a place of </v>

292
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 2>potential that you can actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>transform,</v>

293
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 2>which is also something extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange,</v>

294
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:44.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we do treat each other as if </v>

295
00:16:44.741 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 2>we're capable of bringing new forms into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world in some permanent manner.</v>

296
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we treat each other as if we have </v>

297
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:52.660
<v Speaker 2>free choice and free will and perhaps we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

298
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:57.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies that are predicated on the </v>

299
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.010
<v Speaker 2>idea that we don't don't do very well </v>
<v Speaker 2>and societies that are predicated on the</v>

300
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:03.410
<v Speaker 2>idea that we do seem to do a lot better.</v>

301
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Plus people tend to get very annoyed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you if you treat them like they're </v>

302
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 2>automatons that lack free will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something that people find very,</v>

303
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.350
<v Speaker 2>I would say constraining slave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like about that even you know that,</v>

304
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.540
<v Speaker 2>that the demand that you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual autonomy and even worse that </v>

305
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.821
<v Speaker 2>you're not responsible for your choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an insult to someone to suggest to </v>

306
00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:28.180
<v Speaker 2>them that they're not responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their choices.</v>

307
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:28.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

308
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.350
<v Speaker 2>you usually to do that to someone from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal perspective,</v>

309
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 2>you have to argue something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>diminished capacity,</v>

310
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:39.851
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you're mentally ill or you don't </v>

311
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:39.851
<v Speaker 2>have the intellectual capacity or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

312
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:44.130
<v Speaker 2>or you were or you were adult by some </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance or you had a brain injury or </v>

313
00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 2>something and that's why you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for your actions.</v>

314
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the respect that you give to </v>

315
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.990
<v Speaker 2>another human being is the assumption </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're responsible for their </v>

316
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.640
<v Speaker 2>actions and some of that can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you do something bad then you're</v>

317
00:17:56.641 --> 00:17:57.600
<v Speaker 2>responsible for it.</v>

318
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 2>But part of that too is that if you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something good,</v>

319
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.890
<v Speaker 2>you're also responsible for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that also seems necessary because,</v>

320
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really,</v>

321
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's got to be more annoying </v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

322
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.840
<v Speaker 2>than anything else that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine to strive virtuously let's say,</v>

323
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:17.841
<v Speaker 2>to produce something of extreme value </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then to be treated as if that was a </v>

324
00:18:17.841 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 2>mere deterministic outcome and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

325
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 2>your actual choices had nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

326
00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:27.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people find that sort of thing </v>

327
00:18:27.531 --> 00:18:28.020
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily punishing and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to,</v>

328
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

329
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:34.130
<v Speaker 2>I know that there are debates about all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things and debates about freewill </v>

330
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.500
<v Speaker 2>in debates about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

331
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:39.501
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to take a clear look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>how people act and how they want to be </v>

332
00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:43.890
<v Speaker 2>treated and then to trace it back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these old ideas to see if there's some,</v>

333
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 2>if there's some metaphysical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say metaphysical connection.</v>

334
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

335
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 2>so here's how the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how the book opens.</v>

336
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.010
<v Speaker 2>In the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God created the heavens and the earth.</v>

337
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:01.310
<v Speaker 2>The earth was without form and void and </v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness was over the face of the deep </v>

338
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 2>and the spirit of God was hovering over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the face of the waters.</v>

339
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a hard,</v>

340
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call narrative?</v>

341
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:16.100
<v Speaker 2>Section two to get a handle on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in order to understand it </v>

342
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:16.860
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to actually look behind it.</v>

343
00:19:16.861 --> 00:19:21.861
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of pieces of old stories</v>

344
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:27.120
<v Speaker 2>in the old testament that flesh out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning of these lines.</v>

345
00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:30.390
<v Speaker 2>And I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give you a quick overview of it,</v>

346
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.500
<v Speaker 2>one of the ideas that lurks underneath </v>
<v Speaker 2>these lines,</v>

347
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.960
<v Speaker 2>although you can't tell because it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>English,</v>

348
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.230
<v Speaker 2>you have to look at the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages and of course I don't speak </v>

349
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.111
<v Speaker 2>the original languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've had to use secondary sources </v>

350
00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:45.111
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too bad for me,</v>

351
00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

352
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

353
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.830
<v Speaker 2>without form and void and the deep idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that's associated with this </v>

354
00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:54.720
<v Speaker 2>notion of endless deep potential.</v>

355
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.990
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the words that are used to represent </v>

356
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.490
<v Speaker 2>without form and void or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well one is toe,</v>

357
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get this part wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tohu wa Bohu.</v>

358
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:10.970
<v Speaker 2>And another one is tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's important to know this because </v>

359
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.360
<v Speaker 2>those words are associated with an early</v>
<v Speaker 2>miss earlier Mesopotamian word which is </v>

360
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.950
<v Speaker 2>titled Matt and Tie that was a dragon </v>
<v Speaker 2>like creature who represented the salt </v>

361
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:24.021
<v Speaker 2>water and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and time out had a husband named app </v>

362
00:20:24.021 --> 00:20:25.290
<v Speaker 2>suit and time at aps who were sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>locked together,</v>

363
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:30.530
<v Speaker 2>kind of a sexual embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was that locking together of </v>

364
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:34.310
<v Speaker 2>timeout and APP sue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that's potential and </v>

365
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that or chaos in order.</v>

366
00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:39.921
<v Speaker 2>They were locked together and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that union of chaos and order that gave </v>

367
00:20:39.921 --> 00:20:43.581
<v Speaker 2>rise in the old Mesopotamian myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the Enuma elish to the to the </v>

368
00:20:43.581 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 2>to being to the old gods first and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually as as creation progressed to </v>

369
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.330
<v Speaker 2>human beings themselves.</v>

370
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.080
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this idea lurking </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath this,</v>

371
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.140
<v Speaker 2>these initial lines that God is akin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that which confronts the unknown and </v>

372
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 2>carves it into pieces and makes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world out of its pieces.</v>

373
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that it confronts is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like a while.</v>

374
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:10.441
<v Speaker 2>It's something like a predatory reptiles</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like a dragon or something </v>

375
00:21:10.441 --> 00:21:13.951
<v Speaker 2>like a serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think part of the reason for that </v>

376
00:21:13.951 --> 00:21:13.951
<v Speaker 2>and and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

377
00:21:13.951 --> 00:21:18.520
<v Speaker 2>this is a very deep and ancient idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that this is where it gets so </v>

378
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 2>complicated to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The translation is partly.</v>

379
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.860
<v Speaker 2>That is how human beings created our </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

380
00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Like we went out beyond the confines of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our safe spaces.</v>

381
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Let's say our space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our safe spaces defined by,</v>

382
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:37.070
<v Speaker 2>by the tree or defined by the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we actively voyaged outward to the </v>

383
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.941
<v Speaker 2>places that we were afraid of and didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand and and Kong and conquered </v>

384
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:44.670
<v Speaker 2>and encountered things out there like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like add,</v>

385
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 2>like literally animals like mammoths and</v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes and predators of all sorts.</v>

386
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 2>And it was as a consequence of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>active,</v>

387
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:57.571
<v Speaker 2>brave engagement with the domain of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did not understand the terrifying </v>

388
00:21:57.571 --> 00:22:01.090
<v Speaker 2>domain of what we did not understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the world in fact was generated.</v>

389
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And that idea lurks deeply inside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opening lines of,</v>

390
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.190
<v Speaker 2>of Genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's an.</v>

391
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a profound idea in my estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think.</v>

392
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.420
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also that the way our brains are</v>

393
00:22:13.421 --> 00:22:18.421
<v Speaker 2>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that I'm going to </v>

394
00:22:18.421 --> 00:22:20.191
<v Speaker 2>try to develop more today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the ancient circuits that our </v>

395
00:22:20.191 --> 00:22:23.551
<v Speaker 2>ancestors used to deal with the space </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond which they had already explored.</v>

396
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:26.720
<v Speaker 2>So that would be home territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

397
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.740
<v Speaker 2>So that's that unknown territory that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's characterized by promise because </v>

398
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.060
<v Speaker 2>there are new things out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also by intense danger,</v>

399
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:35.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're prey animals,</v>

400
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.590
<v Speaker 2>especially billions of years ago when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were very young,</v>

401
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.890
<v Speaker 2>we had to go out there and encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that were terribly dangerous and </v>

402
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.380
<v Speaker 2>there was a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

403
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:49.381
<v Speaker 2>paternal courage that went along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and it was that the spirit of </v>

404
00:22:49.381 --> 00:22:52.630
<v Speaker 2>paternal courage that enabled the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conquering of the unknown and there's no</v>

405
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:56.220
<v Speaker 2>difference between the conquering of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown and the creation of habits,</v>

406
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.400
<v Speaker 2>habitable order.</v>

407
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.610
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is is that as our </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive faculties have developed to </v>

408
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.160
<v Speaker 2>the point where we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

409
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.350
<v Speaker 2>we're capable of very high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction.</v>

410
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 2>The underlying biological architecture </v>
<v Speaker 2>has remained the same.</v>

411
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:13.861
<v Speaker 2>And so I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that it's too much to say </v>

412
00:23:13.861 --> 00:23:15.640
<v Speaker 2>at all that the circuits that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that engage you,</v>

413
00:23:15.641 --> 00:23:20.641
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're having an argument about </v>

414
00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:22.561
<v Speaker 2>something fundamental with someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you love and so you're trying to </v>

415
00:23:22.561 --> 00:23:26.311
<v Speaker 2>structure the world around you jointly </v>
<v Speaker 2>to create a habitable space that you can</v>

416
00:23:26.381 --> 00:23:29.890
<v Speaker 2>both exist within your using the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuits,</v>

417
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:35.110
<v Speaker 2>the abstracted version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're using the same circuits that are </v>

418
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 2>archaic ancestors would have used when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they went out into the unknown itself to</v>

419
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:39.070
<v Speaker 2>encounter beasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

420
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.890
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and predators and,</v>

421
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and geographical unknowns.</v>

422
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:48.121
<v Speaker 2>It's the same circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that we do it abstractly now </v>

423
00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:51.461
<v Speaker 2>instead of concretely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course it has to be the same </v>

424
00:23:51.461 --> 00:23:51.461
<v Speaker 2>circuit because evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary is,</v>

425
00:23:51.461 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 2>is a very conservative force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what else would it be?</v>

426
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 2>And this is also why I think it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy for us to demonize those people who</v>

427
00:23:59.091 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 2>are our enemies because</v>

428
00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.130
<v Speaker 2>our enemies confront us with what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to,</v>

429
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.070
<v Speaker 2>with what we don't want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

430
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:14.110
<v Speaker 2>they ended because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our first response is to use snake </v>

431
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.941
<v Speaker 2>circuitry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snake detection circuitry on them and </v>

432
00:24:17.941 --> 00:24:19.440
<v Speaker 2>that accounts for our capacity almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate capacity to demonize and,</v>

433
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.070
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a reason for that.</v>

434
00:24:21.071 --> 00:24:22.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not a trivial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

435
00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:24.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a very fast response and second of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

436
00:24:24.581 --> 00:24:27.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a response that has worked for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

437
00:24:27.131 --> 00:24:28.900
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very long time.</v>

438
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.060
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

439
00:24:31.061 --> 00:24:36.061
<v Speaker 2>one of the variance of the hero and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would consider a variant of the hero,</v>

440
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.880
<v Speaker 2>like a fragment of the picture of God is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heroic warrior who slays the enemy.</v>

441
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>

442
00:24:43.541 --> 00:24:48.541
<v Speaker 2>that's not precisely a politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct representation of the hero in </v>

443
00:24:48.541 --> 00:24:52.111
<v Speaker 2>modern times and well then no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still something that you go </v>

444
00:24:52.111 --> 00:24:52.750
<v Speaker 2>watch and movies all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>admire,</v>

445
00:24:52.751 --> 00:24:52.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

446
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.570
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this one of the.</v>

447
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.390
<v Speaker 2>How many plots are their romance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure.</v>

448
00:24:58.391 --> 00:25:03.250
<v Speaker 2>That's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most of the adventure genre is while</v>

449
00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:05.920
<v Speaker 2>there's some enemy that's lurking in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some form,</v>

450
00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:07.600
<v Speaker 2>it could be human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be alien,</v>

451
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.060
<v Speaker 2>and someone rises up to go and confront </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

452
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.560
<v Speaker 2>maintain order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

453
00:25:11.561 --> 00:25:14.320
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's no getting away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that story.</v>

454
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.600
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have that in your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

455
00:25:16.601 --> 00:25:19.030
<v Speaker 2>then you play a video game where that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

456
00:25:19.031 --> 00:25:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Or You watch a movie where that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

457
00:25:20.651 --> 00:25:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Or You read a book where that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening and it captures you.</v>

458
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Even if your atheistic and you're only </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is star wars,</v>

459
00:25:27.311 --> 00:25:28.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

460
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.730
<v Speaker 2>and it's still well really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really right.</v>

461
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.760
<v Speaker 2>It really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it still captures your imagination and </v>

462
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.060
<v Speaker 2>you act like someone who's possessed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious fervor.</v>

463
00:25:37.061 --> 00:25:40.090
<v Speaker 2>When you line up for three days to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first one into the theater,</v>

464
00:25:40.091 --> 00:25:45.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the while claiming that your </v>

465
00:25:45.091 --> 00:25:45.091
<v Speaker 2>atheistic to the core,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

466
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.820
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this,</v>

467
00:25:48.821 --> 00:25:53.821
<v Speaker 2>this without form and void is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic and certainly it's a hard thing </v>

468
00:25:54.341 --> 00:25:54.530
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

469
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard thing to get a grip on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

470
00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:01.650
<v Speaker 2>what exactly this means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I can give you another kind of </v>

471
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.131
<v Speaker 2>example of how you would experience the </v>
<v Speaker 2>formless chaos of potential in your own </v>

472
00:26:06.161 --> 00:26:11.161
<v Speaker 2>lives and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even how the order that you </v>

473
00:26:11.161 --> 00:26:11.161
<v Speaker 2>currently inhabit can dissolve into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

474
00:26:11.161 --> 00:26:14.440
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Dante's inferno,</v>

475
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.660
<v Speaker 2>when he outlined the levels of hail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Dante was trying to get to the bottom</v>

476
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:21.820
<v Speaker 2>of what constituted evil really in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

477
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.910
<v Speaker 2>in this representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a work of psychology.</v>

478
00:26:24.911 --> 00:26:26.320
<v Speaker 2>And he was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there,</v>

479
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.510
<v Speaker 2>there are various ways to behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible,</v>

480
00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.860
<v Speaker 2>but there is a hierarchy of re </v>
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible behavior and there's </v>

481
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.860
<v Speaker 2>something absolutely the worst at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>

482
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And Dante believed that it was be trail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's right,</v>

483
00:26:40.841 --> 00:26:45.841
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that enables our long </v>

484
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:50.360
<v Speaker 2>term cooperation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful cooperation between people is </v>

485
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:50.360
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>

486
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.990
<v Speaker 2>And I would also say that trust is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental natural resource.</v>

487
00:26:52.991 --> 00:26:57.991
<v Speaker 2>So there's been some very good books </v>
<v Speaker 2>written on the economic utility of </v>

488
00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:57.991
<v Speaker 2>trust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

489
00:26:57.991 --> 00:27:02.151
<v Speaker 2>in societies where the default economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>presupposition between trading partners </v>

490
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:07.810
<v Speaker 2>is trust tend to be rich even if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any natural resources.</v>

491
00:27:07.811 --> 00:27:09.480
<v Speaker 2>And you can see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

492
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.600
<v Speaker 2>with what happened with Ebay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think was a kind of miracle </v>

493
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.271
<v Speaker 2>because of what should have happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Ebay was that you sent me junk and </v>

494
00:27:17.271 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 2>I sent you a check that bounced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

495
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:19.860
<v Speaker 2>And that was the end of Ebay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

496
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

497
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:23.310
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't what happened.</v>

498
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:28.311
<v Speaker 2>You're like the default,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the default transaction on Ebay was so </v>

499
00:27:28.311 --> 00:27:31.530
<v Speaker 2>honest that the brokers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could hire brokers to begin with.</v>

500
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.510
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what they were called </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>

501
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:37.380
<v Speaker 2>but you could pay someone a fee so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would guarantee the transaction.</v>

502
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.350
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't send me John Can,</v>

503
00:27:39.351 --> 00:27:44.351
<v Speaker 2>I'd actually send you a payment and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay 10 percent for someone to guarantee </v>

504
00:27:44.351 --> 00:27:47.841
<v Speaker 2>that the default trade was so honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>that those things vanished right away.</v>

505
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.880
<v Speaker 2>And so that meant that all this frozen </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital,</v>

506
00:27:50.881 --> 00:27:55.881
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were all the junk that people had </v>

507
00:27:55.881 --> 00:27:58.161
<v Speaker 2>lying around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone else might want instantly </v>

508
00:27:58.161 --> 00:28:00.531
<v Speaker 2>became money and the only reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked was because people trusted one </v>

509
00:28:00.531 --> 00:28:00.531
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so trust is,</v>

510
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.420
<v Speaker 2>is unbelievably powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Economic Force,</v>

511
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:06.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe the most powerful economic force </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

512
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.050
<v Speaker 2>If you have a relationship with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's predicated on trust.</v>

513
00:28:10.051 --> 00:28:14.430
<v Speaker 2>And a part of the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that trust is what enables us to look at</v>

514
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:16.230
<v Speaker 2>each other without running away </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming.</v>

515
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.470
<v Speaker 2>And what I mean by that is that if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust you,</v>

516
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:24.590
<v Speaker 2>then I don't have to take into account </v>
<v Speaker 2>how complicated you are because you're </v>

517
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.590
<v Speaker 2>horribly complicated to know.</v>

518
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I think chimpanzee full of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a human being is.</v>

519
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 2>And as long as you'll do what you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll do,</v>

520
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.470
<v Speaker 2>then I can take you at your word and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your word simplify as you and you can </v>

521
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 2>take me at my word and my word simplify </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you,</v>

522
00:28:38.341 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 2>and then we can act like we understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other even though we don't.</v>

523
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.840
<v Speaker 2>But then if that trust is betrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then all the snakes come forth very,</v>

524
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:47.600
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you,</v>

525
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:53.270
<v Speaker 2>all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect of being betrayed one way or </v>

526
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.551
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens if you're in a </v>

527
00:28:55.551 --> 00:28:55.551
<v Speaker 2>relationship with someone and you trust </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

528
00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.950
<v Speaker 2>then you make certain assumptions about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the past and you make certain </v>

529
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.011
<v Speaker 2>assumptions about the present and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make certain assumptions about the </v>

530
00:29:04.011 --> 00:29:06.591
<v Speaker 2>future and everything stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're standing on solid ground </v>

531
00:29:06.591 --> 00:29:08.730
<v Speaker 2>and and the chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're standing on thin ice.</v>

532
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.780
<v Speaker 2>The chaos is hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sharp beneath the waves isn't there.</v>

533
00:29:12.781 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're safe.</v>

534
00:29:13.681 --> 00:29:16.530
<v Speaker 2>You're in the lifeboat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then if the person betrays you,</v>

535
00:29:16.531 --> 00:29:21.531
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship and the person has an </v>

536
00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:23.991
<v Speaker 2>affair and you find out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then you think one moment you're </v>

537
00:29:23.991 --> 00:29:23.991
<v Speaker 2>one place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

538
00:29:23.991 --> 00:29:28.780
<v Speaker 2>You're aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is secure because you </v>

539
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.970
<v Speaker 2>predicated your perception of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the axiom of trust and the next </v>

540
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.090
<v Speaker 2>second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really the next second,</v>

541
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.240
<v Speaker 2>you're in a completely different place </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not only is that place different </v>

542
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.601
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place you were years ago is </v>

543
00:29:41.601 --> 00:29:45.411
<v Speaker 2>different and the place you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the future years hanse is </v>

544
00:29:45.411 --> 00:29:48.541
<v Speaker 2>different and so all of that certainty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that strange certainty that you inhabit </v>

545
00:29:48.541 --> 00:29:51.820
<v Speaker 2>can collapse into incredible complexity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>

546
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:53.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone betrays you,</v>

547
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.800
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

548
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.600
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were you?</v>

549
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 2>Because you aren't who I thought you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were and I thought I knew you,</v>

550
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.990
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know you at all and I never</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew you.</v>

551
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:06.990
<v Speaker 2>And so all the things we did together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those weren't the things that I thought </v>

552
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.110
<v Speaker 2>were happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something else was happening and you're </v>

553
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.631
<v Speaker 2>you or someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means I'm someone else because </v>

554
00:30:12.631 --> 00:30:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I thought I knew what was going on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly I don't.</v>

555
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:17.791
<v Speaker 2>I'm some sort of blind sucker or the or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the victim of a psychopath or someone </v>

556
00:30:17.791 --> 00:30:22.201
<v Speaker 2>who is so naive that they can barely </v>
<v Speaker 2>live and I don't understand anything </v>

557
00:30:22.201 --> 00:30:25.741
<v Speaker 2>about human beings and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand anything about myself and I </v>

558
00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:26.800
<v Speaker 2>have no idea where I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was at home,</v>

559
00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:31.801
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a house and it's full of </v>

560
00:30:31.801 --> 00:30:34.351
<v Speaker 2>strangers and I don't know what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do tomorrow or next week or </v>

561
00:30:34.351 --> 00:30:38.191
<v Speaker 2>next year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like all of that certainty that </v>

562
00:30:38.191 --> 00:30:40.831
<v Speaker 2>habitable certainty collapses right back</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the potential from witchetty merged</v>

563
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.660
<v Speaker 2>and that's a terrifying thing.</v>

564
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:48.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a journey to the underworld from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mythological perspective and that is </v>

565
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 2>really something worth knowing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

566
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:55.921
<v Speaker 2>journeys to the underworld are </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily common in mythological </v>

567
00:30:55.921 --> 00:30:59.281
<v Speaker 2>stories and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the hobbit going out to find the </v>

568
00:30:59.281 --> 00:31:01.570
<v Speaker 2>smaller the dragon and get the gold is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>journey into the underworld.</v>

569
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Journeys to the underworld happen all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and modern people don't </v>

570
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.691
<v Speaker 2>understand what the underworld is except</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've all been there and we go </v>

571
00:31:09.691 --> 00:31:11.230
<v Speaker 2>there all the time and we'd go there </v>
<v Speaker 2>every time.</v>

572
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.240
<v Speaker 2>The solidity and stability of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've erected,</v>

573
00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:21.241
<v Speaker 2>at least partly through our speech is </v>
<v Speaker 2>shattered because while some sort of </v>

574
00:31:21.241 --> 00:31:25.471
<v Speaker 2>snake appears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another way of thinking about it </v>

575
00:31:25.471 --> 00:31:25.760
<v Speaker 2>and it's a really good way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it because you know,</v>

576
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.890
<v Speaker 2>no matter how carefully you construct a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little habitable area that's around you,</v>

577
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:35.070
<v Speaker 2>there's always something you didn't take</v>
<v Speaker 2>into account and there's always </v>

578
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:38.671
<v Speaker 2>something that can pop up its head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you in and make you aware of your </v>

579
00:31:38.671 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 2>mortality and age you for that matter or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even kill you.</v>

580
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's the permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the permanent situation of life.</v>

581
00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Which is part of the reason why I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of Adam and Eve,</v>

582
00:31:48.311 --> 00:31:49.690
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is archetipal.</v>

583
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.260
<v Speaker 2>It's because we do inhabit walled </v>
<v Speaker 2>gardens,</v>

584
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:58.261
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because a walled garden is half </v>

585
00:31:58.261 --> 00:31:59.300
<v Speaker 2>structure society and half nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a walled garden is.</v>

586
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.770
<v Speaker 2>A walled garden is a place of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

587
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.050
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of paradise and warmth and,</v>

588
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:05.020
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

589
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:05.950
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

590
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.240
<v Speaker 2>and love and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

591
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.760
<v Speaker 2>and sustenance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also the place where something </v>

592
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 2>can pop up at any moment and knock you </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of it.</v>

593
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:20.131
<v Speaker 2>And I think part of the reason that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>story exists at the beginning of this </v>

594
00:32:20.131 --> 00:32:24.211
<v Speaker 2>collection of books is because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>explains the eternal situation of human </v>

595
00:32:24.211 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're always in that situation.</v>

596
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 2>We're in a walled garden or we bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>well hope we are,</v>

597
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:34.500
<v Speaker 2>but there's always a snake and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>even worse because if there is a snake </v>

598
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.281
<v Speaker 2>where exactly the sort of creatures who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to do nothing but go and </v>

599
00:32:38.281 --> 00:32:39.320
<v Speaker 2>interact with that state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second that we can manage it,</v>

600
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

601
00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:45.270
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely the case that if you </v>

602
00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:45.270
<v Speaker 2>want a human being to muck around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

603
00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.430
<v Speaker 2>the best thing to do is to tell them not</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever to do it,</v>

604
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:49.220
<v Speaker 2>have anything to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course something,</v>

605
00:32:49.221 --> 00:32:54.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have teenagers or even children </v>

606
00:32:54.221 --> 00:32:57.940
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if you know anything about yourself </v>

607
00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:57.940
<v Speaker 2>or your partner.</v>

608
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.640
<v Speaker 2>So these stories are trying to express </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you might describe as an unchanging</v>

609
00:33:04.131 --> 00:33:06.080
<v Speaker 2>transcendent reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

610
00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:08.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something like what's common across</v>

611
00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:10.610
<v Speaker 2>all human experience across all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

612
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's what young essentially meant </v>
<v Speaker 2>by an archetype.</v>

613
00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:14.840
<v Speaker 2>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

614
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:20.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to think that what we see with </v>

615
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.540
<v Speaker 2>our senses is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course that's true,</v>

616
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:25.541
<v Speaker 2>but what we see with our senses is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's real that works at the timeframe </v>

617
00:33:25.541 --> 00:33:27.080
<v Speaker 2>that we exist in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

618
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:29.600
<v Speaker 2>And so we see things that we can touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pick up.</v>

619
00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 2>We see tools essentially that are useful</v>
<v Speaker 2>for our moment to moment activities.</v>

620
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:39.370
<v Speaker 2>We don't see the structures of eternity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially not the abstract structures </v>

621
00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:43.811
<v Speaker 2>of eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to imagine those with our </v>

622
00:33:43.811 --> 00:33:43.811
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

623
00:33:43.811 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly what these stories are</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

624
00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:44.750
<v Speaker 2>They're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

625
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:50.140
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's forms of stability that </v>

626
00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.540
<v Speaker 2>transcend our capacity to observe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is hardly surprising.</v>

627
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.130
<v Speaker 2>We know that if we're scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

628
00:33:55.131 --> 00:34:00.131
<v Speaker 2>Because we're always abstracting out </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we can't immediately </v>

629
00:34:00.131 --> 00:34:02.951
<v Speaker 2>observe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are metaphysical or moral </v>

630
00:34:02.951 --> 00:34:06.011
<v Speaker 2>realities or phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical realities that have the same </v>

631
00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:08.981
<v Speaker 2>nature that you can't see them in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life by observing them with your senses.</v>

632
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:14.261
<v Speaker 2>But you can imagine them with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination and sometimes the things </v>

633
00:34:14.261 --> 00:34:18.071
<v Speaker 2>that you imagine with your imagination </v>
<v Speaker 2>are more real than the things that you </v>

634
00:34:18.071 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 2>see numbers that are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

635
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:23.000
<v Speaker 2>and there's endless examples of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would say,</v>

636
00:34:23.001 --> 00:34:28.001
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is also a good way of thinking </v>

637
00:34:28.001 --> 00:34:30.461
<v Speaker 2>about fiction because a good work of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction is more real than the stories </v>

638
00:34:30.461 --> 00:34:32.630
<v Speaker 2>from which it was derived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it has no staying power,</v>

639
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:37.631
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's distilled reality even though in </v>

640
00:34:37.631 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 2>some sense it never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

641
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what you mean by happened.</v>

642
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

643
00:34:41.361 --> 00:34:42.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

644
00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:46.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a pattern that repeats in many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many places with variation.</v>

645
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.280
<v Speaker 2>You extract out the central pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

646
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.820
<v Speaker 2>it's the pattern purely never existed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>any specific form,</v>

647
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:58.180
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that you've pulled a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern out from all those exemplars </v>

648
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.710
<v Speaker 2>means that you've extracted something </v>
<v Speaker 2>real and I think the reason that the,</v>

649
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.800
<v Speaker 2>the story of Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we'll talk about and quite a bit </v>

650
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.531
<v Speaker 2>of detail today has net has been immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>to being forgotten is because it says </v>

651
00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:12.920
<v Speaker 2>things about the nature of the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition that are always true.</v>

652
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I can give you another brief example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

653
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 2>like people have a lot of guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

654
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:23.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a line of social psychology that</v>
<v Speaker 2>claims that most people feel that </v>

655
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 2>they're better than other people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just don't buy that,</v>

656
00:35:24.981 --> 00:35:27.170
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what I've seen in my life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's,</v>

657
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit biased because I'm a clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist and I see more people who </v>

658
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.550
<v Speaker 2>are overtly suffering maybe than people </v>
<v Speaker 2>do in general.</v>

659
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Although I'm not so sure about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't have to scratch very </v>

660
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:43.221
<v Speaker 2>far beneath the surface of most people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives before you find something truly </v>

661
00:35:43.221 --> 00:35:47.511
<v Speaker 2>tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean this sort of tragedy </v>

662
00:35:47.511 --> 00:35:47.511
<v Speaker 2>that you whine about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

663
00:35:47.511 --> 00:35:48.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mother has Alzheimer's or,</v>

664
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:53.751
<v Speaker 2>or your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your best friend committed suicide or </v>

665
00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:54.720
<v Speaker 2>you have a close relative with cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a sick child or you know,</v>

666
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:59.721
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with you because</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost everyone has at least one really </v>

667
00:35:59.721 --> 00:36:01.020
<v Speaker 2>terrible thing wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't,</v>

668
00:36:01.021 --> 00:36:01.740
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will.</v>

669
00:36:01.741 --> 00:36:05.680
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so know that,</v>

670
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:07.010
<v Speaker 2>that so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

671
00:36:07.011 --> 00:36:10.200
<v Speaker 2>that tragic sense of being there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people all the time.</v>

672
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's also the case that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

673
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 2>in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I rarely meet someone who says,</v>

674
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

675
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing everything I possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hell of a guy and I can't see how </v>

676
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:23.580
<v Speaker 2>I could possibly improve.</v>

677
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you meet,</v>

678
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.390
<v Speaker 2>you meet someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think they're narcissistic,</v>

679
00:36:27.391 --> 00:36:28.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would endure,</v>

680
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.190
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

681
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most people don't feel that way.</v>

682
00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:36.441
<v Speaker 2>They feel like they could do a hell of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot better than they are and they're </v>

683
00:36:36.441 --> 00:36:39.950
<v Speaker 2>quite acutely aware of their faults and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't feel that are what they </v>

684
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.970
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see what happens in the story of</v>

685
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Adam and Eve as well as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people become self conscious,</v>

686
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.170
<v Speaker 2>at least that's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get thrown out of paradise and then</v>

687
00:36:49.171 --> 00:36:54.171
<v Speaker 2>they're in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And history is a place where there's </v>

688
00:36:54.171 --> 00:36:56.841
<v Speaker 2>pain in childbirth and where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated by your mate and where you </v>

689
00:36:56.841 --> 00:37:00.771
<v Speaker 2>have to toil like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no other animal because you're </v>

690
00:37:00.771 --> 00:37:03.921
<v Speaker 2>aware of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to work and sacrifice the joys </v>

691
00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 2>of the present for the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

692
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:08.190
<v Speaker 2>And you know you're going to die and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have all that weight on you.</v>

693
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.970
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

694
00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:12.090
<v Speaker 2>that's just how can anything be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>true than not.</v>

695
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.750
<v Speaker 2>That's just as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how it is for.</v>

696
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're naive beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehension,</v>

697
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:22.130
<v Speaker 2>there's something about your life that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

698
00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:27.220
<v Speaker 2>that is echoed in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that representation and why it is </v>

699
00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:31.151
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're such strange creatures </v>

700
00:37:31.151 --> 00:37:31.890
<v Speaker 2>because we don't seem to really fit into</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in some sense.</v>

701
00:37:31.891 --> 00:37:34.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's also what's expressed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion of the fall.</v>

702
00:37:34.771 --> 00:37:36.390
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the existentialist said,</v>

703
00:37:36.391 --> 00:37:41.391
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people feel like they have a debt that </v>

704
00:37:41.391 --> 00:37:41.391
<v Speaker 2>they have to pay off to existence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

705
00:37:41.391 --> 00:37:46.210
<v Speaker 2>for the crime of there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the crime of there being something </v>

706
00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:50.031
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's because we're acutely </v>

707
00:37:50.031 --> 00:37:52.281
<v Speaker 2>aware that we have to offer something of</v>
<v Speaker 2>value to the people around us so that </v>

708
00:37:52.281 --> 00:37:52.490
<v Speaker 2>they can tolerate us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

709
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 2>well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going about our business.</v>

710
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:59.210
<v Speaker 2>But it seems deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that human beings seem to exist in </v>

711
00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:04.221
<v Speaker 2>a post cataclysmic world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly also what's </v>

712
00:38:04.221 --> 00:38:07.881
<v Speaker 2>represented in genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very interesting because you </v>

713
00:38:07.881 --> 00:38:07.881
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

714
00:38:07.881 --> 00:38:08.820
<v Speaker 2>in the Adam and Eve story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two,</v>

715
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.510
<v Speaker 2>there's two catastrophes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially there's the catastrophe that</v>

716
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:17.511
<v Speaker 2>occurs when Adam and eve wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we'll talk about in detail and </v>

717
00:38:17.511 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 2>become self conscious and know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're naked,</v>

718
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.790
<v Speaker 2>that and their eyes are open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

719
00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:24.770
<v Speaker 2>So that's the terminology that's used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to have your eyes open means to have</v>

720
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.960
<v Speaker 2>an increment in consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially [inaudible] eyes are </v>

721
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.561
<v Speaker 2>associated with consciousness for human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings because we're intensely visual </v>

722
00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:36.891
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the metaphor of having your eyes </v>

723
00:38:36.891 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 2>opened means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the same as the metaphor of coming to</v>

724
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:43.231
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as Adam and eve come to </v>

725
00:38:43.231 --> 00:38:43.231
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realized they were naked.</v>

726
00:38:43.231 --> 00:38:47.370
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic interpretation of that is </v>

727
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:47.440
<v Speaker 2>that it has something to do with sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>sin.</v>

728
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.800
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that I,</v>

729
00:38:49.801 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that that's what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

730
00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.400
<v Speaker 2>All the other elements about that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are irrelevant,</v>

731
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.890
<v Speaker 2>it's more of that to realize that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>naked.</v>

732
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

733
00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.690
<v Speaker 2>if you dream that you're naked on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage in front of people,</v>

734
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.750
<v Speaker 2>that's not a sexual dreams man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're some kind of strange </v>

735
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.750
<v Speaker 2>exhibitionist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

736
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:11.580
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you want to cover yourself up and </v>

737
00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.591
<v Speaker 2>get the hell off that stage as fast as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and so to be naked in front of </v>

738
00:39:13.591 --> 00:39:17.461
<v Speaker 2>a crowd is to have everyone to have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgment of the social world focused on </v>

739
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:24.510
<v Speaker 2>your self evident inadequacies and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes people self conscious and that </v>

740
00:39:25.121 --> 00:39:30.121
<v Speaker 2>that's a real human state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's associated with neuroticism and in </v>

741
00:39:30.121 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 2>the big five traits model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people don't like that at all.</v>

742
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:36.220
<v Speaker 2>They don't like having their fragility </v>
<v Speaker 2>and vulnerability exposed to the group.</v>

743
00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:40.570
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the two major fears of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because one is social humiliation</v>

744
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:44.580
<v Speaker 2>and the other is something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>mortality and death and like your.</v>

745
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Your typical agoraphobic for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to have both those fears at the </v>

746
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:52.660
<v Speaker 2>same time because she usually is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She tends to believe she's going to have</v>

747
00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:57.661
<v Speaker 2>a very spectacular and exhibition mystic</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart attack in a public place and make </v>

748
00:39:58.061 --> 00:40:00.430
<v Speaker 2>a terrible fool of herself while she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dying.</v>

749
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:05.820
<v Speaker 2>So then that's a good example of the two</v>
<v Speaker 2>archetipal fears that characterize,</v>

750
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.630
<v Speaker 2>characterize human beings.</v>

751
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.560
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>

752
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.040
<v Speaker 2>and I said that I tried to approach </v>
<v Speaker 2>these stories as if I didn't know what </v>

753
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.071
<v Speaker 2>they were about because that seemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to me because there are mysteries </v>

754
00:40:20.071 --> 00:40:23.551
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything about them is mysterious and </v>

755
00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:26.430
<v Speaker 2>why we have them is mysterious and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell you're all doing here is </v>

756
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.800
<v Speaker 2>mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

757
00:40:26.801 --> 00:40:31.801
<v Speaker 2>listening to this lecture and so and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading young [inaudible] young Carl </v>

758
00:40:31.801 --> 00:40:33.610
<v Speaker 2>young was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very helpful in this because he,</v>

759
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:38.020
<v Speaker 2>he faced these stories with a beginner's</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and presumed there was something to</v>

760
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:43.021
<v Speaker 2>him that he didn't understand given that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were at the very bloody bottom of </v>

761
00:40:43.021 --> 00:40:47.071
<v Speaker 2>our civilization in which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically perfectly clear and that </v>

762
00:40:47.071 --> 00:40:51.210
<v Speaker 2>they came out of the midst sub time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't satisfied with the idea of the</v>

763
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Freudian idea that God was just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>father or the Marxist idea that religion</v>

764
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 2>was the opiate of the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like religion was the opiate of the</v>

765
00:40:59.591 --> 00:41:04.591
<v Speaker 2>masses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then communism was the methamphetamine </v>

766
00:41:04.591 --> 00:41:05.320
<v Speaker 2>of the masses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that.</v>

767
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

768
00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.760
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been betrayed by someone and so </v>

769
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:18.760
<v Speaker 2>you fall into that underworld of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

770
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.270
<v Speaker 2>of doubt about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a serious place to be in that </v>

771
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.801
<v Speaker 2>underworld a because not only do you not</v>
<v Speaker 2>know where you came from or who you are </v>

772
00:41:26.801 --> 00:41:28.190
<v Speaker 2>or where you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad enough.</v>

773
00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's the underworld itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a subdivision of the </v>

774
00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.191
<v Speaker 2>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the worst suburb is I think what </v>

775
00:41:36.191 --> 00:41:38.270
<v Speaker 2>hell is essentially from a metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective because you know,</v>

776
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 2>if someone really cuts you off at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees,</v>

777
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:42.800
<v Speaker 2>especially if they do it in a malevolent</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

778
00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.250
<v Speaker 2>and if you're going to be betrayed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you really want to be betrayed properly,</v>

779
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 2>you want to be betrayed by someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really out to hurt you.</v>

780
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just weren't being stupid.</v>

781
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:53.300
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you for whatever reason.</v>

782
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:57.560
<v Speaker 2>And then that's also you plunged into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that underworld space.</v>

783
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's also when you start to nurse </v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings of resentment and agreement and</v>

784
00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:04.070
<v Speaker 2>murder and homicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even worse,</v>

785
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if people are betrayed enough,</v>

786
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.320
<v Speaker 2>they start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start to obsess about the utility </v>

787
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 2>of being itself and perhaps go to places</v>
<v Speaker 2>that no one would ever want to go with.</v>

788
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:18.910
<v Speaker 2>They were in their right mind and to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to develop a nurse fantasies of the </v>

789
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:23.441
<v Speaker 2>ultimate revenge and that's a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>place to be and that's held as far as I </v>

790
00:42:23.441 --> 00:42:27.701
<v Speaker 2>can tell and that's why hell is always </v>
<v Speaker 2>been a suburb of the underworld because </v>

791
00:42:27.701 --> 00:42:29.390
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get plunged into a situation that</v>

792
00:42:29.391 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand and things are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you anymore,</v>

793
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.850
<v Speaker 2>it's one step from being completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>confused.</v>

794
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:40.060
<v Speaker 2>It's only one step from being completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>confused to being completely outraged </v>

795
00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.320
<v Speaker 2>and resentful and then it's only one </v>
<v Speaker 2>step from there to really looking for </v>

796
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.921
<v Speaker 2>revenge and that can take you places </v>
<v Speaker 2>that well that that merely to imagine </v>

797
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:53.471
<v Speaker 2>properly can be traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen that happen with people </v>

798
00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:56.531
<v Speaker 2>many times and I think that anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses their imagination on themselves can</v>

799
00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.990
<v Speaker 2>see how that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I don't imagine there's a single</v>

800
00:42:59.991 --> 00:43:04.991
<v Speaker 2>person in the room that hasn't nursed </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly intense fantasies of revenge at </v>

801
00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:10.121
<v Speaker 2>least at one point in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually you know for what appeared </v>

802
00:43:10.121 --> 00:43:11.900
<v Speaker 2>to be good reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no picnic to get betrayed.</v>

803
00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:14.150
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it can shake your faith in being.</v>

804
00:43:14.151 --> 00:43:18.290
<v Speaker 2>But if it shakes it so badly that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned against being itself,</v>

805
00:43:18.291 --> 00:43:20.390
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly no solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

806
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:22.460
<v Speaker 2>All it does is make everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

807
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:24.290
<v Speaker 2>even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

808
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now so and God said,</v>

809
00:43:29.111 --> 00:43:34.111
<v Speaker 2>let there be light and there was light </v>
<v Speaker 2>and God saw that the light was good and </v>

810
00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:35.080
<v Speaker 2>God separated the light from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness.</v>

811
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.820
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another,</v>

812
00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.100
<v Speaker 2>that's another fundamental separation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

813
00:43:39.101 --> 00:43:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Light and darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are,</v>

814
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.120
<v Speaker 2>those are in some sense the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental,</v>

815
00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:48.180
<v Speaker 2>two of the fundamental elements of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious being because of course when </v>

816
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.940
<v Speaker 2>it's light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're awake and conscious because we're </v>

817
00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:51.970
<v Speaker 2>diurnal animals and when it's night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then we're asleep.</v>

818
00:43:51.971 --> 00:43:53.560
<v Speaker 2>And so our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

819
00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.530
<v Speaker 2>our existence is bounded by light and </v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness.</v>

820
00:43:56.531 --> 00:43:58.480
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're up and alert when it's light.</v>

821
00:43:58.481 --> 00:44:01.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because we're highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>visual animals,</v>

822
00:44:01.481 --> 00:44:03.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike most animals,</v>

823
00:44:03.101 --> 00:44:08.101
<v Speaker 2>because most animals you smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we use vision were very strange that </v>

824
00:44:08.101 --> 00:44:11.911
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Vision is associated with </v>

825
00:44:11.911 --> 00:44:14.041
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment and illumination and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the breaking of the dawn and with the </v>

826
00:44:14.041 --> 00:44:14.770
<v Speaker 2>coming of the new day and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that.</v>

827
00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:18.070
<v Speaker 2>So and so for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for light to be created is,</v>

828
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.100
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is associated in some sense with the </v>

829
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.501
<v Speaker 2>emergence of conscious being and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another echo of that notion and </v>

830
00:44:25.501 --> 00:44:29.930
<v Speaker 2>there the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the particular phrasing of the of the </v>

831
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 2>story also is important because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>that God sad,</v>

832
00:44:32.251 --> 00:44:37.251
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the use of that word and </v>

833
00:44:37.251 --> 00:44:39.480
<v Speaker 2>that's the active element of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that gives rise to,</v>

834
00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 2>gives order to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

835
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:47.091
<v Speaker 2>So it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the spirit of the structure </v>

836
00:44:47.091 --> 00:44:50.180
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself and and produces the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental divisions of experience.</v>

837
00:44:50.431 --> 00:44:55.431
<v Speaker 2>That's what's being presented here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God separated the light from the </v>

838
00:44:55.431 --> 00:44:57.510
<v Speaker 2>darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He called the light day and the darkness</v>

839
00:44:57.511 --> 00:45:02.511
<v Speaker 2>he called night and again again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that things are named is also </v>

840
00:45:02.511 --> 00:45:05.751
<v Speaker 2>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see this later without them </v>

841
00:45:05.751 --> 00:45:08.631
<v Speaker 2>because God gives them the job of naming</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the animals and it's sort of like </v>

842
00:45:08.631 --> 00:45:10.230
<v Speaker 2>the animals don't actually exist in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense till they're named.</v>

843
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:14.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another indication of the authors</v>

844
00:45:14.371 --> 00:45:19.371
<v Speaker 2>of the Bible's attempt to come to terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the fact that our cognitive </v>

845
00:45:19.371 --> 00:45:23.721
<v Speaker 2>faculties and our ability to speak have </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to do with the way that we </v>

846
00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:25.860
<v Speaker 2>cast chaotic potential into actuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

847
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:30.861
<v Speaker 2>Because we can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't really get a grip on something </v>

848
00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:30.870
<v Speaker 2>before we have a name for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why,</v>

849
00:45:30.871 --> 00:45:35.871
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all have names and everything that </v>

850
00:45:35.871 --> 00:45:36.270
<v Speaker 2>you encounter has to have a name because</v>
<v Speaker 2>before it has a name,</v>

851
00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:39.660
<v Speaker 2>it's just kind of part of the blurry </v>
<v Speaker 2>background and something like that.</v>

852
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:42.390
<v Speaker 2>And you could say it exists before it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a name,</v>

853
00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:43.440
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's true.</v>

854
00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:47.040
<v Speaker 2>But it's also true that it doesn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 2>before it has a name.</v>

855
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Because as soon as you give something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a name,</v>

856
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.280
<v Speaker 2>it's nature changes and you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed it into something that's not</v>

857
00:45:53.281 --> 00:45:58.281
<v Speaker 2>so much mira potential anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's at least on its way to being </v>

858
00:45:58.281 --> 00:45:58.281
<v Speaker 2>actuality.</v>

859
00:45:58.281 --> 00:46:00.660
<v Speaker 2>It's on its way to being a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

860
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 2>the act of naming is repeated </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually in the first chapters of the</v>

861
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:10.641
<v Speaker 2>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is this </v>

862
00:46:10.641 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 2>continued emphasis on the importance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and conscious articulation</v>

863
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:17.360
<v Speaker 2>and speech and speech is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that does separate us in an </v>

864
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.660
<v Speaker 2>important way from animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:46:18.661 --> 00:46:23.661
<v Speaker 2>like we haven't got very far teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals how to speak the best we've </v>

866
00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:26.400
<v Speaker 2>managed so far as some parrots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

867
00:46:26.401 --> 00:46:31.401
<v Speaker 2>There's gray African parrot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one of them that got up to </v>

868
00:46:31.401 --> 00:46:34.191
<v Speaker 2>about a four year old level and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind boggling because like how big is </v>

869
00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:36.840
<v Speaker 2>the brain of a parrot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that big and that bloody thing</v>

870
00:46:36.841 --> 00:46:41.841
<v Speaker 2>could talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that shows you how much we know </v>

871
00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:41.900
<v Speaker 2>about brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know they're small and all that.</v>

872
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:46.910
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we tried teaching chimpanzees to </v>

873
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.910
<v Speaker 2>talk and they could kind of get </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere with sign language,</v>

874
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.690
<v Speaker 2>especially if you started when they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>

875
00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:53.691
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have the capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>language like we do and they were never </v>

876
00:46:53.691 --> 00:46:56.100
<v Speaker 2>able to really pass it onto the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the next generation,</v>

877
00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:59.190
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously a critical element of</v>
<v Speaker 2>really having that ability.</v>

878
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.070
<v Speaker 2>So human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

879
00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.120
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've used our linguistic capacity to </v>

880
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.331
<v Speaker 2>parse up the world in a new way and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize it to the new way and you </v>

881
00:47:08.331 --> 00:47:11.700
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say that we're just like ants on</v>

882
00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:15.130
<v Speaker 2>this little trivial planet out on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>edge of,</v>

883
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:20.290
<v Speaker 2>of one of 100 million galaxies and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening here has no cosmic </v>

884
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:22.800
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's an arbitrary,</v>

885
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 2>that's an arbitrary a proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

886
00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:31.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're very complicated things and </v>

887
00:47:31.251 --> 00:47:33.680
<v Speaker 2>whatever's going on on this planet has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with conscious reality and the </v>

888
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.161
<v Speaker 2>transformations of consciousness for all</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know might be the most important </v>

889
00:47:38.161 --> 00:47:42.121
<v Speaker 2>things that happen everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to consider </v>

890
00:47:42.121 --> 00:47:43.080
<v Speaker 2>consciousness at trivial phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

891
00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:48.180
<v Speaker 2>it's taken three and a half billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>years for you to develop the brain that </v>

892
00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.540
<v Speaker 2>you've developed and you and human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings are amazing creatures.</v>

893
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:54.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a casual walk through youtube and </v>

894
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 2>all those crazy kids that climb cranes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do that.</v>

895
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.600
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Park who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

897
00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.220
<v Speaker 2>that stuff's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

898
00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are crazy,</v>

899
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:04.000
<v Speaker 2>crazy animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's almost nothing we can't do.</v>

900
00:48:04.001 --> 00:48:08.260
<v Speaker 2>And I'm very loath to assume that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation of consciousness that are</v>

901
00:48:08.261 --> 00:48:11.670
<v Speaker 2>described in the early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the early stories in,</v>

902
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:16.090
<v Speaker 2>in the biblical accounts are somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmically trivial.</v>

903
00:48:16.091 --> 00:48:19.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't strike me that way and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly not self evident.</v>

904
00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:23.470
<v Speaker 2>And even if they are cosmically trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means,</v>

905
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.050
<v Speaker 2>the rocks don't care what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

906
00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:29.500
<v Speaker 2>who cares what the rocks think first?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think so.</v>

907
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why that's exactly relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if even if it's all the same to</v>

908
00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:36.790
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that I doubt,</v>

909
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:39.580
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly not just all the same to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

910
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because your consciousness has a quality</v>

911
00:48:42.071 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 2>and it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heidegger,</v>

912
00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:45.070
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

913
00:48:45.071 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 2>who's a philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

914
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:51.330
<v Speaker 2>who's writing sort of influenced me post</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoc because I recreated some of the </v>

915
00:48:52.151 --> 00:48:55.150
<v Speaker 2>things that he had talked about in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties before I knew much about it,</v>

916
00:48:55.151 --> 00:49:00.070
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that heidegger </v>
<v Speaker 2>said was that the fundamental element of</v>

917
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:04.150
<v Speaker 2>human being of human phenomenology was </v>
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>

918
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.360
<v Speaker 2>You said that that's the basic essence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your being is that you care about </v>

919
00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.130
<v Speaker 2>things you know and that that's either </v>
<v Speaker 2>negatively or positively,</v>

920
00:49:12.131 --> 00:49:17.131
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to not care about something or to </v>

921
00:49:17.131 --> 00:49:19.441
<v Speaker 2>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is still to be involved in care and </v>

922
00:49:19.441 --> 00:49:22.411
<v Speaker 2>so even if the cosmos itself is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is neutral with regards to our </v>

923
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:27.010
<v Speaker 2>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not and we're the only things that</v>

924
00:49:27.011 --> 00:49:32.011
<v Speaker 2>we know of that are conscious and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>while we might as well go with that and </v>

925
00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:32.011
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

926
00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:36.841
<v Speaker 2>I can't help but think that the constant</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempts by people to trivialize the </v>

927
00:49:36.881 --> 00:49:40.450
<v Speaker 2>nature of their own consciousness has a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a dark side.</v>

928
00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm a psychoanalyst and so I always </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that way.</v>

929
00:49:43.151 --> 00:49:44.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

930
00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:45.430
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

931
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 2>if you as a being don't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't have to do anything.</v>

932
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:52.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a great justification for total </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of responsibility and that,</v>

933
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.120
<v Speaker 2>that really twigged something for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

934
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:57.910
<v Speaker 2>people who are band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

935
00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 2>or vengeful or angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are always looking for a reason why they</v>

936
00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:02.770
<v Speaker 2>don't have to be responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

937
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Plus plus it's a lot easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the notion that consciousness is </v>

938
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.010
<v Speaker 2>trivial immediately allows you to wander</v>
<v Speaker 2>down that path.</v>

939
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:14.400
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm skeptical of those claims and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that there's a deep hatred </v>

940
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 2>of humanity that underlies those claims </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

941
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:18.310
<v Speaker 2>And I read my youtube comments </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

942
00:50:18.311 --> 00:50:19.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've always been,</v>

943
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I've always been annoyed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

944
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:27.600
<v Speaker 2>because I've heard like sort of radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>clueless environmentalist say things </v>

945
00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.210
<v Speaker 2>like planet would be better off without </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on it,</v>

946
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 2>which is something that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just cannot say that,</v>

947
00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 2>that if you say that and listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

948
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:40.810
<v Speaker 2>you should like go to a monastery for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like three years and never say a word </v>

949
00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.890
<v Speaker 2>and have a shower every 10 minutes until</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've learned your lesson properly.</v>

950
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:48.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't order a more genocidal phrase </v>

951
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:51.580
<v Speaker 2>the mat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course you always do it in a </v>

952
00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.280
<v Speaker 2>display of your care for the world.</v>

953
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:52.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

954
00:50:52.731 --> 00:50:54.410
<v Speaker 2>if we just didn't have any people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

955
00:50:54.411 --> 00:50:59.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just line them all up and shoot </v>

956
00:50:59.411 --> 00:50:59.411
<v Speaker 2>them with machine guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

957
00:50:59.411 --> 00:51:00.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really sickening.</v>

958
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:01.410
<v Speaker 2>It's appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

959
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:04.490
<v Speaker 2>And there's a hatred for humanity that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom of it and I mean,</v>

960
00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:09.491
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of understand why because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're messy and we don't clean up after </v>

961
00:51:09.491 --> 00:51:13.361
<v Speaker 2>ourselves and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like raping the rain forests and </v>

962
00:51:13.361 --> 00:51:16.511
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do have some sympathy for people </v>

963
00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:16.511
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

964
00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:16.511
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

965
00:51:16.511 --> 00:51:19.310
<v Speaker 2>we're hell on mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she certainly returns the favor.</v>

966
00:51:19.311 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good thing to remember,</v>

967
00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:24.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what we're doing is just bloody</v>

968
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:29.000
<v Speaker 2>well trying to exist with a relative </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum of pain and we're doing our best</v>

969
00:51:29.001 --> 00:51:29.990
<v Speaker 2>to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

970
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.570
<v Speaker 2>to get as good at doing that as fast as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>

971
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:37.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's not an easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are lots of us and like life is </v>

972
00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:40.541
<v Speaker 2>bloody complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that happens too is </v>

973
00:51:40.541 --> 00:51:43.571
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you scratch beneath the surface of </v>

974
00:51:43.571 --> 00:51:43.571
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that's always,</v>

975
00:51:43.571 --> 00:51:44.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

976
00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:47.330
<v Speaker 2>it's been a kind of miracle is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to someone,</v>

977
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 2>they're out doing their job and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a good job at it.</v>

978
00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:52.280
<v Speaker 2>Like some emergency room nurse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

979
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:54.830
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a job for you or maybe they work</v>

980
00:51:54.831 --> 00:51:56.480
<v Speaker 2>in palliative care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

981
00:51:56.481 --> 00:51:59.090
<v Speaker 2>when you talk to them and you find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got like four,</v>

982
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:04.180
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a serious problems in their family and </v>

983
00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.181
<v Speaker 2>maybe their diabetic to boot and yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>they haul themselves out of bed in the </v>

984
00:52:07.181 --> 00:52:08.210
<v Speaker 2>morning and go and take care of dying </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

985
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:13.211
<v Speaker 2>It's like good God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People deserve a bit of respect for </v>

986
00:52:13.211 --> 00:52:17.050
<v Speaker 2>struggling forward and not always trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the planet a worst place when </v>

987
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.140
<v Speaker 2>they're beset on all sides constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

988
00:52:20.141 --> 00:52:25.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what unending series of tragedy you </v>

989
00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:27.491
<v Speaker 2>think we could have a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathy for ourselves as a consequence </v>

990
00:52:27.491 --> 00:52:27.491
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

991
00:52:27.491 --> 00:52:31.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're not all like rapacious </v>
<v Speaker 2>greedy monsters who are bent on just </v>

992
00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 2>devouring everything in our path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.600
<v Speaker 2>so a little bit more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

994
00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:38.000
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

995
00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

996
00:52:38.931 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

997
00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:42.320
<v Speaker 2>so let's go to the next part of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

998
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.650
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so God said,</v>

999
00:52:45.651 --> 00:52:50.651
<v Speaker 2>let there be an expanse in the midst of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the waters and let it separate the </v>

1000
00:52:50.651 --> 00:52:54.131
<v Speaker 2>waters from the waters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God made the expanse and separated </v>

1001
00:52:54.131 --> 00:52:57.671
<v Speaker 2>the waters that were under the expanse </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the waters that were above the </v>

1002
00:52:57.671 --> 00:52:59.720
<v Speaker 2>expanse and it was so and God called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>expanse heaven and there was evening and</v>

1003
00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 2>there was morning the second day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well to understand that because what,</v>

1004
00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:08.660
<v Speaker 2>how did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense at all </v>

1005
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:09.020
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think I told you a little bit about</v>

1006
00:53:09.021 --> 00:53:10.710
<v Speaker 2>this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1007
00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:15.780
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world that's being created in this </v>

1008
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:15.780
<v Speaker 2>particular account is a phenomenological</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1009
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a disk of land because if you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in the field and look around,</v>

1010
00:53:18.921 --> 00:53:20.930
<v Speaker 2>you're on a disk of land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty obvious.</v>

1011
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:25.931
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a dome on top of it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less held up by the mountains </v>

1012
00:53:25.931 --> 00:53:28.991
<v Speaker 2>and rain comes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's water above the dome because </v>

1013
00:53:28.991 --> 00:53:28.991
<v Speaker 2>where else would the rate come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1014
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.650
<v Speaker 2>and underneath the ground there's fresh </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

1015
00:53:31.651 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 2>You can drill down and find that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then around that there's salt water.</v>

1016
00:53:34.441 --> 00:53:39.441
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of an empirical world </v>

1017
00:53:39.441 --> 00:53:42.711
<v Speaker 2>because if you're a child and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and field and you look at the </v>

1018
00:53:42.711 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of what it would be like.</v>

1019
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the world that's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>created.</v>

1020
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:48.480
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that is worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about,</v>

1021
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.670
<v Speaker 2>this is something Carl young was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in,</v>

1022
00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:57.850
<v Speaker 2>is that these old descriptions are half </v>
<v Speaker 2>geographical and half empirical,</v>

1023
00:53:57.851 --> 00:54:01.360
<v Speaker 2>so sort of based on observation and half</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological.</v>

1024
00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.550
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things young was </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in,</v>

1025
00:54:03.551 --> 00:54:05.020
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was astrology,</v>

1026
00:54:05.021 --> 00:54:07.990
<v Speaker 2>but mostly for a psychological reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1027
00:54:07.991 --> 00:54:10.660
<v Speaker 2>they're obviously there are stars up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dome.</v>

1028
00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:16.050
<v Speaker 2>And then when you look at the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine the shapes of the stars </v>

1029
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.820
<v Speaker 2>and that helps you orient yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as soon as you can see shapes in</v>

1030
00:54:18.821 --> 00:54:23.821
<v Speaker 2>the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can recognize the </v>

1031
00:54:23.821 --> 00:54:23.821
<v Speaker 2>constellations and you can orient </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself at night.</v>

1032
00:54:23.821 --> 00:54:26.260
<v Speaker 2>But then the constellations become God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it in the gods,</v>

1033
00:54:26.261 --> 00:54:30.670
<v Speaker 2>turned into a drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and the drama comes from within.</v>

1034
00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:35.700
<v Speaker 2>It's the projection of imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when young was analyzing </v>

1035
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.230
<v Speaker 2>astrology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a matt analyzing psychology.</v>

1036
00:54:38.231 --> 00:54:43.231
<v Speaker 2>Because he saw the astrological </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative as the projection of the human</v>

1037
00:54:44.171 --> 00:54:47.530
<v Speaker 2>imagination onto the cosmos and so when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was analyzing astrology,</v>

1038
00:54:47.531 --> 00:54:52.531
<v Speaker 2>who is analyzing psychology and that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing as the case with these </v>

1039
00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:54.580
<v Speaker 2>stories is that the world they they </v>
<v Speaker 2>described is only,</v>

1040
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:59.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not the natural world like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist would describe it because </v>

1041
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.670
<v Speaker 2>these people weren't scientists.</v>

1042
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.420
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the technology and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools.</v>

1043
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:06.750
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the way they fruit for them it </v>

1044
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:09.040
<v Speaker 2>was the world for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the way they saw the world.</v>

1045
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 2>And so we're looking at the way they saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and a lot of that psychology </v>

1046
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:16.660
<v Speaker 2>and we share that psychology to a large </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree with those people.</v>

1047
00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:21.930
<v Speaker 2>So in this is psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting to know what the </v>

1048
00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:24.950
<v Speaker 2>geographical substrate is so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can kind of understand the stories.</v>

1049
00:55:24.951 --> 00:55:29.951
<v Speaker 2>And I like this picture because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great from a psychological </v>

1050
00:55:29.951 --> 00:55:30.850
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very famous picture and you know,</v>

1051
00:55:30.851 --> 00:55:33.490
<v Speaker 2>so basically what you have here is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world as we know it.</v>

1052
00:55:33.491 --> 00:55:37.000
<v Speaker 2>And there's the dome with the Sun and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon on it and the stars.</v>

1053
00:55:37.001 --> 00:55:39.910
<v Speaker 2>And then if you look outside what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1054
00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:42.220
<v Speaker 2>well then you're out into this cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

1055
00:55:42.221 --> 00:55:42.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1056
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are like the wheels of,</v>

1057
00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:47.260
<v Speaker 2>of the planets and the music of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spheres.</v>

1058
00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:52.590
<v Speaker 2>That's the ever present explorer who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone beyond the domain that he can </v>

1059
00:55:52.601 --> 00:55:55.480
<v Speaker 2>understand and is peering out into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown as such.</v>

1060
00:55:55.481 --> 00:56:00.481
<v Speaker 2>And it's a psychological pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like because you do know some </v>

1061
00:56:00.481 --> 00:56:04.741
<v Speaker 2>things and then outside of that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are things you don't know and when </v>

1062
00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:07.561
<v Speaker 2>you're feeling brave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put a foot or two out where you </v>

1063
00:56:07.561 --> 00:56:08.770
<v Speaker 2>don't understand like because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>frontier everywhere,</v>

1064
00:56:08.771 --> 00:56:10.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're,</v>

1065
00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:15.330
<v Speaker 2>if you're feeling heroic and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something for the world and you want </v>

1066
00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:16.480
<v Speaker 2>to expand what you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you poke your head through what you know</v>

1067
00:56:16.481 --> 00:56:18.640
<v Speaker 2>when you take a look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

1068
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.670
<v Speaker 2>at whatever structure is out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1069
00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.640
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty smart because of them is </v>
<v Speaker 2>still where it's safe.</v>

1070
00:56:24.641 --> 00:56:29.641
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing because if you jump </v>

1071
00:56:29.641 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 2>right out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then maybe you fall off the edge of</v>

1072
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:31.060
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>

1073
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.390
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't precisely recommend that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you do it accidentally,</v>

1074
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:39.780
<v Speaker 2>and to me this is a recreation of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Taoist Yin Yang symbol,</v>

1075
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

1076
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:45.990
<v Speaker 2>with the White Paisley here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what you know in the dark </v>

1077
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:49.621
<v Speaker 2>paisley serpents really there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the right place to be is right on </v>

1078
00:56:49.621 --> 00:56:53.431
<v Speaker 2>the line between them because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of got one foot where you </v>

1079
00:56:53.431 --> 00:56:55.210
<v Speaker 2>understand that gives you security and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

1080
00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of dull because hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1081
00:56:57.011 --> 00:56:59.890
<v Speaker 2>everything that's going on there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what people are like.</v>

1082
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.920
<v Speaker 2>They don't want just security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky said that in notes from the </v>

1083
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.470
<v Speaker 2>underground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great,</v>

1084
00:57:05.471 --> 00:57:07.150
<v Speaker 2>great book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

1085
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was his,</v>

1086
00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:13.650
<v Speaker 2>an early critic critic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism of the notion of a political </v>

1087
00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:13.650
<v Speaker 2>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1088
00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:18.481
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you gave people everything they </v>

1089
00:57:18.481 --> 00:57:20.071
<v Speaker 2>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had nothing deep but cake and </v>

1090
00:57:20.071 --> 00:57:24.330
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sit in warm pools and busy </v>

1091
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:24.330
<v Speaker 2>themselves with the continuation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>species.</v>

1092
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:29.310
<v Speaker 2>That was his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his lines that the first thing they </v>

1093
00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:30.180
<v Speaker 2>would do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe after the first week was like</v>

1094
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:32.860
<v Speaker 2>goal kind of half insane and smash </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything up.</v>

1095
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Just so that something that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect,</v>

1096
00:57:34.721 --> 00:57:39.721
<v Speaker 2>what happened so that they'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>something interesting to do and it's so </v>

1097
00:57:39.721 --> 00:57:39.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

1098
00:57:39.911 --> 00:57:44.911
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the utopia notion that if you just had </v>

1099
00:57:44.911 --> 00:57:45.190
<v Speaker 2>all the material stuff you wanted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd,</v>

1100
00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.020
<v Speaker 2>you'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1101
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.910
<v Speaker 2>what would you be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do?</v>

1102
00:57:48.911 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Would you just sit on the couch and </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch TV?</v>

1103
00:57:52.121 --> 00:57:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1104
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be,</v>

1105
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:59.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you'd be cutting </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself just for entertainment in no </v>

1106
00:57:59.010 --> 00:57:59.010
<v Speaker 2>time flat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1107
00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's the sort of thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1108
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:05.491
<v Speaker 2>And so we're not adapted for security </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Utopia were adapted for a certain </v>

1109
00:58:06.461 --> 00:58:07.930
<v Speaker 2>amount of security because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:12.980
<v Speaker 2>we are vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mostly we want to have one foot out </v>

1111
00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.100
<v Speaker 2>where we don't know what the hell is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on because that's where your alert</v>

1112
00:58:15.101 --> 00:58:19.330
<v Speaker 2>and alive and tents and with it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1113
00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I think I believe this and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually has something to do with </v>

1114
00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.120
<v Speaker 2>the hemispheric structure of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your,</v>

1115
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:30.150
<v Speaker 2>of the physiology of your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the right hemisphere looks </v>

1116
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:31.360
<v Speaker 2>roughly adapted to what you don't know.</v>

1117
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:33.580
<v Speaker 2>And the left hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very,</v>

1118
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:35.920
<v Speaker 2>this is an over simplification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a useful one,</v>

1119
00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:41.490
<v Speaker 2>is adapted to the world that you do know</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the right place for you to be as </v>

1120
00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:42.480
<v Speaker 2>halfway between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that,</v>

1121
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:47.490
<v Speaker 2>and you can tell that that's what's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool and this tells you that this is </v>

1122
00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.180
<v Speaker 2>actually reality that's manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1123
00:58:49.181 --> 00:58:54.181
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that sense of active </v>
<v Speaker 2>engagement you have in the world when </v>

1124
00:58:54.181 --> 00:58:55.210
<v Speaker 2>things are working well for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know where you're.</v>

1125
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Where are you should be at the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1126
00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:02.580
<v Speaker 2>You're alert and on top of things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged and you don't have much of a </v>

1127
00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:06.391
<v Speaker 2>sense of time and the sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy of life sort of recedes and </v>

1128
00:59:06.391 --> 00:59:07.720
<v Speaker 2>that's when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when you've got one foot,</v>

1129
00:59:07.721 --> 00:59:12.721
<v Speaker 2>when it's where it's secure in one foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in the unknown and your brain </v>

1130
00:59:12.721 --> 00:59:16.711
<v Speaker 2>signals to you that you're in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>place by making what you're doing </v>

1131
00:59:16.711 --> 00:59:16.711
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>

1132
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.320
<v Speaker 2>And that sense of meaning is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurophysiological signal,</v>

1133
00:59:20.321 --> 00:59:25.321
<v Speaker 2>but you've got forces of the cosmos </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly balanced in your being at that </v>

1134
00:59:25.321 --> 00:59:29.801
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it feels so good and it </v>

1135
00:59:29.801 --> 00:59:29.801
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else could it possibly be?</v>

1136
00:59:29.801 --> 00:59:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1137
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:31.360
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1138
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.910
<v Speaker 2>our brain is capable of looking beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>our vision.</v>

1139
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:38.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's for and that sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>engagement.</v>

1140
00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:43.841
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to assume that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything but a real signal and you can </v>

1141
00:59:43.841 --> 00:59:44.150
<v Speaker 2>reduce it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could say,</v>

1142
00:59:44.151 --> 00:59:49.151
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with being where you know </v>

1143
00:59:49.151 --> 00:59:52.570
<v Speaker 2>only is that you don't know everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's going to be a problem in the </v>

1144
00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:56.681
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with being where you </v>

1145
00:59:56.681 --> 00:59:56.930
<v Speaker 2>know nothing is that's just too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1146
00:59:56.931 --> 01:00:01.931
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go into panic mode and because </v>

1147
01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:01.931
<v Speaker 2>anything can happen there and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle it,</v>

1148
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.160
<v Speaker 2>so you got to mediate between those two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1149
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:09.160
<v Speaker 2>You want to be secure enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your physiology isn't revving out of </v>

1150
01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.001
<v Speaker 2>control and you want to be out there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknown enough so that you keep </v>

1151
01:00:13.001 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 2>updating yourself constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>

1152
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:15.520
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1153
01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:20.690
<v Speaker 2>that's the place where information flow </v>
<v Speaker 2>is maximized and you know that because </v>

1154
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:24.731
<v Speaker 2>that's where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're having a really interesting </v>

1155
01:00:24.731 --> 01:00:27.071
<v Speaker 2>conversation with someone or you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gripped by a book or you're really into </v>

1156
01:00:27.071 --> 01:00:29.210
<v Speaker 2>a movie or maybe something that you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

1157
01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1158
01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 2>apart from your work or maybe even in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your work,</v>

1159
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 2>you're into it and that's because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are in the right place at the right time</v>

1160
01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:38.990
<v Speaker 2>in your whole nervous system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>signaling that to you.</v>

1161
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:42.080
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that's the sort of place</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should be all the time.</v>

1162
01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.900
<v Speaker 2>If of course you can't be because no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one's perfect,</v>

1163
01:00:44.901 --> 01:00:46.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1164
01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:49.130
<v Speaker 2>that's the recreation of paradise on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1165
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:52.700
<v Speaker 2>It's something like it because you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the right place at the right time.</v>

1166
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:54.860
<v Speaker 2>When that is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subject to certain,</v>

1167
01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.120
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Restrictions that we can talk about </v>

1168
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:01.120
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what this guy is doing and,</v>

1169
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.740
<v Speaker 2>and that's I would say akin to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>action that God is taking when he's </v>

1170
01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.870
<v Speaker 2>transforming the chaos of potential into</v>
<v Speaker 2>habitable big.</v>

1171
01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:14.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's the sort of thing that human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings are supposed to act out and God </v>

1172
01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:19.061
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let the waters under heaven be gathered </v>

1173
01:01:19.061 --> 01:01:19.061
<v Speaker 2>together into one place and let the dry </v>
<v Speaker 2>land appear.</v>

1174
01:01:19.061 --> 01:01:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And it was so god called the dry land </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth and the waters that were gathered </v>

1175
01:01:23.421 --> 01:01:28.421
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he called Seas and God saw that it was </v>

1176
01:01:28.421 --> 01:01:28.421
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1177
01:01:28.421 --> 01:01:29.780
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1178
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:34.870
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this play written by a German </v>

1179
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:35.570
<v Speaker 2>named Gupta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can never say that properly.</v>

1180
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:39.020
<v Speaker 2>It's Johan van g o e t h e,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can't say it,</v>

1181
01:01:39.021 --> 01:01:44.021
<v Speaker 2>but he wrote this play called Faust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote one part of it when he was </v>

1182
01:01:44.021 --> 01:01:48.851
<v Speaker 2>quite young and then files to when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was quite old and he has a character in </v>

1183
01:01:48.851 --> 01:01:52.391
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mephistopheles and Mephistopheles the </v>

1184
01:01:52.391 --> 01:01:54.731
<v Speaker 2>devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he actually has the devil explain </v>

1185
01:01:54.731 --> 01:01:55.040
<v Speaker 2>himself twice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically using the same words,</v>

1186
01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:56.480
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really like.</v>

1187
01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:01.540
<v Speaker 2>It was very profound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically girth is memphis awfully </v>

1188
01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:01.790
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1189
01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:05.930
<v Speaker 2>he's the adversary of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of putting it,</v>

1190
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's how it works out.</v>

1191
01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Mythologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the figure behind the snake in the </v>

1192
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.271
<v Speaker 2>garden of Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something we'll talk about </v>

1193
01:02:16.271 --> 01:02:16.271
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has a.</v>

1194
01:02:16.271 --> 01:02:19.390
<v Speaker 2>He has a sophisticated philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not just some random maker.</v>

1195
01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:24.450
<v Speaker 2>He's got a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a deep philosophy and his </v>

1196
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:24.660
<v Speaker 2>philosophy is quite straightforward and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's compelling,</v>

1197
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:29.690
<v Speaker 2>it's compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are gripped by it quite </v>

1198
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:32.571
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far more often than they think and his </v>

1199
01:02:32.571 --> 01:02:32.571
<v Speaker 2>philosophy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1200
01:02:32.571 --> 01:02:32.571
<v Speaker 2>look around at the world.</v>

1201
01:02:32.571 --> 01:02:37.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like an I then Karamazov in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brothers Karamazov when he's trying to </v>

1202
01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:39.870
<v Speaker 2>disabuse his younger brother of being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1203
01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.830
<v Speaker 2>a Christian monk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mephistopheles says,</v>

1204
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the world.</v>

1205
01:02:44.641 --> 01:02:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you look around the world,</v>

1206
01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing but a blood bath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just suffering everywhere.</v>

1207
01:02:49.051 --> 01:02:54.051
<v Speaker 2>Everything eats everything and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>die terribly and they're cruel to one </v>

1208
01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:58.311
<v Speaker 2>another and the whole mess is nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>but a constant hall of terrible carnage </v>

1209
01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:00.990
<v Speaker 2>in and ruin and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1210
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1211
01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:03.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rec.</v>

1212
01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:08.970
<v Speaker 2>He says it it be better if it was never </v>
<v Speaker 2>existed at all.</v>

1213
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.940
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very,</v>

1214
01:03:11.941 --> 01:03:14.340
<v Speaker 2>very interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do believe,</v>

1215
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:17.820
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen this in people many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the depths of despair,</v>

1216
01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.550
<v Speaker 2>especially when you've been betrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1217
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.460
<v Speaker 2>and you wander into the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>subdivision of the underworld,</v>

1218
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.760
<v Speaker 2>that's something that comes to mind if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a very sick child,</v>

1219
01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:31.761
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe your whole family is suffering </v>

1220
01:03:31.761 --> 01:03:31.761
<v Speaker 2>as whole families do.</v>

1221
01:03:31.761 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes an idea is going to come to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1222
01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:37.731
<v Speaker 2>It's like good God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who put this message together and is it </v>

1223
01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:38.100
<v Speaker 2>really worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it really worth this suffering?</v>

1224
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:39.750
<v Speaker 2>Suicidal people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1225
01:03:39.751 --> 01:03:42.510
<v Speaker 2>they say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say no enough of this.</v>

1226
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be pushed along way.</v>

1227
01:03:44.281 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking before you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually commit suicide.</v>

1228
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:49.440
<v Speaker 2>You have to be in very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very desperate straits.</v>

1229
01:03:49.441 --> 01:03:54.441
<v Speaker 2>But your answer under those conditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that being is such that it would be </v>

1230
01:03:54.441 --> 01:03:56.940
<v Speaker 2>better if it had never been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very,</v>

1231
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very.</v>

1232
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:04.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe because I think what happens </v>

1233
01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.551
<v Speaker 2>if you acted out is that you make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very things that lead you to despair far</v>

1234
01:04:08.221 --> 01:04:10.410
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't see that.</v>

1235
01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:15.411
<v Speaker 2>If it's reasonable to draw a logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion that suffering should justify</v>

1236
01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:21.481
<v Speaker 2>as your desire to make being in that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer to that can be to produce more </v>

1237
01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:21.600
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

1238
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:26.930
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my observation has been that people </v>

1239
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:30.981
<v Speaker 2>who act out the Memphis too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feely and philosophy inevitably make </v>

1240
01:04:30.981 --> 01:04:34.981
<v Speaker 2>suffering far worse and so and then that</v>
<v Speaker 2>raises the specter of well do they </v>

1241
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:39.270
<v Speaker 2>weren't being just to cease or are they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just out for bloody revenge at every,</v>

1242
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:44.300
<v Speaker 2>at any cost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my conclusion has always been that </v>

1243
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.860
<v Speaker 2>is that the mask is well being shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist because it's too terrible,</v>

1244
01:04:46.861 --> 01:04:51.861
<v Speaker 2>but the true motivation is I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make everyone suffer as much as I </v>

1245
01:04:51.861 --> 01:04:52.700
<v Speaker 2>possibly can before I say goodbye to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this place.</v>

1246
01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:58.090
<v Speaker 2>And if you read the writings of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the kids who showed up the </v>

1247
01:04:58.090 --> 01:04:58.440
<v Speaker 2>columbine high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll tell you exactly that.</v>

1248
01:04:58.441 --> 01:05:02.640
<v Speaker 2>That's precisely and exactly what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>concluded and then acted out.</v>

1249
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:08.060
<v Speaker 2>So anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in this God says that it was good </v>

1250
01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.751
<v Speaker 2>and I've thought about that a lot is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like because the question is something </v>

1251
01:05:10.751 --> 01:05:10.751
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1252
01:05:10.751 --> 01:05:11.430
<v Speaker 2>is it something better than nothing?</v>

1253
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Because that's a really good question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1254
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.880
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about two things in </v>

1255
01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:19.960
<v Speaker 2>relationship to that and one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is,</v>

1256
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it depends on how it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are right,</v>

1257
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:28.470
<v Speaker 2>because it could be that there are ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being in the world that justify the </v>

1258
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:31.240
<v Speaker 2>world and their ways of being in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that make the world unbearable.</v>

1259
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.480
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that the narrative that </v>
<v Speaker 2>runs through the biblical stories is </v>

1260
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.350
<v Speaker 2>precisely a dialogue between those two </v>
<v Speaker 2>types of being.</v>

1261
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.560
<v Speaker 2>And the optimistic part of the story is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that being requires limitation and </v>

1262
01:05:44.081 --> 01:05:45.970
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no escape from that.</v>

1263
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:51.150
<v Speaker 2>But there are modes of being that allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to be perhaps even more than </v>

1264
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:55.231
<v Speaker 2>tolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps there are modes of being that </v>

1265
01:05:55.231 --> 01:05:56.110
<v Speaker 2>allow that to be good and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight and narrow road.</v>

1266
01:05:56.111 --> 01:05:58.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a very difficult road to tread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1267
01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.270
<v Speaker 2>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1268
01:05:59.271 --> 01:06:00.790
<v Speaker 2>that that's possible.</v>

1269
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an optimist by nature and,</v>

1270
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:04.510
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1271
01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.560
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized and read about that I </v>

1272
01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.080
<v Speaker 2>actually find plausible because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly the case.</v>

1273
01:06:11.081 --> 01:06:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are ways that you can act and</v>

1274
01:06:13.301 --> 01:06:15.760
<v Speaker 2>make things worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows that,</v>

1275
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:18.670
<v Speaker 2>and so if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be the opposite,</v>

1276
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:23.671
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has to be ways that you could act </v>

1277
01:06:23.671 --> 01:06:25.841
<v Speaker 2>that make things better and obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can act in ways that make things </v>

1278
01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:28.870
<v Speaker 2>really way worse and so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1279
01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:32.560
<v Speaker 2>are there ways that you can act and make</v>
<v Speaker 2>things really much better?</v>

1280
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:36.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the question is can </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have our cake and eat it too?</v>

1281
01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Can we have the being that requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitation and suffering and also </v>

1282
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:45.751
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously transcend that by our </v>
<v Speaker 2>mode of being and I believe that the </v>

1283
01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:48.160
<v Speaker 2>biblical stories and perhaps not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>the biblical stories,</v>

1284
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:50.710
<v Speaker 2>but the biblical stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they human?</v>

1285
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Imagine one of the human imagination is </v>
<v Speaker 2>best attempts to address and answer that</v>

1286
01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:58.660
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the entire story is about.</v>

1287
01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:04.020
<v Speaker 2>So the first of it is the catastrophe of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the collapse of self consciousness and </v>

1288
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.060
<v Speaker 2>the entrance of humanity into history </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the rest of it is okay,</v>

1289
01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.150
<v Speaker 2>now we're in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we know that we're going to die.</v>

1290
01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:15.151
<v Speaker 2>We know about our mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're conscious of our own being is </v>

1291
01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:18.751
<v Speaker 2>their emotive acting in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows that to be justifiable or maybe </v>

1292
01:07:18.751 --> 01:07:23.251
<v Speaker 2>even more that allows that to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>triumphant and then I would also say </v>

1293
01:07:23.251 --> 01:07:28.080
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's worth finding out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that that's the other thing </v>

1294
01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.951
<v Speaker 2>that's so interesting because you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>this short time on earth and there's </v>

1295
01:07:31.951 --> 01:07:35.281
<v Speaker 2>lots of things that are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to contend with and and </v>

1296
01:07:35.281 --> 01:07:38.440
<v Speaker 2>you have the problem of tolerating </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself even in all your insufficiency.</v>

1297
01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:43.440
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that seems to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the case is that if you adopt a </v>

1298
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.490
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently profound motive being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you attempt to do that,</v>

1299
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:50.700
<v Speaker 2>then the mere act of lifting up that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight is enough to justify the fact </v>

1300
01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:53.890
<v Speaker 2>that you're insufficient and mortal and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1301
01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bound by tragedy.</v>

1302
01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.960
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that and I believe people </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that because if you watch how </v>

1303
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:05.461
<v Speaker 2>people act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look for people they admire and </v>

1304
01:08:05.461 --> 01:08:05.461
<v Speaker 2>they do admire people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1305
01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.230
<v Speaker 2>It's a natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a natural phenomena.</v>

1306
01:08:08.231 --> 01:08:13.231
<v Speaker 2>You see it starting with children being </v>
<v Speaker 2>children admire and then they imitate </v>

1307
01:08:13.231 --> 01:08:17.040
<v Speaker 2>and we looked to people who seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to bear the burden being in a </v>

1308
01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 2>heroic manner and there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of us that calls to that and that</v>

1309
01:08:20.391 --> 01:08:23.390
<v Speaker 2>makes us want to mimic that and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow it.</v>

1310
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.470
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's.</v>

1311
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's the deepest and most</v>
<v Speaker 2>profound of instincts.</v>

1312
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:33.341
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's right and even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not so convinced on the positive </v>

1313
01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:37.211
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's more difficult to be </v>

1314
01:08:37.211 --> 01:08:39.311
<v Speaker 2>convinced of the positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can certainly be convinced on the </v>

1315
01:08:39.311 --> 01:08:42.311
<v Speaker 2>negative end because there are ways of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being that are so brutal and so </v>

1316
01:08:42.311 --> 01:08:46.010
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible that merely to read about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them is enough to traumatize you.</v>

1317
01:08:46.011 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if you're a person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't lost their soul completely,</v>

1318
01:08:50.451 --> 01:08:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you can't help but encounter stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and shudder away from them.</v>

1319
01:08:54.681 --> 01:08:57.860
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexander Solzhenitsyn,</v>

1320
01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:02.950
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the person who did most </v>

1321
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:06.071
<v Speaker 2>unmasked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the absolute horrors of communist </v>

1322
01:09:06.071 --> 01:09:08.330
<v Speaker 2>totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that he believed that the Nuremberg</v>

1323
01:09:08.331 --> 01:09:11.030
<v Speaker 2>judgments were the most important event </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the 20th century.</v>

1324
01:09:11.031 --> 01:09:14.390
<v Speaker 2>And that was the judgment at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>World War II,</v>

1325
01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:19.420
<v Speaker 2>that there were certain actions that no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one was to undertake no matter what </v>

1326
01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.030
<v Speaker 2>their cultural background was because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1327
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.240
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crimes against humanity that there was </v>

1328
01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.780
<v Speaker 2>such a thing as universal evil and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can debate that,</v>

1329
01:09:26.781 --> 01:09:27.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1330
01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:28.340
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1331
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:29.870
<v Speaker 2>and people certainly have.</v>

1332
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:32.090
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is if you debate that,</v>

1333
01:09:32.091 --> 01:09:37.091
<v Speaker 2>then you have to say that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions under which the sorts of </v>

1334
01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:37.760
<v Speaker 2>things that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in the concentration camps,</v>

1335
01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:40.470
<v Speaker 2>which would be the gassing of children </v>
<v Speaker 2>after their torture and,</v>

1336
01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:45.710
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're forcible removal from their </v>

1337
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:45.740
<v Speaker 2>parents and all the terrible things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>went along with that,</v>

1338
01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:48.440
<v Speaker 2>that that's just okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just an opinion.</v>

1339
01:09:48.441 --> 01:09:53.441
<v Speaker 2>It's just something that happened and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are circumstances under which </v>

1340
01:09:53.441 --> 01:09:54.800
<v Speaker 2>that's justifiable if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's no transcendent,</v>

1341
01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:58.400
<v Speaker 2>good and evil underneath that argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only a matter of practicality.</v>

1342
01:09:58.730 --> 01:09:59.440
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1343
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.230
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to me that that's,</v>

1344
01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:05.870
<v Speaker 2>that's not the right conclusion to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it seems to me.</v>

1345
01:10:05.871 --> 01:10:09.410
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the units and concluded </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he looked at the Nuremberg trials.</v>

1346
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.800
<v Speaker 2>So the notion that the notion that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was good,</v>

1347
01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.170
<v Speaker 2>well even if you don't believe that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1348
01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:20.030
<v Speaker 2>because maybe it's not as good as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be,</v>

1349
01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's incumbent on you as </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who participates in the process </v>

1350
01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:25.490
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1351
01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:30.080
<v Speaker 2>furthering creation to act as if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be good at least.</v>

1352
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.810
<v Speaker 2>And to further that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all of your efforts,</v>

1353
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:36.500
<v Speaker 2>partly because what the hell else do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do that could possibly be better</v>

1354
01:10:36.501 --> 01:10:41.501
<v Speaker 2>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could possibly justify your </v>

1355
01:10:41.501 --> 01:10:41.501
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More than that.</v>

1356
01:10:41.501 --> 01:10:42.350
<v Speaker 2>And you know perfectly well if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1357
01:10:42.351 --> 01:10:45.080
<v Speaker 2>if you have any sense at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think clearly about it at all,</v>

1358
01:10:45.081 --> 01:10:47.690
<v Speaker 2>is that that's what you want to see in </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else.</v>

1359
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1360
01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:53.720
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're desperate and maybe you're </v>

1361
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:54.230
<v Speaker 2>cynical and now and then someone appears</v>
<v Speaker 2>that acts at least momentarily,</v>

1362
01:10:54.231 --> 01:10:59.231
<v Speaker 2>like a light in the darkness and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifts your spirit up and gives you a </v>

1363
01:10:59.231 --> 01:11:00.350
<v Speaker 2>little bit of hope and maybe helps you </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue on.</v>

1364
01:11:00.351 --> 01:11:02.960
<v Speaker 2>It's well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously a call to being.</v>

1365
01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:03.740
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1366
01:11:03.741 --> 01:11:06.050
<v Speaker 2>it's a statement from your own soul that</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1367
01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:07.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that.</v>

1368
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:10.430
<v Speaker 2>That's how you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe then,</v>

1369
01:11:10.431 --> 01:11:12.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get a chance to,</v>

1370
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:16.550
<v Speaker 2>to participate in what is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought too,</v>

1371
01:11:16.551 --> 01:11:20.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1372
01:11:20.241 --> 01:11:23.240
<v Speaker 2>we'll leave that for a little later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And God said,</v>

1373
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:28.270
<v Speaker 2>let the earth sprout vegetation plants </v>
<v Speaker 2>yielding seed and fruit trees bearing </v>

1374
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:30.590
<v Speaker 2>fruit in which is their seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each according to its kind on the earth.</v>

1375
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And it was so and the earth brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth vegetation.</v>

1376
01:11:33.741 --> 01:11:38.741
<v Speaker 2>Plants yielding seed according to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own kind and trees bearing fruit in </v>

1377
01:11:38.741 --> 01:11:40.190
<v Speaker 2>which is their seed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each according to its kind.</v>

1378
01:11:40.191 --> 01:11:45.191
<v Speaker 2>And God saw that it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was evening and there was morning </v>

1379
01:11:45.191 --> 01:11:45.191
<v Speaker 2>the third day.</v>

1380
01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1381
01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.140
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting these old pictures say,</v>

1382
01:11:53.141 --> 01:11:54.580
<v Speaker 2>because if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you go,</v>

1383
01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:59.610
<v Speaker 2>you got this halo around God's had and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the split again between night</v>

1384
01:12:00.221 --> 01:12:03.490
<v Speaker 2>and darkness and God's right on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>border between the two.</v>

1385
01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1386
01:12:05.171 --> 01:12:05.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1387
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.860
<v Speaker 2>that's what a halo is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Halo is the sun or the moon.</v>

1388
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's like a coin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you have the Queen's head on </v>

1389
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:15.250
<v Speaker 2>the coin and that's the queen on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moon and it's and it's silver and it's a</v>

1390
01:12:15.251 --> 01:12:20.251
<v Speaker 2>symbol of value because of course the </v>
<v Speaker 2>queen is sovereign and the moon is the </v>

1391
01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:22.320
<v Speaker 2>sovereign of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sky and gold of course is the sudden and</v>

1392
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.440
<v Speaker 2>gold is pure because it doesn't mix with</v>
<v Speaker 2>other metals and it shines like the sun,</v>

1393
01:12:26.441 --> 01:12:31.441
<v Speaker 2>so it partakes of the son and God </v>
<v Speaker 2>partakes of the sun because there's </v>

1394
01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:34.450
<v Speaker 2>something about whatever he represents </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with consciousness and</v>

1395
01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.840
<v Speaker 2>illumination and enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's that force of illumination.</v>

1396
01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Enlightenment that's right on the border</v>
<v Speaker 2>between these two sets of phenomena.</v>

1397
01:12:41.731 --> 01:12:46.731
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what that picture is </v>

1398
01:12:46.731 --> 01:12:46.731
<v Speaker 2>trying to present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

1399
01:12:46.731 --> 01:12:48.490
<v Speaker 2>it's a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>

1400
01:12:48.491 --> 01:12:53.491
<v Speaker 2>but it does again allude to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying idea that there's something </v>

1401
01:12:53.491 --> 01:12:56.050
<v Speaker 2>about consciousness that's integral to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to being itself.</v>

1402
01:12:57.450 --> 01:13:02.450
<v Speaker 2>And God said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let there be lights in the expanse of </v>

1403
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:04.551
<v Speaker 2>the heavens to separate the date from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night and let them be for signs and </v>

1404
01:13:04.551 --> 01:13:04.650
<v Speaker 2>for seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for days.</v>

1405
01:13:04.651 --> 01:13:05.820
<v Speaker 2>And for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1406
01:13:05.821 --> 01:13:10.821
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a remarkable bit of a bit of a </v>

1407
01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:13.850
<v Speaker 2>writing there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you just think about how bloody </v>

1408
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:16.251
<v Speaker 2>long it took our caveman ancestors to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the night sky and start to </v>

1409
01:13:16.251 --> 01:13:20.481
<v Speaker 2>figure out that there were repeating </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns across years that enabled them </v>

1410
01:13:20.481 --> 01:13:21.060
<v Speaker 2>to mark the seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1411
01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I just can't imagine how they figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out.</v>

1412
01:13:23.251 --> 01:13:27.150
<v Speaker 2>It's that the degree of careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>observation that it took.</v>

1413
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:32.210
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know people figured that out a long </v>

1414
01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:32.210
<v Speaker 2>time ago because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1415
01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:32.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1416
01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:36.741
<v Speaker 2>those great megalithic monuments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like stonehenge seemed to be </v>

1417
01:13:36.741 --> 01:13:40.820
<v Speaker 2>astronomical observatories essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see the same thing with the </v>

1418
01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:40.820
<v Speaker 2>pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1419
01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.110
<v Speaker 2>people were looking at the damn sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out,</v>

1420
01:13:43.111 --> 01:13:44.370
<v Speaker 2>looking at God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1421
01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:49.380
<v Speaker 2>because that's kind of what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at the night sky </v>

1422
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:49.980
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out the regularity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>order in the universe.</v>

1423
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's all compacted into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>little light,</v>

1424
01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:57.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let them be for signs and for </v>

1425
01:13:57.291 --> 01:13:58.020
<v Speaker 2>seasons to be oriented by the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1426
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:03.650
<v Speaker 2>And then let them be lights in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expanse of Heavens to give light upon </v>

1427
01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:04.410
<v Speaker 2>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was so and God made the two great</v>

1428
01:14:04.411 --> 01:14:09.411
<v Speaker 2>lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greater light to rule the day and </v>

1429
01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:12.530
<v Speaker 2>the lesser light to rule the night and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stars and God set them in the </v>

1430
01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:15.051
<v Speaker 2>expanse of the heavens to give light on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth to rule over the day and over </v>

1431
01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:19.441
<v Speaker 2>the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's an idea of sovereignty </v>

1432
01:14:19.441 --> 01:14:19.441
<v Speaker 2>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1433
01:14:19.441 --> 01:14:19.441
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1434
01:14:19.441 --> 01:14:23.210
<v Speaker 2>that there's an analogy between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruler and the and the heavenly bodies </v>

1435
01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:25.660
<v Speaker 2>that that light up the light up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness essentially.</v>

1436
01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:30.661
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really interesting idea too</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it took us a long time to come </v>

1437
01:14:30.661 --> 01:14:31.390
<v Speaker 2>to terms with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned last week,</v>

1438
01:14:31.391 --> 01:14:36.391
<v Speaker 2>to come to terms with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty itself and to decide what </v>

1439
01:14:36.391 --> 01:14:37.300
<v Speaker 2>constituted valid power.</v>

1440
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's not power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not power.</v>

1441
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.580
<v Speaker 2>It's authority and competence and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

1442
01:14:42.581 --> 01:14:47.581
<v Speaker 2>It's not dominance either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more sophisticated than that </v>

1443
01:14:47.581 --> 01:14:51.031
<v Speaker 2>because the people that you want to rule</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't people who have power because </v>

1444
01:14:51.031 --> 01:14:52.960
<v Speaker 2>power just means I can hurt you and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't hurt me back.</v>

1445
01:14:52.961 --> 01:14:54.240
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not that,</v>

1446
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:59.380
<v Speaker 2>that's not what you need from a ruler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though devolves into that from time</v>

1447
01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:02.230
<v Speaker 2>to time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you want is the kind of wisdom that</v>

1448
01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:05.970
<v Speaker 2>illuminates the darkness and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>associate the sovereign with the,</v>

1449
01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:11.130
<v Speaker 2>with a heavenly kings of the light is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly reasonable thing to do from a </v>

1450
01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:12.520
<v Speaker 2>metaphoric perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an ancient,</v>

1451
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:13.930
<v Speaker 2>ancient idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1452
01:15:13.931 --> 01:15:18.931
<v Speaker 2>and another example of how we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>grounded in a dream and God set them in </v>

1453
01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:23.731
<v Speaker 2>the expanse of heavens to give light on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth to rule over the day and the </v>

1454
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:24.160
<v Speaker 2>night and to separate the light from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness.</v>

1455
01:15:24.161 --> 01:15:25.630
<v Speaker 2>And God saw that it was good.</v>

1456
01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Now their emphasis on the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was better,</v>

1457
01:15:28.211 --> 01:15:30.820
<v Speaker 2>that there was something than nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1458
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:35.970
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could consider that the </v>

1459
01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 2>declaration of the cosmos is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1460
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:41.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better that there's something than </v>

1461
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.310
<v Speaker 2>nothing and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know that?</v>

1462
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And I guess the answer to that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something instead of nothing.</v>

1463
01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:45.610
<v Speaker 2>And I know that that's not proof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1464
01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's still a remarkable fact that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to be the case.</v>

1465
01:15:48.851 --> 01:15:52.900
<v Speaker 2>And no one does know why that is and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should go along with it and see</v>

1466
01:15:52.901 --> 01:15:54.280
<v Speaker 2>what we can do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1467
01:15:54.281 --> 01:15:58.480
<v Speaker 2>and see how we could make it better </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we certainly could if we were,</v>

1468
01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:02.770
<v Speaker 2>if we were really committed to it and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>shook our resentment and our,</v>

1469
01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:08.130
<v Speaker 2>our anger and our hatred and I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's reason for all of that because </v>

1470
01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.550
<v Speaker 2>people do suffer terribly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1471
01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what being could be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we all contributed,</v>

1472
01:16:12.821 --> 01:16:17.821
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributed to it to the best of our </v>

1473
01:16:17.821 --> 01:16:18.460
<v Speaker 2>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what we could conquer and</v>

1474
01:16:18.461 --> 01:16:23.461
<v Speaker 2>what sort of magnificent cities we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce and what things we could we </v>

1475
01:16:23.461 --> 01:16:24.190
<v Speaker 2>could eradicate from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1476
01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 2>from the suffering of the world.</v>

1477
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

1478
01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:35.750
<v Speaker 2>And there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1479
01:16:35.751 --> 01:16:39.440
<v Speaker 2>there's this guy I read about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing and I don't remember his</v>

1480
01:16:39.441 --> 01:16:40.200
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

1481
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.200
<v Speaker 2>he found out about this worm that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the Guinea worm.</v>

1482
01:16:43.201 --> 01:16:48.201
<v Speaker 2>And Guinea worm is a really horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and you can look it up if you </v>

1483
01:16:48.201 --> 01:16:51.161
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you a little bit about it </v>

1484
01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:52.601
<v Speaker 2>even though it's very distasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Guinea worm is a parasite that lives </v>

1485
01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:54.740
<v Speaker 2>in Africa to burrows under your skin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite long.</v>

1486
01:16:54.741 --> 01:16:58.820
<v Speaker 2>It's about that long and it's about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wide and so it'll burrow underneath your</v>

1487
01:16:58.821 --> 01:17:00.500
<v Speaker 2>leg and then it's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1488
01:17:00.501 --> 01:17:02.480
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it posts this little head out </v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole,</v>

1489
01:17:02.481 --> 01:17:04.460
<v Speaker 2>which is one of its delightful </v>
<v Speaker 2>tendencies.</v>

1490
01:17:04.461 --> 01:17:06.980
<v Speaker 2>And then if you want to pull it out it </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks,</v>

1491
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:12.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously otherwise you'd just </v>

1492
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.550
<v Speaker 2>pull</v>

1493
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it out and it would be dead and so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like that.</v>

1494
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:15.980
<v Speaker 1>So it just breaks off and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people had this horrible disease,</v>

1495
01:17:15.981 --> 01:17:18.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and did it while you can,</v>

1496
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:23.140
<v Speaker 1>you can't imagine what that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like because you're a part of the one </v>

1497
01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:23.600
<v Speaker 1>percent and you live in North America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thank God for that.</v>

1498
01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little.</v>

1499
01:17:24.951 --> 01:17:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you don't even want to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

1500
01:17:26.721 --> 01:17:31.721
<v Speaker 1>let alone habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went to Africa and wipe the damn </v>

1501
01:17:31.721 --> 01:17:31.721
<v Speaker 1>thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like crow.</v>

1502
01:17:31.721 --> 01:17:31.721
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1503
01:17:31.721 --> 01:17:34.220
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot better off without any Guinea</v>

1504
01:17:34.221 --> 01:17:39.221
<v Speaker 1>worms on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though that's like Guinea worm </v>

1505
01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:39.221
<v Speaker 1>genocide talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still,</v>

1506
01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty happy about it.</v>

1507
01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>And so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one guy who thought,</v>

1508
01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:44.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't need these things and yeah,</v>

1509
01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:45.770
<v Speaker 1>well fair enough.</v>

1510
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1511
01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.410
<v Speaker 1>so good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1512
01:17:51.411 --> 01:17:56.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he can die thinking that the </v>

1513
01:17:56.411 --> 01:17:56.411
<v Speaker 1>world's a better place than it was when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he first popped out and so,</v>

1514
01:17:56.411 --> 01:17:57.720
<v Speaker 1>so good for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1515
01:17:57.790 --> 01:17:59.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good aim,</v>

1516
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:04.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is to think that when you're on </v>

1517
01:18:04.931 --> 01:18:05.390
<v Speaker 1>your deathbed and you can look back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1518
01:18:05.391 --> 01:18:08.480
<v Speaker 1>well there's a little less suffering in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world from here on out.</v>

1519
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Then there would be if I had never </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed and that's a lot better than the</v>

1520
01:18:11.601 --> 01:18:13.610
<v Speaker 1>opposite because it's certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1521
01:18:13.611 --> 01:18:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Say if your stolen to ensure that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a hell of a lot more suffering in the</v>

1522
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:22.391
<v Speaker 1>world and there would have been if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't lived and we perfectly well know </v>

1523
01:18:22.391 --> 01:18:22.850
<v Speaker 1>that people can manage that and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1524
01:18:22.851 --> 01:18:27.530
<v Speaker 1>many people try to do nothing but manage</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely that.</v>

1525
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:32.830
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard for me not to think about </v>

1526
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:35.081
<v Speaker 1>that as some sort of metaphysical evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's the right way to look </v>

1527
01:18:35.081 --> 01:18:39.011
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was evening and there was </v>

1528
01:18:39.011 --> 01:18:40.661
<v Speaker 1>morning the fourth day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have the sun here and then the </v>

1529
01:18:43.271 --> 01:18:44.470
<v Speaker 1>moon here as far as I can.</v>

1530
01:18:51.330 --> 01:18:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Actually I think this is the moon over </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1532
01:18:53.531 --> 01:18:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1533
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.300
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1534
01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:58.660
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the Sistine Chapel,</v>

1535
01:18:58.661 --> 01:18:59.320
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1536
01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.740
<v Speaker 1>an absolutely remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No part of the reason too,</v>

1537
01:19:02.741 --> 01:19:05.650
<v Speaker 1>in the part of the reason I'm teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>about these biblical stories is because,</v>

1538
01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:08.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking because the humanities have</v>

1539
01:19:08.321 --> 01:19:09.850
<v Speaker 1>been decimated so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1540
01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:11.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

1541
01:19:11.081 --> 01:19:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that has mostly to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and hatred more than anything</v>

1542
01:19:14.141 --> 01:19:19.141
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really think that you can </v>

1543
01:19:19.141 --> 01:19:20.911
<v Speaker 1>get a grip on the humanities and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to offer without knowing the </v>

1544
01:19:20.911 --> 01:19:24.751
<v Speaker 1>biblical stories because they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the dream out of which the </v>

1545
01:19:24.751 --> 01:19:27.871
<v Speaker 1>humanities emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so unless you have that background </v>

1546
01:19:27.871 --> 01:19:27.871
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dream,</v>

1547
01:19:27.871 --> 01:19:32.820
<v Speaker 1>then there's all sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are utterly profound that don't open </v>

1548
01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:36.331
<v Speaker 1>themselves up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dante's inferno would be one of </v>

1549
01:19:36.331 --> 01:19:38.941
<v Speaker 1>those Milton's paradise lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an absolutely amazing piece of </v>

1550
01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:38.941
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1551
01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Milton wrote it because he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify the ways of God to man,</v>

1552
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:44.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an ambition that is.</v>

1553
01:19:44.410 --> 01:19:47.140
<v Speaker 1>And I mean he was serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took the problem seriously.</v>

1554
01:19:47.141 --> 01:19:49.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the Memphis to feely and </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is that,</v>

1555
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:55.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a rough business that we're </v>

1556
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.110
<v Speaker 1>involved in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe we should just give it up.</v>

1557
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I think the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world I think was deciding </v>

1558
01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:02.191
<v Speaker 1>that in the 19 eighties when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding whether we're going to engage </v>

1559
01:20:02.191 --> 01:20:03.400
<v Speaker 1>in the ultimate nuclear catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1560
01:20:03.401 --> 01:20:06.160
<v Speaker 1>and we were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close to that a number of times and</v>

1561
01:20:06.161 --> 01:20:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a decision in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the part of humanity that we might as</v>

1562
01:20:10.081 --> 01:20:13.560
<v Speaker 1>well keep the whole awful game going </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than just demolish it.</v>

1563
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1564
01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:16.470
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton,</v>

1565
01:20:16.471 --> 01:20:19.410
<v Speaker 1>he wrote paradise lost too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dream again.</v>

1566
01:20:19.411 --> 01:20:24.411
<v Speaker 1>It's a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And trying to explain the nature of </v>

1567
01:20:24.411 --> 01:20:27.501
<v Speaker 1>being in the nature of evil and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't crack the damn thing without </v>

1568
01:20:27.501 --> 01:20:27.720
<v Speaker 1>knowing the underlying stories.</v>

1569
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:31.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's really too bad because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>utterly profound and the reason you need</v>

1570
01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:36.531
<v Speaker 1>profound things as far as I can tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need profound knowledge is because life </v>

1571
01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.310
<v Speaker 1>is actually a profound problem for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

1572
01:20:38.311 --> 01:20:43.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can shelter back and live a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very conservative existence and look </v>

1573
01:20:43.311 --> 01:20:45.120
<v Speaker 1>like more power to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand why you would do that,</v>

1574
01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:50.121
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't stop you from having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face the ultimate questions of life </v>

1575
01:20:50.121 --> 01:20:54.320
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there in everyone's face and at </v>

1576
01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 1>least at some point in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be better if you could.</v>

1577
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:59.870
<v Speaker 1>I think if you could confront them full </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and end to deal with them properly </v>

1578
01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:01.740
<v Speaker 1>and to be a beacon of strength as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

1579
01:21:01.741 --> 01:21:05.430
<v Speaker 1>It's and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that wisdom,</v>

1580
01:21:05.431 --> 01:21:07.440
<v Speaker 1>that's what the humanities are supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to teach.</v>

1581
01:21:07.441 --> 01:21:12.441
<v Speaker 1>His wisdom and wisdom is what enables </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to deal honorably with the tragedy </v>

1582
01:21:12.441 --> 01:21:12.441
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

1583
01:21:12.441 --> 01:21:17.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see how you could think that </v>

1584
01:21:17.150 --> 01:21:19.821
<v Speaker 1>that was a bad idea because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be times when you're in an </v>

1585
01:21:19.821 --> 01:21:23.091
<v Speaker 1>emergency room and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prone to panic and to and to cry and to </v>

1586
01:21:23.091 --> 01:21:26.901
<v Speaker 1>break down into and to collapse and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be of no use to anyone around you and </v>

1587
01:21:26.901 --> 01:21:30.890
<v Speaker 1>that's not the right way to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the right way to be in a situation </v>

1588
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:34.221
<v Speaker 1>like that is too strong and reliable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can do that without </v>

1589
01:21:34.221 --> 01:21:37.581
<v Speaker 1>being wise and you can't be wise without</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting yourself together without </v>

1590
01:21:37.581 --> 01:21:41.661
<v Speaker 1>knowing something about where you came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from and what you're like and that </v>

1591
01:21:41.661 --> 01:21:43.290
<v Speaker 1>that's history and the humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this isn't optional.</v>

1592
01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.660
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more necessary.</v>

1593
01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:49.200
<v Speaker 1>The man does not live by bread alone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the issue here.</v>

1594
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:51.870
<v Speaker 1>So you see these magnificent works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1595
01:21:51.871 --> 01:21:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1596
01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not like Michelangelo thought of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this literally,</v>

1597
01:21:57.601 --> 01:22:02.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a genius for God's sake and he's </v>

1598
01:22:02.601 --> 01:22:04.170
<v Speaker 1>trying to get at something and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get at the profundity of human</v>

1599
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:04.650
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

1600
01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:09.650
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's why you have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal figure here and that the </v>

1601
01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:13.330
<v Speaker 1>cosmic role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that consciousness and tradition plays </v>

1602
01:22:13.330 --> 01:22:14.670
<v Speaker 1>in being itself and it's ennobling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you think.</v>

1603
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:18.930
<v Speaker 1>People religious or not people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of people come from</v>

1604
01:22:18.931 --> 01:22:23.931
<v Speaker 1>all over the world to Rome and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this little tiny chapel to look </v>

1605
01:22:23.931 --> 01:22:27.441
<v Speaker 1>at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something in it that everyone </v>

1606
01:22:27.441 --> 01:22:27.441
<v Speaker 1>needs to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1607
01:22:27.441 --> 01:22:28.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not just beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more than beauty.</v>

1608
01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:33.411
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that which feeds the soul and and </v>

1609
01:22:33.411 --> 01:22:36.981
<v Speaker 1>everyone feels that even if they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it so and God said,</v>

1610
01:22:37.351 --> 01:22:41.100
<v Speaker 1>let the waters swarm with swarms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>living creatures and let birds fly above</v>

1611
01:22:41.101 --> 01:22:42.930
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the expanse of the heavens.</v>

1612
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:48.140
<v Speaker 1>So God created the great sea creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>and every living creature that moves </v>

1613
01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:51.591
<v Speaker 1>with which the waters swarm according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their kinds and every winged bird </v>

1614
01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:51.630
<v Speaker 1>according to its kind.</v>

1615
01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.930
<v Speaker 1>And God saw that it was good and God </v>
<v Speaker 1>blessed them.</v>

1616
01:22:55.110 --> 01:23:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fruitful and multiply and fill the </v>

1617
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.110
<v Speaker 1>waters in the seas and let birds </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiply on the earth.</v>

1618
01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:02.820
<v Speaker 1>And there was evening and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning the fifth day.</v>

1619
01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:08.450
<v Speaker 1>And God said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the earth bring forth living </v>

1620
01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:09.340
<v Speaker 1>creatures according to their kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>livestock and creeping beasts,</v>

1621
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:12.190
<v Speaker 1>creeping things and beasts of the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to their kinds.</v>

1622
01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:17.340
<v Speaker 1>And it was so and God made the beast of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth according to their kinds and </v>

1623
01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:20.170
<v Speaker 1>the livestock according to their kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything that creeps on the ground</v>

1624
01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.240
<v Speaker 1>according to its kind kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1625
01:23:22.241 --> 01:23:23.350
<v Speaker 1>That's kin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1626
01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And to be kind is to treat others as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're your kid.</v>

1627
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:30.100
<v Speaker 1>And so according to its kind and God saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was good.</v>

1628
01:23:30.101 --> 01:23:33.110
<v Speaker 1>That's continually continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1629
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:38.250
<v Speaker 1>re presented over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God said that's the thing that calls </v>

1630
01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:38.620
<v Speaker 1>being into existence.</v>

1631
01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And God said it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the fundamental judgment </v>

1632
01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:43.620
<v Speaker 1>about the nature of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1633
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the translation,</v>

1634
01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.560
<v Speaker 1>in the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1635
01:23:47.561 --> 01:23:49.360
<v Speaker 1>from the Old Testament to the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>

1636
01:23:49.361 --> 01:23:53.710
<v Speaker 1>is God is obviously blessing creation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of this story.</v>

1637
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.010
<v Speaker 1>And then you have old testament God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't mess around with him,</v>

1638
01:23:57.011 --> 01:23:58.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he'll give you a good smiting if</v>

1639
01:23:58.571 --> 01:24:03.571
<v Speaker 1>you get out of line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt about that and he's </v>

1640
01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:03.571
<v Speaker 1>kind of an arbitrary character and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1641
01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:04.360
<v Speaker 1>lots of modern people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1642
01:24:04.361 --> 01:24:06.010
<v Speaker 1>how could you believe in a God like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1643
01:24:06.011 --> 01:24:07.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's like when I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1644
01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:13.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Old Testament people that isn't how </v>

1645
01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.931
<v Speaker 1>they thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought you better look the hell </v>

1646
01:24:15.931 --> 01:24:15.990
<v Speaker 1>out because life is really difficult and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you step out of line,</v>

1647
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get flattened and God </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't care in some sense whether you </v>

1648
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:21.000
<v Speaker 1>approve of him.</v>

1649
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does that have to do with </v>

1650
01:24:25.530 --> 01:24:25.530
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you don't approve.</v>

1651
01:24:25.530 --> 01:24:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like you better pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>though because otherwise you're going to</v>

1652
01:24:27.311 --> 01:24:32.311
<v Speaker 1>be in real trouble and that there's real</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom in that niche of thought that it </v>

1653
01:24:32.311 --> 01:24:36.490
<v Speaker 1>nature really admired the old testament </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a work of literature because he </v>

1654
01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:37.360
<v Speaker 1>thought that the representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>divine,</v>

1655
01:24:37.361 --> 01:24:42.361
<v Speaker 1>let's say as a representation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the essential nature of being was </v>

1656
01:24:42.361 --> 01:24:45.280
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily accurate and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary and often cruel.</v>

1657
01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:50.281
<v Speaker 1>Nature wasn't following a morality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings could really understand as </v>

1658
01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:56.041
<v Speaker 1>moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he thought that was very realistic </v>

1659
01:24:56.041 --> 01:24:56.650
<v Speaker 1>and I like that interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens in the New Testament is</v>

1660
01:24:56.651 --> 01:25:01.651
<v Speaker 1>quite interesting because there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>insistence all of a sudden in the new </v>

1661
01:25:01.651 --> 01:25:05.341
<v Speaker 1>testament that you're supposed to act </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards God as if he's nothing but good,</v>

1662
01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:09.100
<v Speaker 1>and that's such a strange thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1663
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:13.660
<v Speaker 1>you look at the world and you think are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really just good a well,</v>

1664
01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:18.280
<v Speaker 1>the cancer and the earthquakes is kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hard to fit into that picture and you</v>

1665
01:25:18.281 --> 01:25:23.281
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrible things that happened to </v>

1666
01:25:23.281 --> 01:25:23.281
<v Speaker 1>children and all of that is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to square with the notion of a</v>

1667
01:25:23.281 --> 01:25:24.730
<v Speaker 1>good God obviously.</v>

1668
01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:30.720
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The underlying idea is that if you act </v>

1669
01:25:30.941 --> 01:25:34.540
<v Speaker 1>in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it more likely to be true.</v>

1670
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's that I would consider that </v>

1671
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.750
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inactive,</v>

1672
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:44.340
<v Speaker 1>both courage and faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're going to make the case </v>

1673
01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.130
<v Speaker 1>like God makes at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible.</v>

1674
01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:50.370
<v Speaker 1>That being is in fact good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't see it because you get to </v>

1675
01:25:51.131 --> 01:25:52.780
<v Speaker 1>see all the things about it that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>

1676
01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:56.590
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a metaphysical presupposition.</v>

1677
01:25:56.591 --> 01:25:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>

1678
01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:02.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a decision to act that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to act as if being as good and</v>

1679
01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:03.890
<v Speaker 1>to further that,</v>

1680
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.800
<v Speaker 2>and then the implicit idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1681
01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:11.801
<v Speaker 2>there isn't anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't any way that you can make </v>

1682
01:26:11.801 --> 01:26:14.681
<v Speaker 2>things work out better than to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's a current courageous </v>

1683
01:26:14.681 --> 01:26:17.000
<v Speaker 2>element to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think has also expressed to some</v>

1684
01:26:17.001 --> 01:26:21.620
<v Speaker 2>degree in the idea of Christ's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary sacrifice of his own life.</v>

1685
01:26:21.621 --> 01:26:26.621
<v Speaker 2>His presupposition was something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to act as if God is good and </v>

1686
01:26:26.621 --> 01:26:31.391
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to play that out right to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end and now that becomes something like </v>

1687
01:26:31.391 --> 01:26:34.340
<v Speaker 2>a divine pattern and I believe there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom in that because again,</v>

1688
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:37.820
<v Speaker 2>most of the time that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling with this sort of thing,</v>

1689
01:26:37.821 --> 01:26:39.470
<v Speaker 2>I've always been looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

1690
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been studying good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been studying evil because evil is </v>

1691
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:45.770
<v Speaker 2>easier to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially after the 20th century.</v>

1692
01:26:45.771 --> 01:26:50.771
<v Speaker 2>It's like I think you have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be blind not to think about </v>

1693
01:26:50.771 --> 01:26:55.481
<v Speaker 2>the things that happened in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century as evil and and some of the </v>

1694
01:26:55.481 --> 01:26:57.080
<v Speaker 2>things that happened were so brutally.</v>

1695
01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.500
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely unimaginable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1696
01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:03.780
<v Speaker 2>unless you imagine it and and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1697
01:27:03.781 --> 01:27:08.781
<v Speaker 2>it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the historical record and </v>

1698
01:27:08.781 --> 01:27:08.781
<v Speaker 2>then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1699
01:27:08.781 --> 01:27:10.780
<v Speaker 2>if there's something that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that terrible.</v>

1700
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:15.850
<v Speaker 2>It indicates as clearly as anything can </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's also something that's its </v>

1701
01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:20.801
<v Speaker 2>opposite and that's whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the farthest away possible from </v>

1702
01:27:20.801 --> 01:27:23.390
<v Speaker 2>that outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean we can exactly say</v>

1703
01:27:23.391 --> 01:27:28.391
<v Speaker 2>what it is because it's easier to grip </v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense what it means to torture </v>

1704
01:27:28.391 --> 01:27:33.311
<v Speaker 2>and break and hurt and not to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize so clearly how you would </v>

1705
01:27:33.311 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 2>have to act if you are acting in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exact opposite manner,</v>

1706
01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:41.030
<v Speaker 2>but at least it implies that it exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I see that pattern being laid out in</v>

1707
01:27:41.031 --> 01:27:46.031
<v Speaker 2>this dreamlike manner in the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>testament and it has something to do </v>

1708
01:27:46.031 --> 01:27:46.031
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1709
01:27:46.031 --> 01:27:48.530
<v Speaker 2>it has something to do and this is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure with the,</v>

1710
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:51.500
<v Speaker 2>with the voluntary acceptance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mortality,</v>

1711
01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.840
<v Speaker 2>because of course that's the poisoned </v>
<v Speaker 2>apple,</v>

1712
01:27:53.841 --> 01:27:54.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1713
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:57.860
<v Speaker 2>The fact that everybody looks forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the future to know that your finite</v>

1714
01:27:57.861 --> 01:28:02.861
<v Speaker 2>and so as everything that you love and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for that not to </v>

1715
01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:06.101
<v Speaker 2>poison your existence and while there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no getting out of it as far as we can </v>

1716
01:28:06.261 --> 01:28:11.261
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there might be something like </v>

1717
01:28:11.261 --> 01:28:11.261
<v Speaker 2>switching your attitude to it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could say,</v>

1718
01:28:11.261 --> 01:28:15.101
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the price you pay for being and </v>

1719
01:28:15.101 --> 01:28:17.921
<v Speaker 2>they're heroic thing to do is to accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and not even to accept it </v>

1720
01:28:17.921 --> 01:28:17.960
<v Speaker 2>grudgingly to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1721
01:28:17.961 --> 01:28:22.961
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to accept that and I'm going </v>

1722
01:28:22.961 --> 01:28:26.231
<v Speaker 2>to act nonetheless as if being is good </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm going to see how things </v>

1723
01:28:26.231 --> 01:28:30.881
<v Speaker 2>turn out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and God saw </v>

1724
01:28:30.881 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 2>that it was good and so it's an act of </v>
<v Speaker 2>courage,</v>

1725
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:32.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1726
01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:37.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an act of courage that's </v>

1727
01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:39.401
<v Speaker 2>associated with that transformation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude and even with regards to the </v>

1728
01:28:39.401 --> 01:28:41.270
<v Speaker 2>notion that the world is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a courageous attitude,</v>

1729
01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:46.660
<v Speaker 2>especially given that there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that makes that conclusion </v>

1730
01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:51.070
<v Speaker 2>difficult to continually draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the alternative seems to me to be </v>

1731
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.560
<v Speaker 2>far worse.</v>

1732
01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:58.810
<v Speaker 2>So there's God again with the sun behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>him because he's associated with the </v>

1733
01:28:58.911 --> 01:29:02.490
<v Speaker 2>solar consciousness and he's creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these strange,</v>

1734
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:05.540
<v Speaker 2>wonderful creatures and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1735
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:07.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people say,</v>

1736
01:29:07.441 --> 01:29:07.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1737
01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 2>the idea of God as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an old man in the sky,</v>

1738
01:29:11.281 --> 01:29:16.281
<v Speaker 2>let's say that's primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more better to think about it </v>

1739
01:29:16.281 --> 01:29:20.210
<v Speaker 2>as a much more better Jesus anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more sophisticated to think,</v>

1740
01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:27.230
<v Speaker 2>to think of the divine essence as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>disembodied spirit or something like </v>

1741
01:29:27.230 --> 01:29:27.230
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1742
01:29:27.230 --> 01:29:31.370
<v Speaker 2>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not so obvious either because </v>

1743
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:34.190
<v Speaker 2>as I already pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't anything that's more </v>

1744
01:29:34.190 --> 01:29:34.200
<v Speaker 2>complicated than a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1745
01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:39.030
<v Speaker 2>and so the idea that the divine is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's at least as complicated</v>

1746
01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:44.031
<v Speaker 2>as a human beings strikes me as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's actually quite </v>

1747
01:29:44.031 --> 01:29:44.550
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know it's a metaphor,</v>

1748
01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:49.551
<v Speaker 2>although I don't know to what degree it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a metaphor and it's also something </v>

1749
01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:49.551
<v Speaker 2>that's embodied.</v>

1750
01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:51.630
<v Speaker 2>And I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also a very interesting notion,</v>

1751
01:29:51.631 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's become increasingly obvious</v>

1752
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:57.840
<v Speaker 2>as we've tried to do such things as </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce artificial intelligence,</v>

1753
01:29:57.841 --> 01:30:02.841
<v Speaker 2>that it's very difficult to produce an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence or perhaps a consciousness </v>

1754
01:30:02.841 --> 01:30:05.210
<v Speaker 2>that isn't the embodied in some manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1755
01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:07.800
<v Speaker 2>it can't be just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't be just a spirit,</v>

1756
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:12.830
<v Speaker 2>a spirit without form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's part of the reason </v>

1757
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:14.340
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why Christianity put so much emphasis at</v>

1758
01:30:14.341 --> 01:30:16.410
<v Speaker 2>the end of time on the resurrection of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the body.</v>

1759
01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Because there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1760
01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a drive in there too.</v>

1761
01:30:20.311 --> 01:30:23.760
<v Speaker 2>He noble to ignoble the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

1762
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:27.870
<v Speaker 2>not just the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consciousness that floats abstractly</v>

1763
01:30:27.871 --> 01:30:32.871
<v Speaker 2>above the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to say that knowing you can't do </v>

1764
01:30:32.871 --> 01:30:35.781
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just shed that part of you </v>

1765
01:30:35.781 --> 01:30:35.781
<v Speaker 2>that's heavy and materials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1766
01:30:35.781 --> 01:30:37.530
<v Speaker 2>and leave it behind as if it's of no </v>
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>

1767
01:30:37.530 --> 01:30:39.630
<v Speaker 2>You have to ennoble ennoble that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1768
01:30:39.631 --> 01:30:44.631
<v Speaker 2>And that idea is also linked to the note</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the representation of God as as a </v>

1769
01:30:45.031 --> 01:30:50.031
<v Speaker 2>human being and as a wise human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as something that's embodied and so </v>

1770
01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:55.680
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least from the metaphorical </v>

1771
01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:55.680
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's reasonable just to to</v>

1772
01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.360
<v Speaker 2>brush your hands across it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

1773
01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.700
<v Speaker 2>that's primitive because I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1774
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:03.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's primitive at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then God said,</v>

1775
01:31:03.931 --> 01:31:07.500
<v Speaker 2>let us make man in our image after our </v>
<v Speaker 2>likeness.</v>

1776
01:31:07.501 --> 01:31:09.450
<v Speaker 2>And it's our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because while this is,</v>

1777
01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:12.930
<v Speaker 2>this is part of the priestly story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1778
01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:18.140
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of sources for the old </v>

1779
01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:18.150
<v Speaker 2>testament and in the priestly version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

1780
01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:20.400
<v Speaker 2>it's below him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may be wrong.</v>

1781
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:25.550
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the precisely it doesn't matter </v>

1782
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:28.611
<v Speaker 2>because the notion is is that the God </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's in the background of this story </v>

1783
01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:31.020
<v Speaker 2>has a kind of plurality of being right.</v>

1784
01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:35.640
<v Speaker 2>And it looks like the idea of monotheism</v>
<v Speaker 2>arose with great difficulty across time.</v>

1785
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Because there are lots of powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that there's a power of </v>

1786
01:31:41.341 --> 01:31:44.460
<v Speaker 2>powers was something that it wasn't easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to figure out,</v>

1787
01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:49.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it because what's what's constant </v>

1788
01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.180
<v Speaker 2>across sources of power or some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mega power,</v>

1789
01:31:51.181 --> 01:31:54.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to figure out what that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what's being represented by,</v>

1790
01:31:55.260 --> 01:32:00.260
<v Speaker 2>by the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell from polytheism to </v>

1791
01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:00.260
<v Speaker 2>monotheism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1792
01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:04.480
<v Speaker 2>it's the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the observation that there are powers </v>

1793
01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.410
<v Speaker 2>that determine the destiny of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part that you're,</v>

1794
01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:08.470
<v Speaker 2>that you're subject to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the idea that there's something</v>

1795
01:32:08.471 --> 01:32:10.990
<v Speaker 2>common across all those powers that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can represent,</v>

1796
01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:16.020
<v Speaker 2>partly say with the idea of the Sun </v>
<v Speaker 2>rising in the morning and finding its </v>

1797
01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:19.951
<v Speaker 2>way out of the darkness at night and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's associated with </v>

1798
01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:20.800
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and sovereignty is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very see.</v>

1799
01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:26.100
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that bothers me about </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple minded atheism and I would say </v>

1800
01:32:26.231 --> 01:32:31.231
<v Speaker 2>the simple minded atheism is of the sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>that regards these stories as nothing </v>

1801
01:32:31.231 --> 01:32:32.620
<v Speaker 2>but simple superstitions is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1802
01:32:32.621 --> 01:32:36.010
<v Speaker 2>very poorly informed because whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>these stories are,</v>

1803
01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:38.320
<v Speaker 2>they are not merely simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstitions.</v>

1804
01:32:38.321 --> 01:32:43.321
<v Speaker 2>They weren't conjured up by some cabell </v>
<v Speaker 2>of priests to bamboozle the masses even </v>

1805
01:32:43.421 --> 01:32:45.730
<v Speaker 2>though they were used for that purposes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from time to time.</v>

1806
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:46.840
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much,</v>

1807
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:51.870
<v Speaker 2>much more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a very ancient lineage and </v>

1808
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:53.290
<v Speaker 2>they're tied together with all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other stories and there's.</v>

1809
01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:58.380
<v Speaker 2>There's an emergent wisdom in them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the right way to view them </v>

1810
01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:02.641
<v Speaker 2>is as the birthplace of sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical ideas and so you have to </v>

1811
01:33:02.641 --> 01:33:04.360
<v Speaker 2>wrestle with these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just,</v>

1812
01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:09.760
<v Speaker 2>you and I said already that I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be as rational as I possibly can in my </v>

1813
01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.471
<v Speaker 2>discussion of these stories and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>refer to anything metaphysical except </v>

1814
01:33:13.471 --> 01:33:17.191
<v Speaker 2>when that's absolutely necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I don't want to eliminate </v>

1815
01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:20.731
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of a metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality because I think that's </v>

1816
01:33:20.731 --> 01:33:20.731
<v Speaker 2>premature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1817
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:25.180
<v Speaker 2>but you have to take the story seriously</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to,</v>

1818
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:26.530
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to,</v>

1819
01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:28.900
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to approach the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

1820
01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:32.260
<v Speaker 2>you can't just casually dismiss them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not appropriate.</v>

1821
01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:35.290
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let us make man in our image.</v>

1822
01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.630
<v Speaker 2>That's a very interesting idea and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1823
01:33:37.631 --> 01:33:42.631
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to understand how it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings came up with the idea </v>

1824
01:33:42.631 --> 01:33:46.930
<v Speaker 2>that US lowly creatures were so with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamians for example,</v>

1825
01:33:46.931 --> 01:33:49.000
<v Speaker 2>and the Greeks were like this to human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>

1826
01:33:49.001 --> 01:33:52.180
<v Speaker 2>weren't God like they were the play </v>
<v Speaker 2>things of the gods,</v>

1827
01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were.</v>

1828
01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:56.530
<v Speaker 2>They were just the gods just tortured us</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their amusement,</v>

1829
01:33:56.531 --> 01:34:01.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love and hatred and anger and all those </v>

1830
01:34:01.531 --> 01:34:01.531
<v Speaker 2>powerful forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just.</v>

1831
01:34:01.531 --> 01:34:06.450
<v Speaker 2>We were just playing things to the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't anything particularly </v>

1832
01:34:06.450 --> 01:34:09.391
<v Speaker 2>divine about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The notion that that in some sense we </v>

1833
01:34:09.391 --> 01:34:12.301
<v Speaker 2>partake of the divine is that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>staggering idea and you don't want to </v>

1834
01:34:12.301 --> 01:34:16.680
<v Speaker 2>underestimate the difficulty that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was an abstracting that or the utility </v>

1835
01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:18.580
<v Speaker 2>of that idea for our current mode of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

1836
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:24.390
<v Speaker 2>let them have dominion over the fish of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sea and over the birds of the </v>

1837
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:27.211
<v Speaker 2>heavens and over the livestock and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth and over every creeping thing </v>

1838
01:34:27.211 --> 01:34:27.211
<v Speaker 2>that creeps on the earth.</v>

1839
01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:33.530
<v Speaker 2>So God created man in his own image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the image of God.</v>

1840
01:34:33.531 --> 01:34:35.600
<v Speaker 2>He created him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male and female.</v>

1841
01:34:35.601 --> 01:34:39.020
<v Speaker 2>He created them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because there is more</v>

1842
01:34:39.021 --> 01:34:41.630
<v Speaker 2>than one creation story in genesis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this story,</v>

1843
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:44.420
<v Speaker 2>males and females are basically created </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>

1844
01:34:44.690 --> 01:34:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Later Eve is extracted out of Adam and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about that,</v>

1845
01:34:49.041 --> 01:34:54.041
<v Speaker 2>but not here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the two sexes are generated </v>

1846
01:34:54.041 --> 01:34:55.670
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously and they both carry </v>
<v Speaker 2>within them the divine stamp,</v>

1847
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>which is very egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very</v>

1848
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.980
<v Speaker 1>appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think unbelievably advanced that </v>

1849
01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:03.410
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like to me and God </v>
<v Speaker 1>blessed them.</v>

1850
01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing and God said to </v>

1851
01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:11.021
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fruitful and multiply and fill the </v>

1852
01:35:11.021 --> 01:35:12.821
<v Speaker 1>earth and subdue it and have dominion </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the fish of the sea and over the </v>

1853
01:35:12.821 --> 01:35:16.180
<v Speaker 1>birds of the heavens and over every </v>
<v Speaker 1>living thing that moves on the earth and</v>

1854
01:35:16.181 --> 01:35:21.181
<v Speaker 1>there's God creating Adam and eve and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking pretty happy about the </v>

1855
01:35:21.261 --> 01:35:21.740
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>

1856
01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:28.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's Michelangelo's famous Sistine</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chapel Representation.</v>

1857
01:35:28.021 --> 01:35:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And there's some cool things about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1858
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.080
<v Speaker 1>you've got to wonder is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an aside and I don't know if </v>

1859
01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a credible aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interesting aside,</v>

1860
01:35:37.831 --> 01:35:39.420
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a form of credible.</v>

1861
01:35:39.630 --> 01:35:41.580
<v Speaker 1>What the Hell is God doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this thing,</v>

1862
01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:42.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1863
01:35:42.751 --> 01:35:44.600
<v Speaker 1>what is this exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1864
01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:45.870
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

1865
01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:48.570
<v Speaker 1>there's been some interesting answers to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and this is one of them.</v>

1866
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:52.280
<v Speaker 1>So there was a group of scientists about</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago that,</v>

1867
01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.320
<v Speaker 1>that were remarked on the precise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the precise analogy between this </v>

1868
01:35:58.581 --> 01:36:02.610
<v Speaker 1>structure and the brain bisected down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>

1869
01:36:02.730 --> 01:36:07.730
<v Speaker 1>And of course Michael Angelo was one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first people who did detailed </v>

1870
01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:10.290
<v Speaker 1>dissections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they felt that,</v>

1871
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.400
<v Speaker 1>that Michelangelo had put God inside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain for some reason.</v>

1872
01:36:16.230 --> 01:36:21.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me to be associated with </v>

1873
01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:21.230
<v Speaker 1>the notion that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1874
01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:25.431
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an analogy or a metaphorical </v>

1875
01:36:25.431 --> 01:36:26.640
<v Speaker 1>identity between the notion of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>God is and the structures that give rise</v>

1876
01:36:26.641 --> 01:36:28.490
<v Speaker 1>to consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1877
01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I think we really underestimate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to which consciousness is,</v>

1878
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:37.650
<v Speaker 1>is both same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miraculous and an not understood.</v>

1879
01:36:37.651 --> 01:36:38.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1880
01:36:39.330 --> 01:36:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1881
01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.990
<v Speaker 1>you have what appears to be an entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>material substrate.</v>

1882
01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you are aware and self aware and </v>

1883
01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:49.260
<v Speaker 1>able to generate the world merely in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense by looking at it.</v>

1884
01:36:49.261 --> 01:36:52.470
<v Speaker 1>It really is remarkable and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is dependent on,</v>

1885
01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:58.280
<v Speaker 1>on something that wells up from deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>within that material substrate that we </v>

1886
01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:58.330
<v Speaker 1>don't understand at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1887
01:36:58.331 --> 01:36:59.020
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1888
01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:01.640
<v Speaker 1>it's crazily remarkable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1889
01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:06.660
<v Speaker 1>when you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear a lot about scientific </v>

1890
01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:10.041
<v Speaker 1>reductionism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you something that's kind </v>

1891
01:37:10.041 --> 01:37:10.041
<v Speaker 1>of interesting and it's a tangent to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1892
01:37:10.041 --> 01:37:14.031
<v Speaker 1>the guy that discovered Dna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Watson and Watson and </v>

1893
01:37:14.031 --> 01:37:18.291
<v Speaker 1>crick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember who wrote this </v>

1894
01:37:18.291 --> 01:37:18.291
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them</v>

1895
01:37:18.291 --> 01:37:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believed the DNA was so complicated </v>

1896
01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.230
<v Speaker 1>that it had to come from space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't believe it could have possibly</v>

1897
01:37:24.231 --> 01:37:29.231
<v Speaker 1>evolved on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like a lot of these people who </v>

1898
01:37:29.231 --> 01:37:32.531
<v Speaker 1>are used as exemplars of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>reductionism aren't like that at all.</v>

1899
01:37:32.751 --> 01:37:34.280
<v Speaker 1>When you actually read what they had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1900
01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:34.770
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1901
01:37:34.771 --> 01:37:37.430
<v Speaker 1>they were very aware of the limits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own knowledge.</v>

1902
01:37:37.431 --> 01:37:41.870
<v Speaker 1>And I mean DNA is something really quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly remarkable.</v>

1903
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:44.930
<v Speaker 1>It's an eternal substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been around for a very long time.</v>

1904
01:37:44.931 --> 01:37:47.510
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that we understand it is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very stupid idea.</v>

1905
01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:52.070
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that I would say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing applies to the brain.</v>

1906
01:37:52.071 --> 01:37:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1907
01:37:53.361 --> 01:37:56.670
<v Speaker 1>we're scratching away at the surface of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand at all.</v>

1908
01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.440
<v Speaker 1>And so it's quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1909
01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.200
<v Speaker 1>and maybe Michelangelo had enough gall </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>

1910
01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:02.310
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly possible.</v>

1911
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had enough goal to do dissections </v>

1912
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.410
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the cost of that was death,</v>

1913
01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this rob corpses essentially to </v>

1914
01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:12.440
<v Speaker 1>go and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>

1915
01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:13.020
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

1916
01:38:13.021 --> 01:38:15.690
<v Speaker 1>not particularly politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1917
01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:22.190
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is another representation of </v>

1918
01:38:22.190 --> 01:38:23.190
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a funny one.</v>

1919
01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I had to throw that in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know this,</v>

1920
01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1921
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.590
<v Speaker 1>there's this joke in the atheistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist community.</v>

1922
01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it might've been started by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins,</v>

1923
01:38:33.541 --> 01:38:38.541
<v Speaker 1>but that might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was just as reasonable to </v>

1924
01:38:38.541 --> 01:38:39.570
<v Speaker 1>believe in the flying spaghetti monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it was to believe in God.</v>

1925
01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the flying spaghetti monster by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

1926
01:38:41.911 --> 01:38:42.780
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1927
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:48.250
<v Speaker 1>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called touched by his noodly </v>

1928
01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:51.320
<v Speaker 1>appendage and anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>

1929
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:56.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not very sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is funny so and God blessed them </v>

1930
01:38:56.350 --> 01:39:00.291
<v Speaker 1>and God said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fruitful and multiply and fill the </v>

1931
01:39:00.291 --> 01:39:05.151
<v Speaker 1>earth and subdue it and have dominion </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the fish of the sea and over the </v>

1932
01:39:05.151 --> 01:39:06.120
<v Speaker 1>birds of the heavens and over every </v>
<v Speaker 1>living thing that moves on the earth.</v>

1933
01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.890
<v Speaker 1>God said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

1934
01:39:07.891 --> 01:39:12.891
<v Speaker 1>I have given you every plant yielding </v>
<v Speaker 1>seed that is on the face of all the </v>

1935
01:39:12.891 --> 01:39:12.891
<v Speaker 1>earth and every tree with seed in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>

1936
01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.080
<v Speaker 1>you shall have them for food and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>every beast of the earth and every bird </v>

1937
01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:19.260
<v Speaker 1>of the heavens and to everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>creeps on the earth.</v>

1938
01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Everything that has the breath of life I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have given every green plant for food.</v>

1939
01:39:22.771 --> 01:39:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And it was so and God saw everything he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had made.</v>

1940
01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:30.890
<v Speaker 1>And behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very good and there was evening </v>

1941
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.890
<v Speaker 1>and there was morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sixth day.</v>

1942
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Thus the heavens and the earth were </v>
<v Speaker 1>finished and all the host of them.</v>

1943
01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:39.380
<v Speaker 1>And on the seventh day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God finished his work that he had done </v>

1944
01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:40.410
<v Speaker 1>and he rested on the seventh day from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all his work that he had done.</v>

1945
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:43.890
<v Speaker 1>So God blessed the seventh day and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>it holy because on it,</v>

1946
01:39:43.891 --> 01:39:46.710
<v Speaker 1>God rested from all his work that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>done in creation.</v>

1947
01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.210
<v Speaker 1>And I like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1948
01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:55.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of counseling work with </v>

1949
01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.711
<v Speaker 1>people who were coaching work I guess </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who were fairly </v>

1950
01:39:57.711 --> 01:39:59.940
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly successful and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually workaholics,</v>

1951
01:39:59.941 --> 01:40:04.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the sort of people that were </v>

1952
01:40:04.941 --> 01:40:04.941
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work 80 hours a week just nonstop.</v>

1953
01:40:04.941 --> 01:40:08.960
<v Speaker 1>That's just what they were like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we're always </v>

1954
01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:08.960
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1955
01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:12.741
<v Speaker 1>how much should you work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one answer is you just work til </v>

1956
01:40:12.741 --> 01:40:12.741
<v Speaker 1>you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1957
01:40:12.741 --> 01:40:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just exhaust yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>while that's not,</v>

1958
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:18.810
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out why that</v>

1959
01:40:18.811 --> 01:40:23.811
<v Speaker 1>isn't a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be something like this is </v>

1960
01:40:23.811 --> 01:40:26.331
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want to do so much work </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the amount of work you do </v>

1961
01:40:26.331 --> 01:40:27.690
<v Speaker 1>interferes with the amount of work that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could still do,</v>

1962
01:40:28.410 --> 01:40:28.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1963
01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Because if you work like mad for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and then you have to lie in a </v>

1964
01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:36.270
<v Speaker 1>hospital bed for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that obviously isn't very productive,</v>

1965
01:40:36.271 --> 01:40:41.271
<v Speaker 1>so you have to figure out how much you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can work diligently and then how much </v>

1966
01:40:41.271 --> 01:40:44.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to recuperate so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get back up and work again.</v>

1967
01:40:44.031 --> 01:40:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1968
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000
<v Speaker 1>People have basically settled on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this and given it the </v>

1969
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:50.970
<v Speaker 1>divine imprimatur that that's one way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it,</v>

1970
01:40:50.971 --> 01:40:51.960
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1971
01:40:51.961 --> 01:40:55.150
<v Speaker 1>you can toil away for six days and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder because you have to work,</v>

1972
01:40:55.151 --> 01:41:00.151
<v Speaker 1>but you should rest at least one day out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of seven because otherwise while you </v>

1973
01:41:00.151 --> 01:41:01.790
<v Speaker 1>don't appreciate life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be part of it.</v>

1974
01:41:01.791 --> 01:41:05.200
<v Speaker 1>And plus I think it's more a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>iterative interability,</v>

1975
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:10.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that defines </v>

1976
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.430
<v Speaker 1>morality is the capacity to repeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1977
01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:10.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1978
01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:14.050
<v Speaker 1>So if something is properly structured </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a moral manner,</v>

1979
01:41:14.410 --> 01:41:17.380
<v Speaker 1>then you can do it over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over again without any degeneration.</v>

1980
01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And so that's kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

1981
01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:24.570
<v Speaker 1>If your relationship is negotiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can continue to negotiate it and </v>

1982
01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:25.570
<v Speaker 1>then you can have a relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lasts for a long time.</v>

1983
01:41:25.571 --> 01:41:28.270
<v Speaker 1>You can do it today and next week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>next month.</v>

1984
01:41:28.271 --> 01:41:30.850
<v Speaker 1>The next year you could maintain it </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>

1985
01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.120
<v Speaker 1>and this I would say is the wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been associate that's been </v>

1986
01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.230
<v Speaker 1>garnered over God only knows what period</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time to say,</v>

1987
01:41:38.231 --> 01:41:43.231
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even God needed to take a break </v>

1988
01:41:43.231 --> 01:41:45.721
<v Speaker 1>and appreciate what was going on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not such a bad thing for people to </v>

1989
01:41:45.721 --> 01:41:49.021
<v Speaker 1>follow that pattern and that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for modern people to know because </v>

1990
01:41:49.021 --> 01:41:53.101
<v Speaker 1>we seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you know we're very wealthy </v>

1991
01:41:53.101 --> 01:41:55.870
<v Speaker 1>by historical standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our capacity to relax isn't exactly what</v>

1992
01:41:55.871 --> 01:41:57.910
<v Speaker 1>it could be and I think that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard on people.</v>

1993
01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to go over again the idea </v>

1994
01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:08.881
<v Speaker 1>of the attributes of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about that a little bit last </v>

1995
01:42:08.881 --> 01:42:11.790
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to return to it because I </v>

1996
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:13.711
<v Speaker 1>think it's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth dwelling on a little bit </v>

1997
01:42:13.711 --> 01:42:17.431
<v Speaker 1>because we're trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that people were trying to </v>

1998
01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:20.941
<v Speaker 1>formulate when they were formulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>these representations and we've sort of </v>

1999
01:42:20.941 --> 01:42:24.721
<v Speaker 1>come to the conclusion that there there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an attempt to abstract out the </v>

2000
01:42:25.841 --> 01:42:30.841
<v Speaker 1>nature of power from specific aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and there is some attempt to </v>

2001
01:42:30.841 --> 01:42:35.251
<v Speaker 1>associate that with consciousness as </v>
<v Speaker 1>that which gives rise to being itself </v>

2002
01:42:35.251 --> 01:42:40.021
<v Speaker 1>and there's some attempt to associate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that consciousness with something that </v>

2003
01:42:40.021 --> 01:42:41.290
<v Speaker 1>has a cosmic quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might mean,</v>

2004
01:42:41.710 --> 01:42:46.710
<v Speaker 1>and and it's a statement that it has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic quality rather than rather than a</v>

2005
01:42:46.991 --> 01:42:49.570
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mere statement that there's.</v>

2006
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:54.870
<v Speaker 1>That there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that has world generating </v>

2007
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:57.901
<v Speaker 1>significance and also the implication </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's associated with human beings </v>

2008
01:42:57.901 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very.</v>

2009
01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>propositions and I don't believe that </v>

2010
01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.990
<v Speaker 1>there simply refutable it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfectly coherent argument even </v>

2011
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:09.730
<v Speaker 1>though it's primarily made </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically and so then once again,</v>

2012
01:43:09.731 --> 01:43:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I want to build up the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the framework of associations around the</v>

2013
01:43:14.201 --> 01:43:17.530
<v Speaker 1>idea of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that Freud did when he</v>

2014
01:43:17.531 --> 01:43:19.510
<v Speaker 1>was interpreting dreams and it's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>

2015
01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:21.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if someone comes to me with a dream,</v>

2016
01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.240
<v Speaker 1>then I have them tell me the whole dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I get them to repeat it line by</v>

2017
01:43:27.761 --> 01:43:32.761
<v Speaker 1>line and then whenever they say a line </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it there's an object in it or a </v>

2018
01:43:33.131 --> 01:43:38.131
<v Speaker 1>person or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked them what that makes them </v>

2019
01:43:38.131 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 1>remember or what that thing means to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them or what comes to mind.</v>

2020
01:43:40.451 --> 01:43:45.451
<v Speaker 1>And that's the associational technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's predicated on the idea that </v>

2021
01:43:45.451 --> 01:43:48.730
<v Speaker 1>your memory works by association and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that if you're daydreaming,</v>

2022
01:43:48.731 --> 01:43:50.200
<v Speaker 1>you know you go from one thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

2023
01:43:50.201 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>like a conversation and that</v>

2024
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:55.790
<v Speaker 2>you can take an idea that's at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>center of a web of associations.</v>

2025
01:43:55.791 --> 01:44:00.791
<v Speaker 2>And by tracking the associations you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of zero in on what the idea might </v>

2026
01:44:00.791 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 2>meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you expanded that by trying to.</v>

2027
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:09.490
<v Speaker 2>He called it to amplify the dream by </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about about narrative or </v>

2028
01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:13.331
<v Speaker 2>literary or mythological similarities </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that might be associated with the </v>

2029
01:44:13.371 --> 01:44:18.371
<v Speaker 2>narrative structure of the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think often that can be </v>

2030
01:44:18.371 --> 01:44:18.371
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2031
01:44:18.371 --> 01:44:21.590
<v Speaker 2>and it's like the dream is an idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's trying to come to birth.</v>

2032
01:44:21.591 --> 01:44:23.120
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly formulated.</v>

2033
01:44:23.121 --> 01:44:25.070
<v Speaker 2>And then if you discuss it and amplify </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2034
01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:30.340
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can speed along its </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation into a more articulated </v>

2035
01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:34.301
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the dream is also something that </v>

2036
01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:37.360
<v Speaker 2>because your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind is trying to work with one </v>

2037
01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.871
<v Speaker 2>foot in the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to formulate what's out </v>

2038
01:44:40.871 --> 01:44:41.420
<v Speaker 2>there in the unknown and to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>concrete.</v>

2039
01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:43.850
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't do that in one fell </v>
<v Speaker 2>swoop.</v>

2040
01:44:43.851 --> 01:44:48.110
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't just take potential and turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>it into two articulated ideas.</v>

2041
01:44:48.111 --> 01:44:51.050
<v Speaker 2>It has to dream up what's out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>first projects,</v>

2042
01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:54.420
<v Speaker 2>it's imagination out there to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle on what it might be.</v>

2043
01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:59.421
<v Speaker 2>And then that's presented in the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you analyze the dream you can </v>

2044
01:44:59.421 --> 01:45:02.741
<v Speaker 2>make it more articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what we're going to do </v>

2045
01:45:02.741 --> 01:45:06.311
<v Speaker 2>with the attributes of God to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to build up the representational </v>

2046
01:45:06.311 --> 01:45:06.311
<v Speaker 2>structure a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2047
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:09.980
<v Speaker 2>So the hypothesis is that God is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstracted ideal,</v>

2048
01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:15.190
<v Speaker 2>formulated in large part to dissociate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideal from any particular </v>

2049
01:45:15.190 --> 01:45:19.481
<v Speaker 2>incarnation or man or ruler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the underlying idea there too is </v>

2050
01:45:19.481 --> 01:45:23.981
<v Speaker 2>that when the ruler becomes the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state turns into the biblical Egypt </v>

2051
01:45:23.981 --> 01:45:26.360
<v Speaker 2>and the biblical Egypt is a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a very,</v>

2052
01:45:26.361 --> 01:45:30.290
<v Speaker 2>very solid idea in the old testament </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think took people.</v>

2053
01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:34.130
<v Speaker 2>God only knows how long to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you transformed,</v>

2054
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:39.790
<v Speaker 2>if you confuse the notion of sovereign </v>
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty with the current sovereign,</v>

2055
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:46.270
<v Speaker 2>then your culture immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>degenerated into totalitarian state and </v>

2056
01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:48.770
<v Speaker 2>turned to stone and that was deadly than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were slaves.</v>

2057
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:50.790
<v Speaker 2>And then the thing was going to collapse</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

2058
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Like no matter how big and grandiose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as the ruler became the concrete</v>

2059
01:45:55.761 --> 01:45:59.450
<v Speaker 2>incarnation of the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no distinction between the man</v>

2060
01:45:59.690 --> 01:46:03.380
<v Speaker 2>and the divine notion of the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the society was doomed.</v>

2061
01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:07.760
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's a less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why I think that's true.</v>

2062
01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:09.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's simple as that.</v>

2063
01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:14.000
<v Speaker 2>And I think we saw more than enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence of that in the 20th century and</v>

2064
01:46:14.001 --> 01:46:16.340
<v Speaker 2>we're certainly seeing the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeating itself now,</v>

2065
01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.620
<v Speaker 2>when the ruler becomes the ideal of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

2066
01:46:18.621 --> 01:46:23.621
<v Speaker 2>turns into the biblical Egypt and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical Egypt as the architectural </v>

2067
01:46:23.621 --> 01:46:24.490
<v Speaker 2>tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is God like?</v>

2068
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Christian perspective,</v>

2069
01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:34.620
<v Speaker 2>there's three elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is seems to have something to do </v>

2070
01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:35.050
<v Speaker 2>with tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's God the father.</v>

2071
01:46:35.051 --> 01:46:37.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly the embodiment I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2072
01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:40.450
<v Speaker 2>of of the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an ancient,</v>

2073
01:46:40.451 --> 01:46:45.451
<v Speaker 2>ancient thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also partly the embodiment of </v>

2074
01:46:45.451 --> 01:46:47.380
<v Speaker 2>the tradition of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also a very ancient thing.</v>

2075
01:46:47.381 --> 01:46:49.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's the structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

2076
01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:54.770
<v Speaker 2>it's the structure that consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerges from that enables us to grapple </v>

2077
01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:56.850
<v Speaker 2>with the unknown as such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>

2078
01:46:57.330 --> 01:47:00.160
<v Speaker 2>there's the intermediary between that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2079
01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:03.360
<v Speaker 2>and Christ say that's the Holy Spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that bird.</v>

2080
01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:06.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's the spirit in a more abstract</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

2081
01:47:06.481 --> 01:47:11.481
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's probably as close as </v>

2082
01:47:11.481 --> 01:47:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Christianity ever got to the notion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness as such,</v>

2083
01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:14.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disembodied consciousness,</v>

2084
01:47:14.401 --> 01:47:19.401
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the notion of the </v>

2085
01:47:19.401 --> 01:47:20.340
<v Speaker 2>suffering individual and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

2086
01:47:20.730 --> 01:47:25.730
<v Speaker 2>that's a very complicated idea and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like in order for.</v>

2087
01:47:26.250 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old idea,</v>

2088
01:47:29.071 --> 01:47:34.071
<v Speaker 2>and I believe this was originally a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish idea that something with the </v>

2089
01:47:34.071 --> 01:47:34.710
<v Speaker 2>attributes of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>omniscience,</v>

2090
01:47:34.711 --> 01:47:38.190
<v Speaker 2>omnipresence and omnipotence lacks </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2091
01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:43.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a Zen Koan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really interesting idea because </v>

2092
01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:46.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the world can something like </v>

2093
01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.841
<v Speaker 2>that lack and the idea is limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something that's everything lacks </v>

2094
01:47:48.511 --> 01:47:53.511
<v Speaker 2>limitation and bounce that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I first encountered that just </v>

2095
01:47:53.511 --> 01:47:54.590
<v Speaker 2>blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was such a,</v>

2096
01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:59.630
<v Speaker 2>such a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant realization that there are </v>

2097
01:47:59.630 --> 01:48:02.901
<v Speaker 2>advantages to not being able to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>things because partly because it gives </v>

2098
01:48:02.901 --> 01:48:04.340
<v Speaker 2>you something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that's,</v>

2099
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:05.640
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2100
01:48:05.641 --> 01:48:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Is If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had everything you wanted to have</v>

2101
01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:12.160
<v Speaker 2>at every moment at your fingertips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that,</v>

2102
01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:14.220
<v Speaker 2>that's there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing,</v>

2103
01:48:14.221 --> 01:48:16.410
<v Speaker 2>there's no story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

2104
01:48:16.411 --> 01:48:17.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that happened to superman,</v>

2105
01:48:17.881 --> 01:48:22.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cartoon character by the 19 </v>

2106
01:48:22.881 --> 01:48:25.431
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could juggle planets and you could </v>

2107
01:48:25.431 --> 01:48:25.431
<v Speaker 2>bounce like hydrogen bombs off them.</v>

2108
01:48:25.431 --> 01:48:26.430
<v Speaker 2>And be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like everyone got bored because,</v>

2109
01:48:26.650 --> 01:48:28.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were you going to do to superman?</v>

2110
01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have a hydrogen bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adamant,</v>

2111
01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.600
<v Speaker 2>he just brushes it off and like combs </v>
<v Speaker 2>his hair and that's the end of that.</v>

2112
01:48:33.601 --> 01:48:38.601
<v Speaker 2>And the whole cartoon series basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>died because he didn't have any flaws.</v>

2113
01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:44.480
<v Speaker 2>There's no story without the limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's an absolutely </v>

2114
01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.370
<v Speaker 2>remarkable idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the notion of Christ,</v>

2115
01:48:47.371 --> 01:48:50.700
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that I've puzzled </v>
<v Speaker 2>over for a long time and I learned a lot</v>

2116
01:48:50.701 --> 01:48:55.701
<v Speaker 2>of this from youngest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's idea in Christianity that </v>

2117
01:48:55.701 --> 01:48:55.701
<v Speaker 2>there's consciousness as such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2118
01:48:55.930 --> 01:49:00.930
<v Speaker 2>which in some senses eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It stretches from the beginning of the </v>

2119
01:49:00.930 --> 01:49:02.040
<v Speaker 2>time to the end of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's this abstract notion,</v>

2120
01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:07.280
<v Speaker 2>but it lacks a certain kind of reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not instantiated somewhere </v>

2121
01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:09.420
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not instantiated in a specific time</v>

2122
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.360
<v Speaker 2>and place in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea of the sun,</v>

2123
01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.800
<v Speaker 2>the third part of the trinity or one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the three parts of the trinity is the </v>

2124
01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:22.281
<v Speaker 2>notion that tradition and consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>as such also has to be embedded in </v>

2125
01:49:23.491 --> 01:49:25.230
<v Speaker 2>history in a particular time.</v>

2126
01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:30.230
<v Speaker 2>And place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's the archetypical </v>

2127
01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:31.410
<v Speaker 2>embededness and that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>incarnation and that's the perfect man,</v>

2128
01:49:31.411 --> 01:49:36.411
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who accepts his mortality and that acts </v>

2129
01:49:36.411 --> 01:49:36.411
<v Speaker 2>in a virtuous manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an uh,</v>

2130
01:49:36.411 --> 01:49:36.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2131
01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:36.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2132
01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:39.840
<v Speaker 2>it's the archetypal story of every </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual as well.</v>

2133
01:49:39.841 --> 01:49:44.841
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very strong strain in </v>

2134
01:49:44.841 --> 01:49:47.001
<v Speaker 2>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say this is more pronounced in </v>

2135
01:49:47.001 --> 01:49:47.001
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

2136
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:52.020
<v Speaker 2>that the purpose of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the proper path of life is to take the </v>

2137
01:49:53.861 --> 01:49:55.180
<v Speaker 2>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

2138
01:49:55.181 --> 01:49:58.750
<v Speaker 2>and the spirit that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness as such,</v>

2139
01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:03.010
<v Speaker 2>and to act it out in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your own personal life,</v>

2140
01:50:03.011 --> 01:50:08.011
<v Speaker 2>in a manner that's analogous to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manner in which Christ acted out in his </v>

2141
01:50:08.011 --> 01:50:12.121
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means in part is the </v>

2142
01:50:12.121 --> 01:50:14.350
<v Speaker 2>acceptance of the tragic preconditions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of existence.</v>

2143
01:50:14.351 --> 01:50:19.060
<v Speaker 2>And so that's partly betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>betrayal by friends and by family and by</v>

2144
01:50:19.061 --> 01:50:19.690
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>

2145
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:24.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's partly punishment for sins that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did not commit to as well as the </v>

2146
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:27.070
<v Speaker 2>ones you did commit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes that's just a relief,</v>

2147
01:50:27.071 --> 01:50:30.130
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the arbitrary nature of justice and also</v>

2148
01:50:30.131 --> 01:50:33.630
<v Speaker 2>the fact affinity dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the notion is,</v>

2149
01:50:33.631 --> 01:50:35.710
<v Speaker 2>is that your duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

2150
01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:40.770
<v Speaker 2>and the way to set things right in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmos is to accept that as a necessary </v>

2151
01:50:40.770 --> 01:50:43.870
<v Speaker 2>precondition for being and to act </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtuously despite that.</v>

2152
01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:49.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful idea as far as I'm </v>

2153
01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:49.140
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm also,</v>

2154
01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:53.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's a weird place and I've seen </v>

2155
01:50:53.610 --> 01:50:55.831
<v Speaker 2>some very strange things in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I've seen is </v>

2156
01:50:55.831 --> 01:50:55.831
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2157
01:50:55.831 --> 01:50:57.610
<v Speaker 2>I've dealt with some people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2158
01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:00.460
<v Speaker 2>let's say that they weren't on a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>path,</v>

2159
01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:05.580
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that was really </v>

2160
01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:05.580
<v Speaker 2>interesting about being around people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

2161
01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:08.710
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like they were surrounded </v>
<v Speaker 2>by a gravitational field of sorts.</v>

2162
01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:10.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking metaphorically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

2163
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:15.870
<v Speaker 2>and their worldview is so warped and </v>
<v Speaker 2>twisted that if you came within contact </v>

2164
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:20.731
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you all of a sudden started to play a </v>

2165
01:51:20.731 --> 01:51:21.310
<v Speaker 2>part in their drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was almost inevitable.</v>

2166
01:51:21.311 --> 01:51:26.311
<v Speaker 2>They would maneuver and manipulate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpret in a way that made you into </v>

2167
01:51:26.311 --> 01:51:29.350
<v Speaker 2>the villain in their story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what it was that you wanted to</v>

2168
01:51:29.351 --> 01:51:34.351
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And unless you've encountered something </v>

2169
01:51:34.351 --> 01:51:34.351
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and many of you probably have you,</v>

2170
01:51:34.351 --> 01:51:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you don't know how powerful a pole that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2171
01:51:36.401 --> 01:51:40.180
<v Speaker 2>And so it's certainly possible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can act in like,</v>

2172
01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:45.240
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a gravitational object and ben </v>

2173
01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:46.120
<v Speaker 2>things around them to fit their </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>

2174
01:51:46.590 --> 01:51:50.230
<v Speaker 2>They're unhappy and tragic narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've seen the opposite too,</v>

2175
01:51:50.231 --> 01:51:52.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were people who were,</v>

2176
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:57.430
<v Speaker 2>were aiming upward with the best of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability and because of that they </v>

2177
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:58.150
<v Speaker 2>had a positive effect on the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>around them and,</v>

2178
01:51:58.330 --> 01:51:58.940
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2179
01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:02.710
<v Speaker 2>that and that ordered things around them</v>
<v Speaker 2>in profound ways.</v>

2180
01:52:02.710 --> 01:52:07.710
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's an open question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The degree to which the cosmos would </v>

2181
01:52:08.081 --> 01:52:13.081
<v Speaker 2>order itself around you properly if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>got yourself together as much as you </v>

2182
01:52:13.751 --> 01:52:15.760
<v Speaker 2>could get yourself together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2183
01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean we know that things can go very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very badly wrong if you,</v>

2184
01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:22.510
<v Speaker 2>if you do things very badly wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt about that.</v>

2185
01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:27.840
<v Speaker 2>But the converse is also true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you start to sort yourself out </v>

2186
01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:29.410
<v Speaker 2>properly and then you have a beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on your family being,</v>

2187
01:52:29.411 --> 01:52:34.411
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to echo down the </v>

2188
01:52:34.411 --> 01:52:36.450
<v Speaker 2>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also spreads out into the </v>

2189
01:52:36.450 --> 01:52:36.450
<v Speaker 2>community and we are networked together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2190
01:52:36.450 --> 01:52:38.620
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not associated linearly,</v>

2191
01:52:38.621 --> 01:52:41.950
<v Speaker 2>we all affect each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an open question.</v>

2192
01:52:41.951 --> 01:52:45.070
<v Speaker 2>The degree to which acting out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion of,</v>

2193
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:50.500
<v Speaker 2>of the notion that being is good and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>notion that you can accept its </v>

2194
01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:51.620
<v Speaker 2>limitations and that you should still </v>
<v Speaker 2>strive for virtue.</v>

2195
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:53.000
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an open question.</v>

2196
01:52:53.001 --> 01:52:58.001
<v Speaker 2>How profound effect that would have on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the structure of reality if you really </v>

2197
01:52:58.001 --> 01:53:01.451
<v Speaker 2>chose to act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen things as I said in my </v>

2198
01:53:01.451 --> 01:53:04.871
<v Speaker 2>life that indicate that I do believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a metaphysical element to life </v>

2199
01:53:04.871 --> 01:53:05.840
<v Speaker 2>as well as the rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>practical element.</v>

2200
01:53:05.841 --> 01:53:10.841
<v Speaker 2>And I think there are times when those </v>
<v Speaker 2>two things come together and I've seen </v>

2201
01:53:10.841 --> 01:53:14.000
<v Speaker 2>that happen and so I don't think we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>the limits of virtue.</v>

2202
01:53:14.001 --> 01:53:17.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we know what true virtue </v>
<v Speaker 2>could bring about if we,</v>

2203
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:20.060
<v Speaker 2>if we aimed at it carefully and </v>
<v Speaker 2>practically.</v>

2204
01:53:20.061 --> 01:53:25.061
<v Speaker 2>And so the notion that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something divine about the individual </v>

2205
01:53:25.061 --> 01:53:27.230
<v Speaker 2>who accepts the conditions of existence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and still strives for the good.</v>

2206
01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's an idea that's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much worth paying attention to and I </v>

2207
01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:37.571
<v Speaker 2>think the fact that people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered that idea for at least 2000 </v>

2208
01:53:37.571 --> 01:53:39.870
<v Speaker 2>years quite seriously is also an </v>
<v Speaker 2>indication that there's,</v>

2209
01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 2>there's at least something to be thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>about with in relationship to that.</v>

2210
01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:45.950
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of the trinitarian idea.</v>

2211
01:53:49.330 --> 01:53:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Same idea there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you see this is.</v>

2212
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:56.290
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting too because you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here you have God the father essentially</v>

2213
01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:00.010
<v Speaker 2>who's who's coming out of this strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this isn't the sky.</v>

2214
01:54:00.011 --> 01:54:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see this very often in these old</v>

2215
01:54:02.351 --> 01:54:04.630
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly the sky.</v>

2216
01:54:04.631 --> 01:54:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the heaven was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2217
01:54:06.450 --> 01:54:07.780
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people believed in.</v>

2218
01:54:07.781 --> 01:54:12.781
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the sky opens and there's a </v>

2219
01:54:12.781 --> 01:54:12.880
<v Speaker 2>dimension beyond the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that,</v>

2220
01:54:12.881 --> 01:54:17.881
<v Speaker 2>and I wanted to show you this too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to show you that this isn't only a </v>

2221
01:54:17.881 --> 01:54:20.110
<v Speaker 2>western conception know when it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to do with mystical experience</v>

2222
01:54:20.111 --> 01:54:23.740
<v Speaker 2>because there is a bar to satisfy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kind of looks like he has a hat,</v>

2223
01:54:24.010 --> 01:54:29.010
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole bunch of bodhisattvas </v>

2224
01:54:29.010 --> 01:54:31.920
<v Speaker 2>going back to we turn it right and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole in the sky here is like a whole </v>

2225
01:54:32.171 --> 01:54:34.840
<v Speaker 2>into time and these things are recurring</v>
<v Speaker 2>across time.</v>

2226
01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:39.250
<v Speaker 2>It's the eternal recurrence of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this redemptive archetype and the sky</v>

2227
01:54:39.251 --> 01:54:43.090
<v Speaker 2>opens up and you can see that thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>recurring and recurring and recurring.</v>

2228
01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Same ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

2229
01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:49.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the Blue Buddha whose a healing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the healing entity sitting in a </v>

2230
01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.911
<v Speaker 2>Mandela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a representation of </v>

2231
01:54:53.911 --> 01:54:56.071
<v Speaker 2>paradise and it's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like reality opens up and reveals </v>

2232
01:54:56.071 --> 01:54:57.930
<v Speaker 2>this image of perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a.</v>

2233
01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:00.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a universal conception and,</v>

2234
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:04.560
<v Speaker 2>and while I think it's a representation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

2235
01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:09.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of the metaphysical and </v>

2236
01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:10.300
<v Speaker 2>the physical coming together in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

2237
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:13.330
<v Speaker 2>in some sort of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

2238
01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean you have to remember that </v>

2239
01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:20.791
<v Speaker 2>there's absolutely no doubt that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have metaphysical and religious </v>

2240
01:55:20.791 --> 01:55:22.420
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an absolute fact.</v>

2241
01:55:22.421 --> 01:55:25.270
<v Speaker 2>You can induce them chemically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can reduce them electrochemically.</v>

2242
01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Lots of people who have epilepsy have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>epileptic pro dramas that are associated</v>

2243
01:55:29.891 --> 01:55:31.090
<v Speaker 2>with divine enlightenment.</v>

2244
01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:33.880
<v Speaker 2>So does the Esky for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had,</v>

2245
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:38.910
<v Speaker 2>he had epilepsy and that was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that made him </v>

2246
01:55:38.910 --> 01:55:41.941
<v Speaker 2>a great author because Dostoevsky would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this feeling that he was going to </v>

2247
01:55:41.941 --> 01:55:46.381
<v Speaker 2>have an epileptic seizure and he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the feeling for him was that the </v>

2248
01:55:46.381 --> 01:55:50.061
<v Speaker 2>world was opening up and he was becoming</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more and more enlightened and </v>

2249
01:55:50.061 --> 01:55:52.050
<v Speaker 2>he was just on the verge of grasping the</v>
<v Speaker 2>essence of existence.</v>

2250
01:55:52.051 --> 01:55:55.080
<v Speaker 2>And then he'd have an epileptic seizure </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the subjective feeling.</v>

2251
01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Was that that much knowledge was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>too much for him to bear.</v>

2252
01:55:59.460 --> 01:55:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2253
01:55:59.851 --> 01:56:02.340
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was a neurological abnormality</v>

2254
01:56:02.341 --> 01:56:03.690
<v Speaker 2>and fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2255
01:56:03.691 --> 01:56:05.340
<v Speaker 2>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was Dostoevsky,</v>

2256
01:56:05.341 --> 01:56:07.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you can't just brush that off.</v>

2257
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:08.670
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2258
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:12.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2259
01:56:12.141 --> 01:56:14.400
<v Speaker 2>so that's the trinitarian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>

2260
01:56:14.401 --> 01:56:16.700
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this notion here is the notion that,</v>

2261
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:20.750
<v Speaker 2>well the crosses crosses a funny thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the cross marks the center,</v>

2262
01:56:20.751 --> 01:56:23.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an x and the x is the center of</v>

2263
01:56:23.391 --> 01:56:28.391
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the x that the cathedral is and </v>

2264
01:56:28.391 --> 01:56:28.391
<v Speaker 2>it's the center of the world is where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

2265
01:56:28.391 --> 01:56:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Because as a consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the center of the world.</v>

2266
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:34.490
<v Speaker 2>That center of the world is a place of </v>
<v Speaker 2>betrayal and suffering and limitation.</v>

2267
01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.130
<v Speaker 2>That's that's exactly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the question is,</v>

2268
01:56:37.131 --> 01:56:42.131
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that and given the fact that you </v>

2269
01:56:42.131 --> 01:56:44.531
<v Speaker 2>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are you supposed to do </v>

2270
01:56:44.531 --> 01:56:44.531
<v Speaker 2>about it and what that represents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that's Goya.</v>

2271
01:56:44.531 --> 01:56:49.301
<v Speaker 2>What that representation implies is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to voluntarily accept </v>

2272
01:56:49.551 --> 01:56:52.280
<v Speaker 2>that and then move forward on</v>

2273
01:56:57.910 --> 01:57:02.910
<v Speaker 2>well in good faith and with courage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the notion and that you're </v>

2274
01:57:02.910 --> 01:57:05.881
<v Speaker 2>supported.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supported by your tradition and </v>

2275
01:57:05.881 --> 01:57:08.371
<v Speaker 2>that's why you need your tradition too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you need to be embedded in </v>

2276
01:57:08.371 --> 01:57:09.280
<v Speaker 2>your tradition because without that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without the support,</v>

2277
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:14.290
<v Speaker 2>let's say of your father and I mean that</v>
<v Speaker 2>both practically and metaphysically,</v>

2278
01:57:14.291 --> 01:57:19.291
<v Speaker 2>without that behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without the knowledge of you as both a </v>

2279
01:57:19.291 --> 01:57:22.141
<v Speaker 2>biological and a cultural creature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without that depth of knowledge you </v>

2280
01:57:22.141 --> 01:57:26.221
<v Speaker 2>can't hate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have the courage to do it </v>

2281
01:57:26.221 --> 01:57:26.221
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you could be,</v>

2282
01:57:26.221 --> 01:57:28.660
<v Speaker 2>and so without that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're a historical creature,</v>

2283
01:57:28.661 --> 01:57:31.840
<v Speaker 2>you know what students ask me sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why study history?</v>

2284
01:57:31.841 --> 01:57:32.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2285
01:57:32.261 --> 01:57:37.261
<v Speaker 2>because history is about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's like history tells you </v>

2286
01:57:37.261 --> 01:57:41.461
<v Speaker 2>who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell who you are because you </v>

2287
01:57:41.461 --> 01:57:41.461
<v Speaker 2>only live a little while.</v>

2288
01:57:41.461 --> 01:57:44.880
<v Speaker 2>How the hell can you figure out who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so you need all this collected </v>

2289
01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.301
<v Speaker 2>wisdom and all this dream like </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and all this mythology and </v>

2290
01:57:48.301 --> 01:57:52.471
<v Speaker 2>all this narrative to inform you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you are beyond what you see of </v>

2291
01:57:52.631 --> 01:57:57.631
<v Speaker 2>yourself and you know you're pummeled </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and people picked on you and </v>

2292
01:57:57.631 --> 01:58:00.780
<v Speaker 2>there's 50 things about you that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible and you know you've got a self </v>

2293
01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:03.871
<v Speaker 2>esteem problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sort of hunched over and you've </v>

2294
01:58:03.871 --> 01:58:03.871
<v Speaker 2>got all these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2295
01:58:03.871 --> 01:58:06.520
<v Speaker 2>and so it's not easy to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the divinity that lurks behind</v>

2296
01:58:06.521 --> 01:58:11.521
<v Speaker 2>that and unless you're aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroic stories of the past and the </v>

2297
01:58:11.521 --> 01:58:12.940
<v Speaker 2>metaphysics of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

2298
01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:18.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you can have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>courage to regard yourself as the sort </v>

2299
01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:21.451
<v Speaker 2>of creature that could stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath that intense existential </v>

2300
01:58:21.451 --> 01:58:23.650
<v Speaker 2>burden and move forward in encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 2>grace.</v>

2301
01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:28.950
<v Speaker 2>And of course that's part of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm talking about these biblical </v>

2302
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:29.530
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's 9:30,</v>

2303
01:58:29.531 --> 01:58:31.030
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to have to stop.</v>

2304
01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Thank.</v>

2305
01:58:49.490 --> 01:58:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to stop exactly at 10 </v>

2306
01:58:54.490 --> 01:58:56.270
<v Speaker 1>tonight because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the deal with the theater people.</v>

2307
01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2308
01:58:57.681 --> 01:59:01.640
<v Speaker 1>besides I'll be out of anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent to say by that point,</v>

2309
01:59:01.641 --> 01:59:03.110
<v Speaker 1>certainly so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2310
01:59:03.111 --> 01:59:05.330
<v Speaker 1>at least we got through one story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was good.</v>

2311
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:07.360
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2312
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:16.790
<v Speaker 1>let's give everyone like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2313
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:21.570
<v Speaker 1>just a few seconds to settle down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who wants to leave can leave.</v>

2314
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:25.110
<v Speaker 1>So thank you for all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all for coming.</v>

2315
01:59:25.111 --> 01:59:27.050
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly amazed that,</v>

2316
01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:27.930
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2317
01:59:28.050 --> 01:59:30.600
<v Speaker 1>everybody comes and listens to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2318
01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:33.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2319
01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:35.910
<v Speaker 1>it's strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

2320
01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:38.250
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far it's been fun though,</v>

2321
01:59:38.251 --> 01:59:39.750
<v Speaker 1>so that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2322
01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:40.410
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

2323
01:59:41.650 --> 01:59:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I opened that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi Dr Peterson.</v>

2324
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I was raised Catholic and any time there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a bit of a,</v>

2325
01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:51.220
<v Speaker 2>an inherent contradiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it,</v>

2326
01:59:51.221 --> 01:59:54.430
<v Speaker 2>in the document to the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be referred to as a mystery.</v>

2327
01:59:54.431 --> 01:59:56.740
<v Speaker 2>And there's one mystery I've always kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of wondered about,</v>

2328
01:59:56.741 --> 02:00:00.100
<v Speaker 2>and it's very important to genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

2329
02:00:00.970 --> 02:00:05.380
<v Speaker 2>how do you deal with a perfect God or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conception of a perfect God,</v>

2330
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:09.310
<v Speaker 2>who by nature isn't capable of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperfect design,</v>

2331
02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:13.480
<v Speaker 2>are incapable of a perfect design?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I mean by that is many religions</v>

2332
02:00:13.481 --> 02:00:14.560
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2333
02:00:14.561 --> 02:00:18.790
<v Speaker 2>good and evil as separate deities that </v>
<v Speaker 2>preexisted simultaneously.</v>

2334
02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>

2335
02:00:20.621 --> 02:00:25.621
<v Speaker 2>is that Lucifer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the embodiment of evil in the Christian </v>

2336
02:00:25.621 --> 02:00:29.071
<v Speaker 2>religion is an outgrowth of God and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the Milton for example,</v>

2337
02:00:29.111 --> 02:00:33.940
<v Speaker 2>presents him as a rebel against his </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of God's tyranny.</v>

2338
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another example,</v>

2339
02:00:35.381 --> 02:00:35.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2340
02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.270
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't touch on,</v>

2341
02:00:37.271 --> 02:00:38.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even today,</v>

2342
02:00:38.741 --> 02:00:42.160
<v Speaker 2>but in paradise supposedly perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>garden,</v>

2343
02:00:42.161 --> 02:00:47.161
<v Speaker 2>a perfect design is infiltrated again by</v>
<v Speaker 2>that evil outgrowth of a so called </v>

2344
02:00:47.951 --> 02:00:50.980
<v Speaker 2>perfect God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from a psychological perspective,</v>

2345
02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:55.060
<v Speaker 2>do you think there is a significance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this presentation of perfection,</v>

2346
02:00:55.061 --> 02:01:00.061
<v Speaker 2>yet the contradictory flaws that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of naturally part of that </v>

2347
02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:02.110
<v Speaker 2>perfection.</v>

2348
02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2349
02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Kol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

2350
02:01:05.650 --> 02:01:06.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a good simple question.</v>

2351
02:01:09.650 --> 02:01:11.660
<v Speaker 2>We're starting to see you.</v>

2352
02:01:12.690 --> 02:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>He was Kinda Manichaean in his approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

2353
02:01:14.970 --> 02:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tended towards thinking that evil in </v>

2354
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>some sense was a separate entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2355
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:24.951
<v Speaker 1>when I thought about that for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because there's a potency about </v>

2356
02:01:24.951 --> 02:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>evil that just can't be brushed away and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

2357
02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this most practically,</v>

2358
02:01:27.991 --> 02:01:32.991
<v Speaker 1>as I've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went in for people in my clinical </v>

2359
02:01:32.991 --> 02:01:32.991
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2360
02:01:32.991 --> 02:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with many people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>touched by malevolence and there's no </v>

2361
02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>other way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2362
02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>of stating it properly and this happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot to people who have posttraumatic </v>

2363
02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:44.260
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they encountered someone that </v>

2364
02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>wanted to hurt them for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting them.</v>

2365
02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't some misunderstanding.</v>

2366
02:01:46.821 --> 02:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>You can forget about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that at all.</v>

2367
02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>And so to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deny the reality of evil in some </v>

2368
02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:57.941
<v Speaker 1>sense I think is the ultimate naivety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's a word that you won't </v>

2369
02:01:57.941 --> 02:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>hear used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2370
02:01:58.191 --> 02:01:59.770
<v Speaker 1>very often in universities anymore.</v>

2371
02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just,</v>

2372
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:03.580
<v Speaker 1>I just can't understand that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

2373
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:09.430
<v Speaker 1>But I thought about that lot and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna kind of answer that question by </v>

2374
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>hitting it scatter shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is that there's an idea,</v>

2375
02:02:15.861 --> 02:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>and this happens in Milton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that comes across in Milton,</v>

2376
02:02:18.921 --> 02:02:23.890
<v Speaker 1>that distance from God is hell right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

2377
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>that hell doesn't actually have any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's ambivalent in Milton,</v>

2378
02:02:26.991 --> 02:02:31.991
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental claim seems to be </v>

2379
02:02:31.991 --> 02:02:31.991
<v Speaker 1>that the farther you get from God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it's hell.</v>

2380
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:34.310
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton,</v>

2381
02:02:34.311 --> 02:02:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's Lucifer,</v>

2382
02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:36.800
<v Speaker 1>the bringer of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2383
02:02:36.801 --> 02:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>He's God's highest angel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God most wrong.</v>

2384
02:02:39.141 --> 02:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of think about him as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit of rationality,</v>

2385
02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:47.260
<v Speaker 1>of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not because I'm not an admirer of </v>

2386
02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:47.260
<v Speaker 1>intelligence because hooray for </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

2387
02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:51.320
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that that Milton </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to cotton onto before the rise of</v>

2388
02:02:51.321 --> 02:02:56.321
<v Speaker 1>modern totalitarian states was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect has the capacity to fall in </v>

2389
02:02:57.021 --> 02:03:00.860
<v Speaker 1>love with its own creations and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevate them to the highest place,</v>

2390
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:03.260
<v Speaker 1>which is basically a totalitarian claim.</v>

2391
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like what I know is everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be known and if it was only </v>

2392
02:03:08.530 --> 02:03:12.221
<v Speaker 1>manifest in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world would become a utopia and I </v>

2393
02:03:12.221 --> 02:03:12.470
<v Speaker 1>also think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about this next week.</v>

2394
02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I also think that that's the core idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the tower of Babel.</v>

2395
02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Remember the tower of Babel is raised by</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being so that the pinnacle will </v>

2396
02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.341
<v Speaker 1>hit heaven and so it's the idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can build a structure that makes the </v>

2397
02:03:24.341 --> 02:03:27.290
<v Speaker 1>transcendent unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so okay,</v>

2398
02:03:27.291 --> 02:03:29.690
<v Speaker 1>so there's those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's,</v>

2399
02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:32.420
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea of freewill that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with it too,</v>

2400
02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:36.380
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that in order for </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to be good there has to be evil.</v>

2401
02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the answer is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

2402
02:03:41.091 --> 02:03:46.091
<v Speaker 1>is that in order for there to be being </v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be limitation in order for </v>

2403
02:03:46.311 --> 02:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>their good to be good.</v>

2404
02:03:47.330 --> 02:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>There has to be the possibility of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the right path is to exist such </v>

2405
02:03:53.721 --> 02:03:55.760
<v Speaker 1>that the possibility of evil remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>

2406
02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:59.870
<v Speaker 1>but that you choose the good and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that evil per se is built into the</v>

2407
02:03:59.871 --> 02:04:02.750
<v Speaker 1>structure of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that that's human.</v>

2408
02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I think that evil is human and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's understandable.</v>

2409
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I did a lecture that's online about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between evil and tragedy and</v>

2410
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>tragedy seems to be built into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the world and perhaps you </v>

2411
02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>can blame God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2412
02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:19.430
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to me that it's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fault that the earthquakes for example,</v>

2413
02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:24.700
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is not obvious to me either that </v>

2414
02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:25.100
<v Speaker 1>it's tragedy that takes the spirit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

2415
02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that human beings are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipped to deal with tragedy,</v>

2416
02:04:28.251 --> 02:04:31.820
<v Speaker 1>but we're not equipped to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that destroys people.</v>

2417
02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysically speaking,</v>

2418
02:04:38.641 --> 02:04:43.641
<v Speaker 1>the world is structured so that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a choice between good and evil and </v>

2419
02:04:43.681 --> 02:04:48.681
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the next question is why do we </v>

2420
02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 1>have a choice and that that's where my </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge runs out.</v>

2421
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the alchemists,</v>

2422
02:04:54.150 --> 02:04:59.150
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculated that the Orthodox Christians </v>

2423
02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:02.390
<v Speaker 1>also follow this line of reasoning is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings in some sense are </v>

2424
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:06.621
<v Speaker 1>furthering creation by our actions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our choices and I think there's </v>

2425
02:05:06.621 --> 02:05:11.001
<v Speaker 1>something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like creation is </v>

2426
02:05:11.001 --> 02:05:11.820
<v Speaker 1>unfinished in some sense and that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in,</v>

2427
02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>in moving it in whatever direction it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we want to move it,</v>

2428
02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:20.300
<v Speaker 1>and part of that is that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill and part of that is that we </v>

2429
02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:22.350
<v Speaker 1>have the choice between good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's also was all associated with,</v>

2430
02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:27.740
<v Speaker 1>with the significance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the cosmic significance of our </v>

2431
02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:30.951
<v Speaker 1>lives and I blood that strikes me as </v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible and I think the weight of </v>

2432
02:05:31.411 --> 02:05:35.130
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that people feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentially as an indication of that.</v>

2433
02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:38.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's about the best I could do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2434
02:05:38.910 --> 02:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2435
02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 2>and it seems the way you're describing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2436
02:05:40.891 --> 02:05:45.891
<v Speaker 2>it's built into at least the text that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you presented because one of the other </v>

2437
02:05:45.891 --> 02:05:48.870
<v Speaker 2>things I had noticed was God </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistently describes creation is good,</v>

2438
02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:49.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creates light,</v>

2439
02:05:49.801 --> 02:05:50.880
<v Speaker 2>it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he creates dark.</v>

2440
02:05:50.881 --> 02:05:55.881
<v Speaker 2>It's good after he creates things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he announces that he creates man and </v>

2441
02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:00.030
<v Speaker 2>woman announces that they have dominion </v>
<v Speaker 2>over those things and can use them,</v>

2442
02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:01.980
<v Speaker 2>and it might be something lost in </v>
<v Speaker 2>translation,</v>

2443
02:06:01.981 --> 02:06:06.420
<v Speaker 2>but that is described as very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as that dominion is brought into</v>

2444
02:06:06.421 --> 02:06:11.421
<v Speaker 2>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might speak to that notion of </v>

2445
02:06:11.421 --> 02:06:11.421
<v Speaker 2>furthering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2446
02:06:11.421 --> 02:06:13.020
<v Speaker 1>here's something interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll develop this a lot,</v>

2447
02:06:13.021 --> 02:06:18.021
<v Speaker 1>is that you see when Adam and eve eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fruit and the snake gives him the </v>

2448
02:06:18.021 --> 02:06:22.821
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens is their </v>

2449
02:06:22.821 --> 02:06:22.821
<v Speaker 1>eyes are opened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>

2450
02:06:22.821 --> 02:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>That means that while they've woken up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2451
02:06:23.980 --> 02:06:28.980
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been an increment in their </v>

2452
02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:30.831
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and the next thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is that they recognize that </v>

2453
02:06:30.831 --> 02:06:30.831
<v Speaker 1>they're naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2454
02:06:30.831 --> 02:06:35.231
<v Speaker 1>And to recognize that you're naked is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that you're vulnerable and </v>

2455
02:06:35.231 --> 02:06:38.811
<v Speaker 1>human beings are strange creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most animals are like this and </v>

2456
02:06:38.811 --> 02:06:38.811
<v Speaker 1>they're protected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not us.</v>

2457
02:06:38.811 --> 02:06:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Like our most vulnerable parts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>displayed for Harman,</v>

2458
02:06:42.571 --> 02:06:44.100
<v Speaker 1>for everyone to observe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2459
02:06:44.101 --> 02:06:49.101
<v Speaker 1>So we've got that sort of bipedal </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfconsciousness built into us,</v>

2460
02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:54.440
<v Speaker 1>but what's really interesting is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Adam and eve realized that they're </v>

2461
02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:57.231
<v Speaker 1>naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same moment that they know the </v>

2462
02:06:57.231 --> 02:06:58.170
<v Speaker 1>difference between good and evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that God,</v>

2463
02:06:58.171 --> 02:06:59.220
<v Speaker 1>that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just,</v>

2464
02:06:59.610 --> 02:07:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I just ground away on that for years.</v>

2465
02:07:01.590 --> 02:07:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Trust if they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is,</v>

2466
02:07:02.761 --> 02:07:07.761
<v Speaker 1>is what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the relationship between </v>

2467
02:07:07.761 --> 02:07:08.250
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of nakedness and the knowledge</v>

2468
02:07:08.251 --> 02:07:09.480
<v Speaker 1>of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I think,</v>

2469
02:07:09.481 --> 02:07:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I think I figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2470
02:07:11.610 --> 02:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it was that you see when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that you're vulnerable and they </v>

2471
02:07:16.610 --> 02:07:18.570
<v Speaker 1>also develop knowledge of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2472
02:07:18.571 --> 02:07:23.571
<v Speaker 1>So there's deep knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and they get embarrassed </v>

2473
02:07:23.571 --> 02:07:23.571
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cover themselves up,</v>

2474
02:07:23.571 --> 02:07:23.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's culture.</v>

2475
02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:27.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very profound shock for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to recognize that they're naked.</v>

2476
02:07:27.691 --> 02:07:32.691
<v Speaker 1>It even makes Adam hide from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they developed the knowledge of </v>

2477
02:07:32.691 --> 02:07:32.691
<v Speaker 1>good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2478
02:07:32.691 --> 02:07:36.861
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because you see human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have this peculiar capacity that </v>

2479
02:07:36.861 --> 02:07:37.780
<v Speaker 1>no other creature has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2480
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:41.740
<v Speaker 1>I know how I can be hurt because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of my own limitations.</v>

2481
02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Painfully aware and now because I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how I can be heard,</v>

2482
02:07:45.550 --> 02:07:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I know how you can be hurt and I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of that and that's I </v>

2483
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:51.640
<v Speaker 1>think how evil enters the world.</v>

2484
02:07:51.850 --> 02:07:56.850
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I've got this expansion of </v>

2485
02:07:56.850 --> 02:07:56.850
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says in genesis that that,</v>

2486
02:07:56.870 --> 02:08:01.870
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives people another attribute of </v>

2487
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:04.231
<v Speaker 1>divinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing the difference between good and </v>

2488
02:08:04.231 --> 02:08:06.061
<v Speaker 1>evil as it has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and it has nothing to do with </v>

2489
02:08:06.061 --> 02:08:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve prior to having their eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened,</v>

2490
02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.000
<v Speaker 1>but that the cosmos switches when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness manifests itself and </v>

2491
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.290
<v Speaker 1>that's when the possibility of evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>enters the world.</v>

2492
02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:19.380
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and that's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>echoed by the intimate relationship </v>

2493
02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:21.520
<v Speaker 1>between the snake in the garden of Eden </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Satan,</v>

2494
02:08:21.550 --> 02:08:26.550
<v Speaker 1>which is we go into because that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very strange associations like </v>

2495
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:30.961
<v Speaker 1>the snake all also becomes the adversary</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bea and I think that's all jumped </v>

2496
02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:34.420
<v Speaker 1>very quickly into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's because you know,</v>

2497
02:08:34.430 --> 02:08:39.430
<v Speaker 1>there's the snake that bites you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle and then there's the snake that </v>

2498
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.490
<v Speaker 1>lives in your enemy.</v>

2499
02:08:39.850 --> 02:08:42.310
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the snake that lives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

2500
02:08:42.311 --> 02:08:47.311
<v Speaker 1>if you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've banished the enemy to the </v>

2501
02:08:47.311 --> 02:08:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the snake that lives in</v>

2502
02:08:48.281 --> 02:08:53.281
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you remove yourself from your family </v>

2503
02:08:53.281 --> 02:08:53.710
<v Speaker 1>and that snake that's in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2504
02:08:53.711 --> 02:08:54.550
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

2505
02:08:54.551 --> 02:08:59.551
<v Speaker 1>that's a psychological phenomena that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to transcendent evil itself.</v>

2506
02:08:59.801 --> 02:09:01.780
<v Speaker 1>The thing that inhabits every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

2507
02:09:01.950 --> 02:09:04.720
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's that association </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the snake and Satan.</v>

2508
02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:06.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2509
02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:12.420
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with our knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability that gives us this </v>

2510
02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:14.080
<v Speaker 1>constant capacity for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for evil being.</v>

2511
02:09:14.081 --> 02:09:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you're a medieval torture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2512
02:09:16.991 --> 02:09:18.880
<v Speaker 1>People don't generally imagine that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing,</v>

2513
02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:24.040
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people were medieval torturers and </v>

2514
02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:25.630
<v Speaker 1>they were very good at what they did and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way that you can be a torturers</v>

2515
02:09:25.631 --> 02:09:28.210
<v Speaker 1>to know what would hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2516
02:09:28.210 --> 02:09:29.970
<v Speaker 1>And so you exploit your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

2517
02:09:29.971 --> 02:09:34.971
<v Speaker 1>exploit the knowledge of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability to bring pain into the </v>

2518
02:09:34.971 --> 02:09:38.311
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that you can lay that </v>

2519
02:09:38.311 --> 02:09:40.981
<v Speaker 1>precisely at God's feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people have been arguing about that </v>

2520
02:09:41.081 --> 02:09:42.220
<v Speaker 1>for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2521
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:43.690
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question,</v>

2522
02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:45.580
<v Speaker 1>the question for me that arose from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2523
02:09:45.581 --> 02:09:46.300
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

2524
02:09:46.330 --> 02:09:48.940
<v Speaker 1>like tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can lay that at God's feet.</v>

2525
02:09:49.210 --> 02:09:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't bring additional evil into </v>

2526
02:09:54.210 --> 02:09:57.751
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could we tolerate the tragedy of being </v>

2527
02:09:57.751 --> 02:09:59.590
<v Speaker 1>without becoming corrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think generally the answer to that</v>

2528
02:09:59.591 --> 02:10:04.591
<v Speaker 1>is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've seen people react quite </v>

2529
02:10:04.591 --> 02:10:05.080
<v Speaker 1>heroically to the arbitrary burdens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life,</v>

2530
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but malevolence man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2531
02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:09.940
<v Speaker 1>that lays the low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lays the low and it seems to be to be</v>

2532
02:10:09.941 --> 02:10:13.060
<v Speaker 1>nothing but a destructive force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe as well,</v>

2533
02:10:13.061 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 1>and I think you see this indicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled story,</v>

2534
02:10:14.981 --> 02:10:19.981
<v Speaker 1>that the root of malevolence is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire for revenge against God for the </v>

2535
02:10:19.981 --> 02:10:21.490
<v Speaker 1>creation itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2536
02:10:21.491 --> 02:10:26.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've read terrible things written</v>
<v Speaker 1>by terrible people trying to get to the </v>

2537
02:10:26.491 --> 02:10:30.451
<v Speaker 1>bottom of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mentioned the columbine killers </v>

2538
02:10:30.451 --> 02:10:30.451
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's clear.</v>

2539
02:10:30.451 --> 02:10:30.820
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is go read what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote.</v>

2540
02:10:31.150 --> 02:10:33.070
<v Speaker 1>What they were doing was taking revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>

2541
02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:38.860
<v Speaker 1>They knew that it wasn't unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'd been dwelling on this for </v>

2542
02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:43.900
<v Speaker 1>months plotting the revenge and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge against being itself for the </v>

2543
02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:45.200
<v Speaker 1>crime of being so.</v>

2544
02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>

2545
02:10:54.130 --> 02:10:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Dr.</v>

2546
02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:59.230
<v Speaker 1>you'd said when God saw that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2547
02:10:59.590 --> 02:11:03.370
<v Speaker 1>you read that as potentially well might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be better than nothing.</v>

2548
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And the story in genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bracketed by days,</v>

2549
02:11:08.141 --> 02:11:10.090
<v Speaker 1>which aren't necessarily literal days </v>
<v Speaker 1>yom,</v>

2550
02:11:10.091 --> 02:11:14.920
<v Speaker 1>the original word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also bracketed by and he saw it</v>

2551
02:11:14.921 --> 02:11:16.030
<v Speaker 1>was good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2552
02:11:16.031 --> 02:11:17.620
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my question is,</v>

2553
02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:23.820
<v Speaker 1>is there something more profoundly </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening there between this profundity </v>

2554
02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:27.841
<v Speaker 1>of speaking into existence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way to start is to this observation,</v>

2555
02:11:29.021 --> 02:11:34.021
<v Speaker 1>the seeing that it's good and are we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is God modeling consciousness is a </v>

2556
02:11:34.021 --> 02:11:37.090
<v Speaker 1>little more there for us to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grapple with.</v>

2557
02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

2558
02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:41.440
<v Speaker 1>So go more for us to grapple with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>

2559
02:11:42.410 --> 02:11:47.410
<v Speaker 1>In the sense that we have this amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insight of speaking things forth,</v>

2560
02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:55.570
<v Speaker 1>but you'd also commented on </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness as until something's </v>

2561
02:11:55.570 --> 02:11:56.700
<v Speaker 1>observed during until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until it's seen.</v>

2562
02:11:57.350 --> 02:12:01.700
<v Speaker 1>So when God sees that that creation was </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2563
02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:03.000
<v Speaker 1>is there.</v>

2564
02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.000
<v Speaker 1>There's kind of this bracketing between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bringing forth through the sport </v>

2565
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.130
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the word through Jesus.</v>

2566
02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2567
02:12:09.651 --> 02:12:11.030
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you mean.</v>

2568
02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2569
02:12:11.751 --> 02:12:14.480
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what that is is that I think,</v>

2570
02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:20.200
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's perfectly reasonable from an </v>

2571
02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>architectural and psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective to consider the idea of the </v>

2572
02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:28.520
<v Speaker 1>word equivalent to the spoken truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>being Christ makes that claim in the New</v>

2573
02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's the truth.</v>

2574
02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And embodied.</v>

2575
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:36.850
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can logically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can derive from that the idea that </v>

2576
02:12:36.850 --> 02:12:38.600
<v Speaker 1>if things are spoken into being through </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

2577
02:12:38.601 --> 02:12:40.700
<v Speaker 1>then they're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

2578
02:12:40.701 --> 02:12:44.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that that association exists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's.</v>

2579
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that that's in some sense </v>

2580
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:52.001
<v Speaker 1>the deepest claim of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that because I think that I </v>

2581
02:12:52.001 --> 02:12:53.900
<v Speaker 1>think you have to make a decision in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life as far as I can tell,</v>

2582
02:12:53.901 --> 02:12:58.901
<v Speaker 1>and I think kierkegaard knew this more </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly than anyone else I've ever read </v>

2583
02:12:58.901 --> 02:13:02.820
<v Speaker 1>in is if being is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then an honest relationship with being </v>

2584
02:13:05.761 --> 02:13:09.420
<v Speaker 1>also has to be good and then if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an honest relationship with being,</v>

2585
02:13:09.421 --> 02:13:14.421
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to speak the truth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think what you have to decide is </v>

2586
02:13:14.421 --> 02:13:16.830
<v Speaker 1>that speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you speak the truth,</v>

2587
02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:21.860
<v Speaker 1>then what happens is good regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens and that that's that.</v>

2588
02:13:22.410 --> 02:13:27.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the rub of faith and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that kierkegaard </v>

2589
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:27.410
<v Speaker 1>wrestled with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2590
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:27.410
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2591
02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think if I</v>

2592
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.680
<v Speaker 3>can provide an example about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

2593
02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:38.280
<v Speaker 3>It didn't need an easily and quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2594
02:13:38.281 --> 02:13:43.281
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's partly because it's partly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can live your life two ways.</v>

2595
02:13:43.771 --> 02:13:44.700
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

2596
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:49.790
<v Speaker 3>you can use your language to manipulate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can use your language as a tool to </v>

2597
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:53.541
<v Speaker 3>get what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with that is that that </v>

2598
02:13:53.541 --> 02:13:56.241
<v Speaker 3>assumes that you know what you want and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're right and that's a problem </v>

2599
02:13:56.241 --> 02:13:59.010
<v Speaker 3>because there's lots of things you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know and if you get what you want,</v>

2600
02:13:59.011 --> 02:14:04.011
<v Speaker 3>you may find a that you didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>want it and be that you're not the </v>

2601
02:14:04.011 --> 02:14:05.310
<v Speaker 3>person that started the journey towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2602
02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:10.490
<v Speaker 3>That happens a lot to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when they use their language </v>

2603
02:14:10.490 --> 02:14:11.520
<v Speaker 3>in a manipulative way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the alternative seems to be,</v>

2604
02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:14.310
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is one of the lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

2605
02:14:14.311 --> 02:14:19.311
<v Speaker 3>it's laid out in the movie Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which happens to be a kind of </v>

2606
02:14:19.311 --> 02:14:22.041
<v Speaker 3>archetypical favorite of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that part of the act of faith,</v>

2607
02:14:22.590 --> 02:14:27.590
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I wouldn't say Christian faith </v>

2608
02:14:27.590 --> 02:14:27.990
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say faith and being itself is is</v>

2609
02:14:27.991 --> 02:14:31.020
<v Speaker 3>the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the decision that God is good.</v>

2610
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:36.470
<v Speaker 3>The decision is there's no better way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring better being into being then to </v>

2611
02:14:37.321 --> 02:14:39.780
<v Speaker 3>speak the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I do think that's echoed.</v>

2612
02:14:39.781 --> 02:14:44.781
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a very wise observation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's echoed in that first </v>

2613
02:14:44.781 --> 02:14:44.781
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2614
02:14:44.781 --> 02:14:47.310
<v Speaker 3>they active speech and second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the observation that the consequence was</v>

2615
02:14:47.311 --> 02:14:48.630
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2616
02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:49.290
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

2617
02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:00.600
<v Speaker 4>Good morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Citizens Peterson first have a bunch of </v>

2618
02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:04.831
<v Speaker 4>questions and the one that had them </v>
<v Speaker 4>answered immediately like you have a </v>

2619
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:10.350
<v Speaker 4>post on quora in which you encourage all</v>
<v Speaker 4>children to incur skateboarding </v>

2620
02:15:10.350 --> 02:15:15.331
<v Speaker 4>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also stated in this post you wrote </v>

2621
02:15:16.091 --> 02:15:21.091
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do not try to rescue someone who does </v>

2622
02:15:21.091 --> 02:15:23.941
<v Speaker 4>not want to be rescued and be very </v>
<v Speaker 4>careful about rescuing someone who does.</v>

2623
02:15:24.790 --> 02:15:29.790
<v Speaker 4>And can you reconcile this with what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>stated about transcendent morality and </v>

2624
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:31.440
<v Speaker 4>the heroic impulse that I guess men are </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be</v>

2625
02:15:31.450 --> 02:15:32.890
<v Speaker 1>born with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2626
02:15:32.891 --> 02:15:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2627
02:15:33.701 --> 02:15:34.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2628
02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:37.870
<v Speaker 1>well the skate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skateboarding question is I wrote,</v>

2629
02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I have a book coming out in 2018 called </v>
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life,</v>

2630
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:45.340
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the chapters in there is from</v>

2631
02:15:45.341 --> 02:15:50.341
<v Speaker 1>that cora posting and it's called don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bother their children when they're </v>

2632
02:15:50.341 --> 02:15:53.731
<v Speaker 1>skateboarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of associated with what I </v>

2633
02:15:53.731 --> 02:15:53.731
<v Speaker 1>had said earlier about Parker for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

2634
02:15:53.731 --> 02:15:53.830
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2635
02:15:53.831 --> 02:15:58.831
<v Speaker 1>kids need to go out and push themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>against danger because that's what life </v>

2636
02:15:59.561 --> 02:16:01.510
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pushing yourself against danger and,</v>

2637
02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:06.460
<v Speaker 1>and when you see kids doing things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are dangerous but spectacular,</v>

2638
02:16:06.461 --> 02:16:11.461
<v Speaker 1>then you kind of have a moral obligation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to back the hell off and let them </v>

2639
02:16:11.461 --> 02:16:14.650
<v Speaker 1>experiment with their own mortality </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't keep them safe.</v>

2640
02:16:14.651 --> 02:16:17.500
<v Speaker 1>The best thing you can do is make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>able and courageous.</v>

2641
02:16:17.501 --> 02:16:22.501
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that that's a more </v>

2642
02:16:22.501 --> 02:16:24.241
<v Speaker 1>difficult lesson generally speaking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers to learn then for fathers to </v>

2643
02:16:24.241 --> 02:16:24.241
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

2644
02:16:24.241 --> 02:16:25.240
<v Speaker 1>And that was Freud's fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation,</v>

2645
02:16:25.241 --> 02:16:27.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely crucial.</v>

2646
02:16:27.610 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>And so I've seen do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2647
02:16:30.011 --> 02:16:35.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can obviously be a full on a </v>

2648
02:16:35.011 --> 02:16:35.011
<v Speaker 1>skateboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although the distinction between being a</v>

2649
02:16:35.011 --> 02:16:38.380
<v Speaker 1>fall and developing yourself as not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear as people might like to imagine.</v>

2650
02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:42.580
<v Speaker 1>And when kids are out there with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>helmet and doing dangerous things,</v>

2651
02:16:42.581 --> 02:16:45.100
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a part of me that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course is very worried about it.</v>

2652
02:16:45.101 --> 02:16:50.101
<v Speaker 1>But there's another part of me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>admires it very much because they're </v>

2653
02:16:50.101 --> 02:16:52.450
<v Speaker 1>practicing what they need to practice in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to cope with the world.</v>

2654
02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>

2655
02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Now the other one was rescuing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2656
02:16:57.310 --> 02:16:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got this partly from Carl Rogers.</v>

2657
02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:05.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] rogers was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a clinician of very famous </v>

2658
02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:05.480
<v Speaker 1>clinician and and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2659
02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:06.850
<v Speaker 1>he was a Christian missionary to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2660
02:17:06.851 --> 02:17:11.851
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't end up that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was very interested in the </v>

2661
02:17:11.851 --> 02:17:13.390
<v Speaker 1>utility of listening as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a means of redemption.</v>

2662
02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listening by the way,</v>

2663
02:17:15.461 --> 02:17:18.790
<v Speaker 1>is if you have someone that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a problem,</v>

2664
02:17:19.090 --> 02:17:24.090
<v Speaker 1>the best thing you can often do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to them if they're actually </v>

2665
02:17:24.090 --> 02:17:27.301
<v Speaker 1>trying to communicate because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>configure themselves through speech and </v>

2666
02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:31.270
<v Speaker 1>most people can't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean that in a mean way.</v>

2667
02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean the way they think is by talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can't talk unless they have </v>

2668
02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:37.930
<v Speaker 1>someone to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because they're bouncing</v>

2669
02:17:37.931 --> 02:17:42.931
<v Speaker 1>the idea off them and seeing if it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense and seeing how the person </v>

2670
02:17:42.931 --> 02:17:43.210
<v Speaker 1>responds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listening is a great thing,</v>

2671
02:17:43.510 --> 02:17:48.510
<v Speaker 1>but Rogers was also interested in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the preconditions for having a </v>

2672
02:17:48.510 --> 02:17:52.681
<v Speaker 1>redemptive relationship and that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a therapeutic relationship or an </v>

2673
02:17:52.681 --> 02:17:55.951
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things he claimed was that unless the </v>

2674
02:17:55.951 --> 02:17:58.050
<v Speaker 1>person was aiming upward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing you could do about it.</v>

2675
02:17:58.230 --> 02:18:01.690
<v Speaker 1>That and that seemed to be associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this idea of that initial choice,</v>

2676
02:18:01.691 --> 02:18:06.070
<v Speaker 1>say between good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once someone comes to therapy,</v>

2677
02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:09.040
<v Speaker 1>they've already done something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've already said,</v>

2678
02:18:09.041 --> 02:18:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceivably I could fix it and I need to</v>

2679
02:18:12.341 --> 02:18:17.341
<v Speaker 1>do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so half the work is already </v>

2680
02:18:17.341 --> 02:18:17.770
<v Speaker 1>done by the time they show up because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've already said,</v>

2681
02:18:17.771 --> 02:18:22.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't as good as they could be </v>

2682
02:18:22.771 --> 02:18:22.771
<v Speaker 1>and I could do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

2683
02:18:22.771 --> 02:18:25.600
<v Speaker 1>can you do anything about someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't at that state?</v>

2684
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:29.200
<v Speaker 1>And my observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is Roger's observation as well,</v>

2685
02:18:29.201 --> 02:18:33.100
<v Speaker 1>is that you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can serve by example,</v>

2686
02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:38.340
<v Speaker 1>but until the person has decided on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own that they're wrong.</v>

2687
02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:44.320
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's something wrong about </v>

2688
02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:44.320
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing and that they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>

2689
02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:48.331
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that even trying to hammer </v>

2690
02:18:48.331 --> 02:18:48.331
<v Speaker 1>against that often makes it worse.</v>

2691
02:18:48.331 --> 02:18:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know that soul Schnitzel,</v>

2692
02:18:49.330 --> 02:18:52.540
<v Speaker 1>when he was talking about the communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologues,</v>

2693
02:18:52.541 --> 02:18:57.541
<v Speaker 1>the really hardcore communist ideologues</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were eaten up by the Gulag </v>

2694
02:18:57.541 --> 02:18:57.541
<v Speaker 1>archipelago system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2695
02:18:57.541 --> 02:18:59.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of devoured by their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saw the same thing,</v>

2696
02:18:59.771 --> 02:19:04.771
<v Speaker 1>was that until they were willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that something was wrong with the </v>

2697
02:19:04.771 --> 02:19:06.970
<v Speaker 1>manner in which they had construed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

2698
02:19:06.971 --> 02:19:08.920
<v Speaker 1>that it had resulted in their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>device,</v>

2699
02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:11.110
<v Speaker 1>that there was actually no way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with them.</v>

2700
02:19:11.350 --> 02:19:13.210
<v Speaker 1>They're in kind of an authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble.</v>

2701
02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:14.940
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

2702
02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if you orient yourself as an </v>

2703
02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:25.620
<v Speaker 1>archetypal hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can get through that </v>

2704
02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:25.620
<v Speaker 1>barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2705
02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's part of the issue of</v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill.</v>

2706
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I think that I do not think that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can learn unless they admit that they're</v>

2707
02:19:30.681 --> 02:19:32.570
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this,</v>

2708
02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:37.520
<v Speaker 1>there's this play the cocktail hour by </v>
<v Speaker 1>tsl.</v>

2709
02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's this woman in the play and she </v>

2710
02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:44.381
<v Speaker 1>comes up to a psychiatrist and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in the course of casual </v>

2711
02:19:44.381 --> 02:19:44.381
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she says,</v>

2712
02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I really hope there's something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me,</v>

2713
02:19:46.730 --> 02:19:49.250
<v Speaker 1>and of course the psychiatrist is a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken aback by that.</v>

2714
02:19:49.251 --> 02:19:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2715
02:19:49.701 --> 02:19:51.250
<v Speaker 1>why in the world would you hope such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

2716
02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:53.420
<v Speaker 1>And she says something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2717
02:19:53.421 --> 02:19:54.710
<v Speaker 1>like I'm suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2718
02:19:54.711 --> 02:19:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Things are not good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a dreadful time of it.</v>

2719
02:19:57.111 --> 02:19:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only two possibilities.</v>

2720
02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Either the world in its essence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiring against me and I'm doomed </v>

2721
02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:06.530
<v Speaker 1>because what am I going to do about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

2722
02:20:06.531 --> 02:20:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just built into the structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality or I'm doing something wrong.</v>

2723
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:14.330
<v Speaker 1>So I'm really hoping that I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong because if I am,</v>

2724
02:20:14.331 --> 02:20:16.770
<v Speaker 1>then maybe I could fix it and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped suffering and it's.</v>

2725
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:20.000
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

2726
02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that if your life isn't what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be and you're suffering,</v>

2727
02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:29.380
<v Speaker 1>then it seems to me that that should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient evidence that you don't know </v>

2728
02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:32.921
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that isn't sufficient evidence </v>

2729
02:20:32.921 --> 02:20:36.071
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I don't know how anyone else can </v>

2730
02:20:36.071 --> 02:20:37.730
<v Speaker 1>provide you without evidence and so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to leave it at that.</v>

2731
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:42.750
<v Speaker 4>This is psychological rescue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like rescuing someone who's </v>

2732
02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:42.750
<v Speaker 4>drowning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>

2733
02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can rescue people when they're </v>

2734
02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>drowning even if they don't want you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

2735
02:20:49.930 --> 02:20:51.470
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you something about that </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

2736
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Something interesting about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's relevant is that you know,</v>

2737
02:20:55.430 --> 02:20:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you rescue someone who's drowning.</v>

2738
02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:01.100
<v Speaker 1>You do it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2739
02:21:01.101 --> 02:21:04.400
<v Speaker 1>You come to them like this and you push </v>
<v Speaker 1>them away with your foot.</v>

2740
02:21:04.401 --> 02:21:09.401
<v Speaker 1>If there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you that's what you do if </v>

2741
02:21:09.401 --> 02:21:09.401
<v Speaker 1>you're a lifeguard because if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>panicking and they grabbed you,</v>

2742
02:21:09.401 --> 02:21:14.111
<v Speaker 1>you both drowned and that's stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you both drowned and that's</v>

2743
02:21:14.271 --> 02:21:17.330
<v Speaker 1>a really good way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good metaphor for trying</v>

2744
02:21:17.331 --> 02:21:22.331
<v Speaker 1>to help someone too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when people are in real </v>

2745
02:21:22.331 --> 02:21:22.331
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2746
02:21:22.331 --> 02:21:25.841
<v Speaker 1>some of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're confused and some of it is that </v>

2747
02:21:25.841 --> 02:21:28.391
<v Speaker 1>their life has collapsed around them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some malevolence there and </v>

2748
02:21:28.391 --> 02:21:31.031
<v Speaker 1>there's some desire for vengeance and is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like one dangerous mess and if </v>

2749
02:21:31.031 --> 02:21:34.931
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna wait in there unprepared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that they're going to </v>

2750
02:21:34.931 --> 02:21:36.890
<v Speaker 1>take you down compared to you elevating </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is very,</v>

2751
02:21:36.891 --> 02:21:37.580
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>

2752
02:21:37.860 --> 02:21:42.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't even know what your </v>

2753
02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:44.381
<v Speaker 1>damn psychological stability rests on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be saying just because you're </v>

2754
02:21:44.381 --> 02:21:48.521
<v Speaker 1>lucky and surrounded by saying people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that you have the </v>

2755
02:21:48.521 --> 02:21:52.421
<v Speaker 1>psychological wherewithal to really post</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone up from the depths of the </v>

2756
02:21:52.421 --> 02:21:56.651
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they've also got one foot </v>

2757
02:21:56.651 --> 02:21:57.740
<v Speaker 1>inhale so you should bloody well be </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful about doing that kind of thing.</v>

2758
02:21:57.741 --> 02:21:59.870
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Hubris to attempt it.</v>

2759
02:21:59.871 --> 02:22:04.871
<v Speaker 1>And I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely caution people very </v>

2760
02:22:04.871 --> 02:22:05.960
<v Speaker 1>carefully about trying to rescue someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't want to be rescued.</v>

2761
02:22:05.961 --> 02:22:10.961
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very dangerous activity and it can </v>

2762
02:22:10.961 --> 02:22:10.961
<v Speaker 1>easily be counter productive.</v>

2763
02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:11.860
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So about,</v>

2764
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:13.820
<v Speaker 4>since 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to figure out like,</v>

2765
02:22:13.850 --> 02:22:16.240
<v Speaker 4>extract the Meta the way you've put it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of um,</v>

2766
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:19.190
<v Speaker 4>social justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think I found it actually,</v>

2767
02:22:19.191 --> 02:22:24.191
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they seem to have this behavior where </v>

2768
02:22:24.191 --> 02:22:24.191
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they nebulize every standard we have.</v>

2769
02:22:24.191 --> 02:22:24.620
<v Speaker 4>So they take a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have that handful of criteria.</v>

2770
02:22:25.050 --> 02:22:26.490
<v Speaker 4>You say what something is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is how it is,</v>

2771
02:22:26.491 --> 02:22:31.491
<v Speaker 4>like that's a podium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has these criteria within that </v>

2772
02:22:31.491 --> 02:22:32.790
<v Speaker 4>place they take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2773
02:22:32.791 --> 02:22:37.791
<v Speaker 4>they do something on nebulization where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they take something of what and they </v>

2774
02:22:37.791 --> 02:22:38.430
<v Speaker 4>dissolve the criteria such that there is</v>
<v Speaker 4>no way to say how it is.</v>

2775
02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:40.920
<v Speaker 4>So you see this now with gender where </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone will say their agenda,</v>

2776
02:22:40.921 --> 02:22:44.220
<v Speaker 4>but there's no way to get logically from</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they can be that gender,</v>

2777
02:22:44.221 --> 02:22:45.810
<v Speaker 4>like how you can be an attack </v>
<v Speaker 4>helicopter,</v>

2778
02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:47.310
<v Speaker 4>a male or a woman or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2779
02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:50.490
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing that came from this,</v>

2780
02:22:50.491 --> 02:22:53.070
<v Speaker 4>and I figured this out when I found </v>
<v Speaker 4>about you when I learned about you,</v>

2781
02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:58.200
<v Speaker 4>is that nebulization appears to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>exact opposite process of individuation.</v>

2782
02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:03.870
<v Speaker 4>Philosophic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the philosophical version of </v>

2783
02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:05.721
<v Speaker 4>intuit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>individuation that rests on three </v>

2784
02:23:05.721 --> 02:23:06.330
<v Speaker 4>premises are three core axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is I exist,</v>

2785
02:23:06.331 --> 02:23:09.540
<v Speaker 4>which is an axiom that exist in like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the objective that you exist here,</v>

2786
02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:15.080
<v Speaker 4>and then I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a reiteration of reincarnation </v>

2787
02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:18.051
<v Speaker 4>of I exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is basically you have to say I'm </v>

2788
02:23:18.051 --> 02:23:18.840
<v Speaker 4>right about having existed or also just </v>
<v Speaker 4>falls apart.</v>

2789
02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:20.730
<v Speaker 4>And then you have asked which is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>

2790
02:23:20.731 --> 02:23:21.330
<v Speaker 4>begged from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2791
02:23:21.331 --> 02:23:24.630
<v Speaker 4>if you exist and you're right as what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about,</v>

2792
02:23:24.631 --> 02:23:27.570
<v Speaker 4>God being the metaphor of God in Genesis</v>
<v Speaker 4>being the,</v>

2793
02:23:27.571 --> 02:23:32.571
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a metaphor for the creation of </v>

2794
02:23:32.571 --> 02:23:34.551
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it appears that individuation </v>

2795
02:23:34.551 --> 02:23:34.551
<v Speaker 4>actually fits that triad.</v>

2796
02:23:34.551 --> 02:23:35.730
<v Speaker 4>Because if you take ads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

2797
02:23:36.130 --> 02:23:36.860
<v Speaker 4>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as is a,</v>

2798
02:23:36.861 --> 02:23:41.861
<v Speaker 4>it's the predictive aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you try to take the subjective and </v>

2799
02:23:41.861 --> 02:23:41.861
<v Speaker 4>make it objective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have an idea,</v>

2800
02:23:41.861 --> 02:23:45.681
<v Speaker 4>you test it in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And time is the ultimate arbiter that </v>

2801
02:23:45.681 --> 02:23:48.741
<v Speaker 4>determines these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it changes your understanding of </v>

2802
02:23:48.741 --> 02:23:48.741
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets,</v>

2803
02:23:48.741 --> 02:23:48.741
<v Speaker 4>it lets you know God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it lets you know the objective.</v>

2804
02:23:49.050 --> 02:23:51.300
<v Speaker 4>And then from that point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the subjective which is supposed</v>

2805
02:23:51.301 --> 02:23:54.120
<v Speaker 4>to be formed from objective reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because you've changed that,</v>

2806
02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:56.640
<v Speaker 4>you know have to sacrifice your old self</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old way.</v>

2807
02:23:56.641 --> 02:23:59.190
<v Speaker 4>You saw Jordan Peterson of 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was not who he is now.</v>

2808
02:23:59.670 --> 02:24:02.490
<v Speaker 4>So it gets sacrificed and at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time you can point back to that guy that</v>

2809
02:24:02.491 --> 02:24:04.110
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2810
02:24:04.111 --> 02:24:06.870
<v Speaker 4>that guy was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the scapegoating of the sun.</v>

2811
02:24:07.650 --> 02:24:12.650
<v Speaker 4>So the subjective aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the I am right as the son and the Holy </v>

2812
02:24:12.650 --> 02:24:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is supposed to lead you to God is </v>

2813
02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:15.500
<v Speaker 4>the ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they don't understand that</v>

2814
02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:16.960
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first part,</v>

2815
02:24:16.961 --> 02:24:19.120
<v Speaker 1>the okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can,</v>

2816
02:24:19.150 --> 02:24:24.010
<v Speaker 1>can you just clarify that the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice aspect and the nebulization</v>

2817
02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:25.960
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the social justice is the exact opposite</v>

2818
02:24:25.961 --> 02:24:28.360
<v Speaker 4>process of individuation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all it is.</v>

2819
02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:31.120
<v Speaker 4>And it actually occurs it as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>at and you're thinking,</v>

2820
02:24:31.121 --> 02:24:31.810
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I?</v>

2821
02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:34.680
<v Speaker 4>You either apply individuation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You try to apply criteria.</v>

2822
02:24:34.681 --> 02:24:37.870
<v Speaker 4>You had to find out what you are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality or refuse that paradigm and say,</v>

2823
02:24:37.871 --> 02:24:38.710
<v Speaker 4>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>

2824
02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:43.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm always going to be right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm completely self righteous and you </v>

2825
02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:46.741
<v Speaker 4>stop at that subjective aspect where </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything becomes subjective and you </v>

2826
02:24:46.741 --> 02:24:46.741
<v Speaker 4>ultimately become relativistic and </v>
<v Speaker 4>nihilistic.</v>

2827
02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:50.890
<v Speaker 4>So I'm asking have you considered that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the genesis tail and the,</v>

2828
02:24:50.910 --> 02:24:55.910
<v Speaker 4>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the creation myth and God is actually </v>

2829
02:24:55.910 --> 02:25:00.001
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the process of individuation and the </v>

2830
02:25:00.001 --> 02:25:00.001
<v Speaker 4>trinity is actually those three core </v>
<v Speaker 4>premises.</v>

2831
02:25:00.001 --> 02:25:02.580
<v Speaker 4>The three axioms that come from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>K,</v>

2832
02:25:02.590 --> 02:25:06.730
<v Speaker 4>I haven't considered that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know that</v>

2833
02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:11.570
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] draw drew a parallel between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the passion for,</v>

2834
02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:16.600
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the development of human </v>

2835
02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:16.600
<v Speaker 1>individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

2836
02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:21.130
<v Speaker 1>that idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is lurking inside the union notion of </v>

2837
02:25:21.130 --> 02:25:22.940
<v Speaker 1>individuation because it has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary confrontation,</v>

2838
02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:25.060
<v Speaker 1>mortality and also with evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2839
02:25:25.061 --> 02:25:30.061
<v Speaker 1>As,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as two of the key elements of genuine </v>

2840
02:25:30.061 --> 02:25:32.820
<v Speaker 1>self realization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't considered the metaphorical </v>

2841
02:25:33.010 --> 02:25:36.610
<v Speaker 1>pathway that you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can't comment on that.</v>

2842
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I could say that one of the things </v>

2843
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:44.560
<v Speaker 1>that does disturb me about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological battle that's going on right</v>

2844
02:25:44.561 --> 02:25:45.310
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2845
02:25:45.430 --> 02:25:47.350
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is a very deep part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2846
02:25:47.351 --> 02:25:50.370
<v Speaker 1>and this is the part that's a battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the logos in,</v>

2847
02:25:50.371 --> 02:25:51.040
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dera,</v>

2848
02:25:51.041 --> 02:25:52.300
<v Speaker 1>does old terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2849
02:25:52.301 --> 02:25:56.290
<v Speaker 1>The fellow egocentric West needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken down to its essence,</v>

2850
02:25:56.291 --> 02:25:59.620
<v Speaker 1>is the refusal to engage in precise </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

2851
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:01.750
<v Speaker 1>And I see that in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2852
02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:05.800
<v Speaker 1>manifested in the refusal of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are criticizing.</v>

2853
02:26:05.801 --> 02:26:10.801
<v Speaker 1>Do we ever engage in any debate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in debate and they </v>

2854
02:26:10.801 --> 02:26:10.930
<v Speaker 1>don't believe in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

2855
02:26:11.260 --> 02:26:12.220
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

2856
02:26:12.221 --> 02:26:17.221
<v Speaker 1>the redemptive power of dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because mostly what they believe in his </v>

2857
02:26:17.221 --> 02:26:20.731
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a nebulization in that </v>

2858
02:26:20.731 --> 02:26:23.311
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this tendency to hide behind </v>

2859
02:26:23.311 --> 02:26:25.981
<v Speaker 1>what's vague and foglight instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>making things sharp and clear and </v>

2860
02:26:25.981 --> 02:26:26.980
<v Speaker 1>crystal clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that that's.</v>

2861
02:26:27.130 --> 02:26:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the degeneration of a </v>

2862
02:26:32.130 --> 02:26:33.840
<v Speaker 1>civilization as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you haven't considered that then </v>

2863
02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:34.480
<v Speaker 1>would you please?</v>

2864
02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:38.510
<v Speaker 6>I'll do my best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll do my best.</v>

2865
02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2866
02:26:50.330 --> 02:26:51.210
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So one,</v>

2867
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:56.230
<v Speaker 6>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One more question and then I'll make it </v>

2868
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.230
<v Speaker 6>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

2869
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.230
<v Speaker 6>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hi,</v>

2870
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:57.590
<v Speaker 6>Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My question is,</v>

2871
02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:03.460
<v Speaker 6>I know you stated in the last lecture </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the importance for setting aims in </v>

2872
02:27:04.821 --> 02:27:09.821
<v Speaker 6>life and to kind of have goals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>goals to work towards.</v>

2873
02:27:10.341 --> 02:27:11.780
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So my question was,</v>

2874
02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:14.030
<v Speaker 6>where do you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where do you,</v>

2875
02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:17.660
<v Speaker 6>how do you do that if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you want to go because that's kind</v>

2876
02:27:17.661 --> 02:27:21.500
<v Speaker 6>of where I got stuck on your future </v>
<v Speaker 6>authoring program because.</v>

2877
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

2878
02:27:23.530 --> 02:27:25.460
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2879
02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's echoed to some degree in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the structure of the biblical stories</v>

2880
02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:38.640
<v Speaker 1>and in this manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this notion in the Old </v>

2881
02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Testament that morality is following a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of prohibitions.</v>

2882
02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:46.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of bad things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do and then basically you're </v>

2883
02:27:46.590 --> 02:27:46.590
<v Speaker 1>good enough and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2884
02:27:46.590 --> 02:27:51.020
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's wisdom in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's kind of where children </v>

2885
02:27:51.020 --> 02:27:51.020
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2886
02:27:51.020 --> 02:27:51.020
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2887
02:27:51.020 --> 02:27:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love children and all that,</v>

2888
02:27:52.181 --> 02:27:57.181
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy little creatures and they </v>

2889
02:27:57.181 --> 02:27:59.120
<v Speaker 1>need to be civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly what you do is you,</v>

2890
02:27:59.230 --> 02:28:04.230
<v Speaker 1>you lay prohibitions on them and mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're trying to do is lay </v>

2891
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:07.630
<v Speaker 1>prohibitions on them for the behaviors </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they manifested,</v>

2892
02:28:07.631 --> 02:28:12.631
<v Speaker 1>would make their life miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have another chapter in this book </v>

2893
02:28:12.631 --> 02:28:16.021
<v Speaker 1>that I'm writing called don't let your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children do anything that makes you </v>

2894
02:28:16.021 --> 02:28:16.021
<v Speaker 1>dislike them.</v>

2895
02:28:16.021 --> 02:28:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And the idea there is that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job as a parent is to help your </v>

2896
02:28:20.310 --> 02:28:25.291
<v Speaker 1>children become sort of four year olds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that adults genuinely smile out when </v>

2897
02:28:25.291 --> 02:28:30.221
<v Speaker 1>they come into a room because that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire social environment both </v>

2898
02:28:30.221 --> 02:28:34.031
<v Speaker 1>truthful and welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your job is to make them </v>

2899
02:28:34.031 --> 02:28:38.020
<v Speaker 1>desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social beings and lot of that is </v>

2900
02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:38.020
<v Speaker 1>prohibition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2901
02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:41.570
<v Speaker 1>There's this ethical transformation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens to some degree in the,</v>

2902
02:28:41.571 --> 02:28:46.571
<v Speaker 1>in the tradition of the prophetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition where there is a spirit that </v>

2903
02:28:46.571 --> 02:28:48.110
<v Speaker 1>seems in some sense to rise above the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

2904
02:28:48.111 --> 02:28:53.111
<v Speaker 1>but there's a real transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the old testament and the new </v>

2905
02:28:53.111 --> 02:28:54.410
<v Speaker 1>testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Old Testament is prohibition and the</v>

2906
02:28:54.410 --> 02:28:55.280
<v Speaker 1>New Testament is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2907
02:28:55.281 --> 02:29:00.281
<v Speaker 1>here's the good things you do once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more than merely prohibiting </v>

2908
02:29:00.281 --> 02:29:02.660
<v Speaker 1>yourself from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from impulsive sin.</v>

2909
02:29:02.661 --> 02:29:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there's a positive good to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished while you might say,</v>

2910
02:29:07.251 --> 02:29:09.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the positive good is.</v>

2911
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2912
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:13.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is why this thing that I've said</v>

2913
02:29:13.761 --> 02:29:15.800
<v Speaker 1>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become this crazy Internet meme,</v>

2914
02:29:15.801 --> 02:29:20.801
<v Speaker 1>but that's to clean up your room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot better and more useful </v>

2915
02:29:20.811 --> 02:29:22.460
<v Speaker 1>than people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot harder to.</v>

2916
02:29:22.461 --> 02:29:24.680
<v Speaker 1>But the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you do,</v>

2917
02:29:24.681 --> 02:29:29.681
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I learned this in part from </v>

2918
02:29:29.681 --> 02:29:31.151
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn when he was trying to iron </v>
<v Speaker 1>out his soul when he was in the Gulag </v>

2919
02:29:31.151 --> 02:29:31.190
<v Speaker 1>because he was trying to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got there,</v>

2920
02:29:31.490 --> 02:29:34.250
<v Speaker 1>how he contributed to how we got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2921
02:29:34.251 --> 02:29:36.880
<v Speaker 1>not Stalin and Hitler even though they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were kind of to blame,</v>

2922
02:29:36.890 --> 02:29:41.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't much he could do about </v>

2923
02:29:41.890 --> 02:29:41.890
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you have to do,</v>

2924
02:29:41.890 --> 02:29:45.941
<v Speaker 1>and this is part of humility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you have to look around you within </v>

2925
02:29:45.941 --> 02:29:49.841
<v Speaker 1>your sphere of influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the direct sphere of influence and </v>

2926
02:29:49.841 --> 02:29:53.240
<v Speaker 1>fix the things that announced themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>as in need of repair.</v>

2927
02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:58.480
<v Speaker 1>And those are often small things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know and they can be like your room,</v>

2928
02:29:58.850 --> 02:30:03.850
<v Speaker 1>put it in order because the thing is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't exactly so important that your </v>

2929
02:30:03.850 --> 02:30:04.340
<v Speaker 1>room is in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it is.</v>

2930
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:09.670
<v Speaker 1>What's important is that you learn how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to distinguish between chaos and order </v>

2931
02:30:09.670 --> 02:30:12.140
<v Speaker 1>and to be able to act in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces order.</v>

2932
02:30:12.290 --> 02:30:17.290
<v Speaker 1>And in most households there's 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that could be done to just make </v>

2933
02:30:17.290 --> 02:30:21.311
<v Speaker 1>it less hideous and horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so practicing that is a real useful </v>

2934
02:30:21.531 --> 02:30:23.330
<v Speaker 1>form of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>

2935
02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:26.660
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a divine act because you're</v>

2936
02:30:26.661 --> 02:30:30.530
<v Speaker 1>taking chaos and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you pay attention even to a room,</v>

2937
02:30:30.531 --> 02:30:32.120
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I learned because I've,</v>

2938
02:30:32.170 --> 02:30:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I've renovated many places now and tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make them beautiful.</v>

2939
02:30:35.151 --> 02:30:40.151
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I've really </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned is that even if you own a </v>

2940
02:30:40.151 --> 02:30:43.541
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you investigated all the nooks </v>

2941
02:30:43.541 --> 02:30:47.231
<v Speaker 1>and crannies and cleaned them up and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own imprint on them and made them </v>

2942
02:30:47.231 --> 02:30:48.290
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not yours.</v>

2943
02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:51.530
<v Speaker 1>The mere fact of physical ownership </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make them yours.</v>

2944
02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:56.560
<v Speaker 1>You have to establish a dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the objects before </v>

2945
02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:58.580
<v Speaker 1>they're actually years and I think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2946
02:30:58.610 --> 02:31:01.460
<v Speaker 1>You can do something as simple as just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit on your bed and think,</v>

2947
02:31:01.461 --> 02:31:06.461
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably like five things I </v>

2948
02:31:06.461 --> 02:31:08.891
<v Speaker 1>could do today so that tomorrow morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>is slightly better than this morning was</v>

2949
02:31:08.931 --> 02:31:13.931
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least I'm not falling behind and </v>

2950
02:31:13.931 --> 02:31:14.270
<v Speaker 1>those will usually be like having needed</v>
<v Speaker 1>toad in the morning.</v>

2951
02:31:14.271 --> 02:31:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not going to be something</v>

2952
02:31:15.831 --> 02:31:20.831
<v Speaker 1>you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be things you're trying to </v>

2953
02:31:20.831 --> 02:31:20.831
<v Speaker 1>avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are snakes essentially,</v>

2954
02:31:20.831 --> 02:31:22.770
<v Speaker 1>but if you ask yourself like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking someone,</v>

2955
02:31:22.771 --> 02:31:26.040
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a form of prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ask yourself,</v>

2956
02:31:26.041 --> 02:31:27.570
<v Speaker 1>instead of telling yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2957
02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:32.840
<v Speaker 1>what is it that I could do to set things</v>
<v Speaker 1>more right today that I would actually </v>

2958
02:31:33.751 --> 02:31:34.530
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

2959
02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:37.140
<v Speaker 1>It's usually some small thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not disciplined,</v>

2960
02:31:37.141 --> 02:31:42.141
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can go do it and then you put </v>

2961
02:31:42.141 --> 02:31:45.270
<v Speaker 1>the world together a little more when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that and that spreads out,</v>

2962
02:31:45.690 --> 02:31:50.690
<v Speaker 1>but you also put your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also construct yourself into </v>

2963
02:31:50.690 --> 02:31:53.940
<v Speaker 1>something that's better able to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>order forth from chaos,</v>

2964
02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:59.120
<v Speaker 1>and that makes you just incrementally </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger and then the next day you can </v>

2965
02:31:59.251 --> 02:32:04.251
<v Speaker 1>maybe take on a slightly larger task and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you get the benefit of compound </v>

2966
02:32:04.251 --> 02:32:05.070
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

2967
02:32:05.071 --> 02:32:10.071
<v Speaker 1>it's a tremendously powerful technique </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think if you do that at some </v>

2968
02:32:10.071 --> 02:32:14.361
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of just having to fix things up </v>

2969
02:32:14.361 --> 02:32:17.870
<v Speaker 1>that are not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll start to get a glimmer of the </v>

2970
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:18.100
<v Speaker 1>positive things that you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2971
02:32:19.410 --> 02:32:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the positive things that you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would actually constitute a vision </v>

2972
02:32:24.410 --> 02:32:25.230
<v Speaker 1>and that that's what I would recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2973
02:32:27.170 --> 02:32:32.170
<v Speaker 3>Good night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
