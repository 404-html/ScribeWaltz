1
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>So I've been thinking this week about </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this one of them once a month on a</v>

2
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 1>continuing basis,</v>

3
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 2>so thank you.</v>

4
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>So I think if I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it will be here,</v>

5
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>although it's harder to rent this </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater during the academic year,</v>

6
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.540
<v Speaker 1>but if it isn't here it will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else and I'd like to continue </v>

7
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning a lot from doing it and,</v>

8
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once a month would really be good </v>

9
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 1>because then I could really do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background work and,</v>

10
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could probably do that for a </v>

11
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>couple of years because obviously this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going very quickly,</v>

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't go any faster than it can </v>

14
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>go and that's how it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it seems to me anyways.</v>

15
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>this has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been a very steep learning </v>

17
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>curve for me with regards to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories because I didn't understand them</v>

18
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:14.351
<v Speaker 1>very well and I've got better at using </v>
<v Speaker 1>the resources on line to help me do my </v>

19
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:19.601
<v Speaker 1>background investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of books and some of you </v>

20
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>may have noticed that I'm online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted a conversation I had with </v>

21
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan Otto and his and his brother </v>
<v Speaker 1>Matthew.</v>

22
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's matthew.</v>

23
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I re names escape me so badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe that's right.</v>

24
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>He just finished a book on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Bible and so I've been doing a </v>

25
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>lot of thinking and talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

26
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.910
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand what they're about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

27
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>and then there's all these commentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great site,</v>

28
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called Bible hub that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single verse of the Bible is </v>

29
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.791
<v Speaker 1>listed there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with each verse there are like </v>

30
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:58.160
<v Speaker 1>they've aggregated 10 commentaries from </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 10 commentaries from over the last</v>

31
00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>400 years.</v>

32
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 1>And so there's like a dense page on </v>
<v Speaker 1>every line and that's one of the things </v>

33
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book too,</v>

34
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:11.051
<v Speaker 1>is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's aggregated so much commentary that </v>

35
00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:11.051
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

36
00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it's much bigger than it looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book is much bigger than it looks.</v>

37
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And so it's been very interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become familiar with those two.</v>

38
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:21.821
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that this site is set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the commentary split up by </v>

39
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>versus means you can rapidly compare the</v>
<v Speaker 1>commentaries and get a sense of,</v>

40
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how people have interpreted this over </v>

41
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>while at least several hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course much longer than that </v>

42
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.731
<v Speaker 1>because of the people who wrote the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentaries were of course reading </v>

43
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 1>things that were older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's been very,</v>

44
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

45
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

46
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>so last week we talked about a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

47
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.370
<v Speaker 1>We talked about how you might understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a divine encounter.</v>

48
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>And then we also paralleled that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that God disappears in the Old </v>

49
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

50
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>he bows out as the stories progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be a,</v>

51
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>an emergent property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sequencing of the stories,</v>

52
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:05.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because all the books were written by </v>

53
00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:06.571
<v Speaker 1>independent people are different people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they were aggregated by other </v>

54
00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the narrative continuity,</v>

55
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>is it some kind of emergent property </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

56
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>that's a consequence of this interaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>between people,</v>

57
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.660
<v Speaker 1>readers and writers over centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's strange that given that there </v>

58
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>are also multiple coherent narratives </v>
<v Speaker 1>that united,</v>

59
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

60
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that easy to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

61
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>but it does at least seem to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

62
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.260
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the third thing we talked about was </v>

63
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>that as God bows out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

64
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

65
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual personality seems of the,</v>

66
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:42.121
<v Speaker 1>of the characters that are involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human characters that are involved </v>

67
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>seems to become more and more developed.</v>

68
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't exactly clear what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

69
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>what it means is that God steps away and</v>
<v Speaker 1>man steps forward.</v>

70
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why it's arranged like that or they </v>

71
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 1>or they say ultimate significance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is by no means clear.</v>

72
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Abraham,</v>

73
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>who we're going to concentrate on today </v>
<v Speaker 1>is quite a well developed character.</v>

74
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.160
<v Speaker 1>And I would say there are two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are multiple endings and </v>

75
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>beginnings in the biblical stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important ending,</v>

76
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the ending of the of the garden of </v>

77
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Paradise and and the the disenchantment </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world and the and the sending </v>

78
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>forth of Adam and eve into history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right into the future,</v>

79
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.440
<v Speaker 1>into a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a mode of being that has a future </v>

80
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 1>as part of it and that has history as </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it and that has the necessity of</v>

81
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and toil as part of it.</v>

82
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>That's obviously crucial and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

83
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>That is replayed with the story of Noah </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything is destroyed and then</v>

84
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:44.611
<v Speaker 1>the world is created a new and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices have to be made in order for </v>

85
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:48.241
<v Speaker 1>the world to begin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see the same thing happen </v>

86
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:48.241
<v Speaker 1>again after the Noah story and the Tower</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Babel.</v>

87
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Because history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we really understand history seems to</v>

88
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:56.551
<v Speaker 1>start with Abraham because the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Abraham sound like historical stories</v>

89
00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:01.921
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars debate about the historical </v>

90
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:01.921
<v Speaker 1>accuracy of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose there's.</v>

91
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.010
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of determining once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the degree to which you might </v>

92
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>regard the accounts as equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern empirical history.</v>

93
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:15.841
<v Speaker 1>But this is a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of the biblical stories,</v>

94
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.880
<v Speaker 1>not a historical interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it certainly does seem to be the </v>

95
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>case that from a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

96
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>we enter something like the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern conceptualization,</v>

97
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.580
<v Speaker 1>relatively modern conceptualization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>history with Abraham beyond the accounts</v>

98
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>of divine commands that Abraham carries </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

99
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>This is from Friedman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

100
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:38.431
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned in the last lecture who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote the disappearance of God in a </v>

101
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>variety of other books that are well </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth reading.</v>

102
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>The narrative also includes a variety of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in which Abraham acts on his own</v>

103
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He divides land with his nephew lot.</v>

104
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>He battles kings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he takes concubines,</v>

105
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>he argues with his wife Sarah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On two occasions he tells kings that </v>

106
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Sarah is his sister out of fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they will kill him to get his wife.</v>

107
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.200
<v Speaker 1>He arranges his son's marriage in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place of the single story of Noah's </v>

108
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.200
<v Speaker 1>drunkenness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

109
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>in the case of Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories of a man's life.</v>

110
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:08.291
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>struck by reading this in depth and </v>

111
00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:12.641
<v Speaker 1>reading the commentary is how much like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a story about a person it is,</v>

112
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham isn't a divine figure in,</v>

113
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>in any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any archetipal sense.</v>

114
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has architectural elements </v>

115
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>because he's also obviously the founder </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a nation.</v>

116
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>But fundamentally he's a human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

117
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.510
<v Speaker 1>and he makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has the adventures and he makes the </v>

118
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.510
<v Speaker 1>mistakes of a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

119
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>it's the mistake part that really struck</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

120
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:34.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>

121
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.550
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

122
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I was talking with a friend of mine this</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

123
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Norman Doidge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose a very remarkable person in many </v>

124
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>ways and he was taking me to task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was reading my book,</v>

125
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to publish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will be out in January.</v>

126
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.440
<v Speaker 1>And in the book are in one section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I contrasted the god of the Old </v>

127
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.491
<v Speaker 1>Testament with the god of the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament and made the case sort of </v>

128
00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:01.691
<v Speaker 1>based on North Road fries ideas that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>god of the Old Testament was really </v>

129
00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>harsh and judgmental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

130
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:06.160
<v Speaker 1>And that the god of the New Testament </v>
<v Speaker 1>was more merciful and you know,</v>

131
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sweetness and light.</v>

132
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.460
<v Speaker 1>And Norman took me to task about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that that was a,</v>

133
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>an overly christianized interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would make sense because I derived</v>

134
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:21.281
<v Speaker 1>it in part from northrop Frye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really have come to understand </v>

135
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:25.151
<v Speaker 1>that more that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's right because that he's right </v>

136
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:27.791
<v Speaker 1>about that because the god in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament is actually far more merciful </v>

137
00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 1>than he's generally made out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you really see this with a.</v>

138
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:35.051
<v Speaker 1>it's good news for fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you regard the representation of God </v>

139
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 1>as somehow key to the description of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being itself.</v>

140
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham makes a lot of mistakes,</v>

141
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious mistakes.</v>

142
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet he has a life and he's,</v>

143
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.880
<v Speaker 1>and he's blessed by God despite the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's pretty deeply flawed and </v>

144
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 1>engages in deceptive practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

145
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:54.461
<v Speaker 1>he's a good man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a perfect man by any </v>

146
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>stretch of the imagination and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things work out really well for him.</v>

147
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 1>And he's the founder of a nation and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

148
00:07:56.841 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's good news for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>because perfect people are very,</v>

149
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>very hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the,</v>

150
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

151
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.930
<v Speaker 1>the only pathway to having a rich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful life was through perfection,</v>

152
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:13.541
<v Speaker 1>then we would all be in deep trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's very satisfying to read </v>

153
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other,</v>

154
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I've been struck by</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

155
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham,</v>

156
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is actually absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>key to the interpretation of the story.</v>

157
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Abraham goes out and does things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

158
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:31.331
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed in my life is that nothing I've </v>

159
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 1>ever done was wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by done,</v>

160
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean put my heart and soul into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:38.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like attempted with,</v>

162
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.960
<v Speaker 1>with all of my effort that always </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked.</v>

163
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Now it didn't always work the way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected it to work.</v>

164
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the payoff from it was always </v>

165
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.200
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always something always something of </v>

166
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.121
<v Speaker 1>value always accrued to me when I made </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifices necessary to do </v>

167
00:08:56.121 --> 00:09:00.200
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think part of the message in </v>

168
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.561
<v Speaker 1>this story of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abrahamic stories is go do </v>

169
00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:03.561
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

170
00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:04.240
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

171
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about this in a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways outside of the interpretation of </v>

172
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 1>this story because I have this program </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you might be familiar with which</v>

173
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:16.731
<v Speaker 1>is called future authoring program and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's designed to help people make a plan</v>

174
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 1>for three to five years into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

175
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you answer some questions,</v>

176
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a writing program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You answered some questions about how </v>

177
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.600
<v Speaker 1>you would like your life to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would like your character to be</v>

178
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.020
<v Speaker 1>three to five years down the road if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were taking care of yourself.</v>

179
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you are taking care of someone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually cared about.</v>

180
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.870
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of have to split yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>into two people and treat yourself like </v>

181
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone you have respect for and </v>

182
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.571
<v Speaker 1>that you want the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For now it's not easy because people </v>

183
00:09:47.571 --> 00:09:50.061
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily have respect for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they don't necessarily </v>

184
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 1>want what's the best for themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have a lot of self contempt</v>

185
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of self hatred and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt and a lot of existential angst.</v>

186
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 1>And and a lot of self consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

187
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:02.640
<v Speaker 1>and so people don't necessarily take </v>
<v Speaker 1>care of themselves very well and I think</v>

188
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>

189
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I think you have an obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the highest moral </v>

190
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.691
<v Speaker 1>obligations to treat yourself as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a creature of value and that is </v>

191
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:16.731
<v Speaker 1>in some sense it's in some sense that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent of your actions and you </v>

192
00:10:16.731 --> 00:10:20.720
<v Speaker 1>might think about that metaphorically as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recognition of your divine worth in </v>

193
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 1>the biblical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of your,</v>

194
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.360
<v Speaker 1>of your sins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

195
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

196
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 1>that's powerful language as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

197
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:33.081
<v Speaker 1>Once you understand it anyways with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self authoring program in the future </v>

198
00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 1>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

199
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you ask you answer questions about what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

200
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.260
<v Speaker 1>how you would like your friendships to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be conducted because it's useful to </v>

201
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.591
<v Speaker 1>surround yourself with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to move forward and more </v>

202
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:48.501
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are happy when you move forward and </v>

203
00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 1>not happy when you move back backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not when you fall.</v>

204
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:54.441
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're doing self destructive </v>

205
00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:54.441
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends shouldn't be there to cheer</v>

206
00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 1>you on and because then they're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>not acting like friends.</v>

207
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I know it's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still happens all the time and </v>

209
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:03.080
<v Speaker 1>people allow it to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea.</v>

210
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>And now how would you like to sort your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family out,</v>

211
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.630
<v Speaker 1>and I was thinking about this this week </v>
<v Speaker 1>too because I was thinking about Noah's </v>

212
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Ark and there was a phrase in that story</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't understand,</v>

213
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 1>which was that noah was perfect in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

214
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means and you </v>

215
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.551
<v Speaker 1>know when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're going through a book like </v>

216
00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:24.891
<v Speaker 1>the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand a phrase that </v>

217
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:25.080
<v Speaker 1>actually means you've missed something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that that's just not.</v>

218
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not Germane to the story.</v>

219
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It means you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get it,</v>

220
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:30.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get it.</v>

221
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:35.181
<v Speaker 1>You didn't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that Noah was perfect in</v>

222
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:40.611
<v Speaker 1>his generations and that's why he could </v>
<v Speaker 1>build an arc that would sustain him and </v>

223
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:43.350
<v Speaker 1>him and and humanity itself through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flood.</v>

224
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.990
<v Speaker 1>It meant that he not only did he walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>with God,</v>

225
00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:50.991
<v Speaker 1>which is something that we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the context of the sermon on the </v>

226
00:11:50.991 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>mount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the established proper relationships</v>

227
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.250
<v Speaker 1>with his family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his children.</v>

228
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.500
<v Speaker 1>And so what that meant was that his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only was he well integrated as a </v>

229
00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his level of integration had reached</v>

230
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 1>the point where it's stretched out </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond him and encompassed his family.</v>

231
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>And so it was noah and the family that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in the arc.</v>

232
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:11.011
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really understood this this year </v>

233
00:12:11.011 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>because I had a very tumultuous year or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it from a personal</v>

234
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:17.371
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could think about it as a year that </v>

235
00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:17.371
<v Speaker 1>had no shortage of floods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And My.</v>

236
00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that I was able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get through it.</v>

237
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>I also had terrible health problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons I was able to get</v>

238
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:27.670
<v Speaker 1>through it was because my family really </v>
<v Speaker 1>came together around me,</v>

239
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 1>my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>

240
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:33.601
<v Speaker 1>my parents and my friends as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and particularly a certain group of </v>

241
00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 1>friends and that's partly all of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>came together in my mind this week and I</v>

242
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

243
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:44.701
<v Speaker 1>that's what it means to be perfect in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his generations meant that he hadn't </v>

244
00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:48.691
<v Speaker 1>just straightened himself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd also straightened out his </v>

245
00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 1>relationships with his family and I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you that when crisis strikes you,</v>

246
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.160
<v Speaker 1>which it will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will.</v>

247
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.510
<v Speaker 1>The flood will come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

248
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 1>That's why the apocalypse has always </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon us.</v>

249
00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:02.461
<v Speaker 1>The flood will definitely come into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and to the degree that you've </v>

250
00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:06.060
<v Speaker 1>organized yourself psychologically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also healed the relationships between </v>

251
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.441
<v Speaker 1>you and your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be the critical element that </v>

252
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:13.910
<v Speaker 1>determines whether you live or die when </v>
<v Speaker 1>a crisis comes or or whether it's </v>

253
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.070
<v Speaker 1>someone in your family lives or dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea of the arc containing </v>

254
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.241
<v Speaker 1>the man who's who walks with God and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose generations are perfect and that </v>

255
00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Speaker 1>that's what sustains humanity through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crisis.</v>

256
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like you couldn't be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically accurate than that.</v>

257
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I was thinking about </v>

258
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.840
<v Speaker 1>this week I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about another line in the</v>

259
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.960
<v Speaker 1>new testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's from the sermon on the </v>

260
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:36.960
<v Speaker 1>mount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not absolutely sure.</v>

261
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Christ compares the Kingdom of Heaven to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mustard seed and so I was thinking </v>

262
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:47.011
<v Speaker 1>about a mustard seed is a very tiny seed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it grows into quite a spectacular </v>

263
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:50.731
<v Speaker 1>complex plant and I was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you should operate in the world in </v>

264
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:56.371
<v Speaker 1>order to make it a better place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that that's what you should be </v>

265
00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:59.491
<v Speaker 1>doing and that is what you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and there there's lots in the </v>

266
00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:03.601
<v Speaker 1>world to fix everything that bothers you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the world and about yourself </v>

267
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:05.230
<v Speaker 1>should be fixed and you can do that.</v>

268
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 1>And my dawning realization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>

269
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>he lives in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is James.</v>

270
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Simon is a great painter and he's taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a lot of things,</v>

271
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:20.311
<v Speaker 1>helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's helped me design my house and </v>

272
00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:22.111
<v Speaker 1>beautify it and I bought some paintings </v>
<v Speaker 1>from him a couple of years ago and he </v>

273
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:27.811
<v Speaker 1>did this series of paintings where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>went around North America and stood in </v>

274
00:14:27.811 --> 00:14:31.951
<v Speaker 1>different places and then he painted the</v>
<v Speaker 1>view from here down and so it's his feet</v>

275
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:35.860
<v Speaker 1>planted in different places on roads in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the desert,</v>

276
00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:40.861
<v Speaker 1>on the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one actually hanging over my </v>

277
00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:40.861
<v Speaker 1>toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is him standing at a urinal.</v>

278
00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

279
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:47.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to make a point and the </v>

280
00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:49.291
<v Speaker 1>point was that wherever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth paying attention and that's </v>

281
00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:50.680
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all these places that he visited,</v>

282
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 1>he looked exactly</v>

283
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.340
<v Speaker 3>where he was standing by the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road in the desert side of mundane in </v>

284
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 3>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then maybe he put 40 hours into that</v>

285
00:14:59.211 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 3>painting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

286
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 3>when it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very realistic painting with really good</v>

287
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:07.391
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what he's telling you as a painter </v>

288
00:15:07.391 --> 00:15:08.810
<v Speaker 3>is everything is worth paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>to an infinite amount,</v>

289
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have enough time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the artists does that for you.</v>

290
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The artist looks and locks and locks and</v>

291
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:18.791
<v Speaker 3>locks and locks and then gives you that </v>
<v Speaker 3>vision and so then you can look at the </v>

292
00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:22.241
<v Speaker 3>painting and it reminds you that right </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you are is there's every </v>

293
00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:26.771
<v Speaker 3>everything that there is is right where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are and that's a hard thing to </v>

294
00:15:26.771 --> 00:15:26.771
<v Speaker 3>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually true.</v>

295
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:32.110
<v Speaker 3>And so I've been telling people online </v>
<v Speaker 3>in various ways and the lectures that </v>

296
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 3>they should start fixing up the world by</v>
<v Speaker 3>cleaning up the room.</v>

297
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.480
<v Speaker 3>And I wanted to just elaborate on that a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit before I get back to the </v>

298
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.751
<v Speaker 3>lecture itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'd say it's become this Internet </v>

299
00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:45.020
<v Speaker 3>weird Internet meme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

300
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

301
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a joke and good.</v>

302
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:54.731
<v Speaker 3>It's a jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really happy about the fact that so </v>

303
00:15:54.731 --> 00:15:57.581
<v Speaker 3>much of this has got the leaving of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humor and it's really important because </v>

304
00:15:57.581 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 3>that's what stops things from </v>
<v Speaker 3>degenerating into,</v>

305
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.390
<v Speaker 3>into conflict humor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking about this idea of </v>

306
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.990
<v Speaker 3>cleaning up your room in relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mustard seed idea.</v>

307
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:08.570
<v Speaker 3>And you see the thing about cleaning up </v>
<v Speaker 3>your room.</v>

308
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.780
<v Speaker 3>This is also something I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carl young and his studies on alchemy </v>

309
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.830
<v Speaker 3>because for young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the alchemist was attempting to </v>

310
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.521
<v Speaker 3>make the philosopher's stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was not only engaged in the </v>

311
00:16:21.521 --> 00:16:24.071
<v Speaker 3>transformation of the material world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was engaged in a process of self </v>

312
00:16:24.071 --> 00:16:27.491
<v Speaker 3>transformation that occurred at the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>time as the as the chemical trap,</v>

313
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.800
<v Speaker 3>as the chemical transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was a psychological work in some </v>

314
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:32.800
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

315
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you want to sort out your room</v>
<v Speaker 3>and beautified because the beauty is </v>

316
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.911
<v Speaker 3>also important and let's say that all </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have is just a little room like </v>

317
00:16:39.911 --> 00:16:43.151
<v Speaker 3>you're not rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're poor and you don't have any </v>

318
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:43.151
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing,</v>

319
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Speaker 3>but you've got your damn room and you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>got this space right in front of you.</v>

320
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:50.321
<v Speaker 3>You know that that's a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmos that you can come to grips with </v>

321
00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 3>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

322
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 3>what's there in front of you right in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of you?</v>

323
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.950
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is it depends on </v>
<v Speaker 3>how open your eyes are.</v>

324
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.690
<v Speaker 3>That's the proper answer because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could say,</v>

325
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.270
<v Speaker 3>w William Blake said this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

326
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.520
<v Speaker 3>eldest Huxley made comments that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar that in a transcendent </v>

327
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.031
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see infinity in the finite and </v>

328
00:17:10.031 --> 00:17:10.031
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

329
00:17:10.031 --> 00:17:13.301
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can see infinity in what you </v>

330
00:17:13.301 --> 00:17:13.301
<v Speaker 3>have within your grasp.</v>

331
00:17:13.301 --> 00:17:15.110
<v Speaker 3>If you look and you could save,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's the case with your room,</v>

332
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.350
<v Speaker 3>and so you want to clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

333
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you do that?</v>

334
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

335
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:26.291
<v Speaker 3>a room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his room is a place to sleep and so if </v>

336
00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:29.711
<v Speaker 3>you set your room up properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you figure out how to sleep and </v>

337
00:17:29.711 --> 00:17:29.711
<v Speaker 3>when you should sleep and how you should</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep,</v>

338
00:17:29.711 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 3>and then you figure out when you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up and then you figure out,</v>

339
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what clothes you should wear because </v>

340
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:37.420
<v Speaker 3>they have to be arranged properly in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your dresser,</v>

341
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.721
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to have some place to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put your clothes and you're going to </v>

342
00:17:40.721 --> 00:17:40.721
<v Speaker 3>have some clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to figure out what you're going</v>

343
00:17:40.721 --> 00:17:41.960
<v Speaker 3>to wear those clothes to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

344
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:47.050
<v Speaker 3>And then that means you have to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out what you're going to do and then </v>

345
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.721
<v Speaker 3>your room has to serve that purpose </v>
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise it isn't set up </v>

346
00:17:49.721 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 3>properly and if it doesn't set up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it doesn't serve your purposes,</v>

347
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.590
<v Speaker 3>you will be unhappy and not happy in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>room because the way that we perceive </v>

348
00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.710
<v Speaker 3>the world is as a place to move from </v>
<v Speaker 3>point a to point B in,</v>

349
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.060
<v Speaker 3>and then if the place that we're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>facilitates that movement,</v>

350
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:07.290
<v Speaker 3>then we're happy to be there.</v>

351
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.370
<v Speaker 3>And if the place that we're in serves as</v>
<v Speaker 3>an obstacle to that movement,</v>

352
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 3>then we're unhappy to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what it means to set up your room</v>

353
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 3>is that you have to have somewhere to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's worthwhile.</v>

354
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:23.241
<v Speaker 3>Or you can set up your room and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>room has to be set up to facilitate </v>

355
00:18:23.241 --> 00:18:23.700
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next thing is,</v>

356
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:25.500
<v Speaker 3>well maybe you have to make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>

357
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.790
<v Speaker 3>but that's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

358
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:31.791
<v Speaker 3>That means you have to have some taste </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that doesn't mean you have to have </v>

359
00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:34.881
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't because you can be garish </v>

360
00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 3>with money and you can be tasteful with </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

361
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.660
<v Speaker 3>All you need is taste and taste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beats money when it comes to beautifying</v>

362
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:42.480
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that money is trivial because it's not.</v>

363
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:47.481
<v Speaker 3>The taste is crucial and people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very artistically oriented can make </v>

364
00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:49.860
<v Speaker 3>beautiful things out of virtually </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing and not only that,</v>

365
00:18:49.861 --> 00:18:53.010
<v Speaker 3>the literature suggests that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to make beautiful things,</v>

366
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 3>putting real constraints on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on what you allow yourself to do,</v>

367
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.490
<v Speaker 3>facilitates creativity instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interfering with it.</v>

368
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 3>Because let's say you have to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>something out of nothing,</v>

369
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.100
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,</v>

370
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:10.101
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to make something out of </v>

371
00:19:10.101 --> 00:19:11.961
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be creative in order to do </v>

372
00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:14.301
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then to beautify your room means </v>

373
00:19:14.301 --> 00:19:18.201
<v Speaker 3>that you also have to develop your </v>
<v Speaker 3>capacity to be creative and so then you </v>

374
00:19:18.201 --> 00:19:21.621
<v Speaker 3>can make your room shine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then what will happen is that if </v>

375
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 3>your family isn't together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will interfere with that.</v>

376
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:29.290
<v Speaker 3>You will interfere with that because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>won't have the discipline to do it </v>

377
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:29.670
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when you start building this,</v>

378
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.270
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little microcosm of perfection with</v>

379
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:38.271
<v Speaker 3>what you have at hand and it'll evoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the pathologies of everyone in your </v>

380
00:19:38.271 --> 00:19:39.390
<v Speaker 3>household.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wonder what the hell you're up to in</v>

381
00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:42.720
<v Speaker 3>there and they won't necessarily be </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy because if you're.</v>

382
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.940
<v Speaker 3>If they're in a lowly place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

383
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:49.140
<v Speaker 3>and so are you and you're trying to move</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of that than the higher you move out</v>

384
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:54.141
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more the place they're in looks bad </v>

385
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:54.141
<v Speaker 3>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

386
00:19:54.141 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 3>what they should do is celebrate your </v>
<v Speaker 3>victory over chaos and evil,</v>

387
00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:57.510
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't what will happen.</v>

388
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.720
<v Speaker 3>What will happen instead is that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>will attempt to pull you back down.</v>

389
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:06.050
<v Speaker 3>They'll attempt to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and obviously all families don't do </v>

390
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:06.050
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

391
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.160
<v Speaker 3>but all families do that to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some families do almost nothing but </v>

392
00:20:10.201 --> 00:20:12.480
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is that if you're</v>

393
00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:17.481
<v Speaker 3>going to organize your room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to have to confront </v>

394
00:20:17.481 --> 00:20:18.570
<v Speaker 3>the devils in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's often.</v>

395
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.800
<v Speaker 3>That's often a terrifying thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of those devils have have lineages </v>

396
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.450
<v Speaker 3>that go back many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

397
00:20:24.451 --> 00:20:29.451
<v Speaker 3>many generations and God only knows what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to struggle with in order to </v>

398
00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:33.351
<v Speaker 3>overcome that and so and so to sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself out into fix up your room is a </v>

399
00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 3>nontrivial matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

400
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:41.180
<v Speaker 3>and you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll learn by doing that and then </v>

401
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.931
<v Speaker 3>maybe you'll learn enough by doing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that you can fix up your family a </v>

402
00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:47.991
<v Speaker 3>little bit and then having done that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have enough character so that </v>

403
00:20:47.991 --> 00:20:51.740
<v Speaker 3>when you to operate in the world at your</v>
<v Speaker 3>job or maybe in the broader social </v>

404
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.921
<v Speaker 3>spheres,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you will be a force for good </v>

405
00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 3>instead of harm because you'll have </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned some humility by noting just how</v>

406
00:20:57.011 --> 00:21:02.011
<v Speaker 3>difficult it was to put your damn room </v>
<v Speaker 3>together well and yourself for that </v>

407
00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:02.011
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

408
00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:06.420
<v Speaker 3>And so you'll proceed cautiously with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your eyes open towards the good and so </v>

409
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are some of the things I've been </v>

410
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 3>thinking about this week and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germane,</v>

411
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Germane to what we're going to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight.</v>

412
00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:19.891
<v Speaker 3>Because what happens at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the abrahamic stories is basically God </v>

413
00:21:19.891 --> 00:21:23.860
<v Speaker 3>comes to Abraham and just says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go get going,</v>

414
00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do something,</v>

415
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 3>do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get going.</v>

416
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.730
<v Speaker 3>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

417
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:29.950
<v Speaker 3>where should I go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And God,</v>

418
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.980
<v Speaker 3>God is somewhat vague about that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he sends Abraham.</v>

419
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:36.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a real fixer upper man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's starvation narrow,</v>

420
00:21:36.241 --> 00:21:39.730
<v Speaker 3>and there's tyranny and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's marital dissolution.</v>

421
00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:43.180
<v Speaker 3>And there's deceit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just like where you live,</v>

422
00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:44.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same thing.</v>

423
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.610
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

424
00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.680
<v Speaker 3>it's tyranny and catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's great.</v>

425
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.800
<v Speaker 3>The tyrannical great father because </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Abraham ends up having to </v>

426
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.010
<v Speaker 3>sojourn in Egypt and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

427
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:56.880
<v Speaker 3>there's a feminine.</v>

428
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.890
<v Speaker 3>So Mother Nature is on the rampage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham lies about,</v>

429
00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 3>his wife has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see.</v>

430
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 3>And so it's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the world.</v>

431
00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:06.160
<v Speaker 3>It's tyranny and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and vulnerability and deceit.</v>

432
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.760
<v Speaker 3>And yet God says goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you do go,</v>

433
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.060
<v Speaker 3>then you'll become a father of nations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

434
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

435
00:22:14.111 --> 00:22:19.111
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty good news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it's strange because you'd </v>

436
00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:21.511
<v Speaker 3>expect that if God chose Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then he'd send them immediately to the </v>

437
00:22:21.511 --> 00:22:22.420
<v Speaker 3>land of honey land of milk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And honey,</v>

438
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:27.421
<v Speaker 3>and that isn't what happens at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen at all and Abraham </v>

439
00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:31.021
<v Speaker 3>never gets there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his mission is still regarded as </v>

440
00:22:31.021 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 3>divine and thank God for that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what your mission will be because</v>

441
00:22:34.001 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 3>that's what you will encounter in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

442
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.620
<v Speaker 3>Those are the arc archetipal things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone encounters the tyranny of the </v>

443
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.131
<v Speaker 3>social structure and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rapaciousness of nature and the </v>

444
00:22:44.131 --> 00:22:48.091
<v Speaker 3>deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deceitful quality of the human </v>

445
00:22:48.091 --> 00:22:48.091
<v Speaker 3>psyche.</v>

446
00:22:48.091 --> 00:22:48.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

447
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a negative view in some sense,</v>

448
00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:56.041
<v Speaker 3>but it's positive in the story because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it basically says is something </v>

449
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:59.110
<v Speaker 3>that's akin to the sermon on the mount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that if you're aligned with God</v>

450
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.590
<v Speaker 3>and you pay attention to the divine </v>
<v Speaker 3>injunction,</v>

451
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.950
<v Speaker 3>then you can operate in the midst of </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos and tyranny and deception and </v>

452
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:12.481
<v Speaker 3>flourish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could hardly hope to have a </v>

453
00:23:12.481 --> 00:23:13.540
<v Speaker 3>better piece of news than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Given that that's exactly where you are.</v>

454
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.860
<v Speaker 3>So and I didn't see any of that neighbor</v>
<v Speaker 3>having stories to begin with,</v>

455
00:23:17.861 --> 00:23:21.310
<v Speaker 3>so that's been very interesting to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of reveal itself.</v>

456
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:28.340
<v Speaker 3>Abraham section nus develops the </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality and character of man to </v>

457
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 3>integrate new degree in biblical </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative.</v>

458
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.640
<v Speaker 3>Well picturing him in a new degree of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility in him,</v>

459
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:40.650
<v Speaker 3>a new degree of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's the other thing that's really </v>

460
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.381
<v Speaker 3>struck me and I think this is absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>crucial importance and I don't know how </v>

461
00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:45.100
<v Speaker 3>much importance but it's certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>important to me.</v>

462
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.040
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that has just blown me</v>
<v Speaker 3>away in the last year because I've </v>

463
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.430
<v Speaker 3>talked to lots of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of people live,</v>

464
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also lots of people online but it's </v>

465
00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 3>more obvious live and it's obvious in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this theater as well as I've.</v>

466
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I've gone around and spoken and a large </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportion of my audience has been young</v>

467
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:05.490
<v Speaker 3>man young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

468
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.580
<v Speaker 3>under 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

469
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.720
<v Speaker 3>And I've spoken to them a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

470
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.230
<v Speaker 3>And what's so odd about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this is that of all the things </v>

471
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.370
<v Speaker 3>that I've spoken about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I can see the audience and I can</v>

472
00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:24.371
<v Speaker 3>feel how the audience is reacting </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm always paying attention to </v>

473
00:24:24.371 --> 00:24:24.590
<v Speaker 3>all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in so far as I can manage that.</v>

474
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:25.310
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

475
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:29.510
<v Speaker 3>I get some sense of how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying is landing,</v>

476
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:34.511
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you have to do if you're going to </v>

477
00:24:34.511 --> 00:24:36.191
<v Speaker 3>speak effectively to people and what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens is if I talk about </v>

478
00:24:36.191 --> 00:24:40.151
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone b is silent just like they are </v>

479
00:24:40.151 --> 00:24:42.020
<v Speaker 3>now silent and not moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

480
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.820
<v Speaker 3>Focusing attentive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say pick up your responsibility,</v>

481
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:51.821
<v Speaker 3>pick up the heaviest thing you can and </v>
<v Speaker 3>carry it and the room goes quiet and </v>

482
00:24:51.821 --> 00:24:55.751
<v Speaker 3>everybody's eyes open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that always makes somebody </v>

483
00:24:55.751 --> 00:24:55.751
<v Speaker 3>break up.</v>

484
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

485
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I was speaking to an </v>
<v Speaker 3>English journalist today who's going to </v>

486
00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.380
<v Speaker 3>write an article in spectator magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about this and at the same</v>

487
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.950
<v Speaker 3>point in the discussion the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the same emotional reaction.</v>

488
00:25:18.951 --> 00:25:21.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't really understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

489
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about it that's so </v>

490
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.721
<v Speaker 3>crucial because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been fed this unending diet of </v>

491
00:25:28.721 --> 00:25:30.800
<v Speaker 3>rights and freedoms and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about that especially.</v>

492
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:36.310
<v Speaker 3>There's something about that that so </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathologically wrong and people are </v>

493
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.731
<v Speaker 3>starving for the antidote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the antidote is truth and </v>

494
00:25:39.731 --> 00:25:39.860
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

495
00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:41.240
<v Speaker 3>And it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it isn't.</v>

496
00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what you should do in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

497
00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some,</v>

498
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.940
<v Speaker 3>some I know better or someone knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>better for you,</v>

499
00:25:49.941 --> 00:25:51.740
<v Speaker 3>what you should do sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that.</v>

500
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.930
<v Speaker 3>It's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that.</v>

501
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.270
<v Speaker 3>It's that that's the secret to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful life and without a meaningful</v>

502
00:25:56.271 --> 00:26:01.271
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all you have is suffering and </v>

503
00:26:01.271 --> 00:26:03.610
<v Speaker 3>nihilism and despair and all of that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>self contempt and and that's not good </v>

504
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:08.311
<v Speaker 3>and so the man hits necessary for men to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up and take responsibility and </v>

505
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.560
<v Speaker 3>they all know that and and are starving </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that message and the message is more</v>

506
00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.360
<v Speaker 3>that that's also a good thing to stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and take responsibility because </v>

507
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:20.360
<v Speaker 3>you're cursed so much.</v>

508
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 3>Now from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

509
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.530
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from when you're young with this notion </v>

510
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.931
<v Speaker 3>that your active engagement with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world is part of what is destroying and </v>

511
00:26:28.931 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 3>undermining the planet and adding to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tyranny of the social systems.</v>

512
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about not so much that,</v>

513
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:35.310
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

514
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.460
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to soul deadening.</v>

515
00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:41.530
<v Speaker 3>It's andy human right to the core and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense instead is that you know,</v>

516
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were able to reveal</v>

517
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 4>the best of yourself to you in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

518
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:51.591
<v Speaker 4>that you would be an overwhelming force </v>
<v Speaker 4>for good and that whatever errors might </v>

519
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 4>be made along the way would wash out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the works,</v>

520
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:58.320
<v Speaker 4>and that's the other thing that you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the abrahamic stories because Abraham</v>

521
00:26:58.321 --> 00:27:01.530
<v Speaker 4>is not a perfect person by any stretch </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the imagination.</v>

522
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 4>He's a real person and he makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>mistakes,</v>

523
00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:06.510
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The overarching narrative is,</v>

524
00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maintain your covenant with God,</v>

525
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 4>and despite your inadequacies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then not only will you prevail,</v>

526
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 4>but your descendants will prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

527
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:18.840
<v Speaker 4>That's really good news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

528
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 4>so it's been really something to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in the,</v>

529
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.470
<v Speaker 4>in the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that.</v>

530
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:29.130
<v Speaker 4>So that's responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that Abraham is kinder,</v>

531
00:27:29.131 --> 00:27:34.131
<v Speaker 4>gentler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more intrepid ethical or a better </v>

532
00:27:34.131 --> 00:27:34.131
<v Speaker 4>debater than his ancestor noah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rather.</v>

533
00:27:34.131 --> 00:27:36.660
<v Speaker 4>Both the Noah and Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories or pieces of a development of an</v>

534
00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:41.661
<v Speaker 4>increasingly stronger stance of humans </v>
<v Speaker 4>relative to the daddy before the story </v>

535
00:27:41.661 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 4>is over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humans will become a good deal,</v>

536
00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:48.321
<v Speaker 4>stronger and bolder than Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's really something to say </v>

537
00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:48.321
<v Speaker 4>because Abraham is pretty bold.</v>

538
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.640
<v Speaker 4>So we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's read the stories.</v>

539
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.880
<v Speaker 4>The first one is about Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarah,</v>

540
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:56.820
<v Speaker 4>and lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now these are the generations of Tara.</v>

541
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.470
<v Speaker 4>Tara begat a Ram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so his name is Abraham to begin with,</v>

542
00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:02.160
<v Speaker 4>and that actually turns out to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>

543
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:03.840
<v Speaker 4>It's not Abraham knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Horton,</v>

544
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 4>inherent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inherent begat lot.</v>

545
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:11.180
<v Speaker 4>So heroin is Abrams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brother and heroin died before his </v>

546
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.601
<v Speaker 4>father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terah in the land of his Nativity in Er </v>

547
00:28:14.601 --> 00:28:15.780
<v Speaker 4>of the chaldees and Abraham and nay </v>
<v Speaker 4>whore took them wives.</v>

548
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.760
<v Speaker 4>The name of Abram's wife was Sarah and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the name of [inaudible] wife Milka,</v>

549
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.820
<v Speaker 4>the daughter of heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the father of Milkah and the father of </v>

550
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 4>Isca,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Sarah was barren.</v>

551
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:31.190
<v Speaker 4>She had no child and Terah took Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his son and lot the son of heroin,</v>

552
00:28:31.561 --> 00:28:34.920
<v Speaker 4>his son's son and daughter in law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his son,</v>

553
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:39.921
<v Speaker 4>Abram's wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they went forth with them from the </v>

554
00:28:39.921 --> 00:28:41.931
<v Speaker 4>earth cellies from Irv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Chaldees to go into the land of </v>

555
00:28:41.931 --> 00:28:41.931
<v Speaker 4>Canaan.</v>

556
00:28:41.931 --> 00:28:45.560
<v Speaker 4>That's exile and they came into heroin </v>
<v Speaker 4>and dwelt there and the days of Terah </v>

557
00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.100
<v Speaker 4>were 205 years and Terah died inherent </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a reason that Sarah is,</v>

558
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 4>is introduced as barren and to set the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>

559
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:57.780
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Anton Chekov who when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was talking about this stage setting for</v>

560
00:28:57.781 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 4>a play,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if there was a rifle hanging on the</v>

561
00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 4>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it had better been used before.</v>

562
00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:05.010
<v Speaker 4>I believe the second act or it shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>be hanging there at all.</v>

563
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this is stage setting and part of</v>

564
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:12.600
<v Speaker 4>the reason that the biblical writers are</v>
<v Speaker 4>pointing out that Abram's wife is barren</v>

565
00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:15.000
<v Speaker 4>is because it's a real catastrophe for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham,</v>

566
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 4>for Sarah as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she's barren.</v>

567
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.120
<v Speaker 4>And so it's showing the trouble that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham was in at the beginning of the </v>

568
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:23.970
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's also.</v>

569
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.420
<v Speaker 4>It's also see what happens as the story </v>
<v Speaker 4>progresses is that Abraham,</v>

570
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.310
<v Speaker 4>Abraham and Sarah are eventually granted</v>
<v Speaker 4>his son,</v>

571
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.110
<v Speaker 4>but it's way late in the story and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very,</v>

572
00:29:34.111 --> 00:29:39.111
<v Speaker 4>very old by the time it happens and of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course you're not going to be a father </v>

573
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:41.740
<v Speaker 4>of nations without having a child,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the the,</v>

574
00:29:41.741 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 4>the writers</v>

575
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.220
<v Speaker 3>who are attempting to make the case that</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you forthrightly pursue that which </v>

576
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 3>God directs you to pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that all things are possible.</v>

577
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:58.030
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea and the narrative and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say that's naive and you know </v>

578
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.810
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not it.</v>

579
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 3>You think when you're naive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

580
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.220
<v Speaker 3>and then you dispense with that idea and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then when you stop being the sort of </v>

581
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.721
<v Speaker 3>person who dispenses with ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you come to another place and </v>

582
00:30:12.721 --> 00:30:16.411
<v Speaker 3>that's the place where you think you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have no idea what might be possible for </v>

583
00:30:16.411 --> 00:30:16.450
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

584
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.240
<v Speaker 3>if you've got things together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pursued what you should pursue,</v>

585
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 3>you don't know how much what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible to you right now would become</v>

586
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:28.771
<v Speaker 3>possible under those conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an unknown phenomena and like I've </v>

587
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:33.961
<v Speaker 3>watched people who've put themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>together across time incrementally and </v>

588
00:30:33.961 --> 00:30:36.790
<v Speaker 3>continually and they become capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are jaw,</v>

589
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.710
<v Speaker 3>not only jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>droppingly amazing,</v>

590
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:43.690
<v Speaker 3>but also sometimes metaphysically </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossible to understand and so we don't</v>

591
00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:45.880
<v Speaker 3>know the limits of human endeavor.</v>

592
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.910
<v Speaker 3>We truly don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it it's premature to put a cap on </v>

593
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:52.330
<v Speaker 3>what it is that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

594
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.960
<v Speaker 3>what it is that we're capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you,</v>

595
00:30:54.961 --> 00:30:59.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're already something and maybe </v>

596
00:30:59.961 --> 00:30:59.961
<v Speaker 3>you're not so bad in your current </v>
<v Speaker 3>configuration,</v>

597
00:30:59.961 --> 00:31:04.080
<v Speaker 3>but you may wonder if you did nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the next 30 years except put </v>

598
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.221
<v Speaker 3>yourself together just exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>would you be able to do and you might </v>

599
00:31:08.221 --> 00:31:08.221
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

600
00:31:08.221 --> 00:31:09.850
<v Speaker 3>that's worth finding out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course that's,</v>

601
00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.510
<v Speaker 3>that's the adoption of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one thing I've also learned over the</v>

602
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:18.510
<v Speaker 3>years because I've been curious about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this battle between meaning and </v>

603
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:18.510
<v Speaker 3>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

604
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.071
<v Speaker 3>and I mean I could see for a long while </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rationale in nihilism and the power </v>

605
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 3>of the nihilistic argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

606
00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:26.780
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

607
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 3>it occurred to me across time that </v>
<v Speaker 3>despite that the power of the nihilistic</v>

608
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:34.300
<v Speaker 3>argument is more powerful than naive </v>
<v Speaker 3>optimism,</v>

609
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.480
<v Speaker 3>but it's not more powerful than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>optimism that is not naive because the </v>

610
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:45.811
<v Speaker 3>optimism that is not naive says it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>self evident that the world is a place </v>

611
00:31:45.811 --> 00:31:50.161
<v Speaker 3>of suffering and that there are things </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be done about that and it's self </v>

612
00:31:50.161 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 3>evident that people are flawed and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's things to be done about that.</v>

613
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.900
<v Speaker 3>And then the non naive optimist says the</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering could be reduced and the </v>

614
00:31:59.831 --> 00:32:04.831
<v Speaker 3>insufficient c could be overcome if </v>
<v Speaker 3>people oriented themselves properly and </v>

615
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:09.841
<v Speaker 3>did what they were capable of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do not believe that that's </v>

616
00:32:09.841 --> 00:32:10.050
<v Speaker 3>deniable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

617
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:15.090
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that human potential is </v>

618
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:15.190
<v Speaker 3>virtually limitless and that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

619
00:32:15.191 --> 00:32:19.240
<v Speaker 3>perhaps it's beyond our grasp before </v>
<v Speaker 3>careful as individuals and as a society.</v>

620
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.480
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that there's no reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>for nihilism and there's no reason for </v>

621
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.890
<v Speaker 3>hopelessness and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's no reason to bow down before</v>

622
00:32:26.891 --> 00:32:29.920
<v Speaker 3>evil because we're capable of so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

623
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:35.340
<v Speaker 3>And I think that you can easily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that first because you're not </v>

624
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.940
<v Speaker 3>happy with who you are and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>ashamed and embarrassed about it as you </v>

625
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.181
<v Speaker 3>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know it because if look out </v>

626
00:32:42.181 --> 00:32:44.531
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see people who are capable of doing </v>

627
00:32:44.531 --> 00:32:46.481
<v Speaker 3>great things and you know that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving it our all and still we're not </v>

628
00:32:46.481 --> 00:32:46.920
<v Speaker 3>doing so badly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

629
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.300
<v Speaker 3>And so you might wonder if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

630
00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:54.510
<v Speaker 3>if we devoted 90 percent of our effort </v>
<v Speaker 3>to putting things right instead of 55 </v>

631
00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.900
<v Speaker 3>percent of our effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe even less than that,</v>

632
00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.080
<v Speaker 3>you might wonder just how well could </v>
<v Speaker 3>things be put together.</v>

633
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.530
<v Speaker 3>And I think that you can figure that out</v>
<v Speaker 3>by starting with your room,</v>

634
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

635
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.890
<v Speaker 3>And the Lord said unto Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the,</v>

636
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 3>this is the opening of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get thee out of thy country and from thy</v>

637
00:33:14.811 --> 00:33:19.250
<v Speaker 3>kindred and from thy Father's House unto</v>
<v Speaker 3>a land that I will show the.</v>

638
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:24.020
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of those phrases where </v>
<v Speaker 3>every clause is significant.</v>

639
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Go somewhere you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the first thing.</v>

640
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.540
<v Speaker 3>Get thee out of thy country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

641
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 3>back in the 19 twenties there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole slew of American writers who ended</v>

642
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:37.970
<v Speaker 3>up as expatriates in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hemingway among them,</v>

643
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 3>and who wrote the Great Gatsby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fitzgerald,</v>

644
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a variety of others.</v>

645
00:33:44.121 --> 00:33:49.121
<v Speaker 3>It was very inexpensive in Paris at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and part of their transformation </v>

646
00:33:49.121 --> 00:33:53.741
<v Speaker 3>into great literary figures was the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were out of their country and </v>

647
00:33:53.741 --> 00:33:56.951
<v Speaker 3>now they could see what their country </v>
<v Speaker 3>was because you can't see what your </v>

648
00:33:56.951 --> 00:33:56.951
<v Speaker 3>country is until you leave it.</v>

649
00:33:56.951 --> 00:33:59.780
<v Speaker 3>So you have to go into the unknown and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's God's first command.</v>

650
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Go into the unknown because you already </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what you know and so and that's not</v>

651
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:09.941
<v Speaker 3>enough unless you think you're enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not enough and you don't </v>

652
00:34:09.941 --> 00:34:13.421
<v Speaker 3>think you're enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to go where you haven't </v>

653
00:34:13.421 --> 00:34:15.341
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the first commandment to </v>

654
00:34:15.341 --> 00:34:15.341
<v Speaker 3>Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

655
00:34:15.341 --> 00:34:15.500
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good one.</v>

656
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:18.140
<v Speaker 3>That makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to where you don't know.</v>

657
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from my kindred will that.</v>

658
00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.760
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means grow up,</v>

659
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:24.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means.</v>

660
00:34:24.801 --> 00:34:29.801
<v Speaker 3>It means get away from your family </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough so that you can establish your </v>

661
00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:30.530
<v Speaker 3>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that isn't because there's something</v>

662
00:34:30.531 --> 00:34:32.600
<v Speaker 3>wrong with your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although perhaps there is,</v>

663
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:37.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as there is perhaps wrong with </v>

664
00:34:37.601 --> 00:34:37.601
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it means get away.</v>

665
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to people very frequently whose</v>

666
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:45.281
<v Speaker 3>families have provided them with too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much protection and they know it </v>

667
00:34:45.281 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 3>themselves and that means they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>deprived of necessity.</v>

668
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you see in,</v>

669
00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:54.461
<v Speaker 3>in the United States for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the children are first </v>

670
00:34:54.461 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Speaker 3>generation immigrants often do better </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the,</v>

671
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.650
<v Speaker 3>than the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than their children.</v>

672
00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.980
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>children are first generation </v>

673
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:03.110
<v Speaker 3>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have necessity driving them.</v>

674
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:08.470
<v Speaker 3>And you don't know how much you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessity to drive you because maybe </v>

675
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.700
<v Speaker 3>you're not very disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if a catastrophe doesn't immediately</v>

676
00:35:10.701 --> 00:35:11.480
<v Speaker 3>be fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

677
00:35:11.481 --> 00:35:16.481
<v Speaker 3>if you don't act forthrightly today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you'll never act </v>

678
00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:16.481
<v Speaker 3>forthrightly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

679
00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Because the gap between your foolishness</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the punishment is,</v>

680
00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:25.250
<v Speaker 3>is lengthened by your unearned wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you never grow up and learn and </v>

681
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:29.621
<v Speaker 3>you have to get yourself away from your </v>
<v Speaker 3>dependency in order to allow necessity </v>

682
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:35.201
<v Speaker 3>to drive you forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's to become independent and to </v>

683
00:35:35.201 --> 00:35:38.981
<v Speaker 3>become mature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think part of what's happening in </v>

684
00:35:38.981 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 3>our culture is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

685
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:44.630
<v Speaker 3>the force that's attacking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>forthright movement forward of young men</v>

686
00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:50.871
<v Speaker 3>in particular is afraid of the power of </v>
<v Speaker 3>man because it's confused about the </v>

687
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:54.420
<v Speaker 3>distinction between power and authority </v>
<v Speaker 3>and competence.</v>

688
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I know a man who's who has </v>
<v Speaker 3>authority and competence has power as a </v>

689
00:36:00.421 --> 00:36:02.840
<v Speaker 3>byproduct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the authority and competence,</v>

690
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.620
<v Speaker 3>everything and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

691
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:09.630
<v Speaker 3>and people who can't understand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fail to make the distinction between </v>

692
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 3>power and authority of competence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're afraid of power.</v>

693
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 3>And so they destroy authority and </v>
<v Speaker 3>competence.</v>

694
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's a terrible thing because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need authority and competence.</v>

695
00:36:18.241 --> 00:36:23.241
<v Speaker 3>What else is going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else is going to allow us to </v>

696
00:36:23.241 --> 00:36:23.241
<v Speaker 3>prevail?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the long run,</v>

697
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:28.430
<v Speaker 3>and so you get away from your country </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get away from your kin and from </v>

698
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.830
<v Speaker 3>your father's house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

699
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.740
<v Speaker 3>And you go out there and you establish </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in the world.</v>

700
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:36.741
<v Speaker 3>It's a call to adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what this the first lines in the </v>

701
00:36:36.741 --> 00:36:40.641
<v Speaker 3>Abrahamic story is a call to adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So great unto a land that I will show </v>

702
00:36:41.371 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

703
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:44.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

704
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:52.790
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I've been struck </v>

705
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:54.810
<v Speaker 3>very hard by a number of writers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carl Young,</v>

706
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.070
<v Speaker 3>obviously among them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>

707
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.540
<v Speaker 3>he wrote things like Nisha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you understand them,</v>

708
00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:05.541
<v Speaker 3>they just break you into pieces and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that young understood in </v>

709
00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:10.461
<v Speaker 3>the psychoanalysts understand it's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the most terrifying elements of </v>

710
00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:12.300
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalytic thinking is very tightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>allied with religious thinking,</v>

711
00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 3>which is that you are not the master of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own house.</v>

712
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 3>There are spirits that dwelling within </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

713
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.480
<v Speaker 3>meaning you have a will and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise a certain amount of conscious </v>

714
00:37:24.511 --> 00:37:29.511
<v Speaker 3>control over your being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are all sorts of things that </v>

715
00:37:29.511 --> 00:37:31.320
<v Speaker 3>occur within you that seem to be beyond </v>
<v Speaker 3>your capacity to control your dreams.</v>

716
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:33.190
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a really good example.</v>

717
00:37:33.191 --> 00:37:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Are Your impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

718
00:37:34.591 --> 00:37:39.591
<v Speaker 3>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might think of those as so foreign </v>

719
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:39.591
<v Speaker 3>from you that they're not even.</v>

720
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:39.591
<v Speaker 3>You don't even want them to be part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

721
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:41.310
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but more subtly even.</v>

722
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.220
<v Speaker 3>How about what you're interested in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What compels you?</v>

723
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where does that come from?</v>

724
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.720
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you can't.</v>

725
00:37:48.721 --> 00:37:53.721
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't conjure it up of your own </v>

726
00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:53.721
<v Speaker 3>accord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

727
00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a student in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking difficult course,</v>

728
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.430
<v Speaker 3>you might say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

729
00:37:56.431 --> 00:37:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I need to sit down and study for three </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours,</v>

730
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.810
<v Speaker 3>but then you sit down and that is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

731
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Your attention goes everywhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might say,</v>

732
00:38:03.241 --> 00:38:05.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose attention is it?</v>

733
00:38:05.371 --> 00:38:10.371
<v Speaker 3>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it goes everywhere because you say </v>

734
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:10.371
<v Speaker 3>it's your attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

735
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:10.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's your attention,</v>

736
00:38:10.381 --> 00:38:12.660
<v Speaker 3>maybe you will be able to control it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't.</v>

737
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:18.080
<v Speaker 3>And so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well jen and just exactly what the hell </v>

738
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:18.080
<v Speaker 3>is controlling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>

739
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's random.</v>

740
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:19.030
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

741
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.340
<v Speaker 3>I better not be random.</v>

742
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:25.580
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens to some degree in </v>

743
00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.311
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an element of randomness in </v>

744
00:38:28.311 --> 00:38:28.311
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not random.</v>

745
00:38:28.311 --> 00:38:32.870
<v Speaker 3>It's driven by the action of phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think are best considered as </v>

746
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 3>something like subpersonalities or </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll even only a partial description.</v>

747
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.110
<v Speaker 3>You can't make yourself interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

748
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Interest manifests itself in grips you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different thing.</v>

749
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 3>And so what is it that's gripping you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how do you conceptualize that?</v>

750
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Is that a divine power?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

751
00:38:54.351 --> 00:38:59.351
<v Speaker 3>it's divine as far as your concern </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it grips you and you can't do </v>

752
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:02.761
<v Speaker 3>anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a calling in you towards </v>

753
00:39:02.761 --> 00:39:03.670
<v Speaker 3>what you're compelled by and what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in.</v>

754
00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes that might be very dark </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes not,</v>

755
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.880
<v Speaker 3>but you're compelled forward by your </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest.</v>

756
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.540
<v Speaker 3>And so and so the idea that what moves </v>
<v Speaker 3>you away from your country and your </v>

757
00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 3>father's house and the comforts of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>childhood home is,</v>

758
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 3>is something that's beyond you.</v>

759
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 3>And that you listened to in Harken to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

760
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.390
<v Speaker 3>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

761
00:39:25.391 --> 00:39:30.391
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to call it that God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it doesn't matter what you </v>

762
00:39:30.391 --> 00:39:30.391
<v Speaker 3>call it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

763
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.480
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter to what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's called.</v>

764
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:38.110
<v Speaker 3>It still is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't listen to it,</v>

765
00:39:38.111 --> 00:39:40.180
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't listen to it,</v>

766
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 3>and I've been a clinician and talked to </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough people now as old as I am,</v>

767
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.370
<v Speaker 3>to know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

768
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.190
<v Speaker 3>If you do not listen to that thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>beckons you forward,</v>

769
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.160
<v Speaker 3>you will pay for it like you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly imagine.</v>

770
00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.880
<v Speaker 3>You'll have everything that's terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>about life in your life and nothing </v>

771
00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.901
<v Speaker 3>about it that's good and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll know that it was your fault and </v>

772
00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 3>that you squandered what you could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>

773
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:08.790
<v Speaker 3>So this is not only a calling forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a warning unto a land that I will </v>

774
00:40:10.211 --> 00:40:13.080
<v Speaker 3>show the and that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I will show the that.</v>

775
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.700
<v Speaker 3>And you don't want to be too concrete </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>

776
00:40:15.701 --> 00:40:20.701
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of new territories </v>

777
00:40:20.701 --> 00:40:20.701
<v Speaker 3>that you can inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

778
00:40:20.701 --> 00:40:25.500
<v Speaker 3>There's this abstract and conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory of Gilda University and you </v>

779
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 3>study biology or you studied physics or </v>
<v Speaker 3>or any discipline.</v>

780
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.360
<v Speaker 3>You're in a territory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

781
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 3>You're in the territory that all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scholars have established,</v>

782
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:35.911
<v Speaker 3>and then as you master the discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you move out beyond the established </v>

783
00:40:35.911 --> 00:40:35.911
<v Speaker 3>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the unknown,</v>

784
00:40:35.911 --> 00:40:37.750
<v Speaker 3>and that's a new land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

785
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's even a land of your enemies </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that matter,</v>

786
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.750
<v Speaker 3>but it's a new land to the frontier is </v>
<v Speaker 3>always in front of you.</v>

787
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:47.530
<v Speaker 3>And so you know when the earth was less </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhabited than it is now.</v>

788
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:52.710
<v Speaker 3>The frontier was the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>frontier and the geographical frontier </v>

789
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.520
<v Speaker 3>was the same thing and now they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>separated to some degree because there's</v>

790
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:58.420
<v Speaker 3>not so much geographical frontier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's the frontier is a place that</v>

791
00:40:58.421 --> 00:41:03.421
<v Speaker 3>never disappears and the land that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond the land that you know is always </v>

792
00:41:03.421 --> 00:41:03.421
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

793
00:41:03.421 --> 00:41:08.250
<v Speaker 3>And it's always where you should go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of that packed into these four </v>

794
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:12.360
<v Speaker 3>phrases so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I've been thinking about </v>

795
00:41:13.301 --> 00:41:16.030
<v Speaker 3>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at the world through a story,</v>

796
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:17.170
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't help it.</v>

797
00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:21.580
<v Speaker 3>And this story is what gives value to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world or or the stories,</v>

798
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.620
<v Speaker 3>what you extract from the value of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

799
00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:28.621
<v Speaker 3>You can look at it either way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're somewhere and it's not good </v>

800
00:41:28.621 --> 00:41:28.621
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

801
00:41:28.621 --> 00:41:30.340
<v Speaker 3>That's the eternal human predicament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wherever you are,</v>

802
00:41:30.341 --> 00:41:35.341
<v Speaker 3>isn't good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to some degree that's actually a </v>

803
00:41:35.341 --> 00:41:35.341
<v Speaker 3>good thing because if it was good </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

804
00:41:35.341 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 3>well there's nothing for you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually maybe a good thing that</v>

805
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:43.361
<v Speaker 3>it's insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that might be why sometimes having </v>

806
00:41:43.361 --> 00:41:46.691
<v Speaker 3>less iss is better than having more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be a pollyanna about </v>

807
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

808
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:52.271
<v Speaker 3>I know that there's deprivation that can</v>
<v Speaker 3>reach to the point where it's no where </v>

809
00:41:52.271 --> 00:41:56.351
<v Speaker 3>it's completely counterproductive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't always the case that </v>

810
00:41:56.351 --> 00:41:58.290
<v Speaker 3>starting with little is you.</v>

811
00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 3>If you start with little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start with more possibility.</v>

812
00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:05.981
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you move from always from what's </v>

813
00:42:05.981 --> 00:42:07.040
<v Speaker 3>unbearable about the present to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>better future.</v>

814
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't have that,</v>

815
00:42:08.781 --> 00:42:13.781
<v Speaker 3>then you have no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have nothing but threatened and </v>

816
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:14.330
<v Speaker 3>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no positive emotion because the</v>

817
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:18.830
<v Speaker 3>positive emotion is generated in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conception of the better future and then</v>

818
00:42:18.831 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 3>the evidence that you generate yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're moving towards it.</v>

819
00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 3>That's where the positive and fulfilling</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning of life comes.</v>

820
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:27.320
<v Speaker 3>So you want to set up this structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

821
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:32.500
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important and so what it means is </v>

822
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.511
<v Speaker 3>that you want to be going somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good enough so that the going is </v>

823
00:42:34.941 --> 00:42:37.670
<v Speaker 3>worth the while and you can ask yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

824
00:42:37.671 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Speaker 3>and that's partly what we tried to build</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the future authoring program,</v>

825
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

826
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.490
<v Speaker 3>we know what's wrong with life.</v>

827
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:47.060
<v Speaker 3>It's rife with suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 3>insufficiency in deception and evil.</v>

828
00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 3>It's all of that obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

829
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:54.020
<v Speaker 3>what would make the journey worthwhile?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you can ask yourself that.</v>

830
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

831
00:42:55.100 --> 00:43:00.100
<v Speaker 3>in order to bear up hundred this load,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it that I would need to be </v>

832
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 3>striving to attain?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you ask yourself that,</v>

833
00:43:01.701 --> 00:43:05.360
<v Speaker 3>that's to knock and the door will open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that means.</v>

834
00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:10.361
<v Speaker 3>If you ask yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you will find an answer and you'll </v>

835
00:43:10.361 --> 00:43:10.361
<v Speaker 3>think you'll shrink away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll think,</v>

836
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way I could do that.</v>

837
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

838
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:18.670
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what's possible and </v>

839
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 3>you're not as much as you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so god only knows what you could,</v>

840
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:27.100
<v Speaker 3>what you could do and have and give if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you sacrificed everything to it.</v>

841
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:33.280
<v Speaker 3>And that's the reason that Abraham is </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly making sacrifices and it's </v>

842
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:33.430
<v Speaker 3>archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

843
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:37.700
<v Speaker 3>He's burning up like baby lambs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like while they're alive,</v>

844
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:40.580
<v Speaker 3>you know that something and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>valuable and that's something,</v>

845
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:45.581
<v Speaker 3>it's you have to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you think about it as a modern </v>

846
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:49.031
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the act of sacrificing something </v>

847
00:43:49.031 --> 00:43:49.580
<v Speaker 3>might have some dramatic compulsion to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

848
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:54.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go out into a flock and to take </v>

849
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:55.430
<v Speaker 3>something that's new board and to cut </v>
<v Speaker 3>its throat into bleed it into burn.</v>

850
00:43:55.431 --> 00:44:00.431
<v Speaker 3>It might be a way of indicating to </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself that you're actually serious </v>

851
00:44:00.431 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 3>about something and it isn't so obvious </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have rituals of seriousness like</v>

852
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:08.711
<v Speaker 3>that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not so obvious that we're </v>

853
00:44:08.711 --> 00:44:10.871
<v Speaker 3>actually serious about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe that's not such a good </v>

854
00:44:10.871 --> 00:44:14.081
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so maybe we shouldn't be thinking </v>

855
00:44:14.081 --> 00:44:14.081
<v Speaker 3>that these people were so archaic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>primitive and superstitious.</v>

856
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:16.460
<v Speaker 3>It's possible that they knew something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we don't.</v>

857
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:22.390
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly in the abrahamic stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that maintains </v>

858
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Abraham's covenant with God is his </v>
<v Speaker 3>continual,</v>

859
00:44:23.281 --> 00:44:28.281
<v Speaker 3>a willingness to sacrifice it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so that sacrificial issue is so </v>

860
00:44:28.281 --> 00:44:31.721
<v Speaker 3>important because you are not committed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to something unless you're willing to </v>

861
00:44:31.721 --> 00:44:35.561
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Commitment and sacrifice are the same </v>

862
00:44:35.561 --> 00:44:38.991
<v Speaker 3>thing and I think its borders on </v>
<v Speaker 3>miraculous that those concepts are </v>

863
00:44:38.991 --> 00:44:42.570
<v Speaker 3>embedded into this narrative at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of dramatic action.</v>

864
00:44:42.571 --> 00:44:44.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of abstract explanation,</v>

865
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:49.820
<v Speaker 3>people are acting this out and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental conception is so profound </v>

866
00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:54.051
<v Speaker 3>that it's really quite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite inspiring and it's </v>

867
00:44:54.051 --> 00:44:57.560
<v Speaker 3>breathtaking really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you understand what message is </v>

868
00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.281
<v Speaker 3>trying to be conveyed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to make sacrifices and what do </v>

869
00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:03.690
<v Speaker 3>you have to sacrifice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to sacrifice that which is most</v>

870
00:45:03.691 --> 00:45:08.691
<v Speaker 3>valuable to you currently that stopping </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and God only knows what that is.</v>

871
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:11.070
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly the worst of you.</v>

872
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:16.160
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly that and god only knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>to what degree you're in love with the </v>

873
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.620
<v Speaker 3>worst of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So well,</v>

874
00:45:19.621 --> 00:45:24.621
<v Speaker 3>so you moved from the unbearable present</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ideal future and and you can't </v>

875
00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:29.301
<v Speaker 3>help that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to live in a structure like </v>

876
00:45:29.301 --> 00:45:29.301
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's your house,</v>

877
00:45:29.301 --> 00:45:32.211
<v Speaker 3>that's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you want to get your house in </v>

878
00:45:32.211 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 3>order and if you want it to be a place </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can live properly,</v>

879
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:38.751
<v Speaker 3>then you have to plan the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is perfect.</v>

880
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:43.460
<v Speaker 3>And then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what does that mean?</v>

881
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:46.530
<v Speaker 3>It means it's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

882
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:51.531
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I do all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time with my clinical and consulting </v>

883
00:45:51.531 --> 00:45:53.640
<v Speaker 3>clients is try to figure out what would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be good for them,</v>

884
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.040
<v Speaker 3>but we do more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We try to think,</v>

885
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:56.640
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what,</v>

886
00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:01.650
<v Speaker 3>how can we set this up so it's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good for you and that all the side </v>

887
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:03.390
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that are things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>good for other people.</v>

888
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:09.290
<v Speaker 3>And so because people are often also </v>
<v Speaker 3>timid about trying to get something </v>

889
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:12.621
<v Speaker 3>that's good for themselves because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel that it's selfish or that they </v>

890
00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:12.621
<v Speaker 3>don't deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we set it up so that.</v>

891
00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:12.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

892
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:17.991
<v Speaker 3>we're going to set it up so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>plainly obvious that this will not harm </v>

893
00:46:17.991 --> 00:46:22.500
<v Speaker 3>the structure of the universe for you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have what you need and to do it in a way</v>

894
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:27.501
<v Speaker 3>that's of benefit to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no downside to that and and so </v>

895
00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:32.391
<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay if you reach out and take </v>

896
00:46:32.391 --> 00:46:32.391
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that's interesting</v>

897
00:46:32.391 --> 00:46:36.441
<v Speaker 3>about the biblical stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abrahamic stories as well as the God </v>

898
00:46:36.441 --> 00:46:39.450
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really seem to be opposed to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>success of the people that he's chosen.</v>

899
00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 3>You know what happens to them as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they progress through their journey,</v>

900
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:48.470
<v Speaker 3>as they get larger flocks and they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>more authority and they get,</v>

901
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:50.790
<v Speaker 3>they get more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get life more abundant.</v>

902
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.590
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's God isn't,</v>

903
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.050
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem to be a miser in the old </v>
<v Speaker 3>testament.</v>

904
00:46:55.051 --> 00:47:00.051
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you put in the effort and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and you accept the covenant and you </v>

905
00:47:00.051 --> 00:47:04.431
<v Speaker 3>make the sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you get to be successful and maybe </v>

906
00:47:04.431 --> 00:47:07.820
<v Speaker 3>successful beyond your wildest dreams </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that's actually seems to be </v>

907
00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.320
<v Speaker 3>okay with God and that's pretty cool </v>
<v Speaker 3>given that you know,</v>

908
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:15.370
<v Speaker 3>that the general notion of Old Testament</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is that all he's doing is casting </v>

909
00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 3>out curses in death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

910
00:47:16.891 --> 00:47:20.280
<v Speaker 3>wherever he happens to wander.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean there's certainly no shortage</v>

911
00:47:20.281 --> 00:47:20.860
<v Speaker 3>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

912
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:26.680
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that that's very good </v>

913
00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.211
<v Speaker 3>news and that you also don't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect in order for to have that </v>

914
00:47:29.211 --> 00:47:29.620
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing,</v>

915
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:31.930
<v Speaker 3>this is the issue about going into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown.</v>

916
00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:33.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

917
00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:38.101
<v Speaker 3>if you leave your country and your kin </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your father's house and you go out </v>

918
00:47:38.101 --> 00:47:40.420
<v Speaker 3>into a land that your intuition guides </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to,</v>

919
00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.870
<v Speaker 3>you're going to undergo these radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformations.</v>

920
00:47:43.871 --> 00:47:48.871
<v Speaker 3>This is a sacrificial transformation too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're moving forthrightly and </v>

921
00:47:48.871 --> 00:47:50.320
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

922
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 3>And that's the same as the dragon fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the hero's story.</v>

923
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:56.830
<v Speaker 3>And what will happen there is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>will transform yourself,</v>

924
00:47:56.831 --> 00:48:01.831
<v Speaker 3>and so the call to an ideal is also the </v>
<v Speaker 3>call to a sequence of deaths and </v>

925
00:48:02.201 --> 00:48:05.200
<v Speaker 3>rebirths that move you closer and closer</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ideal.</v>

926
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:09.160
<v Speaker 3>And that's what that's what God is </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling Abraham to do.</v>

927
00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:15.650
<v Speaker 3>In the first sentence of this story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see these things echoed</v>

928
00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.010
<v Speaker 3>in the strangest places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these are stills that I took from</v>

929
00:48:28.011 --> 00:48:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio and this little cricket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he is this still small voice,</v>

930
00:48:31.911 --> 00:48:33.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that calls to you.</v>

931
00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.130
<v Speaker 3>It's your conscious conscience in part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your intuition in part,</v>

932
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:40.160
<v Speaker 3>and it's the thing that opens up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>great book of the world,</v>

933
00:48:40.161 --> 00:48:42.950
<v Speaker 3>the great sacred book of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what happens here,</v>

934
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:48.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the animators are at pains to show </v>

935
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.950
<v Speaker 3>you that it's a leather bound book with </v>
<v Speaker 3>guilt lettering.</v>

936
00:48:48.951 --> 00:48:53.030
<v Speaker 3>It's a valuable book and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's quiet that's showing it to you,</v>

937
00:48:53.031 --> 00:48:54.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to meditate.</v>

938
00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:59.291
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you have to be somewhere where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world isn't drowning you out in </v>

939
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:02.831
<v Speaker 3>order to understand how to open this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to listen to that voice that tells you </v>

940
00:49:02.831 --> 00:49:05.300
<v Speaker 3>where you should go with what you should</v>
<v Speaker 3>do next,</v>

941
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:10.350
<v Speaker 3>and then what happens is that something </v>
<v Speaker 3>beckons to you in the night.</v>

942
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.700
<v Speaker 3>It's a star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

943
00:49:11.701 --> 00:49:13.950
<v Speaker 3>It's something that transcends the </v>
<v Speaker 3>horizon.</v>

944
00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:15.480
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's glitters,</v>

945
00:49:15.481 --> 00:49:18.500
<v Speaker 3>it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not day to day it.</v>

946
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:23.520
<v Speaker 3>It's something that's beyond you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that represents a </v>

947
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.860
<v Speaker 3>transcendent ideal and that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifest to you.</v>

948
00:49:25.861 --> 00:49:30.660
<v Speaker 3>If you're quiet enough to listen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you wish upon so strangely,</v>

949
00:49:30.661 --> 00:49:35.661
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people do that they wish upon a </v>

950
00:49:35.661 --> 00:49:37.791
<v Speaker 3>star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they teach their children that and they </v>

951
00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:37.830
<v Speaker 3>don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean you wish upon a star?</v>

952
00:49:37.831 --> 00:49:42.831
<v Speaker 3>What in the world does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means you lift your eyes to the </v>

953
00:49:42.831 --> 00:49:44.940
<v Speaker 3>heavens and make a pact with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent and then your and then what</v>

954
00:49:44.941 --> 00:49:48.750
<v Speaker 3>your heart's desire will come to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means and you think,</v>

955
00:49:48.751 --> 00:49:49.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so.</v>

956
00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:54.650
<v Speaker 3>That's not naive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most sophisticated thing that </v>

957
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:57.060
<v Speaker 3>you can know and it's the birth of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hero,</v>

958
00:49:57.061 --> 00:49:58.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's the.</v>

959
00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:03.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the Nativity star obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where it takes place.</v>

960
00:50:06.141 --> 00:50:06.710
<v Speaker 3>It's just</v>

961
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:11.690
<v Speaker 3>anywhere and the person who is just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>carpenter and a toy maker,</v>

962
00:50:11.691 --> 00:50:16.691
<v Speaker 3>but that's pretty good at carpenter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a deceitful carpenter than </v>

963
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:18.710
<v Speaker 3>your house falls down and if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>toy maker then you love children.</v>

964
00:50:18.711 --> 00:50:20.150
<v Speaker 3>It's a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

965
00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:22.340
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Japan who lives in this little,</v>

966
00:50:22.341 --> 00:50:22.890
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

967
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:24.920
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a grand house,</v>

968
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.770
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just an everyday house,</v>

969
00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:32.771
<v Speaker 3>but everything that's happening and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is good and so that means it's a palace </v>

970
00:50:32.771 --> 00:50:34.580
<v Speaker 3>because everything in it is how that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening is good.</v>

971
00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.980
<v Speaker 3>There's a saying and I don't remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it comes from.</v>

972
00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Then it's better to have bread and water</v>
<v Speaker 3>in peace than a feast in conflict.</v>

973
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:46.271
<v Speaker 3>And like that's not a saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just the starkest possible </v>

974
00:50:46.271 --> 00:50:50.021
<v Speaker 3>description of the truth because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing worse than eating a grande meal </v>

975
00:50:50.021 --> 00:50:53.060
<v Speaker 3>with people you hate and despise that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are at each other's throats.</v>

976
00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.670
<v Speaker 3>It's much better to have bread and water</v>
<v Speaker 3>in peace.</v>

977
00:50:55.671 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

978
00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:02.040
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just clearheaded analysis of the </v>

979
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 3>structure of the world to say things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

980
00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.960
<v Speaker 3>and so the magical transformation can </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen in the most mundane of places </v>

981
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.250
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is that the </v>

982
00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.591
<v Speaker 3>mundane nature of places is an illusion </v>
<v Speaker 3>because every place is the potential </v>

983
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:21.250
<v Speaker 3>birthplace of the Kingdom of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the case and so Japan,</v>

984
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.880
<v Speaker 3>he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a kitten.</v>

985
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:31.240
<v Speaker 3>The kitten likes them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He makes puppets and he's humble person </v>

986
00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 3>and he knows that compared to the ideal </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's attempting to subscribe to,</v>

987
00:51:34.941 --> 00:51:39.941
<v Speaker 3>that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a based before it or anything </v>

988
00:51:39.941 --> 00:51:44.081
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not despicable in relationship to </v>

989
00:51:44.081 --> 00:51:46.961
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason he's on his knees is </v>

990
00:51:46.961 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 3>because the thing he's pointing at is </v>
<v Speaker 3>above him.</v>

991
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:49.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he.</v>

992
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:54.800
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be the right aim if it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't above him and so the fact that </v>

993
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.331
<v Speaker 3>he's on his knees so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is only an indication that his aim is </v>

994
00:51:58.331 --> 00:52:01.901
<v Speaker 3>proper because you should be on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>knees to something that you actually </v>

995
00:52:01.901 --> 00:52:01.901
<v Speaker 3>admire.</v>

996
00:52:01.901 --> 00:52:04.010
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't feel like being on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>knees in front of it,</v>

997
00:52:04.011 --> 00:52:05.900
<v Speaker 3>then perhaps you don't actually admire </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

998
00:52:05.901 --> 00:52:08.480
<v Speaker 3>and then that means you haven't got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage set properly.</v>

999
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:13.810
<v Speaker 3>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be something that fills you </v>

1000
00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.151
<v Speaker 3>with all your aim should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be add something that fills you </v>

1001
00:52:16.151 --> 00:52:19.361
<v Speaker 3>with all because what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do something else while perhaps </v>

1002
00:52:19.361 --> 00:52:22.610
<v Speaker 3>because it's easy and perhaps because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's malevolent and all of those things,</v>

1003
00:52:22.611 --> 00:52:27.611
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those are no answer to the problems </v>

1004
00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:30.221
<v Speaker 3>that beset you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just make things worse and that's </v>

1005
00:52:30.221 --> 00:52:32.531
<v Speaker 3>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then Japan will have as having </v>

1006
00:52:32.531 --> 00:52:34.910
<v Speaker 3>made his packed his covenant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like Abraham,</v>

1007
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:36.740
<v Speaker 3>he falls into a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1008
00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:41.741
<v Speaker 3>He falls into a dream and the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the movie actually takes place in a </v>

1009
00:52:41.741 --> 00:52:41.741
<v Speaker 3>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a dream.</v>

1010
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:46.840
<v Speaker 3>It's the dream within which </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation takes place and that's </v>

1011
00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.630
<v Speaker 3>laid out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in part time stops in,</v>

1012
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:52.640
<v Speaker 3>in the Pinocchio Story and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to Pinocchio in some sense in </v>

1013
00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's outside of normal time.</v>

1014
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.450
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the infinite archetipal space.</v>

1015
00:52:56.451 --> 00:52:58.490
<v Speaker 3>And that's a real place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real place.</v>

1016
00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:03.730
<v Speaker 3>The infinite and the finite coexist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time we're in the place of </v>

1017
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:08.081
<v Speaker 3>the finite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that the place of </v>

1018
00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:10.270
<v Speaker 3>infinite doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just means that we can't get access </v>

1019
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.270
<v Speaker 3>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just get intimations of it.</v>

1020
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 3>From time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when things are going perfectly</v>

1021
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:17.981
<v Speaker 3>well for you on those rare occasions </v>
<v Speaker 3>where everything comes together for the </v>

1022
00:53:17.981 --> 00:53:22.150
<v Speaker 3>brief moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you inhabit that divine place and you </v>

1023
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:25.361
<v Speaker 3>have some sense of what your life could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like if you organized it from </v>

1024
00:53:25.361 --> 00:53:29.310
<v Speaker 3>smallest element to the largest element </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a place that you can inhabit,</v>

1025
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:34.670
<v Speaker 3>if not forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a manner that at least felt like </v>

1026
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.670
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

1027
00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of Japan was decisioned,</v>

1028
00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 3>the transcendent manifests itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes the form of the blue fairy </v>

1029
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.190
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the positive element of nature,</v>

1030
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we could say,</v>

1031
00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>

1032
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:57.100
<v Speaker 3>it's not so clear that she's on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

1033
00:53:57.101 --> 00:54:02.101
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's the Red Queen in Alice in </v>

1034
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:02.740
<v Speaker 3>wonderland who runs around screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go down the rabbit hole,</v>

1035
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:07.060
<v Speaker 3>she runs around screaming off with their</v>
<v Speaker 3>heads and who says,</v>

1036
00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:12.540
<v Speaker 3>in my kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to run as fast as you can just </v>

1037
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:12.880
<v Speaker 3>to stay in the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's mother nature,</v>

1038
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:14.260
<v Speaker 3>but then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1039
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:19.710
<v Speaker 3>how do we know that Mother Nature's </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude towards you isn't negative </v>

1040
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:23.220
<v Speaker 3>because your attitude towards things </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't proper and that's what this film </v>

1041
00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.290
<v Speaker 3>attempts to indicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that if you aim properly,</v>

1042
00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:31.740
<v Speaker 3>then nature aligns itself behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it also a raise itself in front of </v>

1043
00:54:32.231 --> 00:54:34.090
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps even as an antagonist,</v>

1044
00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:39.120
<v Speaker 3>but the power that it it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it provides you with from within might </v>

1045
00:54:39.701 --> 00:54:42.460
<v Speaker 3>be sufficient to overcome it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>without.</v>

1046
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:48.150
<v Speaker 3>And I think that I think that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinical evidence is clear about that </v>

1047
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:52.710
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that we do </v>
<v Speaker 3>know is that if you take people who are </v>

1048
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:56.161
<v Speaker 3>confronting terrible things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shrinking from them and you teach them </v>

1049
00:54:56.681 --> 00:55:01.681
<v Speaker 3>how to structure their behavior so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can advance with courage.</v>

1050
00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Everything works better for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their fears decrease and their character</v>

1051
00:55:08.861 --> 00:55:13.861
<v Speaker 3>grows and so there might be enough of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature within us to help us withstand </v>

1052
00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:17.620
<v Speaker 3>the nature that's outside of us and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>depends,</v>

1053
00:55:17.621 --> 00:55:21.370
<v Speaker 3>at least to some degree on how it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we orient ourselves in the world to</v>

1054
00:55:21.371 --> 00:55:23.980
<v Speaker 3>some to some unknowable degree.</v>

1055
00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:27.310
<v Speaker 5>Now</v>

1056
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:31.640
<v Speaker 3>Japan warrants an autonomous individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a son</v>

1057
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:39.130
<v Speaker 3>and that's also something that makes him</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great person because autonomous </v>

1058
00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:42.320
<v Speaker 3>individuals have their own will and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a tyrant,</v>

1059
00:55:42.321 --> 00:55:47.321
<v Speaker 3>it's the last thing that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>want and if you're the tyrant who's </v>

1060
00:55:47.321 --> 00:55:50.591
<v Speaker 3>jealous of his son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even more so the last thing you're </v>

1061
00:55:50.591 --> 00:55:54.131
<v Speaker 3>ever going to want and so to aim high </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to want the development of the </v>

1062
00:55:54.131 --> 00:55:57.230
<v Speaker 3>autonomous individual or the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would say that's the core story in</v>

1063
00:55:57.231 --> 00:56:02.231
<v Speaker 3>some sense of of Western culture is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>aim high and to develop the autonomous </v>

1064
00:56:02.231 --> 00:56:05.720
<v Speaker 3>individual or the same thing and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens in Pinocchio.</v>

1065
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:10.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham and the transformation takes </v>

1066
00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:14.981
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Magical Transformation and the </v>

1067
00:56:14.981 --> 00:56:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio Story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that's so interesting </v>

1068
00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.561
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is part of it's mythological </v>

1069
00:56:20.561 --> 00:56:20.930
<v Speaker 3>substructure from the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

1070
00:56:20.931 --> 00:56:25.931
<v Speaker 3>there's only two determining forces with</v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to the destiny of the </v>

1071
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

1072
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:29.050
<v Speaker 3>There's nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deterministic and culture,</v>

1073
00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:34.260
<v Speaker 3>deterministic and then scholars wrangle </v>
<v Speaker 3>about which of those is the greater </v>

1074
00:56:35.201 --> 00:56:40.201
<v Speaker 3>force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in mythological stories there's </v>

1075
00:56:40.201 --> 00:56:42.421
<v Speaker 3>always a third element.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The third element is something like </v>

1076
00:56:42.421 --> 00:56:45.451
<v Speaker 3>autonomous consciousness and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>place for autonomous consciousness in </v>

1077
00:56:45.451 --> 00:56:47.050
<v Speaker 3>the deterministic story of nature and </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture,</v>

1078
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.630
<v Speaker 3>but we all act as if autonomy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness,</v>

1079
00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:54.631
<v Speaker 3>is the primary reality and the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories are predicated on the idea that </v>

1080
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 3>autonomous consciousness is what gives </v>
<v Speaker 3>rise to the world and I don't think that</v>

1081
00:56:58.571 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 3>we're in a position to presume that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is necessarily an error,</v>

1082
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:07.510
<v Speaker 3>and so what that means is to aim high </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to develop the autonomous individual</v>

1083
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:12.511
<v Speaker 3>is six is simultaneously the decision to</v>
<v Speaker 3>formulate an allegiance with the </v>

1084
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:19.890
<v Speaker 3>conscious power that brings being into </v>
<v Speaker 3>existence and that all takes place </v>

1085
00:57:21.691 --> 00:57:25.110
<v Speaker 3>inside this little puppet and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>has his adventures,</v>

1086
00:57:25.111 --> 00:57:25.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1087
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:30.860
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still half jackass and half </v>

1088
00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:30.860
<v Speaker 3>deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's still.</v>

1089
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Despite that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite all the errors,</v>

1090
00:57:33.031 --> 00:57:38.031
<v Speaker 3>he has the capacity to move forward and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to transform into something to transform</v>

1091
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:44.870
<v Speaker 3>himself into something that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly considered described as a true </v>

1092
00:57:45.391 --> 00:57:48.240
<v Speaker 3>son of God and that's the right aim</v>

1093
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.840
<v Speaker 3>and it works like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as I can tell.</v>

1094
00:57:53.841 --> 00:57:54.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1095
00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.120
<v Speaker 3>when I talked to people about doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future authoring program,</v>

1096
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:02.040
<v Speaker 3>they often put it off and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>surprising because it's hard and,</v>

1097
00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.580
<v Speaker 3>and be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's more than that.</v>

1098
00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:04.060
<v Speaker 3>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1099
00:58:04.061 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do a bad job.</v>

1100
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't really like assignments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to do it perfectly.</v>

1101
00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:16.110
<v Speaker 3>I need to wait until I have enough time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like one of those is enough to stop </v>

1102
00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 3>you cold and all five of them you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just done.</v>

1103
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:23.310
<v Speaker 3>And so I tell people do it haphazardly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tiny bit at a time and badly because </v>

1104
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:31.741
<v Speaker 3>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell my students when they're doing </v>

1105
00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:34.351
<v Speaker 3>their thesis master's thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write a really bad first draft and then </v>

1106
00:58:34.351 --> 00:58:35.530
<v Speaker 3>we have a little conversation about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't think.</v>

1107
00:58:35.531 --> 00:58:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean that because it sounds like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cliche in some sense.</v>

1108
00:58:40.031 --> 00:58:42.430
<v Speaker 3>It's not a cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a cliche at all.</v>

1109
00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:42.940
<v Speaker 3>It means</v>

1110
00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:48.020
<v Speaker 3>you're a terrible writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1111
00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.980
<v Speaker 3>but if someone put a gun to your head </v>
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

1112
00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:54.120
<v Speaker 3>you have to have your a hundred page </v>
<v Speaker 3>thesis done by next Monday,</v>

1113
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.600
<v Speaker 3>or I'll shoot you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't care how terrible it is,</v>

1114
00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:01.920
<v Speaker 3>you would sit down and write it and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing is then you have it right then,</v>

1115
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.020
<v Speaker 3>then you have something and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix it.</v>

1116
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:06.990
<v Speaker 3>You can iterate and fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That bad first draft.</v>

1117
00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:09.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the most valuable thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's what you need.</v>

1118
00:59:09.391 --> 00:59:13.680
<v Speaker 3>You need a bad first draft of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's.</v>

1119
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:17.730
<v Speaker 3>There's an idea in the young developed </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the trickster and the gesture,</v>

1120
00:59:17.731 --> 00:59:18.660
<v Speaker 3>the comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1121
00:59:18.661 --> 00:59:23.661
<v Speaker 3>That the trickster is the precursor to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the savior and that's one of the things </v>

1122
00:59:23.661 --> 00:59:27.821
<v Speaker 3>I learned from young that was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so unlikely you'd never think that </v>

1123
00:59:27.821 --> 00:59:29.030
<v Speaker 3>it's so amazing that that might be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>

1124
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:30.790
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1125
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:34.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the satirical and the erotic and the and</v>

1126
00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 3>the troublemaker that the comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fool,</v>

1127
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.620
<v Speaker 3>the fool is the precursor to the savior.</v>

1128
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:44.830
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're a fool when you start </v>

1129
00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:44.900
<v Speaker 3>something new and so if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to be a fool,</v>

1130
00:59:44.901 --> 00:59:47.210
<v Speaker 3>then you'll never start anything new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you never started anything new,</v>

1131
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:52.211
<v Speaker 3>then you won't develop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the willingness to be a fool is </v>

1132
00:59:52.211 --> 00:59:54.080
<v Speaker 3>the precursor to transformation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the same as humility.</v>

1133
00:59:54.081 --> 00:59:56.120
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're going to write your </v>
<v Speaker 3>destiny,</v>

1134
00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.240
<v Speaker 3>you can do a bad first job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get smarter as you move </v>

1135
01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.781
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is that so something </v>

1136
01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:04.781
<v Speaker 3>beckons to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens here.</v>

1137
01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the star that you pedal wished on </v>
<v Speaker 3>was the wrong damn star,</v>

1138
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:10.220
<v Speaker 3>but at least it was a star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1139
01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:14.870
<v Speaker 3>At least it was in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least it moved him forward and so you</v>

1140
01:00:14.871 --> 01:00:19.871
<v Speaker 3>say in your life or something grips you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fills you with interest and you </v>

1141
01:00:19.871 --> 01:00:20.090
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1142
01:00:20.091 --> 01:00:20.930
<v Speaker 3>should I do that?</v>

1143
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.840
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not that,</v>

1144
01:00:23.841 --> 01:00:27.650
<v Speaker 3>then something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if it's a mistake?</v>

1145
01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:30.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rest assured,</v>

1146
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.140
<v Speaker 3>what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to stumble around,</v>

1147
01:00:33.141 --> 01:00:34.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's going to happen is this,</v>

1148
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 3>you're going to move to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to not stay in spaces,</v>

1149
01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:39.260
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to wander around in </v>
<v Speaker 3>circles.</v>

1150
01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.090
<v Speaker 3>And I see people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

1151
01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:42.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never knew what to do,</v>

1152
01:00:42.111 --> 01:00:47.111
<v Speaker 3>and now I'm 40 so that's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not so good.</v>

1153
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1154
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:54.280
<v Speaker 3>and there is literature to that suggests</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are a lot more unhappy when </v>

1155
01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:59.261
<v Speaker 3>they look back in their lives about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things they didn't do than they are </v>

1156
01:00:59.261 --> 01:01:01.430
<v Speaker 3>about the mistakes they made while they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing things.</v>

1157
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:06.700
<v Speaker 3>And so that's really worth thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about too because there's redemptive </v>

1158
01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.541
<v Speaker 3>mistakes and a redemptive mistake would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a mistake that you make when you go </v>

1159
01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:10.541
<v Speaker 3>out and try to do something.</v>

1160
01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:10.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually,</v>

1161
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:11.840
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1162
01:01:11.841 --> 01:01:14.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're not good at it,</v>

1163
01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.800
<v Speaker 3>you make a bunch of mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1164
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:21.010
<v Speaker 3>what's the consequence if you pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention is you're not quite so stupid </v>

1165
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.370
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is you've been informed</v>

1166
01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:24.380
<v Speaker 3>by your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the results of your errors,</v>

1167
01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:28.340
<v Speaker 3>and so what happens is you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you follow the beacon,</v>

1168
01:01:28.341 --> 01:01:31.850
<v Speaker 3>you follow the light and you're blind so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know where the light is.</v>

1169
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 3>It's dimly apprehended only and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid to follow it,</v>

1170
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:40.570
<v Speaker 3>but you decided to take some stumbling </v>
<v Speaker 3>steps towards it and as you take </v>

1171
01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:45.401
<v Speaker 3>stumbling steps towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you become illuminated and enlightened </v>

1172
01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.270
<v Speaker 3>and informed because of the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your experience,</v>

1173
01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:52.271
<v Speaker 3>because you're pushing yourself beyond </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you are and you're going into the </v>

1174
01:01:52.271 --> 01:01:53.510
<v Speaker 3>country that you have not yet been in </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you learn something,</v>

1175
01:01:53.511 --> 01:01:56.120
<v Speaker 3>and so what happens then is the star </v>
<v Speaker 3>moves.</v>

1176
01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.550
<v Speaker 3>You move 10 feet towards it and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1177
01:01:58.551 --> 01:01:59.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not right.</v>

1178
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:01.130
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't there.</v>

1179
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:03.390
<v Speaker 3>It's actually there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then you,</v>

1180
01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:08.570
<v Speaker 3>you see it somewhere else and you shift </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself slightly and you move forward </v>

1181
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:12.581
<v Speaker 3>and that's what happens is that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue as you changed the thing that </v>

1182
01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:16.820
<v Speaker 3>guides you forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moves,</v>

1183
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like God in in the,</v>

1184
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.270
<v Speaker 3>in the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Egypt,</v>

1185
01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.760
<v Speaker 3>the pillar of light that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>following gets moving.</v>

1186
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not a permanent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You move towards it,</v>

1187
01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:29.880
<v Speaker 3>it moves away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It guides you forward and so you say,</v>

1188
01:02:29.881 --> 01:02:33.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what I'm aiming at paradise itself.</v>

1189
01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:36.000
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what do you know?</v>

1190
01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:38.910
<v Speaker 3>You see you couldn't see paradise if it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was right in front of you,</v>

1191
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:44.150
<v Speaker 3>but you might get a glimmer of it and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you move towards it and you grow and </v>

1192
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:49.041
<v Speaker 3>then the next time you open your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you see a little bit more clearly and </v>

1193
01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens is that just happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over,</v>

1194
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It keeps moving</v>

1195
01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:59.380
<v Speaker 3>and so you move like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that's so cool is that all</v>

1196
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:02.480
<v Speaker 3>those zigs and zags you say on each of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those Zags,</v>

1197
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.120
<v Speaker 3>zigs is a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hit a wall,</v>

1198
01:03:05.121 --> 01:03:07.520
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I had to die a little bit and I</v>

1199
01:03:07.521 --> 01:03:10.400
<v Speaker 3>barely got back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a phoenix transformation at each,</v>

1200
01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:13.010
<v Speaker 3>at each turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's painful,</v>

1201
01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.350
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is is that even though </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've.</v>

1202
01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.370
<v Speaker 3>You've traveled 20 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say on that road,</v>

1203
01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.590
<v Speaker 3>and you've only moved three miles </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

1204
01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:25.460
<v Speaker 3>You've moved three miles forward instead</v>
<v Speaker 3>of falling backwards,</v>

1205
01:03:25.461 --> 01:03:28.580
<v Speaker 3>because that's the thing too is that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you stand still,</v>

1206
01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:32.990
<v Speaker 3>you fall backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot stand still because the world</v>

1207
01:03:32.991 --> 01:03:37.991
<v Speaker 3>moves away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you stand still and there's no </v>

1208
01:03:37.991 --> 01:03:41.100
<v Speaker 3>status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only backwards and so if you're </v>

1209
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:41.100
<v Speaker 3>not moving backward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

1210
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:46.030
<v Speaker 3>forwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're moving backwards and that's </v>

1211
01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:49.120
<v Speaker 3>more more of the underlying truth of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>matthew principle to those who have </v>

1212
01:03:51.651 --> 01:03:54.740
<v Speaker 3>everything more will be given from those</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have nothing.</v>

1213
01:03:54.741 --> 01:03:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Everything will be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a warning.</v>

1214
01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Do not stay in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well as you zig and zag,</v>

1215
01:04:04.471 --> 01:04:09.471
<v Speaker 3>maybe the maybe the cataclysm of each </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation starts to lessen.</v>

1216
01:04:10.571 --> 01:04:13.840
<v Speaker 3>There's not so much of you that has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>die with every mistake</v>

1217
01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.440
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you end up oriented at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonably properly,</v>

1218
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:22.470
<v Speaker 3>and if you were sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would have been your trip,</v>

1219
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.170
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that and perhaps it's a lot worse,</v>

1220
01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:30.171
<v Speaker 3>did not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps there's no shortage of </v>

1221
01:04:30.171 --> 01:04:32.091
<v Speaker 3>backtracking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter because as you </v>

1222
01:04:32.091 --> 01:04:32.091
<v Speaker 3>stumble forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1223
01:04:32.091 --> 01:04:36.440
<v Speaker 3>you illuminated and inform yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and perhaps that's partly because the </v>

1224
01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.151
<v Speaker 3>world is made of information and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>encounter it and tangle with it than it </v>

1225
01:04:42.601 --> 01:04:47.601
<v Speaker 3>informs you and then you become informed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then your information and then </v>

1226
01:04:47.601 --> 01:04:52.371
<v Speaker 3>you're ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so God says to Abraham,</v>

1227
01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:59.200
<v Speaker 3>I will make of thee a great nation and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>will bless thee and make thy name great </v>

1228
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:06.760
<v Speaker 3>and thou shalt be a blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1229
01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.880
<v Speaker 3>that's a good offer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally,</v>

1230
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:12.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means</v>

1231
01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.640
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean to to be made a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>nation of?</v>

1232
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps it has something to do directly </v>

1233
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.491
<v Speaker 3>with your descendants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it's just that you </v>

1234
01:05:26.491 --> 01:05:29.071
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is if you're a force for good in the </v>

1235
01:05:29.071 --> 01:05:31.231
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that radiates out from you and if </v>

1236
01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:34.441
<v Speaker 3>you're good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's difficult to say how much of an </v>

1237
01:05:34.441 --> 01:05:35.550
<v Speaker 3>impact on things you could have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Dostoevsky,</v>

1238
01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:39.580
<v Speaker 3>who was a very crazy person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly because of his epilepsy,</v>

1239
01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:44.940
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a man is not only responsible for </v>

1240
01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.851
<v Speaker 3>everything he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for everything that everyone else </v>

1241
01:05:47.851 --> 01:05:47.851
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you think,</v>

1242
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1243
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.610
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1244
01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:55.900
<v Speaker 3>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes no.</v>

1245
01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes that's what you think of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>cataclysmic,</v>

1246
01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.860
<v Speaker 3>cataclysmic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really depressed,</v>

1247
01:05:59.861 --> 01:06:04.861
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that your sins are so egregious that </v>

1248
01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 3>they're unforgivable and that in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>manner you're at,</v>

1249
01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:09.340
<v Speaker 3>you're at fault for everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible with the world,</v>

1250
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:14.430
<v Speaker 3>but there's actually truth in that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's actually redemptive truth in </v>

1251
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:17.701
<v Speaker 3>that is that things wouldn't be so bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you weren't so if you weren't so far </v>

1252
01:06:20.171 --> 01:06:25.171
<v Speaker 3>from what you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's terribly pessimistic because </v>

1253
01:06:25.171 --> 01:06:25.300
<v Speaker 3>it's all on you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1254
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:28.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's terribly optimistic because </v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1255
01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:33.031
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>do and if you're crying out for </v>

1256
01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:36.391
<v Speaker 3>something to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's the best news you could </v>

1257
01:06:36.391 --> 01:06:36.391
<v Speaker 3>possibly have.</v>

1258
01:06:36.391 --> 01:06:37.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like things aren't so good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but neither are you.</v>

1259
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:42.310
<v Speaker 3>So if you stopped doing the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you knew to be destructive,</v>

1260
01:06:42.311 --> 01:06:43.810
<v Speaker 3>which is the right place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1261
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:48.811
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to clean up your room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do first while you just get </v>

1262
01:06:48.811 --> 01:06:51.781
<v Speaker 3>rid of the mess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you know what no one has </v>

1263
01:06:51.781 --> 01:06:53.020
<v Speaker 3>to come in and tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully what's the worst mass?</v>

1264
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:57.130
<v Speaker 3>It's just it announces itself to you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can certainly know yourself and this</v>

1265
01:06:57.131 --> 01:06:59.770
<v Speaker 3>is a very easy meditative exercise to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sit down and think,</v>

1266
01:06:59.771 --> 01:07:02.650
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing one thing really stupidly that</v>

1267
01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:04.720
<v Speaker 3>I should stop doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1268
01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:06.850
<v Speaker 3>how long is it going to take you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out what that is?</v>

1269
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 3>It's about two seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1270
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:13.950
<v Speaker 3>You've known it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you could even make it less </v>

1271
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.950
<v Speaker 3>demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say,</v>

1272
01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:19.330
<v Speaker 3>there was some stupid things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that I know are stupid and wrong </v>

1273
01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:24.540
<v Speaker 3>that I could stop doing that I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop doing,</v>

1274
01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:30.690
<v Speaker 3>and then you can just start with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can just do that and maybe it's </v>

1275
01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:30.690
<v Speaker 3>just a little thing.</v>

1276
01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:31.870
<v Speaker 3>Although it's not because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

1277
01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:34.540
<v Speaker 3>it's a step forward on the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>voyage.</v>

1278
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:36.280
<v Speaker 3>It's not a small thing and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1279
01:07:36.281 --> 01:07:37.930
<v Speaker 3>what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say,</v>

1280
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:39.700
<v Speaker 3>let's do this for a year or even a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month,</v>

1281
01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:41.800
<v Speaker 3>just try not to do things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1282
01:07:41.801 --> 01:07:46.801
<v Speaker 3>to be stupid and wrong for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means not to say things you </v>

1283
01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:47.350
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be stupid and wrong as well.</v>

1284
01:07:47.351 --> 01:07:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just do it as an experiment,</v>

1285
01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:55.770
<v Speaker 3>see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's so fun because I have people </v>

1286
01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:56.200
<v Speaker 3>writing to me from all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are saying they're doing that.</v>

1287
01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:57.190
<v Speaker 3>They're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1288
01:07:57.191 --> 01:07:59.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cleaned up my room and,</v>

1289
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 3>and then I stopped saying stupid things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and my God,</v>

1290
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.220
<v Speaker 3>it's like things are way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like who would have guessed it?</v>

1291
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:11.380
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's low hanging fruit man,</v>

1292
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:13.420
<v Speaker 3>because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing.</v>

1293
01:08:13.421 --> 01:08:14.830
<v Speaker 3>If there's a lot of things wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1294
01:08:14.831 --> 01:08:17.000
<v Speaker 3>then it's really easy to start fixing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1295
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:18.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got so much.</v>

1296
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 3>There's so much territory that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhabit.</v>

1297
01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I will make of thee a great nation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will bless thee.</v>

1298
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:30.730
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole nation thing that's </v>

1299
01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:30.730
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to have God on your side,</v>

1300
01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:35.291
<v Speaker 3>that's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might want that when things get </v>

1301
01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:39.521
<v Speaker 3>rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be good and make their name </v>

1302
01:08:39.521 --> 01:08:41.060
<v Speaker 3>great and thou shalt be a blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful.</v>

1303
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:45.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a good deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I will bless them that bless thee.</v>

1304
01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.100
<v Speaker 3>That's good too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and curse him that curses thee and in </v>

1305
01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:51.860
<v Speaker 3>these shallow families of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be blessed.</v>

1306
01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:59.200
<v Speaker 3>That's something that's something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be something.</v>

1307
01:08:59.501 --> 01:09:04.501
<v Speaker 3>If you could wake up and your day was </v>
<v Speaker 3>composed in part of people thanking you </v>

1308
01:09:05.771 --> 01:09:07.930
<v Speaker 3>for all the good things you've done in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

1309
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:09.580
<v Speaker 3>would that be good?</v>

1310
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:16.740
<v Speaker 3>It's not impossible for that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Abraham departed.</v>

1311
01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:22.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the Lord had spoken unto him and lot </v>

1312
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:26.061
<v Speaker 3>went with him and Abraham was 70 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>five years when he departed out of her </v>

1313
01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:27.540
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all old now.</v>

1314
01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Abraham lives a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is also part of the story.</v>

1315
01:09:30.151 --> 01:09:32.040
<v Speaker 3>So he has a wife who can't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>children.</v>

1316
01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.600
<v Speaker 3>He has nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>

1317
01:09:33.601 --> 01:09:38.601
<v Speaker 3>He's been hanging around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dad's shocked for a little too long </v>

1318
01:09:38.601 --> 01:09:38.601
<v Speaker 3>given that he's 75,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1319
01:09:38.601 --> 01:09:40.170
<v Speaker 3>It's time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time to get on the fire,</v>

1320
01:09:40.171 --> 01:09:44.550
<v Speaker 3>lit underneath him a bit and so he's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>got much going for him,</v>

1321
01:09:44.551 --> 01:09:47.670
<v Speaker 3>but he still decides to to move forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've seen this too,</v>

1322
01:09:47.671 --> 01:09:52.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you don't have your destiny in </v>

1323
01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:52.671
<v Speaker 3>hand by your time you're 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1324
01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:57.121
<v Speaker 3>it's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start hurting and if you don't have </v>

1325
01:09:57.121 --> 01:09:57.121
<v Speaker 3>your destiny in hand by the time you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>40,</v>

1326
01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.380
<v Speaker 3>then you really start hurting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forties,</v>

1327
01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:05.100
<v Speaker 3>a real fork in the road.</v>

1328
01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.760
<v Speaker 3>The fork in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's always where you meet the devil </v>

1329
01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.951
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's because every time you have </v>

1330
01:10:13.951 --> 01:10:14.860
<v Speaker 3>to make a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of evil beckons.</v>

1331
01:10:14.861 --> 01:10:16.750
<v Speaker 3>That's why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend,</v>

1332
01:10:16.751 --> 01:10:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I've told you a little about him and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed himself just after 40.</v>

1333
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:25.430
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had had a book published with a very </v>

1334
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.430
<v Speaker 3>small press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was quite a good writer,</v>

1335
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:28.450
<v Speaker 3>but he could not get himself together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it hit him too hard at 40.</v>

1336
01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.460
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying that it's hopeless at</v>
<v Speaker 3>40.</v>

1337
01:10:30.461 --> 01:10:35.461
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that partly because of </v>

1338
01:10:35.461 --> 01:10:38.671
<v Speaker 3>these verses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also partly because of what I've </v>

1339
01:10:38.671 --> 01:10:40.501
<v Speaker 3>seen in my clinical practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had people come to me who have had </v>

1340
01:10:40.501 --> 01:10:42.070
<v Speaker 3>very chaotic and the ill spent lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1341
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.520
<v Speaker 3>who were in that neighborhood of age and</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's true for people who are older </v>

1342
01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.051
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who then decided to make a real effort </v>

1343
01:10:52.051 --> 01:10:53.920
<v Speaker 3>and to try to make where they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1344
01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of being bitter about where they</v>

1345
01:10:55.811 --> 01:10:59.240
<v Speaker 3>weren't because that's the bitterness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really does you,</v>

1346
01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:02.740
<v Speaker 3>when it's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the opposite of gratitude.</v>

1347
01:11:02.741 --> 01:11:03.610
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1348
01:11:03.611 --> 01:11:06.250
<v Speaker 3>it's the manifestation of resentment </v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes you malevolent.</v>

1349
01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.050
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very bad to be better.</v>

1350
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:09.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1351
01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.350
<v Speaker 3>It's hell to be bitter,</v>

1352
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 4>and if you're 40 and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful,</v>

1353
01:11:16.411 --> 01:11:20.460
<v Speaker 4>then you have to accept your lot and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to start to improve what's right in</v>

1354
01:11:20.461 --> 01:11:22.950
<v Speaker 4>front of you and if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't take very long.</v>

1355
01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:26.670
<v Speaker 4>It's quite interesting to watch people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things can be a lot better in six months</v>

1356
01:11:26.671 --> 01:11:29.400
<v Speaker 4>and they can be way better in two years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a struggle,</v>

1357
01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:34.401
<v Speaker 4>uphill struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's by no means impossible and I </v>

1358
01:11:34.401 --> 01:11:35.070
<v Speaker 4>don't know again what the limit of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

1359
01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:40.071
<v Speaker 4>I suppose it depends on the degree to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some degree on the degree of your </v>

1360
01:11:40.071 --> 01:11:40.071
<v Speaker 4>commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>

1361
01:11:40.071 --> 01:11:44.421
<v Speaker 4>so aber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's another indication of the real </v>

1362
01:11:44.421 --> 01:11:45.870
<v Speaker 4>validity of this story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God isn't setting this up to be easy,</v>

1363
01:11:45.871 --> 01:11:50.871
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham was old and he and and his and </v>

1364
01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:51.150
<v Speaker 4>his wife is old too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and more than that,</v>

1365
01:11:51.151 --> 01:11:56.151
<v Speaker 4>she's barren.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is he going to be the father of </v>

1366
01:11:56.151 --> 01:11:56.151
<v Speaker 4>nations?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is he going to be successful?</v>

1367
01:11:56.151 --> 01:12:01.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the initial departure point is </v>

1368
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:02.730
<v Speaker 4>insufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>radically insufficient,</v>

1369
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:07.850
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's very inspiring because it </v>

1370
01:12:08.101 --> 01:12:10.560
<v Speaker 4>means that you can start from where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

1371
01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:17.220
<v Speaker 4>So Abraham departed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot </v>

1372
01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.741
<v Speaker 4>went with him and Abraham was 75 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>old when he departed out of her around </v>

1373
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:23.730
<v Speaker 4>and Abraham took Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his wife and lot his brother's son and </v>

1374
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:23.950
<v Speaker 4>all their substance that they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>gathered.</v>

1375
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:27.310
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has a relationship with law,</v>

1376
01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he doesn't have his own son,</v>

1377
01:12:28.751 --> 01:12:33.751
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his brother died and so he takes his </v>

1378
01:12:33.751 --> 01:12:34.120
<v Speaker 4>nephew as his son that's grateful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1379
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:39.130
<v Speaker 4>did he could be very angry and have </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing to do with them because he </v>

1380
01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:39.160
<v Speaker 4>didn't get his own son.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that isn't,</v>

1381
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.550
<v Speaker 4>that isn't what happens is he's offered </v>
<v Speaker 4>to substitute let's say,</v>

1382
01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:45.580
<v Speaker 4>and he accepts it and so good for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1383
01:12:45.581 --> 01:12:50.581
<v Speaker 4>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's also something that I've seen</v>

1384
01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:55.980
<v Speaker 4>that characterize as people who can make</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best of a bad lot is they don't get </v>

1385
01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:00.690
<v Speaker 4>exactly what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but something comes along that offers </v>

1386
01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:03.750
<v Speaker 4>possibilities that are sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps if exploited properly,</v>

1387
01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:09.240
<v Speaker 4>and they open their heart and welcomed </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in instead of rejecting them in </v>

1388
01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:09.580
<v Speaker 4>bitterness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a good thing.</v>

1389
01:13:09.581 --> 01:13:14.240
<v Speaker 4>And that's part of Abraham's character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Abraham took Sarah,</v>

1390
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:19.250
<v Speaker 4>his wife and lot his brother's son and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all their substance that they had </v>

1391
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.250
<v Speaker 4>gathered and all the souls that they had</v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten in her.</v>

1392
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:24.181
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they went forth to go into the land </v>

1393
01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:24.181
<v Speaker 4>of Canaan into exile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1394
01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:24.520
<v Speaker 4>and into the land of Canaan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They came.</v>

1395
01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:30.550
<v Speaker 4>And that's another repetition of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation story,</v>

1396
01:13:30.551 --> 01:13:35.551
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to go to a land where you're </v>

1397
01:13:35.551 --> 01:13:35.551
<v Speaker 4>not welcome</v>

1398
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:41.030
<v Speaker 4>an apron pass through the land unto the </v>
<v Speaker 4>place of Chm onto the plane of Maura and</v>

1399
01:13:41.031 --> 01:13:46.031
<v Speaker 4>the Canaanite was then in the land and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said </v>

1400
01:13:46.031 --> 01:13:46.220
<v Speaker 4>unto thy seed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will give you this land.</v>

1401
01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:51.221
<v Speaker 4>And there he built an altar to the Lord </v>
<v Speaker 4>who appeared unto him and he removed </v>

1402
01:13:51.221 --> 01:13:55.541
<v Speaker 4>from thence onto a mountain on the east </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Bethel and pitched his tent having </v>

1403
01:13:55.541 --> 01:13:59.171
<v Speaker 4>Bethel on the west and high on the east.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there he built an altar unto the </v>

1404
01:13:59.171 --> 01:13:59.270
<v Speaker 4>Lord and called upon the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord.</v>

1405
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:03.860
<v Speaker 4>Now we don't understand these rituals </v>
<v Speaker 4>precisely.</v>

1406
01:14:03.861 --> 01:14:08.861
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the people who did this </v>

1407
01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:11.051
<v Speaker 4>engaged in a meditative ritual was not </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that you take something of </v>

1408
01:14:11.051 --> 01:14:11.950
<v Speaker 4>value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do this,</v>

1409
01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:17.060
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you undertake this dramatic </v>

1410
01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:17.230
<v Speaker 4>transformation of a life and death </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation.</v>

1411
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:19.330
<v Speaker 4>And is that an aid to meditation?</v>

1412
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:21.390
<v Speaker 4>And what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you sit down and think?</v>

1413
01:14:21.391 --> 01:14:22.360
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you pray?</v>

1414
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:24.790
<v Speaker 4>Pray being to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1415
01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 4>to what do I do next?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do I orient myself in the world as a</v>

1416
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 4>useful exercise to do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's something that people could</v>

1417
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:37.231
<v Speaker 4>do every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's useful to sit down and </v>

1418
01:14:37.231 --> 01:14:37.231
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1419
01:14:37.231 --> 01:14:38.080
<v Speaker 4>what's the most important thing I should</v>
<v Speaker 4>do today?</v>

1420
01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:43.000
<v Speaker 4>What I have an array of things that call</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me to be done,</v>

1421
01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:48.180
<v Speaker 4>some of which I will do with joy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of which I will bear as </v>

1422
01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:51.440
<v Speaker 4>responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they array themselves in front of me</v>

1423
01:14:51.441 --> 01:14:54.280
<v Speaker 4>and what should I attend to first?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1424
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:59.550
<v Speaker 4>do you ask or do you decide and it seems</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me when I do it because I do it all </v>

1425
01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:00.880
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do it every morning.</v>

1426
01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:02.230
<v Speaker 4>I try to sit down and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1427
01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:07.231
<v Speaker 4>I've got things that I would like to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>and things that call to me out of </v>

1428
01:15:07.231 --> 01:15:09.130
<v Speaker 4>necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I do first?</v>

1429
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:14.130
<v Speaker 4>And it's not so much a decision as it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a question and I don't know what I'm </v>

1430
01:15:14.201 --> 01:15:17.530
<v Speaker 4>calling on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's I'm calling on my capacity to think</v>

1431
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:20.230
<v Speaker 4>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not my capacity exactly.</v>

1432
01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

1433
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:28.170
<v Speaker 4>I can commune with whatever provides the</v>
<v Speaker 4>answers and I can think that that's me </v>

1434
01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:28.170
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1435
01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:32.590
<v Speaker 4>and now it isn't that I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't think.</v>

1436
01:15:32.591 --> 01:15:34.660
<v Speaker 4>I do believe that I can consciously </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1437
01:15:34.661 --> 01:15:37.090
<v Speaker 4>but that's not the same as calling for </v>
<v Speaker 4>inspiration.</v>

1438
01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:42.240
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like a dream is not conscious </v>

1439
01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:45.571
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something that happens to you and </v>

1440
01:15:45.571 --> 01:15:47.460
<v Speaker 4>that kind of inspiration is also </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that happens to you because I </v>

1441
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:47.460
<v Speaker 4>asked myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1442
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.330
<v Speaker 4>what's the most important thing I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>do next?</v>

1443
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:53.620
<v Speaker 4>And then I have an answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't because I decided exactly.</v>

1444
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:58.850
<v Speaker 4>I've decided that I'll do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is and that I want to know </v>

1445
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.850
<v Speaker 4>what it is.</v>

1446
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.850
<v Speaker 4>Those are the decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

1447
01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:04.110
<v Speaker 4>But there's an involuntary aspect to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorting that occurs and that's the </v>

1448
01:16:04.991 --> 01:16:07.390
<v Speaker 4>psychological equivalent I suppose to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1449
01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:12.570
<v Speaker 4>And I guess the sacrifice is when I feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I will do whatever it is that calls</v>

1450
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:21.270
<v Speaker 4>to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I don't do the other things that I </v>

1451
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.640
<v Speaker 4>might want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a sacrifice.</v>

1452
01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:27.420
<v Speaker 4>It's to me it's the proper sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 4>because my sense is that things don't go</v>

1453
01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:33.001
<v Speaker 4>properly unless you do what's most </v>
<v Speaker 4>important and if I want things to go </v>

1454
01:16:33.001 --> 01:16:37.651
<v Speaker 4>properly and I do because I've had my </v>
<v Speaker 4>taste of things not going properly,</v>

1455
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:43.650
<v Speaker 4>I want things to go properly and so then</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not so difficult to do what's </v>

1456
01:16:45.461 --> 01:16:50.461
<v Speaker 4>necessary to to do what makes things go </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly under those circumstances and </v>

1457
01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.300
<v Speaker 4>it's hardly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1458
01:16:55.301 --> 01:17:00.301
<v Speaker 4>this is partly why the story of Sodom </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Gomorrah is embedded in the </v>

1459
01:17:00.301 --> 01:17:03.901
<v Speaker 4>abrahamic stories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think because that's an apocalyptic </v>

1460
01:17:03.901 --> 01:17:03.901
<v Speaker 4>story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1461
01:17:03.901 --> 01:17:07.750
<v Speaker 4>If things go badly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole city is destroyed.</v>

1462
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:10.110
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then and</v>

1463
01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.120
<v Speaker 3>the reason it goes badly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because the people in the city do </v>

1464
01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.380
<v Speaker 3>not behave properly and the people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the city might be you.</v>

1465
01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:23.220
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're not behaving properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you go and so does the city and </v>

1466
01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.970
<v Speaker 3>maybe you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you do want that,</v>

1467
01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.940
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you don't want that and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want that,</v>

1468
01:17:27.941 --> 01:17:31.270
<v Speaker 3>then maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know that if you don't do things</v>

1469
01:17:31.271 --> 01:17:33.010
<v Speaker 3>property,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's Un the city.</v>

1470
01:17:33.011 --> 01:17:38.011
<v Speaker 3>If you actually know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then maybe that terrifies you badly </v>

1471
01:17:38.011 --> 01:17:41.941
<v Speaker 3>enough so that you're willing to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sacrifice to do the right things </v>

1472
01:17:41.941 --> 01:17:43.150
<v Speaker 3>instead of the impulsive things that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>might otherwise want to do.</v>

1473
01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:51.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned from Viktor Frankl in from </v>

1474
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Carl Yogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and for many</v>

1475
01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:58.101
<v Speaker 3>of the people whose works on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Holocaust that I read and on the </v>

1476
01:17:58.101 --> 01:18:02.010
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes in the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the people who'd studied most deeply</v>

1477
01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:07.011
<v Speaker 3>always came to the same conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The state became corrupted because each </v>

1478
01:18:07.411 --> 01:18:12.411
<v Speaker 3>individual allowed themselves to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted or perhaps participated </v>

1479
01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:14.520
<v Speaker 3>joyfully in the process of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted.</v>

1480
01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:18.400
<v Speaker 3>And the consequence of that was the end </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>

1481
01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:22.820
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't behave properly,</v>

1482
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:26.960
<v Speaker 3>then you bring about the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and maybe you think,</v>

1483
01:18:26.961 --> 01:18:28.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's only the end of your world.</v>

1484
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:34.090
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe it's the only the end of your </v>

1485
01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:34.090
<v Speaker 3>family's world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>

1486
01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Which I suppose might give you some </v>
<v Speaker 3>pause,</v>

1487
01:18:35.570 --> 01:18:40.570
<v Speaker 3>but there's more to it than that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're connected to everyone else and </v>

1488
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.980
<v Speaker 3>what you do that isn't good</v>

1489
01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:50.670
<v Speaker 3>distributes itself and all the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't do that could be good take </v>

1490
01:18:50.670 --> 01:18:54.370
<v Speaker 3>away from the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you know that,</v>

1491
01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:57.100
<v Speaker 3>and I do think you know that if you take</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seriously,</v>

1492
01:18:57.101 --> 01:19:02.101
<v Speaker 3>because if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the historical events,</v>

1493
01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.550
<v Speaker 3>the cataclysmic events of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>

1494
01:19:05.551 --> 01:19:09.180
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not think that you can fail to come</v>

1495
01:19:09.181 --> 01:19:14.181
<v Speaker 3>to that conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Abraham journeyed going on still </v>

1496
01:19:16.861 --> 01:19:17.970
<v Speaker 3>towards the south.</v>

1497
01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:25.170
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting because to go south </v>
<v Speaker 3>means to go downhill to it's not good to</v>

1498
01:19:25.171 --> 01:19:30.171
<v Speaker 3>go south.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's colloquial for going to where you </v>

1499
01:19:30.171 --> 01:19:31.860
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is what happens to Abraham.</v>

1500
01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:32.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1501
01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:38.150
<v Speaker 3>his accent is preceded by a descent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's very common in life I would </v>

1502
01:19:38.731 --> 01:19:40.320
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it.</v>

1503
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:45.470
<v Speaker 3>So the redemptive element of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative is that if the covenant is </v>

1504
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:49.290
<v Speaker 3>constructed properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's an arc,</v>

1505
01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.440
<v Speaker 3>which is your decision to align yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>with God for all intents and purposes.</v>

1506
01:19:54.931 --> 01:19:59.931
<v Speaker 3>Then even the journey south can be part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a broader journey upward and there </v>

1507
01:20:02.191 --> 01:20:07.191
<v Speaker 3>was a famine in the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's mother nature failing to </v>

1508
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 3>cooperate.</v>

1509
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:13.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's got to be pretty disheartening </v>

1510
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.610
<v Speaker 4>for Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you think?</v>

1511
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:16.461
<v Speaker 4>Because he finally gets it together when</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's 75 to leave and then you know,</v>

1512
01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:17.500
<v Speaker 4>because God says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1513
01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.850
<v Speaker 4>let's get going and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the first place he goes,</v>

1514
01:20:20.851 --> 01:20:22.890
<v Speaker 4>everyone's starving to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1515
01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:27.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might think about that as a test of </v>

1516
01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:27.980
<v Speaker 4>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you say?</v>

1517
01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:29.550
<v Speaker 4>But he keeps going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then what happens?</v>

1518
01:20:29.551 --> 01:20:31.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has to go to Egypt so great.</v>

1519
01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where?</v>

1520
01:20:32.581 --> 01:20:34.560
<v Speaker 4>He's starving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where everyone's starving,</v>

1521
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.110
<v Speaker 4>and then to get away from where </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's starving,</v>

1522
01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:42.230
<v Speaker 4>he goes to a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the whole beginning of the story's </v>

1523
01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:46.430
<v Speaker 4>not particularly auspicious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Abraham went down into Egypt to </v>

1524
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:48.390
<v Speaker 4>soldier in there for the famine was </v>
<v Speaker 4>grievous in the land.</v>

1525
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:51.760
<v Speaker 4>It's a repetition of the same idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1526
01:20:51.761 --> 01:20:54.580
<v Speaker 4>There's downhill voyage out into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1527
01:20:54.581 --> 01:20:59.581
<v Speaker 4>It's repeated over and over that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning of Abraham's journey is </v>

1528
01:20:59.581 --> 01:21:01.180
<v Speaker 4>basically a secrets of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1529
01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.400
<v Speaker 4>of experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of exile,</v>

1530
01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:04.690
<v Speaker 4>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tyranny,</v>

1531
01:21:04.691 --> 01:21:09.691
<v Speaker 4>and catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While you should be able to relate to </v>

1532
01:21:09.691 --> 01:21:12.511
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know how hard it is to get things </v>

1533
01:21:12.511 --> 01:21:12.511
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1534
01:21:12.511 --> 01:21:13.690
<v Speaker 4>you go out to do what you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

1535
01:21:13.691 --> 01:21:18.691
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's your be set by the </v>

1536
01:21:18.691 --> 01:21:19.060
<v Speaker 4>intransigence of the world and failure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1537
01:21:19.061 --> 01:21:20.620
<v Speaker 4>so what are you supposed to do about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1538
01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1539
01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:27.010
<v Speaker 4>maintain your faith in the good and </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuing to move forward.</v>

1540
01:21:27.011 --> 01:21:28.870
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And part of that,</v>

1541
01:21:28.871 --> 01:21:31.390
<v Speaker 4>even if even if you don't buy the </v>
<v Speaker 4>metaphor,</v>

1542
01:21:31.391 --> 01:21:33.220
<v Speaker 4>it's like what are you going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead?</v>

1543
01:21:34.330 --> 01:21:38.320
<v Speaker 4>That won't make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even if there,</v>

1544
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:43.330
<v Speaker 4>if it isn't an APP that you're pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 4>your at least for stalling the </v>

1545
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:46.060
<v Speaker 4>transformation of the chaos into your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your life,</v>

1546
01:21:46.061 --> 01:21:49.210
<v Speaker 4>into sheer hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that can certainly happen.</v>

1547
01:21:49.211 --> 01:21:51.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see people who are having a terrible</v>

1548
01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:56.641
<v Speaker 4>time and then you see people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>having a terrible time who were also </v>

1549
01:21:56.641 --> 01:22:00.710
<v Speaker 4>inhale and it's a lot better to just </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a terrible time than to have a </v>

1550
01:22:00.710 --> 01:22:03.040
<v Speaker 4>terrible time and be in hell at the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1551
01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.520
<v Speaker 4>And it came to pass when he was come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>near to enter into Egypt that he said </v>

1552
01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:10.690
<v Speaker 4>unto [inaudible] wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>behold,</v>

1553
01:22:10.691 --> 01:22:13.120
<v Speaker 4>now I know that thou art a fair woman to</v>
<v Speaker 4>look upon,</v>

1554
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:16.210
<v Speaker 4>therefore it shall come to pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the Egyptians cells see the,</v>

1555
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:18.880
<v Speaker 4>that they shall say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is his wife and they will kill me,</v>

1556
01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:21.610
<v Speaker 4>but they will save the alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So look,</v>

1557
01:22:21.611 --> 01:22:23.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham is really having a rough time.</v>

1558
01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:26.410
<v Speaker 4>He's a failure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1559
01:22:26.411 --> 01:22:31.411
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's wandering around through the land </v>

1560
01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:31.411
<v Speaker 4>of starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he's going to go be a cause.</v>

1561
01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:35.841
<v Speaker 4>I slave in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has this incredibly attractive wife </v>

1562
01:22:35.841 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Speaker 4>and all he can look forward to is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that the most successful man in </v>

1563
01:22:40.781 --> 01:22:43.750
<v Speaker 4>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Pharaoh will take her from him.</v>

1564
01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:49.560
<v Speaker 4>So he's got the whole embitterment thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty much nailed down as far as I can </v>

1565
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:54.391
<v Speaker 4>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is when he makes one of his </v>

1566
01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:54.391
<v Speaker 4>errors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>

1567
01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:57.190
<v Speaker 4>And one of the areas that humanizes him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say,</v>

1568
01:22:57.191 --> 01:23:02.191
<v Speaker 4>I pray thee that thou art my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it may be well for me for my sake </v>

1569
01:23:02.191 --> 01:23:03.130
<v Speaker 4>and my soul shall live because of the.</v>

1570
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.270
<v Speaker 4>And it to pass that when Abraham was </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming to Egypt,</v>

1571
01:23:07.271 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 4>the Egyptians beheld the woman that she </v>
<v Speaker 4>was very fair.</v>

1572
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:14.790
<v Speaker 4>The prince is also a pharaoh saw her and</v>
<v Speaker 4>commended her before Pharaoh and the </v>

1573
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:18.361
<v Speaker 4>woman was taken into Pharaoh's house and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he and treated Abraham well for her </v>

1574
01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:21.841
<v Speaker 4>sake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he had sheep and oxen and he asked </v>

1575
01:23:21.841 --> 01:23:22.060
<v Speaker 4>his men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>servants and maid servants she asses and</v>

1576
01:23:22.061 --> 01:23:27.061
<v Speaker 4>camels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So actually things worked out pretty </v>

1577
01:23:27.061 --> 01:23:27.061
<v Speaker 4>well for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for Abraham,</v>

1578
01:23:27.061 --> 01:23:27.280
<v Speaker 4>despite his deceit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1579
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:32.430
<v Speaker 4>Which is quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I guess it's because if the </v>

1580
01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:34.420
<v Speaker 4>overarching structure is solid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

1581
01:23:34.421 --> 01:23:39.421
<v Speaker 4>it's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then then errors can still be forgiven </v>

1582
01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:44.930
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to speak about it from a metaphorical </v>

1583
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:46.981
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the Lord Plagued Pharaoh and his </v>

1584
01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:49.000
<v Speaker 4>house with great plagues because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarah Abraham's wife.</v>

1585
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:55.240
<v Speaker 4>While it doesn't seem very fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because the pharaoh didn't know,</v>

1586
01:23:55.241 --> 01:23:57.820
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not the right way to look at it</v>

1587
01:23:58.180 --> 01:23:59.140
<v Speaker 4>the right way to look at it.</v>

1588
01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:00.830
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a story later in the,</v>

1589
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:05.950
<v Speaker 4>in the Bible about David and David.</v>
<v Speaker 4>David could be a pretty bad guy,</v>

1590
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:12.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so one of the things he does is when he </v>

1591
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.030
<v Speaker 4>becomes king,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1592
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:16.130
<v Speaker 4>he's in his castle and he's looking over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the city and he sees a woman nude </v>

1593
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 4>bathing nude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sunbathing nude on a,</v>

1594
01:24:19.061 --> 01:24:21.220
<v Speaker 4>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a roof out on the city,</v>

1595
01:24:21.221 --> 01:24:24.340
<v Speaker 4>and he's smitten by her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>floored by her,</v>

1596
01:24:24.341 --> 01:24:27.460
<v Speaker 4>and he has inquiries made about who she </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1597
01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:32.730
<v Speaker 4>her name is Bathsheba,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he finds out who her husband is and </v>

1598
01:24:32.730 --> 01:24:37.111
<v Speaker 4>her husband actually happens to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>general in his army and he arranges for </v>

1599
01:24:39.911 --> 01:24:43.210
<v Speaker 4>that generally be put at the thick of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the battle and killed.</v>

1600
01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:48.470
<v Speaker 4>And then he takes Bathsheba.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and,</v>

1601
01:24:48.570 --> 01:24:52.600
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Lord is not pleased by that.</v>

1602
01:24:52.601 --> 01:24:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's interesting.</v>

1603
01:24:55.181 --> 01:25:00.181
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an interesting story because you </v>

1604
01:25:00.181 --> 01:25:03.601
<v Speaker 4>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well why can't the king do whatever the </v>

1605
01:25:03.601 --> 01:25:03.601
<v Speaker 4>hell he wants?</v>

1606
01:25:03.601 --> 01:25:04.070
<v Speaker 4>Like seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1607
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.500
<v Speaker 4>he's the king,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not.</v>

1608
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:08.800
<v Speaker 4>And he's not like the prime minister or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the president,</v>

1609
01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.430
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1610
01:25:09.490 --> 01:25:12.130
<v Speaker 4>he's the king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you might say,</v>

1611
01:25:12.131 --> 01:25:17.131
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is the king subject to any rules </v>

1612
01:25:17.131 --> 01:25:18.871
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the rationale for the king being </v>

1613
01:25:18.871 --> 01:25:20.140
<v Speaker 4>subject to rules?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1614
01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:25.200
<v Speaker 4>the rationality emerges in these stories</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there are social strictures that are </v>

1615
01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:30.361
<v Speaker 4>such that even if the ruler of the land </v>
<v Speaker 4>transgresses against them,</v>

1616
01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:35.610
<v Speaker 4>there will be hell to pay and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>continually presented over and over in </v>

1617
01:25:35.610 --> 01:25:39.040
<v Speaker 4>the biblical stories and it's a natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>law sort of ideas that there are.</v>

1618
01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:44.490
<v Speaker 4>There are intrinsic rules to the game of</v>
<v Speaker 4>social human being and if you and maybe </v>

1619
01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:50.590
<v Speaker 4>intrinsic rules to the to the natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>state of human being,</v>

1620
01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:55.740
<v Speaker 4>you break those rules consciously or </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconsciously at your absolute peril and</v>

1621
01:25:56.831 --> 01:26:00.790
<v Speaker 4>not only at your apparel but at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>peril of the state and it doesn't matter</v>

1622
01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:05.791
<v Speaker 4>who you are and so I would say this </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually an indication of God being fair</v>

1623
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:10.610
<v Speaker 4>rather than being unfair because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rule here is pharaoh or not.</v>

1624
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:16.460
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to take someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 4>wife and the ignorance is no excuse.</v>

1625
01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.640
<v Speaker 4>Now you might say that's a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>harsh and perhaps it is a little bit </v>

1626
01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:21.770
<v Speaker 4>harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not without merit.</v>

1627
01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.460
<v Speaker 4>The idea is not without merit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course Abraham is</v>

1628
01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:31.860
<v Speaker 4>complicit in this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Despite that he is successful and </v>

1629
01:26:32.331 --> 01:26:36.080
<v Speaker 4>Farrell called Abraham and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this that thou has done unto me?</v>

1630
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:38.540
<v Speaker 4>Why did so now tell me that she was very</v>
<v Speaker 4>wife?</v>

1631
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.360
<v Speaker 4>Why said Thou you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She is my sister.</v>

1632
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 4>I might've taken her to me to wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1633
01:26:44.961 --> 01:26:47.600
<v Speaker 4>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>behold thy wife take her and go thy way,</v>

1634
01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.320
<v Speaker 4>and Pharaoh commanded his men concerning</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and they sent them away and his wife</v>

1635
01:26:51.321 --> 01:26:54.820
<v Speaker 4>and all that he had and Abraham went out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Egypt.</v>

1636
01:26:54.821 --> 01:26:57.580
<v Speaker 4>He and his wife and all that he had and </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot with him into the south.</v>

1637
01:26:57.730 --> 01:27:00.820
<v Speaker 4>And Abraham was very rich in cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in silver and in gold.</v>

1638
01:27:01.770 --> 01:27:03.870
<v Speaker 4>And so what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1639
01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:05.590
<v Speaker 4>Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1640
01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:08.340
<v Speaker 4>he goes to the place of famine and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes to the,</v>

1641
01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:14.090
<v Speaker 4>to this place of territory and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he lies and then he almost loses his </v>

1642
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:15.810
<v Speaker 4>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because he goes,</v>

1643
01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.410
<v Speaker 4>things work out for him and so hooray </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>

1644
01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.960
<v Speaker 4>And he went on his journeys from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>south.</v>

1645
01:27:24.961 --> 01:27:29.961
<v Speaker 4>Even the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to the place where his tent had </v>

1646
01:27:29.961 --> 01:27:29.961
<v Speaker 4>been at the beginning between Bethel and</v>
<v Speaker 4>high,</v>

1647
01:27:29.961 --> 01:27:33.950
<v Speaker 4>under the place of the altar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he makes another sacrifice which he </v>

1648
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:36.060
<v Speaker 4>had made there at the first and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham called on the name of the Lord.</v>

1649
01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:37.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he's had an adventure,</v>

1650
01:27:37.411 --> 01:27:37.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1651
01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:38.910
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1652
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:41.030
<v Speaker 4>he's finished his journey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1653
01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:46.060
<v Speaker 4>and so there's a culminating point in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this narrative and now he doesn't know </v>

1654
01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:46.060
<v Speaker 4>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1655
01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:46.740
<v Speaker 4>he's left the place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's out.</v>

1656
01:27:46.741 --> 01:27:51.741
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's time to build an altar and make </v>

1657
01:27:51.741 --> 01:27:54.000
<v Speaker 4>a sacrifice and figure out and to ask </v>
<v Speaker 4>for divine guidance once again to figure</v>

1658
01:27:54.001 --> 01:27:54.390
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1659
01:27:54.391 --> 01:27:56.640
<v Speaker 4>well I'm done that been there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>done that.</v>

1660
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:59.940
<v Speaker 4>What's next?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the question is asked,</v>

1661
01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:02.970
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is something to consider if you</v>

1662
01:28:02.971 --> 01:28:06.720
<v Speaker 4>want to know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ask seriously and say,</v>

1663
01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:11.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to see Abraham sacrifices a </v>
<v Speaker 4>life to his vow.</v>

1664
01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what do you do?</v>

1665
01:28:15.041 --> 01:28:16.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't sacrifice an animal.</v>

1666
01:28:16.721 --> 01:28:18.820
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't make a blood sacrifice.</v>

1667
01:28:18.821 --> 01:28:21.010
<v Speaker 4>You do it psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>

1668
01:28:21.011 --> 01:28:23.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to sacrifice my life to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>aim.</v>

1669
01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.170
<v Speaker 4>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're serious,</v>

1670
01:28:27.171 --> 01:28:28.400
<v Speaker 4>what do I do next?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1671
01:28:28.401 --> 01:28:30.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to sacrifice my life to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>aim.</v>

1672
01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:34.010
<v Speaker 4>What is it that I should do that's worth</v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrificing my life too?</v>

1673
01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 4>That's a serious question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1674
01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:41.900
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's the sort of question that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't ask because they're afraid </v>

1675
01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:42.590
<v Speaker 4>of the seriousness of the question and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the and the what,</v>

1676
01:28:42.591 --> 01:28:47.591
<v Speaker 4>the magnitude of the potential answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you really want to know what you </v>

1677
01:28:47.591 --> 01:28:48.290
<v Speaker 4>should do that would be worth </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrificing your life too?</v>

1678
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the answer is yes because it's worth it,</v>

1679
01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:56.810
<v Speaker 4>but the answer is also no because really</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's your life.</v>

1680
01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:01.220
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're wrong and you're probably,</v>

1681
01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:08.420
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it doesn't matter because maybe </v>

1682
01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:09.810
<v Speaker 3>the rightness is in the process and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the naughty,</v>

1683
01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.010
<v Speaker 3>in the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1684
01:29:11.011 --> 01:29:16.011
<v Speaker 3>Because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the beginning of a sequence of </v>

1685
01:29:16.011 --> 01:29:16.890
<v Speaker 3>decisions as we've already pointed out </v>
<v Speaker 3>unto the place of the altar which he had</v>

1686
01:29:16.891 --> 01:29:21.891
<v Speaker 3>made there at the first and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham called on the name of the Lord </v>

1687
01:29:21.891 --> 01:29:23.700
<v Speaker 3>and Lord also and lot also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which went with Abraham.</v>

1688
01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Abraham had flocks and herds and tents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the land was not able to bear them </v>

1689
01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:32.810
<v Speaker 3>that they might dwell together for their</v>
<v Speaker 3>substance was great so that they could </v>

1690
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:35.661
<v Speaker 3>not dwell together and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>strife between the herdman of Abram's </v>

1691
01:29:35.661 --> 01:29:39.081
<v Speaker 3>cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cowboys and the Herdman have </v>

1692
01:29:39.081 --> 01:29:39.840
<v Speaker 3>launched council and the Canaanite in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the parasite dwelled in the land.</v>

1693
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:41.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's interesting too,</v>

1694
01:29:41.761 --> 01:29:46.761
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abrams having a pretty good time of it </v>

1695
01:29:46.761 --> 01:29:46.761
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1696
01:29:46.761 --> 01:29:46.761
<v Speaker 3>He's out of starvation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1697
01:29:46.761 --> 01:29:49.380
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out of the tyranny now.</v>

1698
01:29:49.381 --> 01:29:52.680
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of wealthy and then the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>flips on him.</v>

1699
01:29:52.681 --> 01:29:55.020
<v Speaker 3>He's wealthy and now a bad thing happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>

1700
01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:57.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got all this wealth and so does his</v>

1701
01:29:57.151 --> 01:29:59.850
<v Speaker 3>nephew and now they can't get along </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have too much stuff.</v>

1702
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:03.660
<v Speaker 3>So that's quite comical as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a comic interlude here.</v>

1703
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Now they handle it properly and Abraham </v>
<v Speaker 3>said unto lot,</v>

1704
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:13.010
<v Speaker 3>let there be no strife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pray thee between me and the in </v>

1705
01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:15.860
<v Speaker 3>between my herdman and I heard because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're brothers is not the whole land </v>

1706
01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:18.060
<v Speaker 3>before the separate thyself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pray thee from me.</v>

1707
01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:23.300
<v Speaker 3>If you'll take the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'll take the right or if you </v>

1708
01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:23.340
<v Speaker 3>depart to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'll go to the left.</v>

1709
01:30:23.341 --> 01:30:25.380
<v Speaker 3>So basically they sit down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1710
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:27.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of us has got to get out of town and</v>

1711
01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:29.430
<v Speaker 3>it can be one or the other.</v>

1712
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:31.350
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can flip a coin here,</v>

1713
01:30:31.351 --> 01:30:32.970
<v Speaker 3>but we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to separate.</v>

1714
01:30:32.971 --> 01:30:37.971
<v Speaker 3>And so they do it amicably and lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifted up his eyes and looked at all of </v>

1715
01:30:38.701 --> 01:30:41.220
<v Speaker 3>the plain of Jordan that it was well </v>
<v Speaker 3>watered everywhere.</v>

1716
01:30:41.221 --> 01:30:42.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's an intimation of Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1717
01:30:42.961 --> 01:30:47.961
<v Speaker 3>Because you remember eating means well </v>
<v Speaker 3>watered place before the Lord destroyed </v>

1718
01:30:47.961 --> 01:30:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Sodom and Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even as the garden of the Lord,</v>

1719
01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:53.160
<v Speaker 3>like the land of Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the outcome is done to soar.</v>

1720
01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.640
<v Speaker 3>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get four shout and we can hear </v>

1721
01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:58.640
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1722
01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.041
<v Speaker 3>So lot and Abraham are making the </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision about where to go and and lot </v>

1723
01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:06.440
<v Speaker 3>looks out and sees a reasonable place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then this warning comes up that </v>

1724
01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:08.640
<v Speaker 3>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a city out there,</v>

1725
01:31:08.641 --> 01:31:12.420
<v Speaker 3>there's a place out there where things </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not going to go well.</v>

1726
01:31:12.421 --> 01:31:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Things are being done badly and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not going to go well.</v>

1727
01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Then lot chosen mold the plaintiff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan and lot journey the eastern,</v>

1728
01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:24.540
<v Speaker 3>they separated themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one from the other Abraham dwelled </v>

1729
01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:28.191
<v Speaker 3>in the land of Canaan in law dwell in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cities of the plain and pitched his </v>

1730
01:31:28.191 --> 01:31:31.131
<v Speaker 3>tent towards Sodom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the men of Sodom were wicked and </v>

1731
01:31:31.131 --> 01:31:34.080
<v Speaker 3>sinners before the Lord exceedingly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the word sin,</v>

1732
01:31:34.081 --> 01:31:37.020
<v Speaker 3>I've mentioned this to you before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an interesting word.</v>

1733
01:31:37.021 --> 01:31:42.021
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the derivation of an archery term </v>

1734
01:31:42.021 --> 01:31:44.750
<v Speaker 3>in my understanding of its derivation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it the Greek word was Hamartia and </v>

1735
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Hamartia is an archery term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means to miss the Bullseye and you</v>

1736
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:54.170
<v Speaker 3>think it's worth thinking about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphorically because you've got to </v>

1737
01:31:54.170 --> 01:31:54.170
<v Speaker 3>think about all the ways that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>miss the Bullseye,</v>

1738
01:31:54.170 --> 01:31:55.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You close your eyes.</v>

1739
01:31:55.650 --> 01:32:00.650
<v Speaker 3>That's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could not lift up the damn bow and </v>

1740
01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Arrow to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could face the wrong way.</v>

1741
01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:06.700
<v Speaker 3>You could be unskilled in your aim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have and I also like the,</v>

1742
01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:11.730
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the archery metaphor because human </v>

1743
01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:11.730
<v Speaker 3>beings are built on a hunting platform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1744
01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:16.680
<v Speaker 3>And we always aim at things were things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were were ballistic creatures on a </v>

1745
01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.640
<v Speaker 3>trajectory always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're always aiming at something.</v>

1746
01:32:18.641 --> 01:32:23.641
<v Speaker 3>We're always aiming at the mark and </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is of course what you do when you </v>

1747
01:32:23.641 --> 01:32:23.641
<v Speaker 3>hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1748
01:32:23.641 --> 01:32:23.680
<v Speaker 3>Because you have to hit the mark </v>
<v Speaker 3>precisely.</v>

1749
01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:29.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we're like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what we're like that </v>

1750
01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:29.290
<v Speaker 3>psychologically we have to aim at </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and then move towards it.</v>

1751
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:32.770
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so to sin is to miss the mark,</v>

1752
01:32:32.771 --> 01:32:35.530
<v Speaker 3>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to miss the Bullseye,</v>

1753
01:32:35.690 --> 01:32:37.120
<v Speaker 3>to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take aim,</v>

1754
01:32:37.121 --> 01:32:41.760
<v Speaker 3>to aim badly dame carelessly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to not aim at all.</v>

1755
01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:43.440
<v Speaker 3>And that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1756
01:32:43.441 --> 01:32:47.900
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a sin of a mission.</v>

1757
01:32:47.901 --> 01:32:52.901
<v Speaker 3>That's to not do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to be wicked is to aim at what </v>

1758
01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:52.901
<v Speaker 3>you know you shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A mad.</v>

1759
01:32:53.090 --> 01:32:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1760
01:32:54.471 --> 01:32:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't think of that as an external </v>
<v Speaker 3>morality precisely.</v>

1761
01:32:57.530 --> 01:33:02.530
<v Speaker 3>I think that you can read the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>biblical narrative again from a </v>

1762
01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:05.861
<v Speaker 3>psychological perspective and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about external codes </v>

1763
01:33:05.861 --> 01:33:07.220
<v Speaker 3>of conduct here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although we could.</v>

1764
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:11.090
<v Speaker 3>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wickedness that's being described is</v>

1765
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:14.920
<v Speaker 3>the act of you doing something that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know to be wrong,</v>

1766
01:33:15.670 --> 01:33:17.260
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1767
01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.150
<v Speaker 3>and you may do something you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's wrong or not.</v>

1768
01:33:19.151 --> 01:33:24.151
<v Speaker 3>That isn't a sort of thing that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about and we're not talking </v>

1769
01:33:24.151 --> 01:33:26.581
<v Speaker 3>about the things that you do that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>right are there that other people think </v>

1770
01:33:26.581 --> 01:33:27.070
<v Speaker 3>are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about those either.</v>

1771
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.710
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about those things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you consciously do,</v>

1772
01:33:29.711 --> 01:33:32.200
<v Speaker 3>although you know them to be wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

1773
01:33:32.710 --> 01:33:37.710
<v Speaker 3>and that's the things that seem to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>people into the most trouble in these </v>

1774
01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:37.900
<v Speaker 3>stories and I believe that to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>

1775
01:33:37.901 --> 01:33:39.880
<v Speaker 3>I think that's very accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychologically,</v>

1776
01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.940
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing because I see this all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1777
01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 3>If you do something wrong and because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ignorant,</v>

1778
01:33:46.090 --> 01:33:48.670
<v Speaker 3>you don't know better and it doesn't go </v>
<v Speaker 3>well for you,</v>

1779
01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:54.540
<v Speaker 3>that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you do something wrong and you </v>

1780
01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:56.851
<v Speaker 3>know it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the punishment is is manifold and I </v>

1781
01:33:56.851 --> 01:34:01.381
<v Speaker 3>think the reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the reason for that is because </v>

1782
01:34:01.381 --> 01:34:02.410
<v Speaker 3>that makes you cane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means you betray your own ideal,</v>

1783
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just don't know,</v>

1784
01:34:04.241 --> 01:34:05.200
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't been trained,</v>

1785
01:34:05.201 --> 01:34:07.270
<v Speaker 3>your ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just not together,</v>

1786
01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:12.280
<v Speaker 3>you maybe you're even willfully blind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you do something you know to be </v>

1787
01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:15.601
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you've betrayed your own ideal and </v>

1788
01:34:15.601 --> 01:34:15.601
<v Speaker 3>that lands you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cain says to God,</v>

1789
01:34:15.601 --> 01:34:16.300
<v Speaker 3>once Kayden destroys able,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

1790
01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:18.100
<v Speaker 3>I cannot bear my punishment,</v>

1791
01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:27.840
<v Speaker 3>and the Lord said unto Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after that lot was separated from lift </v>

1792
01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.741
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now look upward and look from the place </v>

1793
01:34:31.741 --> 01:34:36.481
<v Speaker 3>where they'll are northward and </v>
<v Speaker 3>southward and eastward and westward for </v>

1794
01:34:36.481 --> 01:34:39.010
<v Speaker 3>all the land which thou seest to thee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will give it and the seed forever,</v>

1795
01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:44.640
<v Speaker 3>and then we'll make those seat as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dust of the earth so that if a man can </v>

1796
01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.970
<v Speaker 3>number the dust of the earth than shell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all thy seed be numbered.</v>

1797
01:34:46.930 --> 01:34:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Arise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk through the land and the length of </v>

1798
01:34:51.930 --> 01:34:51.930
<v Speaker 3>it and the breadth of it for I will give</v>
<v Speaker 3>it unto thee</v>

1799
01:34:56.630 --> 01:34:59.780
<v Speaker 4>in the Cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At short,</v>

1800
01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I can't say that properly because my </v>
<v Speaker 4>French is nonexistent.</v>

1801
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:11.320
<v Speaker 4>So a cathedral is a cross and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation takes place at the crux </v>

1802
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:16.421
<v Speaker 4>of the cross,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly right because the the </v>

1803
01:35:16.421 --> 01:35:19.420
<v Speaker 4>transformation takes place at the point </v>
<v Speaker 4>of maximal suffering and the cathedral </v>

1804
01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:21.470
<v Speaker 4>is designed to indicate that right </v>
<v Speaker 4>symbolically.</v>

1805
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:22.460
<v Speaker 4>Now</v>

1806
01:35:27.410 --> 01:35:32.410
<v Speaker 4>what happens in a religious ceremony is </v>
<v Speaker 4>also a journey and it's a journey in </v>

1807
01:35:32.410 --> 01:35:36.971
<v Speaker 4>some senses to the holy city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then that's also played out in the </v>

1808
01:35:36.971 --> 01:35:36.971
<v Speaker 4>idea of pilgrimage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1809
01:35:36.971 --> 01:35:38.540
<v Speaker 4>Because you go to the holy city,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>

1810
01:35:38.541 --> 01:35:41.720
<v Speaker 4>you go to Jerusalem or wherever it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you think the holy city is.</v>

1811
01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:47.200
<v Speaker 4>You go there and that takes you out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your country and away from your kid and </v>

1812
01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.110
<v Speaker 4>away from your family into the strange </v>
<v Speaker 4>land.</v>

1813
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:51.260
<v Speaker 4>And as you make the journey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you transform and when you come back,</v>

1814
01:35:51.261 --> 01:35:53.300
<v Speaker 4>you're not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the Hobbit,</v>

1815
01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the story of the hobbit.</v>

1816
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:58.190
<v Speaker 4>But let's say you can't afford to go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>a pilgrimage.</v>

1817
01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:03.940
<v Speaker 4>So you go to the cathedral at chart and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a huge maze on the ground and </v>

1818
01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:05.480
<v Speaker 4>it's the world north,</v>
<v Speaker 4>west,</v>

1819
01:36:05.481 --> 01:36:07.820
<v Speaker 4>south and east,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just as God describes here.</v>

1820
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:13.570
<v Speaker 4>So it's laid out and you enter the maize</v>
<v Speaker 4>at one side and in the middle is a stone</v>

1821
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:19.010
<v Speaker 4>pattern that looks like a flower and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

1822
01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:23.240
<v Speaker 4>It's the place where being wells fourth </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's at the center of the Cathedral,</v>

1823
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:27.380
<v Speaker 4>and what that means is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>accept your suffering,</v>

1824
01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:30.920
<v Speaker 4>then you move to the place where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>spirit of being wells fourth,</v>

1825
01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:35.980
<v Speaker 4>that's what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you enter the the maze and you </v>

1826
01:36:36.471 --> 01:36:41.471
<v Speaker 4>walk and it's divided into quadrants and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you walk one quadrant completely and </v>

1827
01:36:42.171 --> 01:36:47.171
<v Speaker 4>then the main pathway takes you into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next quadrant and you walked that </v>

1828
01:36:47.171 --> 01:36:48.410
<v Speaker 4>completely and then it takes you to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>third one and the fourth one.</v>

1829
01:36:48.411 --> 01:36:51.680
<v Speaker 4>And then when you walk the maze </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely everywhere.</v>

1830
01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:53.690
<v Speaker 4>When you've gone everywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

1831
01:36:53.691 --> 01:36:54.500
<v Speaker 4>north,</v>
<v Speaker 4>south,</v>

1832
01:36:54.501 --> 01:36:55.610
<v Speaker 4>east and west,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you've.</v>

1833
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:59.420
<v Speaker 4>When you've traversed the territory </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely,</v>

1834
01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:02.180
<v Speaker 4>then you come to the center and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's yours.</v>

1835
01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:07.780
<v Speaker 4>And that's what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've noticed when I've been </v>

1836
01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:07.780
<v Speaker 4>renovating houses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to do that.</v>

1837
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
<v Speaker 4>I paid a lot of attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological process of house </v>

1838
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.110
<v Speaker 4>renovation because I learned from young </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you said this,</v>

1839
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:20.530
<v Speaker 4>this is something man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said because he was.</v>

1840
01:37:20.531 --> 01:37:23.080
<v Speaker 4>He was talking about the stages of </v>
<v Speaker 4>integration,</v>

1841
01:37:23.081 --> 01:37:26.050
<v Speaker 4>psychological integration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he looked beyond piaget.</v>

1842
01:37:26.051 --> 01:37:27.700
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1843
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.890
<v Speaker 4>although piaget looked very far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

1844
01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:32.170
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a conjunction.</v>

1845
01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:36.030
<v Speaker 4>You have to get your rationality on your</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion together.</v>

1846
01:37:36.210 --> 01:37:37.830
<v Speaker 4>That's a male,</v>
<v Speaker 4>female conjunction,</v>

1847
01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:40.530
<v Speaker 4>symbolically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>male rationality,</v>

1848
01:37:40.531 --> 01:37:42.870
<v Speaker 4>female emotionality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to bring those together so that</v>

1849
01:37:42.871 --> 01:37:47.871
<v Speaker 4>they're oriented in the same direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your emotions in your rationale will be </v>

1850
01:37:47.871 --> 01:37:51.471
<v Speaker 4>served the same purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then you're unified in mind and </v>

1851
01:37:51.471 --> 01:37:51.471
<v Speaker 4>spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1852
01:37:51.471 --> 01:37:53.490
<v Speaker 4>but that's sort of good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you've got that together,</v>

1853
01:37:53.491 --> 01:37:55.260
<v Speaker 4>then there's a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have a body,</v>

1854
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 4>and then that's</v>

1855
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 3>a male female conjunction again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a divine conjunction,</v>

1856
01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.720
<v Speaker 3>the recreation of Adam before his </v>
<v Speaker 3>division into female and male,</v>

1857
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:07.800
<v Speaker 3>and the reconstruction of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>androgynous Christ that all that,</v>

1858
01:38:07.801 --> 01:38:12.801
<v Speaker 3>all those ideas are linked together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you have your emotion and your </v>

1859
01:38:12.801 --> 01:38:14.250
<v Speaker 3>rationality moving in the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction,</v>

1860
01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:19.820
<v Speaker 3>but you're not acting it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you have to unite that abstract </v>

1861
01:38:19.981 --> 01:38:24.150
<v Speaker 3>part of you with your body and start </v>
<v Speaker 3>acting out what you think and feel,</v>

1862
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:27.570
<v Speaker 3>and that's the next conjunction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the last one.</v>

1863
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:32.310
<v Speaker 3>The last conjunction is when you realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is no distinction between you</v>

1864
01:38:32.311 --> 01:38:37.311
<v Speaker 3>and your experience there the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then when you put together your </v>

1865
01:38:37.381 --> 01:38:39.330
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're putting together yourself.</v>

1866
01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:45.120
<v Speaker 3>So I've noticed when I've lived in </v>
<v Speaker 3>places rented or owned,</v>

1867
01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:48.120
<v Speaker 3>didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then if there were part of the place,</v>

1868
01:38:48.121 --> 01:38:51.090
<v Speaker 3>if there was a part of the place that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't attended to,</v>

1869
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:53.760
<v Speaker 3>whatever that might mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might meant cleaned.</v>

1870
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:59.360
<v Speaker 3>It might've meant fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it certainly meant at least </v>

1871
01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.060
<v Speaker 3>thoroughly investigated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that was chaos.</v>

1872
01:39:00.061 --> 01:39:02.520
<v Speaker 3>It was like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the desert.</v>

1873
01:39:02.521 --> 01:39:04.380
<v Speaker 3>That part that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a way of thinking about it.</v>

1874
01:39:04.381 --> 01:39:06.450
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if I owned it wasn't mine.</v>

1875
01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:11.690
<v Speaker 3>I had to interact with it before it </v>
<v Speaker 3>became mine and I had to interact with </v>

1876
01:39:11.690 --> 01:39:14.010
<v Speaker 3>it and I had to put it in order and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>it became mine and then.</v>

1877
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:17.010
<v Speaker 3>And then to the degree that it became </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine and was in order,</v>

1878
01:39:17.011 --> 01:39:22.011
<v Speaker 3>then I was also put an order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you know that because you go into </v>

1879
01:39:22.011 --> 01:39:24.570
<v Speaker 3>places that make you uncomfortable and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's your own house,</v>

1880
01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.010
<v Speaker 3>it's highly probable.</v>

1881
01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.570
<v Speaker 3>It's highly probable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1882
01:39:27.571 --> 01:39:28.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walk into,</v>

1883
01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:31.710
<v Speaker 3>well Chinese doctors do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Traditional Chinese doctors,</v>

1884
01:39:31.711 --> 01:39:36.711
<v Speaker 3>they go into place people's place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they diagnosed their health conditions </v>

1885
01:39:36.711 --> 01:39:38.790
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the balance of Yin and Yang chaos and</v>

1886
01:39:38.791 --> 01:39:41.400
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They walk into a house that this is easy</v>

1887
01:39:41.401 --> 01:39:42.630
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You walk into a house,</v>

1888
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:44.430
<v Speaker 3>there's too much chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1889
01:39:44.431 --> 01:39:49.050
<v Speaker 3>you can detect that in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is out of order and chaotic.</v>

1890
01:39:49.051 --> 01:39:54.051
<v Speaker 3>You don't even want to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You certainly don't want to open the </v>

1891
01:39:54.051 --> 01:39:54.051
<v Speaker 3>refrigerator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

1892
01:39:54.051 --> 01:39:55.860
<v Speaker 3>And there are things that should've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>done years ago,</v>

1893
01:39:55.861 --> 01:39:58.440
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every one of those things is a fight</v>

1894
01:39:58.441 --> 01:40:01.050
<v Speaker 3>that hasn't happened and something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been avoided.</v>

1895
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.690
<v Speaker 3>And you can't even walk in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain your health.</v>

1896
01:40:03.691 --> 01:40:08.691
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you walk in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sicker than you were when you </v>

1897
01:40:08.691 --> 01:40:08.691
<v Speaker 3>were outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one sort of place.</v>

1898
01:40:08.691 --> 01:40:13.490
<v Speaker 3>And then another sort of places you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and you look at the living room and </v>

1899
01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:19.190
<v Speaker 3>the person has vacuum the living room </v>
<v Speaker 3>rug and the lines that were vacuumed are</v>

1900
01:40:20.221 --> 01:40:25.221
<v Speaker 3>parallel to one another and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>furniture is covered with plastic and </v>

1901
01:40:25.921 --> 01:40:30.921
<v Speaker 3>you get a glass of water and then just </v>
<v Speaker 3>as you're going to set it down on the </v>

1902
01:40:30.921 --> 01:40:33.741
<v Speaker 3>coffee table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person rushes over and puts a </v>

1903
01:40:33.741 --> 01:40:35.991
<v Speaker 3>coaster underneath it and everything in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that house says to you that it would be </v>

1904
01:40:35.991 --> 01:40:40.100
<v Speaker 3>a lot more perfect in that house if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were either not there or dad and that's.</v>

1905
01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's the message that the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>house is blasting at you.</v>

1906
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:49.070
<v Speaker 3>And if you happen to live there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to be sick and what </v>

1907
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:50.100
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be sick from is too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>

1908
01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:53.470
<v Speaker 3>And in the other house you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be sick from too much chaos.</v>

1909
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:59.130
<v Speaker 4>And so when you interact with the house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the unexplored parts are the chaos that </v>

1910
01:41:02.361 --> 01:41:07.361
<v Speaker 4>had the parts that you have not yet </v>
<v Speaker 4>contended with are the chaos that has </v>

1911
01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:11.120
<v Speaker 4>not yet been transformed by your </v>
<v Speaker 4>embodied logos.</v>

1912
01:41:11.210 --> 01:41:15.560
<v Speaker 4>Action into habitable territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it does not belong to you.</v>

1913
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:21.990
<v Speaker 4>Arise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk through the land in the length of </v>

1914
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:21.990
<v Speaker 4>it and the breadth of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for I will give it unto thee,</v>

1915
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:26.670
<v Speaker 4>the neighbor and removed his tent and </v>
<v Speaker 4>came and dwelt in the plaintiff camera </v>

1916
01:41:26.670 --> 01:41:27.850
<v Speaker 4>which is in Hebrew and in built there an</v>
<v Speaker 4>altar unto the Lord.</v>

1917
01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.500
<v Speaker 4>And it came to pass in the days of </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

1918
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:34.960
<v Speaker 4>King of Shinar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arioch,</v>

1919
01:41:34.961 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 4>King of Lsr cheered a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of kings,</v>

1920
01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:40.540
<v Speaker 4>we won't talk about them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These made war with Barrett,</v>

1921
01:41:40.541 --> 01:41:42.640
<v Speaker 4>King of Sodom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and with Burger King of Gomorrah,</v>

1922
01:41:43.210 --> 01:41:45.640
<v Speaker 4>she nap king of Admah and the king of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bela,</v>

1923
01:41:45.641 --> 01:41:50.641
<v Speaker 4>which is your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these were joined together in the </v>

1924
01:41:50.641 --> 01:41:51.860
<v Speaker 4>veil of system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the salt sea [inaudible].</v>

1925
01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is actually very much relevant </v>

1926
01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:58.570
<v Speaker 4>today because you see the veil of see </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1927
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.840
<v Speaker 4>which is the salt sea is the farthest </v>
<v Speaker 4>south you can go if south is down </v>

1928
01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:07.690
<v Speaker 4>because it's the Dead Sea and the Dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sea is the lowest place that there is.</v>

1929
01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:12.370
<v Speaker 4>So what's happened is that there's chaos</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the lowest place that there is.</v>

1930
01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:17.700
<v Speaker 4>That's what this story says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what happens to Lord as he gets </v>

1931
01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:18.970
<v Speaker 4>tangled up in the chaos of the lowest </v>
<v Speaker 4>place that there is,</v>

1932
01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:30.160
<v Speaker 4>and in the 14th year came chedorlaomer </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the kings that were with him and </v>

1933
01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.760
<v Speaker 4>smote the Ref fames and asteroid name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the zooms and Hammond,</v>

1934
01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:37.780
<v Speaker 4>the eminence and Chava Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Korea theme and the whites in their </v>

1935
01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:38.750
<v Speaker 4>mount sire onto elpar in which is by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wilderness.</v>

1936
01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:41.180
<v Speaker 4>And they returned and came to end </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mishpat,</v>

1937
01:42:41.181 --> 01:42:43.250
<v Speaker 4>which has Kadesh and smote all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

1938
01:42:43.251 --> 01:42:46.370
<v Speaker 4>The male acolytes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amalekites,</v>

1939
01:42:46.371 --> 01:42:51.371
<v Speaker 4>and the amorites that dwelt in has a has</v>
<v Speaker 4>is zoned to my.</v>

1940
01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:55.610
<v Speaker 4>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey has azonto mark.</v>

1941
01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:00.640
<v Speaker 4>There we go perhaps and their window </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the King of Sodom and the king of </v>

1942
01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:03.731
<v Speaker 4>Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the king of Admah and the king of </v>

1943
01:43:03.731 --> 01:43:03.731
<v Speaker 4>Babylon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the king of Bela.</v>

1944
01:43:03.731 --> 01:43:03.770
<v Speaker 4>The same as Zara.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they joined,</v>

1945
01:43:03.771 --> 01:43:08.771
<v Speaker 4>battled with them in the veil of sodium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is absolute chaos and mayhem in </v>

1946
01:43:09.141 --> 01:43:11.750
<v Speaker 4>the lowest place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hell essentially</v>

1947
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:19.390
<v Speaker 4>with Cheddar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little more of the king of a lamb and </v>

1948
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.390
<v Speaker 4>with title of King,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Nations.</v>

1949
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:22.361
<v Speaker 4>And Amarillo fail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>King of Shinar and area king of Ella's </v>

1950
01:43:22.361 --> 01:43:23.570
<v Speaker 4>or four kings with five and the veil of </v>
<v Speaker 4>system was full of slime pits.</v>

1951
01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Low inhale like with war isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had to throw the slime pits in </v>

1952
01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:30.380
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently around the Dead Sea.</v>

1953
01:43:30.381 --> 01:43:35.381
<v Speaker 4>There are pits of a bite bitumen like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the like the tar pits in near La and so </v>

1954
01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:40.751
<v Speaker 4>that this seems to actually be </v>
<v Speaker 4>historically accurate and the kings of </v>

1955
01:43:40.751 --> 01:43:41.390
<v Speaker 4>Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've remained,</v>

1956
01:43:41.391 --> 01:43:46.391
<v Speaker 4>fled to the mountain and they took their</v>
<v Speaker 4>goods and they took all the goods of </v>

1957
01:43:46.391 --> 01:43:49.301
<v Speaker 4>Sodom and Gomorrah and all their </v>
<v Speaker 4>victuals and went their way and they </v>

1958
01:43:49.301 --> 01:43:50.690
<v Speaker 4>took lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom</v>

1959
01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 4>and his in departed.</v>

1960
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:57.110
<v Speaker 3>So Abraham has a family member who falls</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the lowest place and there came one</v>

1961
01:43:57.111 --> 01:44:02.111
<v Speaker 3>that had escaped and told Abraham the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hebrew for he dwelt in the plaintiff or </v>

1962
01:44:02.111 --> 01:44:03.380
<v Speaker 3>the amorite brother of his goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And brother vainer.</v>

1963
01:44:03.410 --> 01:44:08.410
<v Speaker 3>And these were confederate with Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when Abraham heard that his brother </v>

1964
01:44:08.410 --> 01:44:09.140
<v Speaker 3>was taken captive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He armed his trained servants,</v>

1965
01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:11.450
<v Speaker 3>born in his own house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>318,</v>

1966
01:44:11.451 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 3>and pursued them on to Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1967
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:15.410
<v Speaker 3>so now we also know that Abraham is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty brave guy,</v>

1968
01:44:15.411 --> 01:44:20.411
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets word that this horrible war has </v>

1969
01:44:20.411 --> 01:44:23.411
<v Speaker 3>broken out in the worst of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>places and that his nephew is involved </v>

1970
01:44:23.411 --> 01:44:27.230
<v Speaker 3>in the first thing he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His mountaintop is posy and get the hell</v>

1971
01:44:27.231 --> 01:44:30.260
<v Speaker 3>in there and rescue his nephew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Abraham's no,</v>

1972
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:33.680
<v Speaker 3>whatever goodness is from the Old </v>
<v Speaker 3>Testament perspective,</v>

1973
01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:35.870
<v Speaker 3>it isn't harmlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1974
01:44:35.871 --> 01:44:38.420
<v Speaker 3>It isn't emasculation and castration.</v>

1975
01:44:38.690 --> 01:44:42.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not that it's not weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the inability to fight,</v>

1976
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:47.590
<v Speaker 3>none of that is associated with virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the sort of strength and enable </v>

1977
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:50.420
<v Speaker 3>someone to mountain arm team of 300 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people when he finds out that his nephew</v>

1978
01:44:50.421 --> 01:44:55.421
<v Speaker 3>is being kidnapped in a terrible war and</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get the hell out there and take them </v>

1979
01:44:55.421 --> 01:44:56.240
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>

1980
01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:57.570
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

1981
01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:03.140
<v Speaker 3>that's a call to two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a coal to power that not,</v>

1982
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.950
<v Speaker 3>not a kind of peaceful meekness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny too,</v>

1983
01:45:06.951 --> 01:45:09.350
<v Speaker 3>because you know there's a line in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>new testament,</v>

1984
01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:14.560
<v Speaker 3>the meek shall inherit the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to look at my phone for a sec </v>

1985
01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:14.560
<v Speaker 3>here because I don't know what time it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1986
01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.000
<v Speaker 3>There's a line in the new testament that</v>
<v Speaker 3>says it's in the sermon on the mount,</v>

1987
01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:23.020
<v Speaker 3>says the meek shall inherit the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that I read that line always </v>

1988
01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:23.020
<v Speaker 3>bothered me.</v>

1989
01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:23.020
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

1990
01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:23.930
<v Speaker 3>That's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not right.</v>

1991
01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Knee can't be the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I was doing the story of Noah </v>

1992
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:31.160
<v Speaker 3>and talking about the sermon on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mount,</v>

1993
01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:34.070
<v Speaker 3>I spent a bunch of time looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>commentaries on that line,</v>

1994
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:35.880
<v Speaker 3>looking at the roots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1995
01:45:35.881 --> 01:45:40.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Greek roots in the Hebrew roots and </v>

1996
01:45:40.881 --> 01:45:41.780
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out what that meant and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it meat does not mean meek.</v>

1997
01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:44.120
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what it means.</v>

1998
01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Those who have weapons and know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use them,</v>

1999
01:45:47.181 --> 01:45:50.600
<v Speaker 3>but still keep the machine will inherit </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>

2000
01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:53.270
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot different,</v>

2001
01:45:53.271 --> 01:45:55.910
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot better,</v>

2002
01:45:56.210 --> 01:45:58.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the way it's normally knits,</v>

2003
01:45:58.341 --> 01:46:02.960
<v Speaker 3>normally interpreted is if you're so </v>
<v Speaker 3>weak that your harmless,</v>

2004
01:46:02.961 --> 01:46:04.880
<v Speaker 3>then things will go well for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2005
01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:06.350
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not right.</v>

2006
01:46:06.351 --> 01:46:08.420
<v Speaker 3>That's and that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can't be right.</v>

2007
01:46:08.421 --> 01:46:13.421
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't fit with the narrative is </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly doesn't fit with this </v>

2008
01:46:13.421 --> 01:46:14.180
<v Speaker 3>narrative and he divided himself against</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2009
01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:18.130
<v Speaker 3>He and his servants by night and smoke </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and pursued them into Hobart,</v>

2010
01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:23.140
<v Speaker 3>which is on the left side of Damascus </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he brought back all the goods and </v>

2011
01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:25.550
<v Speaker 3>his brother lot and his goods and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>women also ended the people.</v>

2012
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:31.330
<v Speaker 3>Good work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham and the kings of Sodom went out </v>

2013
01:46:31.330 --> 01:46:34.631
<v Speaker 3>to meet him after his return at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughter of Charitable Omer and of the </v>

2014
01:46:34.631 --> 01:46:36.560
<v Speaker 3>kings that there were there with him at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Valley of [inaudible],</v>

2015
01:46:36.561 --> 01:46:41.561
<v Speaker 3>which is the king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stale and Melchizedek King of Salem </v>

2016
01:46:41.561 --> 01:46:43.550
<v Speaker 3>brought forth bread and wine and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the priest of the most high God.</v>

2017
01:46:43.551 --> 01:46:46.430
<v Speaker 3>And he blessed him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blessed be Abraham of the Most High God,</v>

2018
01:46:46.431 --> 01:46:51.431
<v Speaker 3>possessor of heaven and earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and blessed be the most high God which </v>

2019
01:46:51.431 --> 01:46:51.431
<v Speaker 3>has delivered</v>

2020
01:46:51.431 --> 01:46:53.880
<v Speaker 4>thine enemies into thy hand and gave him</v>
<v Speaker 4>tithes of all.</v>

2021
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:59.410
<v Speaker 4>And the King of Sodom said to Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give me the person's intake diet goods </v>

2022
01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:02.661
<v Speaker 4>to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the goods that Abraham Abraham </v>

2023
01:47:02.661 --> 01:47:05.910
<v Speaker 4>rescued right out of the kinks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Abraham said to the King of Sodom,</v>

2024
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:09.420
<v Speaker 4>I have lift up my hand unto the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

2025
01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:11.760
<v Speaker 4>It means I've made a vow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it means.</v>

2026
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:14.460
<v Speaker 4>That that's what that phrase means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've made a vow to God,</v>

2027
01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:19.490
<v Speaker 4>the possessor of heaven and earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I will not take anything from a </v>

2028
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:22.500
<v Speaker 4>thread even to a shoelace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't take anything that's yours.</v>

2029
01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:25.320
<v Speaker 4>Less you should say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've made a broom.</v>

2030
01:47:25.321 --> 01:47:30.321
<v Speaker 4>Rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take only that which my young men </v>

2031
01:47:30.321 --> 01:47:33.471
<v Speaker 4>have eaten and the portion of men that </v>
<v Speaker 4>went with me and Aner Eshkol and let </v>

2032
01:47:33.471 --> 01:47:37.830
<v Speaker 4>them take their portion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so Abraham decides here he's,</v>

2033
01:47:38.050 --> 01:47:43.050
<v Speaker 4>he's made this immense sacrifice and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and done this incredibly brave act and </v>

2034
01:47:43.050 --> 01:47:43.800
<v Speaker 4>rescued his nephew.</v>

2035
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:48.570
<v Speaker 4>And rescued the king's goods and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>offer him a reward and he says,</v>

2036
01:47:48.571 --> 01:47:53.571
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to take the reward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that he </v>

2037
01:47:53.571 --> 01:47:54.910
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to contaminate the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2038
01:47:55.150 --> 01:47:57.570
<v Speaker 4>the ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>purity of his actions.</v>

2039
01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:00.300
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't want to be paid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't want it.</v>

2040
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:04.510
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't want to benefit from doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't want to have.</v>

2041
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000
<v Speaker 4>What is it exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't want to benefit </v>

2042
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:10.000
<v Speaker 4>inappropriately from doing the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2043
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.060
<v Speaker 4>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's another testament to his </v>

2044
01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:14.160
<v Speaker 4>character in a very complex testament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2045
01:48:14.161 --> 01:48:18.150
<v Speaker 4>Because he's not a CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not a good man in any simple sense.</v>

2046
01:48:18.151 --> 01:48:19.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look what's just happened.</v>

2047
01:48:19.381 --> 01:48:21.150
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's mounted and armed.</v>

2048
01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:24.660
<v Speaker 4>He's mounted in armed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2049
01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2050
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.440
<v Speaker 4>he's led an army into battle and park </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2051
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:33.470
<v Speaker 4>and participated in a slaughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He refuses to benefit from it except to </v>

2052
01:48:33.901 --> 01:48:35.250
<v Speaker 4>get back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was his.</v>

2053
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:40.310
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He refuses to benefit from it except to </v>

2054
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:41.850
<v Speaker 4>get back what was rightfully his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in that way,</v>

2055
01:48:41.851 --> 01:48:43.710
<v Speaker 4>he maintains his covenant with God</v>

2056
01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:51.060
<v Speaker 4>even to a shoe latchet I anything don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever so smaller mean less dao should </v>

2057
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:53.050
<v Speaker 4>claim a share with God and the honor due</v>
<v Speaker 4>to him.</v>

2058
01:48:54.190 --> 01:48:59.190
<v Speaker 4>This is from Matthew Pool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was an English nonconformists </v>

2059
01:48:59.190 --> 01:48:59.620
<v Speaker 4>theologian commenting on that line even </v>
<v Speaker 4>to a shoe latchet.</v>

2060
01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.470
<v Speaker 4>Anything they'll never saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaner,</v>

2061
01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:04.060
<v Speaker 4>small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lest thou should claim a share with God.</v>

2062
01:49:04.061 --> 01:49:06.450
<v Speaker 4>And the honor due to him to his blessing</v>
<v Speaker 4>alone,</v>

2063
01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:09.070
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I will own my riches or less,</v>

2064
01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.470
<v Speaker 4>thou should say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham is enriched with my spoils.</v>

2065
01:49:11.471 --> 01:49:13.930
<v Speaker 4>And however he pretended kindness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>charity,</v>

2066
01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:17.860
<v Speaker 4>yet indeed it was his covetousness that </v>
<v Speaker 4>put them upon this work.</v>

2067
01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:24.420
<v Speaker 4>After these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the word of the Lord came unto Abraham </v>

2068
01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:24.420
<v Speaker 4>and division saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear not Abraham.</v>

2069
01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:29.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm a shield and die exceedingly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I exceeding great reward the vision </v>

2070
01:49:29.361 --> 01:49:34.140
<v Speaker 4>issue again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2071
01:49:34.141 --> 01:49:39.141
<v Speaker 4>we went through that last week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fear Not Abraham,</v>

2072
01:49:39.371 --> 01:49:41.270
<v Speaker 4>I am Thy Shield and thy exceeding great </v>
<v Speaker 4>reward.</v>

2073
01:49:41.271 --> 01:49:42.940
<v Speaker 4>And Abraham said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord God,</v>

2074
01:49:42.941 --> 01:49:46.950
<v Speaker 4>what can you give me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seeing as I'm childless tagless?</v>

2075
01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.050
<v Speaker 4>And that's the only thing that matters </v>
<v Speaker 4>table at this point,</v>

2076
01:49:50.051 --> 01:49:53.080
<v Speaker 4>and the steward of my house is this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>easier of Dem Damascus,</v>

2077
01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:55.330
<v Speaker 4>no kin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Abraham said,</v>

2078
01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:56.920
<v Speaker 4>Abraham said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>behold to me,</v>

2079
01:49:56.921 --> 01:50:01.150
<v Speaker 4>thou has given no seed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Lo one born in my house is mine.</v>

2080
01:50:01.151 --> 01:50:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Air and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the word of the Lord came unto him</v>

2081
01:50:06.230 --> 01:50:08.420
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this shall not be there in heir,</v>

2082
01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:11.840
<v Speaker 4>but he that shall come forth out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>known bottle should be nine here.</v>

2083
01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:14.990
<v Speaker 4>So he gets promised the impossible once </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2084
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:17.750
<v Speaker 4>and he brought him forth abroad and </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2085
01:50:17.751 --> 01:50:22.751
<v Speaker 4>now look towards the heaven and tell the</v>
<v Speaker 4>stars if that will be able to number </v>

2086
01:50:22.751 --> 01:50:22.751
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said unto him,</v>

2087
01:50:22.751 --> 01:50:27.640
<v Speaker 4>so shall thy seed be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he believed in the Lord and he </v>

2088
01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:30.670
<v Speaker 4>counted to him for righteousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seeing that this,</v>

2089
01:50:32.501 --> 01:50:34.030
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the covenant idea,</v>

2090
01:50:34.031 --> 01:50:36.340
<v Speaker 4>this belief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because here's the belief.</v>

2091
01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:45.360
<v Speaker 4>It's the willingness to act as if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world is constructed so that if you do </v>

2092
01:50:45.821 --> 01:50:50.490
<v Speaker 4>the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best possible outcome will occur.</v>

2093
01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:53.070
<v Speaker 4>It's a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the covenant,</v>

2094
01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a decision about how to live in the</v>

2095
01:50:55.141 --> 01:50:58.560
<v Speaker 4>world because the evidence can't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>there before you make the decision.</v>

2096
01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you might hedge your bets,</v>

2097
01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:06.300
<v Speaker 4>you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when Christ comes back in the book of </v>

2098
01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:08.661
<v Speaker 4>revelation to judge people because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes back as a judge and virtually </v>

2099
01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:12.111
<v Speaker 4>everyone gets cast out with the chaff </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not saved with the wheat and he,</v>

2100
01:51:13.890 --> 01:51:18.890
<v Speaker 4>he says something very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He appears in the vision with a sword </v>

2101
01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:21.731
<v Speaker 4>coming out of his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a horrifying vision and he divides </v>

2102
01:51:21.731 --> 01:51:24.530
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He divides humanity into the damned,</v>

2103
01:51:24.531 --> 01:51:25.910
<v Speaker 4>in the safe or the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2104
01:51:25.911 --> 01:51:29.120
<v Speaker 4>the damned and the saved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says something very interesting.</v>

2105
01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:30.260
<v Speaker 4>He says</v>

2106
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:37.100
<v Speaker 4>to those who were neither hot nor cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will spew you out of my mouth.</v>

2107
01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.670
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

2108
01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:39.590
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2109
01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:41.780
<v Speaker 4>it's a disgust metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2110
01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:47.200
<v Speaker 4>T?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what it says is that the worst </v>

2111
01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.781
<v Speaker 4>punishment isn't waiting for those who </v>
<v Speaker 4>committed to something and did wrong.</v>

2112
01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:59.880
<v Speaker 4>The worst punishment is reserved for </v>
<v Speaker 4>those who committed to nothing and </v>

2113
01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.440
<v Speaker 4>stayed on the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's really something to.</v>

2114
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:03.880
<v Speaker 4>That's really something to think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2115
01:52:03.881 --> 01:52:07.810
<v Speaker 4>And it's also something that I believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be true because I see that stacy,</v>

2116
01:52:07.811 --> 01:52:09.070
<v Speaker 4>this is</v>

2117
01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:13.370
<v Speaker 4>utterly destructive because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>progress.</v>

2118
01:52:13.371 --> 01:52:18.371
<v Speaker 4>All the resist movement backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's aging and suffering and no </v>

2119
01:52:18.371 --> 01:52:21.851
<v Speaker 4>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so to not commit to anything is the </v>

2120
01:52:21.851 --> 01:52:24.851
<v Speaker 4>worst of all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Transgressions to commit means to put </v>

2121
01:52:24.851 --> 01:52:29.231
<v Speaker 4>your body and soul into something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To offer your life as a sacrifice means </v>

2122
01:52:29.231 --> 01:52:32.561
<v Speaker 4>that you're willing to make a bargain </v>
<v Speaker 4>with fate and the bargain is I'm going </v>

2123
01:52:32.561 --> 01:52:36.281
<v Speaker 4>to act as if if I give it my all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the best possible thing will happen</v>

2124
01:52:36.561 --> 01:52:41.561
<v Speaker 4>because of that and to to not see the </v>
<v Speaker 4>analogy between that and the act of </v>

2125
01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:45.860
<v Speaker 4>faith in God is to misunderstand the </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely.</v>

2126
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.250
<v Speaker 4>And it has to be an act of faith because</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to know?</v>

2127
01:52:50.710 --> 01:52:53.440
<v Speaker 4>You can look at other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that isn't going to do it.</v>

2128
01:52:53.441 --> 01:52:56.050
<v Speaker 4>It's Kierkegaard was very clear about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of thing.</v>

2129
01:52:56.051 --> 01:53:01.051
<v Speaker 4>There's certain sorts of truths that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can only learn for yourself through </v>

2130
01:53:01.051 --> 01:53:04.321
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's of course why Abraham also </v>

2131
01:53:04.321 --> 01:53:04.321
<v Speaker 4>has to go out alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2132
01:53:04.321 --> 01:53:05.080
<v Speaker 4>He has to leave this candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an individual.</v>

2133
01:53:05.410 --> 01:53:08.800
<v Speaker 4>It's the individuation process like </v>
<v Speaker 4>dying.</v>

2134
01:53:08.801 --> 01:53:13.801
<v Speaker 4>It's something that you do alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you can tell what is </v>

2135
01:53:13.801 --> 01:53:14.200
<v Speaker 4>within your grasp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

2136
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:19.350
<v Speaker 4>unless you make the ultimate sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's no way of finding out </v>

2137
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:21.940
<v Speaker 4>without actually making it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that's the sacrificial act,</v>

2138
01:53:21.941 --> 01:53:22.750
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2139
01:53:22.751 --> 01:53:26.260
<v Speaker 4>that's really emphasized in the active </v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham</v>

2140
01:53:27.450 --> 01:53:30.630
<v Speaker 4>being called upon to sacrifice Isaac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think about that is Abraham,</v>

2141
01:53:30.631 --> 01:53:35.631
<v Speaker 4>he's been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been like breaking himself into </v>

2142
01:53:35.631 --> 01:53:38.571
<v Speaker 4>pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to progress forward through </v>

2143
01:53:38.571 --> 01:53:41.271
<v Speaker 4>starvation and tyranny and war and </v>
<v Speaker 4>deceit and the potential loss of his </v>

2144
01:53:41.271 --> 01:53:45.171
<v Speaker 4>wife and childlessness and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that can really be following </v>

2145
01:53:45.171 --> 01:53:46.470
<v Speaker 4>you in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And finally God grants them.</v>

2146
01:53:46.471 --> 01:53:47.610
<v Speaker 4>Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he's old,</v>

2147
01:53:47.611 --> 01:53:49.050
<v Speaker 4>it's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets Isaac,</v>

2148
01:53:49.051 --> 01:53:51.510
<v Speaker 4>his son,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then what does he do next is say,</v>

2149
01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:52.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2150
01:53:52.291 --> 01:53:55.590
<v Speaker 4>that son that you've been waiting for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for so long it's like,</v>

2151
01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:58.110
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to see just exactly what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>made of.</v>

2152
01:53:58.111 --> 01:54:00.750
<v Speaker 4>So I think you should offer him up as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice.</v>

2153
01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:05.550
<v Speaker 4>And I mean it's a very barbaric story in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sense,</v>

2154
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:10.910
<v Speaker 4>and maybe in more than just the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Abraham does maintain his covenant.</v>

2155
01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:16.500
<v Speaker 4>He's willing to make the sacrifice he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to make.</v>

2156
01:54:16.530 --> 01:54:21.530
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing he's willing to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever sacrifices necessary to keep </v>

2157
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:23.130
<v Speaker 4>his covenant with God intact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's that,</v>

2158
01:54:23.730 --> 01:54:27.080
<v Speaker 4>and that's the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2159
01:54:27.081 --> 01:54:29.120
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's no surprise that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>

2160
01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:36.490
<v Speaker 4>and he believed in the Lord and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>counted it to him for righteousness and </v>

2161
01:54:36.490 --> 01:54:38.420
<v Speaker 4>he said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am the Lord that brought the out of Ur</v>

2162
01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:41.420
<v Speaker 4>of the Chaldees to give this land to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>to inherit it.</v>

2163
01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:43.250
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lord God,</v>

2164
01:54:43.251 --> 01:54:45.380
<v Speaker 4>whereby shall I know that I show </v>
<v Speaker 4>inherited?</v>

2165
01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:49.160
<v Speaker 4>And he said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a sacrificial story.</v>

2166
01:54:49.161 --> 01:54:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take an F.</v>

2167
01:54:50.110 --> 01:54:54.860
<v Speaker 4>I have for three years and a goat of </v>
<v Speaker 4>three years in a realm of three years in</v>

2168
01:54:54.861 --> 01:54:59.861
<v Speaker 4>a turtle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dove and a young pigeon is fairly </v>

2169
01:54:59.861 --> 01:55:01.811
<v Speaker 4>specific actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he took all of these and divided </v>

2170
01:55:01.811 --> 01:55:02.930
<v Speaker 4>them and laid each piece one against </v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

2171
01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:05.000
<v Speaker 4>but the birds divided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he not.</v>

2172
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:07.730
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a reason for that and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know the reason for it.</v>

2173
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:10.190
<v Speaker 4>And when the walls came down upon the </v>
<v Speaker 4>carcasses,</v>

2174
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Abraham drove them away and when the sun</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going down,</v>

2175
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:19.090
<v Speaker 4>a deep sleep fell upon Abraham and low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a horror of great darkness fell upon him</v>

2176
01:55:19.670 --> 01:55:21.530
<v Speaker 4>had didn't mean he was afraid of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dark,</v>

2177
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:23.750
<v Speaker 4>which is what I thought it meant when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>first read it.</v>

2178
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:28.930
<v Speaker 4>It isn't what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means that he fell into a trance or </v>

2179
01:55:28.930 --> 01:55:32.261
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he was enveloped by absolute </v>

2180
01:55:32.261 --> 01:55:34.190
<v Speaker 4>horror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's how this story begins.</v>

2181
01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:40.180
<v Speaker 4>And here's the commentary from Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 4>Benson who was an English methodist </v>

2182
01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:40.910
<v Speaker 4>minister who lived in 17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>49,</v>

2183
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:42.560
<v Speaker 4>was born in 17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>49,</v>

2184
01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:46.290
<v Speaker 4>and the sun was going down about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time of the evening,</v>

2185
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:49.560
<v Speaker 4>evening ablation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the washing for he abode by them praying</v>

2186
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:53.390
<v Speaker 4>and waiting till toward evening a deep </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep fell upon Abraham.</v>

2187
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was not a common sleep through </v>

2188
01:55:59.090 --> 01:56:00.651
<v Speaker 4>weariness or carelessness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't know what a sloop is that's </v>

2189
01:56:00.651 --> 01:56:04.701
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not a common sleep through weariness or </v>

2190
01:56:04.701 --> 01:56:07.900
<v Speaker 4>Carolyn carelessness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a divine ecstasy that being wholly </v>

2191
01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:12.741
<v Speaker 4>taken off from things sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might be wholly taken up with the </v>

2192
01:56:12.741 --> 01:56:16.251
<v Speaker 4>contemplation of things spiritual well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really makes you wonder what Abraham </v>

2193
01:56:16.251 --> 01:56:18.300
<v Speaker 4>was up to in his campsite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so</v>

2194
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:27.620
<v Speaker 4>he was participating in something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>enabled this experience and low or a </v>

2195
01:56:28.341 --> 01:56:31.830
<v Speaker 4>horror of great darkness fell upon him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was designed to strike all upon the</v>

2196
01:56:31.831 --> 01:56:34.170
<v Speaker 4>spirit of Abraham and to possess them </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a holy reverence.</v>

2197
01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Holy fear prepares the soul for holy </v>
<v Speaker 4>joy.</v>

2198
01:56:37.410 --> 01:56:42.410
<v Speaker 4>God humbles first and then lifts up </v>
<v Speaker 4>echoes of Psychedelic Experience,</v>

2199
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:48.470
<v Speaker 4>and he said unto Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no of assurity that thy seed shall be a </v>

2200
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:52.521
<v Speaker 4>stranger in a land that is not theirs </v>
<v Speaker 4>and she'll serve them and they shall </v>

2201
01:56:52.521 --> 01:56:54.510
<v Speaker 4>afflict them 400 years and also that </v>
<v Speaker 4>nation whom they shall serve.</v>

2202
01:56:54.511 --> 01:56:59.511
<v Speaker 4>I will judge and afterwards shall they </v>
<v Speaker 4>come out with great substance and now </v>

2203
01:56:59.511 --> 01:57:00.360
<v Speaker 4>shall go to vi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fathers in peace,</v>

2204
01:57:00.450 --> 01:57:02.460
<v Speaker 4>thou shalt be buried in the good old </v>
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>

2205
01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:05.370
<v Speaker 4>but in the fourth generation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shall come hither again.</v>

2206
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:08.220
<v Speaker 4>For the inequity of the Amorites is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet full</v>

2207
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:12.570
<v Speaker 4>commentaries of Joseph Benson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once again,</v>

2208
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:16.950
<v Speaker 4>they shall come hither again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hither to the land of Canaan.</v>

2209
01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.140
<v Speaker 4>We're in vow note art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now art.</v>

2210
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:24.350
<v Speaker 4>The reason why they must not have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>land of promise in possession until the </v>

2211
01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:28.011
<v Speaker 4>fourth generation is because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>iniquity of the amorites was not yet </v>

2212
01:57:28.011 --> 01:57:31.881
<v Speaker 4>full.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The righteous God has determined that </v>

2213
01:57:31.881 --> 01:57:34.821
<v Speaker 4>the Amorites shall not be cut off until </v>
<v Speaker 4>they arrived at such a pitch of </v>

2214
01:57:34.821 --> 01:57:38.510
<v Speaker 4>wickedness and therefore till it come to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the seed of Abraham must be kept </v>

2215
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:42.171
<v Speaker 4>out of possession.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the interpretation of the story </v>

2216
01:57:42.171 --> 01:57:44.511
<v Speaker 4>essentially is that Abraham's </v>
<v Speaker 4>descendants will end up in slave in </v>

2217
01:57:44.511 --> 01:57:47.541
<v Speaker 4>Egypt for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lengthy period of time and eventually </v>

2218
01:57:47.541 --> 01:57:49.350
<v Speaker 4>come back to the land of Canaan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's interesting too because this is</v>

2219
01:57:49.351 --> 01:57:52.470
<v Speaker 4>part of Abram's bargain with God and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this divine vision.</v>

2220
01:57:52.471 --> 01:57:54.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's been promised everything,</v>

2221
01:57:54.781 --> 01:57:58.020
<v Speaker 4>but it's a pretty tough bargain because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when,</v>

2222
01:57:58.021 --> 01:58:00.450
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when God is pushed or reveals himself,</v>

2223
01:58:00.451 --> 01:58:01.140
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

2224
01:58:01.141 --> 01:58:06.141
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get your damn </v>

2225
01:58:06.141 --> 01:58:06.141
<v Speaker 4>descendants.</v>

2226
01:58:06.141 --> 01:58:06.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not going to be our.</v>

2227
01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:07.030
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2228
01:58:07.150 --> 01:58:11.400
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be a tough journey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be slaves and slave for</v>

2229
01:58:11.401 --> 01:58:14.850
<v Speaker 4>a very long time and eventually come </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and you won't see it.</v>

2230
01:58:14.851 --> 01:58:19.851
<v Speaker 4>You'll be dead long before then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a realistic promise in a </v>

2231
01:58:19.851 --> 01:58:20.430
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you might say,</v>

2232
01:58:20.431 --> 01:58:21.630
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham is so dated,</v>

2233
01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:26.660
<v Speaker 4>desperate to keep the faith that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to read good into what isn't </v>

2234
01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:26.660
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think,</v>

2235
01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:31.280
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's the right way to </v>

2236
01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:33.291
<v Speaker 4>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the right way to look at it is </v>

2237
01:58:33.291 --> 01:58:35.190
<v Speaker 4>the people who wrote these stories for </v>
<v Speaker 4>very realistic and they knew that even </v>

2238
01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:36.960
<v Speaker 4>if things turned out well for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was still going to be real.</v>

2239
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:38.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't going to be some fantasy.</v>

2240
01:58:38.731 --> 01:58:43.731
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say you have a family that </v>

2241
01:58:43.731 --> 01:58:43.731
<v Speaker 4>flourishes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are still going to die,</v>

2242
01:58:43.731 --> 01:58:45.040
<v Speaker 4>there's still going to get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're still gonna have,</v>

2243
01:58:45.070 --> 01:58:46.510
<v Speaker 4>they're still going to be alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2244
01:58:46.511 --> 01:58:48.760
<v Speaker 4>with all of it's suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it'll be,</v>

2245
01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:54.500
<v Speaker 4>but it'll be a life that's rich enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>and complete enough so that it'll </v>

2246
01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:55.270
<v Speaker 4>justify its,</v>
<v Speaker 4>its nature essentially.</v>

2247
01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:56.380
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

2248
01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:02.040
<v Speaker 4>and it came to pass that when the sun </v>
<v Speaker 4>went down and it was dark,</v>

2249
01:59:02.041 --> 01:59:06.480
<v Speaker 4>behold a smoking furnace and a burning </v>
<v Speaker 4>lamp that passed between the pieces.</v>

2250
01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:10.470
<v Speaker 4>Albert Barnes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>American theologian commented on this,</v>

2251
01:59:10.650 --> 01:59:15.650
<v Speaker 4>the oven of smoke and lamp of flame </v>
<v Speaker 4>symbolize the smoke of destruction in </v>

2252
01:59:15.650 --> 01:59:16.890
<v Speaker 4>the light of salvation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're passing,</v>

2253
01:59:16.891 --> 01:59:19.530
<v Speaker 4>passing through the pieces of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrificial victims,</v>

2254
01:59:19.710 --> 01:59:22.530
<v Speaker 4>and probably consuming the mess and </v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted sacrifice,</v>

2255
01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:27.740
<v Speaker 4>or the ratification of the Covenant on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the part of God as the dividing and </v>

2256
01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:28.470
<v Speaker 4>presenting of them were on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham.</v>

2257
01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:35.360
<v Speaker 4>In the same day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Lord made a covenant with Abraham </v>

2258
01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:35.550
<v Speaker 4>saying unto thy seed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't given this land from the river</v>

2259
01:59:35.551 --> 01:59:38.340
<v Speaker 4>of Egypt unto the great river,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the River Euphrates,</v>

2260
01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:40.560
<v Speaker 4>the Canaanites and the Kennedys sites </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the cadman nights,</v>

2261
01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:44.000
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now Cri.</v>

2262
01:59:44.001 --> 01:59:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Abram's wife bear him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no children.</v>

2263
01:59:46.530 --> 01:59:48.690
<v Speaker 4>And she had a handmade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait a second.</v>

2264
01:59:49.590 --> 01:59:52.230
<v Speaker 4>I think we'll stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm tiring out.</v>

2265
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:54.680
<v Speaker 4>And it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's 9:29.</v>

2266
01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:57.600
<v Speaker 4>So that's a very good place to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes.</v>

2267
01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I should,</v>

2268
02:00:07.890 --> 02:00:12.890
<v Speaker 4>I should close properly and just sum up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens here is that that </v>

2269
02:00:13.890 --> 02:00:17.400
<v Speaker 4>Abraham enters into a covenant with God </v>
<v Speaker 4>to act in the world,</v>

2270
02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:21.480
<v Speaker 4>and the action is an adventure story </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially,</v>

2271
02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:26.780
<v Speaker 4>and the adventures repeat and their and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their punctuated by success and sat and </v>

2272
02:00:29.281 --> 02:00:31.410
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice and re contemplation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2273
02:00:31.411 --> 02:00:32.250
<v Speaker 4>And it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this,</v>

2274
02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:33.780
<v Speaker 4>it's this journey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

2275
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:36.810
<v Speaker 4>it's the hero's journey uphill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm here,</v>

2276
02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:39.420
<v Speaker 4>there's a crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I collapsed,</v>

2277
02:00:39.570 --> 02:00:43.320
<v Speaker 4>I reconstruct myself to a higher place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and life is like that continually.</v>

2278
02:00:43.321 --> 02:00:46.200
<v Speaker 4>And that's the story of Abraham and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all contained though.</v>

2279
02:00:46.201 --> 02:00:49.290
<v Speaker 4>It's all contained and this is the thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so cool because that is what your</v>

2280
02:00:49.291 --> 02:00:52.170
<v Speaker 4>life is going to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether you plan out your life or not,</v>

2281
02:00:52.410 --> 02:00:55.710
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be punctuated like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it won't go up,</v>

2282
02:00:55.711 --> 02:00:57.180
<v Speaker 4>maybe it'll go down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the question is,</v>

2283
02:00:57.181 --> 02:01:02.181
<v Speaker 4>what sort of container do you need to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>in in order to tolerate the movement up </v>

2284
02:01:02.181 --> 02:01:06.891
<v Speaker 4>and down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what the story of Abraham </v>

2285
02:01:06.891 --> 02:01:06.891
<v Speaker 4>provides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It provides a,</v>

2286
02:01:06.891 --> 02:01:10.790
<v Speaker 4>it provides a description of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>covenant that's like the Ark of the </v>

2287
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:11.350
<v Speaker 4>covenant and the Ark or the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2288
02:01:11.370 --> 02:01:16.020
<v Speaker 4>Except the covenant is the psychological</v>
<v Speaker 4>equivalent of the Ark of the covenant is</v>

2289
02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:22.350
<v Speaker 4>have faith in the structure of existence</v>
<v Speaker 4>and go forth.</v>

2290
02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:26.250
<v Speaker 4>That's the covenant and that and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>story is,</v>

2291
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:31.020
<v Speaker 4>that's the best possible solution that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have at hand.</v>

2292
02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going to make a request with </v>

2293
02:01:38.410 --> 02:01:41.180
<v Speaker 4>regards to the questions which may mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to reorient yourself in the line.</v>

2294
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:46.510
<v Speaker 4>I would like the first two questions on </v>
<v Speaker 4>each side if possible to relate </v>

2295
02:01:47.751 --> 02:01:52.751
<v Speaker 4>specifically to tonight's lecture and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then I can and then I can address more </v>

2296
02:01:55.251 --> 02:01:57.980
<v Speaker 4>general issues if that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's okay.</v>

2297
02:01:58.970 --> 02:02:00.710
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I again,</v>

2298
02:02:00.711 --> 02:02:05.711
<v Speaker 4>I would like you to carefully speak into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mic so that the people who are </v>

2299
02:02:05.711 --> 02:02:07.040
<v Speaker 4>watching can hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you hear me?</v>

2300
02:02:07.130 --> 02:02:07.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>

2301
02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:14.820
<v Speaker 6>The story about Abraham saying his wife </v>
<v Speaker 6>was his sister.</v>

2302
02:02:14.821 --> 02:02:17.580
<v Speaker 6>You referred to that as him making a </v>
<v Speaker 6>mistake.</v>

2303
02:02:17.581 --> 02:02:22.581
<v Speaker 6>I'm not quite sure I understand how </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're reading that does a mistake </v>

2304
02:02:22.581 --> 02:02:26.151
<v Speaker 6>seeing as it was a very deliberate </v>
<v Speaker 6>decision and it had a pretty good </v>

2305
02:02:26.151 --> 02:02:28.830
<v Speaker 6>outcome for him and he does the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing a few chapters later.</v>

2306
02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:30.750
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is true.</v>

2307
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.860
<v Speaker 4>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2308
02:02:31.861 --> 02:02:36.861
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel that I've cracked out part </v>

2309
02:02:36.861 --> 02:02:36.861
<v Speaker 4>of that story properly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2310
02:02:36.861 --> 02:02:41.541
<v Speaker 4>the reason I said it was a mistake is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's clearly an act of deceit </v>

2311
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:45.700
<v Speaker 4>and it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it does put the Pharaoh in a very </v>

2312
02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:45.900
<v Speaker 4>awkward position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not to mention survived by the way,</v>

2313
02:02:45.901 --> 02:02:48.570
<v Speaker 4>or how do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to say that.</v>

2314
02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Surrey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Surrey.</v>

2315
02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:52.800
<v Speaker 4>It's sariah to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2316
02:02:52.801 --> 02:02:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Surgery?</v>

2317
02:02:54.570 --> 02:02:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2318
02:02:55.141 --> 02:02:59.430
<v Speaker 4>And then it's Sarah and Abraham means </v>
<v Speaker 4>high king,</v>

2319
02:02:59.431 --> 02:03:04.431
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Abraham means father of the people </v>

2320
02:03:04.431 --> 02:03:06.220
<v Speaker 4>in Surrey means Princess and Sarah means</v>
<v Speaker 4>mother of the people.</v>

2321
02:03:06.221 --> 02:03:07.860
<v Speaker 4>It's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't exactly right.</v>

2322
02:03:07.861 --> 02:03:12.861
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you next week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's part of the name </v>

2323
02:03:12.861 --> 02:03:12.861
<v Speaker 4>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2324
02:03:12.861 --> 02:03:16.770
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me that at least in part </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an indication of Abraham Abraham's </v>

2325
02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:23.660
<v Speaker 4>willingness to use a sub optimal </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution when driven to it by necessity.</v>

2326
02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:28.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a heroic act to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend that your wife is your sister.</v>

2327
02:03:28.530 --> 02:03:29.840
<v Speaker 4>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2328
02:03:29.841 --> 02:03:31.530
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe you might say,</v>

2329
02:03:31.531 --> 02:03:36.531
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>under the circumstances there was </v>

2330
02:03:36.531 --> 02:03:36.531
<v Speaker 4>nothing else he could have done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it does seem it.</v>

2331
02:03:36.531 --> 02:03:41.360
<v Speaker 4>I can't see how you can interpret it </v>
<v Speaker 4>other than as a departure from the </v>

2332
02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:44.871
<v Speaker 4>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know that that's not all there is </v>

2333
02:03:44.871 --> 02:03:48.180
<v Speaker 4>to it and it does seem to work out well </v>
<v Speaker 4>for him and my interpretation is that,</v>

2334
02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:53.720
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're oriented properly in the </v>

2335
02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:55.491
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the grace of God allows you a few </v>

2336
02:03:55.491 --> 02:03:56.310
<v Speaker 4>necessary mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2337
02:03:56.620 --> 02:04:01.620
<v Speaker 4>Do you have an alternative idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well why not?</v>

2338
02:04:04.261 --> 02:04:09.261
<v Speaker 4>What is it about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that means it because it's Abraham </v>

2339
02:04:09.261 --> 02:04:10.830
<v Speaker 4>and it isn't reasonable to attribute </v>
<v Speaker 4>mistakes to him or what is it?</v>

2340
02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:16.110
<v Speaker 6>Because at least I think it says in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>text that he's looking to get out of a </v>

2341
02:04:16.321 --> 02:04:21.321
<v Speaker 6>bad situation and he does whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 6>the best thing that's available to him </v>

2342
02:04:23.250 --> 02:04:24.750
<v Speaker 6>and not dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As I said,</v>

2343
02:04:24.751 --> 02:04:27.750
<v Speaker 6>he does the same trick a few chapters </v>
<v Speaker 6>later.</v>

2344
02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:28.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe.</v>

2345
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:31.880
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it is the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2346
02:04:31.881 --> 02:04:33.960
<v Speaker 4>it's like a white lie issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2347
02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:35.720
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's a white lie.</v>

2348
02:04:35.730 --> 02:04:37.800
<v Speaker 4>Acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>

2349
02:04:37.801 --> 02:04:42.801
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best that you can come up with is </v>

2350
02:04:42.801 --> 02:04:42.801
<v Speaker 4>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that doesn't mean it's.</v>

2351
02:04:42.801 --> 02:04:43.260
<v Speaker 4>It's optimal though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2352
02:04:43.290 --> 02:04:48.290
<v Speaker 4>Like all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you a foolish example because </v>

2353
02:04:48.571 --> 02:04:50.130
<v Speaker 4>it's the best that I could do at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>

2354
02:04:50.131 --> 02:04:53.160
<v Speaker 4>but know if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a loved one who says,</v>

2355
02:04:53.190 --> 02:04:58.190
<v Speaker 4>does this dress make me look fat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The answer to that question is I don't </v>

2356
02:04:59.311 --> 02:05:02.010
<v Speaker 4>answer questions like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the answer,</v>

2357
02:05:02.011 --> 02:05:07.011
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the other answer is the white </v>

2358
02:05:07.011 --> 02:05:08.931
<v Speaker 4>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would mean at least in this </v>

2359
02:05:08.931 --> 02:05:10.851
<v Speaker 4>context,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that means that on the one hand </v>

2360
02:05:10.851 --> 02:05:13.881
<v Speaker 4>you're maintaining the positive contract</v>
<v Speaker 4>between you and the person who's asking </v>

2361
02:05:14.881 --> 02:05:19.881
<v Speaker 4>the question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you're still sacrificing the </v>

2362
02:05:19.881 --> 02:05:19.881
<v Speaker 4>truth within that.</v>

2363
02:05:19.881 --> 02:05:19.920
<v Speaker 4>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2364
02:05:20.010 --> 02:05:25.010
<v Speaker 4>you're maintaining your relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the higher order truth but </v>

2365
02:05:25.010 --> 02:05:28.611
<v Speaker 4>sacrificing a lower order truth and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that would be better than the </v>

2366
02:05:28.611 --> 02:05:32.211
<v Speaker 4>reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not as good as not sacrificing </v>

2367
02:05:32.211 --> 02:05:35.181
<v Speaker 4>the truth at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say that if you're maybe </v>

2368
02:05:35.181 --> 02:05:37.410
<v Speaker 4>fortunate because sometimes it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter because you can be in a situation</v>

2369
02:05:37.411 --> 02:05:42.411
<v Speaker 4>where all your choices are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people in situations like </v>

2370
02:05:42.411 --> 02:05:46.161
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've probably been in situations like </v>

2371
02:05:46.161 --> 02:05:46.161
<v Speaker 4>that and maybe that is what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that story is every choice,</v>

2372
02:05:46.161 --> 02:05:50.871
<v Speaker 4>Abraham is in front of him is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can't help but think that it's </v>

2373
02:05:50.871 --> 02:05:54.531
<v Speaker 4>more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means that if you're doing the best </v>

2374
02:05:54.531 --> 02:05:57.690
<v Speaker 4>you can and it's not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can still be good enough.</v>

2375
02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:01.650
<v Speaker 4>That's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2376
02:06:06.130 --> 02:06:11.130
<v Speaker 7>Hello Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you mentioned earlier there's been a </v>

2377
02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:13.000
<v Speaker 7>pervasive problem of nihilism and moral </v>
<v Speaker 7>relativism,</v>

2378
02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:14.080
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that,</v>

2379
02:06:14.110 --> 02:06:19.110
<v Speaker 7>that can kind of be cured with a novice,</v>
<v Speaker 7>naive optimism that's grounded in fact,</v>

2380
02:06:19.450 --> 02:06:22.480
<v Speaker 7>and what can actually be done to improve</v>
<v Speaker 7>situations.</v>

2381
02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:26.610
<v Speaker 7>Is there a way to communicate that </v>
<v Speaker 7>message to a younger audience?</v>

2382
02:06:26.611 --> 02:06:28.300
<v Speaker 7>They teenagers in high school </v>
<v Speaker 7>environment,</v>

2383
02:06:28.301 --> 02:06:31.240
<v Speaker 7>which is nowadays a hotbed for this kind</v>
<v Speaker 7>of nihilistic,</v>

2384
02:06:31.241 --> 02:06:32.170
<v Speaker 7>morally relativist thinking.</v>

2385
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:35.260
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad you asked that.</v>

2386
02:06:36.690 --> 02:06:41.690
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about saying this at the </v>

2387
02:06:41.690 --> 02:06:41.690
<v Speaker 4>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I decided not to,</v>

2388
02:06:41.690 --> 02:06:43.770
<v Speaker 4>but now I get to say it because I got </v>
<v Speaker 4>this question.</v>

2389
02:06:43.771 --> 02:06:45.730
<v Speaker 4>So that's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2390
02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:51.980
<v Speaker 4>I have plans and so plan number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have worked with some people to design</v>

2391
02:06:56.221 --> 02:07:01.221
<v Speaker 4>a website that will enable high </v>
<v Speaker 4>university students to enter their </v>

2392
02:07:01.221 --> 02:07:03.330
<v Speaker 4>course descriptions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their professor's name,</v>

2393
02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:08.480
<v Speaker 4>the subdiscipline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the university and an artificial </v>

2394
02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:10.710
<v Speaker 4>intelligence agent will tell them if the</v>
<v Speaker 4>course is postmodern,</v>

2395
02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:12.390
<v Speaker 4>neo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxist indoctrination.</v>

2396
02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:17.540
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only,</v>

2397
02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:23.580
<v Speaker 4>and I have made tentative arrangements </v>
<v Speaker 4>with someone to finance a advertising </v>

2398
02:07:25.571 --> 02:07:30.571
<v Speaker 4>campaign for that site.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the goal is well to inform the </v>

2399
02:07:31.841 --> 02:07:36.841
<v Speaker 4>consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to be educated or do you </v>

2400
02:07:36.841 --> 02:07:37.210
<v Speaker 4>want to be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And happily you'll build,</v>

2401
02:07:37.211 --> 02:07:40.030
<v Speaker 4>use the site equally for both purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2402
02:07:40.330 --> 02:07:43.520
<v Speaker 4>Because if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to take the,</v>

2403
02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:49.440
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the courses that I would regard as </v>

2404
02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:51.991
<v Speaker 4>indoctrination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then this will give you a way of </v>

2405
02:07:51.991 --> 02:07:53.860
<v Speaker 4>ensuring that nothing that you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed to won't be of that sort.</v>

2406
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:59.310
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'm going to make a video to </v>

2407
02:07:59.310 --> 02:08:02.550
<v Speaker 4>introduce that to university students </v>
<v Speaker 4>and their parents and I'm going to </v>

2408
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:04.840
<v Speaker 4>outline what I think the universities </v>
<v Speaker 4>are doing wrong.</v>

2409
02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:10.260
<v Speaker 4>There's about 20 things they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong and they're seriously wrong </v>

2410
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:13.840
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going to start by describing the</v>

2411
02:08:13.841 --> 02:08:18.841
<v Speaker 4>utility of a university education in </v>
<v Speaker 4>humanities education because the </v>

2412
02:08:18.841 --> 02:08:21.871
<v Speaker 4>humanities education makes you into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of autonomous individual that can </v>

2413
02:08:21.871 --> 02:08:25.981
<v Speaker 4>go away from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that can be independent and can </v>

2414
02:08:25.981 --> 02:08:28.330
<v Speaker 4>communicate and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that has immense economic value,</v>

2415
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:29.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

2416
02:08:29.211 --> 02:08:31.600
<v Speaker 4>not just spiritual value and cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>value,</v>

2417
02:08:31.601 --> 02:08:33.970
<v Speaker 4>but economic value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there's,</v>

2418
02:08:34.450 --> 02:08:36.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to tell people not to go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>university,</v>

2419
02:08:36.611 --> 02:08:41.611
<v Speaker 4>I want to tell them to go to university </v>
<v Speaker 4>and grow the hell up and learn to </v>

2420
02:08:41.611 --> 02:08:44.881
<v Speaker 4>communicate and think and I want them to</v>
<v Speaker 4>avoid the people who will take the </v>

2421
02:08:44.881 --> 02:08:46.480
<v Speaker 4>spirit away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what that website is going</v>

2422
02:08:46.481 --> 02:08:47.590
<v Speaker 4>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope.</v>

2423
02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:52.860
<v Speaker 4>And the goal is to drop the enrollment </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the indoctrination courses across the</v>

2424
02:08:53.021 --> 02:08:56.590
<v Speaker 4>English speaking world by 75 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>within five years.</v>

2425
02:08:56.860 --> 02:08:57.580
<v Speaker 4>That's the goal.</v>

2426
02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:08.440
<v Speaker 4>And then you ask that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ask more specifically about high </v>

2427
02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:08.870
<v Speaker 4>school students.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2428
02:09:09.530 --> 02:09:14.530
<v Speaker 4>we have this future authoring program </v>
<v Speaker 4>that has been used for university </v>

2429
02:09:14.530 --> 02:09:17.120
<v Speaker 4>students and it produces about a 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent improvement in retention.</v>

2430
02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:20.000
<v Speaker 4>And we've tested several thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>university students.</v>

2431
02:09:20.001 --> 02:09:22.760
<v Speaker 4>Anyone can use it by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not for university students,</v>

2432
02:09:22.761 --> 02:09:25.670
<v Speaker 4>but it was easy for us to test its </v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial impact.</v>

2433
02:09:25.671 --> 02:09:28.670
<v Speaker 4>Even if people only spend under 90 </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes on it,</v>

2434
02:09:29.150 --> 02:09:33.380
<v Speaker 4>it still has approximately that effect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially on young men,</v>

2435
02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:39.820
<v Speaker 4>especially if they're ethnic minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if they're not oriented </v>

2436
02:09:40.011 --> 02:09:45.011
<v Speaker 4>towards a career and didn't do very well</v>
<v Speaker 4>in school and so that's really cool </v>

2437
02:09:45.011 --> 02:09:48.671
<v Speaker 4>because it's really hard to design a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological intervention that helps </v>

2438
02:09:48.671 --> 02:09:50.900
<v Speaker 4>the people who are doing the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most psychological intervention.</v>

2439
02:09:50.901 --> 02:09:55.901
<v Speaker 4>So imagine there are people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing not so well and people who are </v>

2440
02:09:55.901 --> 02:09:56.090
<v Speaker 4>doing well and you produce a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological intervention.</v>

2441
02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:00.140
<v Speaker 4>What usually happens is the people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are doing well benefit even more.</v>

2442
02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:05.530
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this seems to work for the </v>

2443
02:10:05.530 --> 02:10:05.990
<v Speaker 4>disenfranchised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're thrilled about that really.</v>

2444
02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:09.170
<v Speaker 4>And so we produced a version for high </v>
<v Speaker 4>school students.</v>

2445
02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:10.850
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

2446
02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:15.970
<v Speaker 4>but we don't have them look three to </v>
<v Speaker 4>five years out into the future because </v>

2447
02:10:15.970 --> 02:10:16.850
<v Speaker 4>they can't and they don't know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2448
02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:18.800
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for full,</v>
<v Speaker 4>full,</v>

2449
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:22.040
<v Speaker 4>fully mature adults to look that far </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the future.</v>

2450
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 4>High school kids can probably manage </v>
<v Speaker 4>three to six months and so we're going </v>

2451
02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:30.831
<v Speaker 4>to have them concentrated on character </v>
<v Speaker 4>development and and what they want for </v>

2452
02:10:30.831 --> 02:10:35.351
<v Speaker 4>their from their friendships and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would like orient themselves in </v>

2453
02:10:35.351 --> 02:10:38.981
<v Speaker 4>school and to start thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of person that they would like to </v>

2454
02:10:38.981 --> 02:10:40.520
<v Speaker 4>be and that never happens in schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weirdly enough.</v>

2455
02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:45.700
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy named John Gatto who won </v>
<v Speaker 4>the teacher of the year award in New </v>

2456
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:48.320
<v Speaker 4>York City and then in New York state and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it stopped being a teacher.</v>

2457
02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:53.320
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a series of books about the </v>

2458
02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:56.471
<v Speaker 4>education system that explain why </v>
<v Speaker 4>students in pre university education </v>

2459
02:10:57.801 --> 02:11:00.710
<v Speaker 4>aren't taught to be autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals.</v>

2460
02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:04.430
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting what he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>discovered historically,</v>

2461
02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:09.730
<v Speaker 4>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to market that probably two </v>

2462
02:11:09.730 --> 02:11:13.151
<v Speaker 4>parents and two university students </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves rather than to the schools </v>

2463
02:11:13.151 --> 02:11:15.950
<v Speaker 4>because our experience has been that </v>
<v Speaker 4>producing this sort of material directly</v>

2464
02:11:15.951 --> 02:11:20.951
<v Speaker 4>for individuals works much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's much more efficient and so then </v>

2465
02:11:20.951 --> 02:11:24.611
<v Speaker 4>students will be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or their parents will be able to </v>

2466
02:11:24.611 --> 02:11:27.941
<v Speaker 4>purchase the program and the students </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be able to use it to design their </v>

2467
02:11:27.941 --> 02:11:32.861
<v Speaker 4>own personality in a manner that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>make them thrilled to be alive.</v>

2468
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:35.690
<v Speaker 4>Let's say that would be the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2469
02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:42.880
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get you to turn it to put </v>

2470
02:11:54.391 --> 02:11:56.190
<v Speaker 4>it down a little more either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excellent.</v>

2471
02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:59.100
<v Speaker 8>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>

2472
02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:05.760
<v Speaker 8>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I,</v>

2473
02:12:09.251 --> 02:12:10.120
<v Speaker 8>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2474
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:13.500
<v Speaker 8>especially the literature in </v>
<v Speaker 8>Developmental Psychology,</v>

2475
02:12:13.501 --> 02:12:18.501
<v Speaker 8>I think bears this out,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I think a huge part of learning is </v>

2476
02:12:18.501 --> 02:12:21.411
<v Speaker 8>interaction and discourse and that seems</v>
<v Speaker 8>very difficult in an online setting,</v>

2477
02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:23.520
<v Speaker 8>even if it's through text.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>

2478
02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:28.700
<v Speaker 8>I don't quite see it as the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And additionally I think there's a huge </v>

2479
02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:30.510
<v Speaker 8>motivational factor that's a difficult </v>
<v Speaker 8>to.</v>

2480
02:12:31.590 --> 02:12:36.590
<v Speaker 8>It's difficult to keep motivated when </v>
<v Speaker 8>you're isolated and nobody else around </v>

2481
02:12:36.590 --> 02:12:38.370
<v Speaker 8>us pursuing the same goal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So how would you dress?</v>

2482
02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:43.520
<v Speaker 4>You're absolutely right on both counts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that the idea of an online </v>

2483
02:12:45.091 --> 02:12:49.320
<v Speaker 4>humanities university is grandiose and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it may not be possible.</v>

2484
02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:53.160
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as you're alluding to,</v>

2485
02:12:53.370 --> 02:12:56.430
<v Speaker 4>we actually don't understand what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>university is.</v>

2486
02:12:57.060 --> 02:13:01.080
<v Speaker 4>We think it's lectures and exams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's probably not.</v>

2487
02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:06.480
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly being together with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people of your own age.</v>

2488
02:13:06.481 --> 02:13:10.590
<v Speaker 4>As you start your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's moving away from your household.</v>

2489
02:13:11.130 --> 02:13:14.490
<v Speaker 4>It's establishing yourself as a credible</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellect,</v>

2490
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:15.540
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2491
02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:20.600
<v Speaker 4>it's picking a new group of peers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all of those things and it isn't </v>

2492
02:13:21.241 --> 02:13:24.360
<v Speaker 4>clear how that can be replicated online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2493
02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:29.750
<v Speaker 4>The people that I'm talking to are </v>
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated enough to understand </v>

2494
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:33.080
<v Speaker 4>Marshall McLuhan's dictum that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>medium is the message and so I think it </v>

2495
02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.971
<v Speaker 4>would be a mistake to attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 4>duplicate the university online because </v>

2496
02:13:37.971 --> 02:13:41.160
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so what we're concentrating on right</v>

2497
02:13:41.161 --> 02:13:43.710
<v Speaker 4>now is not so much content but </v>
<v Speaker 4>infrastructure.</v>

2498
02:13:44.010 --> 02:13:49.010
<v Speaker 4>The question is we want to set up an egg</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a system of education online that </v>

2499
02:13:49.291 --> 02:13:54.291
<v Speaker 4>will be autonomously self-governing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>self improving and the content in some </v>

2500
02:13:55.171 --> 02:14:00.171
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not so much interested in the </v>

2501
02:14:00.171 --> 02:14:02.211
<v Speaker 4>content as we are interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>process by which people who generate </v>

2502
02:14:02.211 --> 02:14:04.200
<v Speaker 4>good content might be optimally </v>
<v Speaker 4>rewarded.</v>

2503
02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:06.150
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2504
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:11.390
<v Speaker 4>And that's probably a discussion that </v>
<v Speaker 4>will take a year or two years to flesh </v>

2505
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:16.341
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We started to conceptualize what the </v>

2506
02:14:16.341 --> 02:14:16.341
<v Speaker 4>system might look like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2507
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:19.350
<v Speaker 4>but to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't.</v>

2508
02:14:20.130 --> 02:14:22.540
<v Speaker 4>We're not taking lectures and putting </v>
<v Speaker 4>them online,</v>

2509
02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:24.810
<v Speaker 4>although obviously that's what I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2510
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:29.870
<v Speaker 4>that isn't going to make an online </v>
<v Speaker 4>humanities university and we know that </v>

2511
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:30.730
<v Speaker 4>and I think everything you said is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

2512
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:35.830
<v Speaker 4>is very accurate and also indicative of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the high probability that something like</v>

2513
02:14:35.941 --> 02:14:37.980
<v Speaker 4>this would fail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2514
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:39.150
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2515
02:14:39.151 --> 02:14:44.151
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to try to be aware of the </v>

2516
02:14:44.151 --> 02:14:44.151
<v Speaker 4>pitfalls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're also going to.</v>

2517
02:14:44.151 --> 02:14:45.450
<v Speaker 4>I read this great book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would recommend this book.</v>

2518
02:14:45.451 --> 02:14:50.451
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very funny book by a guy named </v>

2519
02:14:50.451 --> 02:14:52.401
<v Speaker 4>John Gaul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called system antics and it's a </v>

2520
02:14:52.401 --> 02:14:55.341
<v Speaker 4>cult classic system antics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's about how systems really work </v>

2521
02:14:55.341 --> 02:14:55.440
<v Speaker 4>and how they fail.</v>

2522
02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.440
<v Speaker 4>And it's a work of ironic comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's quite brilliant.</v>

2523
02:14:58.950 --> 02:15:01.160
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one line he,</v>

2524
02:15:01.161 --> 02:15:02.730
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's made of a bunch of axioms.</v>

2525
02:15:02.731 --> 02:15:06.960
<v Speaker 4>And here's one axiom I just love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the system does not do what it's</v>

2526
02:15:06.961 --> 02:15:11.961
<v Speaker 4>name says it does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I worked in Alberta social </v>

2527
02:15:11.961 --> 02:15:15.891
<v Speaker 4>services when I was a kid about 18 or so</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I worked as a consultant and I I </v>

2528
02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:20.250
<v Speaker 4>wanted and I got involved in projects </v>
<v Speaker 4>that were above my pay grade,</v>

2529
02:15:20.251 --> 02:15:25.251
<v Speaker 4>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I learned a lot about how how large </v>

2530
02:15:25.251 --> 02:15:28.911
<v Speaker 4>bureaucracies functioned and I was asked</v>
<v Speaker 4>at one point to update a report that had</v>

2531
02:15:29.101 --> 02:15:32.970
<v Speaker 4>been made the year before about what </v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage of the spending of the social</v>

2532
02:15:32.971 --> 02:15:37.971
<v Speaker 4>services department actually went to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>recipients of welfare and social aid in </v>

2533
02:15:38.461 --> 02:15:43.461
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer was the system did not </v>

2534
02:15:43.461 --> 02:15:44.310
<v Speaker 4>know and could not find out.</v>

2535
02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:49.260
<v Speaker 4>And they had hired a very expensive </v>
<v Speaker 4>consulting firms to answer that question</v>

2536
02:15:49.261 --> 02:15:51.540
<v Speaker 4>the year before and I was asked to </v>
<v Speaker 4>update it,</v>

2537
02:15:51.541 --> 02:15:54.030
<v Speaker 4>which was quite odd to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then I did.</v>

2538
02:15:54.031 --> 02:15:57.540
<v Speaker 4>I went and looked at the consulting </v>
<v Speaker 4>report and I went into the data and what</v>

2539
02:15:57.541 --> 02:16:01.980
<v Speaker 4>I found was that none of it was real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even more importantly,</v>

2540
02:16:01.981 --> 02:16:04.140
<v Speaker 4>there was no way of knowing whether it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was true or false.</v>

2541
02:16:04.141 --> 02:16:09.141
<v Speaker 4>Because the system had never been set up</v>
<v Speaker 4>to calculate what percentage of its </v>

2542
02:16:09.141 --> 02:16:12.120
<v Speaker 4>total spending actually went to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>recipients of social aid.</v>

2543
02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:13.800
<v Speaker 4>It just blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I thought,</v>

2544
02:16:13.801 --> 02:16:15.870
<v Speaker 4>and I was reading this book at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and I thought,</v>

2545
02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:21.500
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the purpose of the social services </v>

2546
02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:22.710
<v Speaker 4>department is to employ people in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>social services department.</v>

2547
02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:25.140
<v Speaker 4>And I mean I wasn't being cynical about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2548
02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:27.240
<v Speaker 4>It's like charity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most charities,</v>

2549
02:16:27.241 --> 02:16:29.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like 90 percent overhead.</v>

2550
02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:33.250
<v Speaker 4>So what does the charity do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It runs itself now.</v>

2551
02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:38.700
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to be cynical about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because big businesses are the same and </v>

2552
02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:38.740
<v Speaker 4>most like even if they're running at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>profit,</v>

2553
02:16:38.741 --> 02:16:42.730
<v Speaker 4>the profit is like five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the business spends 95 percent of its</v>

2554
02:16:42.970 --> 02:16:44.610
<v Speaker 4>time maintaining itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2555
02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:47.320
<v Speaker 4>And it makes a bit of product and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes a bit of profit.</v>

2556
02:16:47.321 --> 02:16:49.180
<v Speaker 4>But most of what it does is maintain </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

2557
02:16:49.630 --> 02:16:54.630
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the axioms in that book that was </v>

2558
02:16:54.630 --> 02:16:56.770
<v Speaker 4>one of them is the system does not do </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it says it does.</v>

2559
02:16:56.771 --> 02:17:01.771
<v Speaker 4>So that's [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you can face the system with a </v>

2560
02:17:01.771 --> 02:17:01.771
<v Speaker 4>clear head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And say,</v>

2561
02:17:01.771 --> 02:17:03.220
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this thing isn't doing what it says</v>

2562
02:17:03.221 --> 02:17:08.221
<v Speaker 4>it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's probably doing something and </v>

2563
02:17:08.221 --> 02:17:08.221
<v Speaker 4>the thing is doing might be useful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we should figure out what that thing</v>

2564
02:17:08.221 --> 02:17:12.871
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's been really useful to me as a </v>

2565
02:17:12.871 --> 02:17:12.871
<v Speaker 4>guide to thinking.</v>

2566
02:17:12.871 --> 02:17:14.140
<v Speaker 4>But the other thing he said was if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to build a big system that works,</v>

2567
02:17:14.141 --> 02:17:17.680
<v Speaker 4>start with by building a small system </v>
<v Speaker 4>that works and scale it,</v>

2568
02:17:17.681 --> 02:17:19.270
<v Speaker 4>and we've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

2569
02:17:19.271 --> 02:17:20.990
<v Speaker 4>with the self authoring programs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2570
02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000
<v Speaker 4>is built small scale systems that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>very robust with the hope that they'll </v>

2571
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:26.000
<v Speaker 4>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the same.</v>

2572
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.990
<v Speaker 4>We'll do the same thing here is start </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a small amount of content.</v>

2573
02:17:31.690 --> 02:17:33.280
<v Speaker 4>See if we can reward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2574
02:17:33.281 --> 02:17:35.080
<v Speaker 4>what I would like to have happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2575
02:17:35.081 --> 02:17:40.081
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people out there who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are pretty intensely educated and some </v>

2576
02:17:40.081 --> 02:17:42.400
<v Speaker 4>of them are really creative and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine that there's a timeline.</v>

2577
02:17:42.430 --> 02:17:46.270
<v Speaker 4>Imagine you could do a humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you imagine there's a timeline say of</v>

2578
02:17:46.271 --> 02:17:49.880
<v Speaker 4>a thousand years that's scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then imagine that,</v>

2579
02:17:50.010 --> 02:17:54.250
<v Speaker 4>that there would be lectures associated </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the timeline at different levels of</v>

2580
02:17:54.251 --> 02:17:57.930
<v Speaker 4>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we might call for a lecture on this.</v>

2581
02:17:57.930 --> 02:18:01.600
<v Speaker 4>The third century had what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the third century.</v>

2582
02:18:01.601 --> 02:18:03.490
<v Speaker 4>80.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got half an hour to explain it.</v>

2583
02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:06.280
<v Speaker 4>You can explain it any way you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can use animation,</v>

2584
02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:08.410
<v Speaker 4>you can use lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can use text,</v>

2585
02:18:08.590 --> 02:18:10.480
<v Speaker 4>you can make a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't care.</v>

2586
02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:14.170
<v Speaker 4>What you have to do is that's the topic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the time span.</v>

2587
02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:19.260
<v Speaker 4>That's the amount of time and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can post it and so we could generate </v>

2588
02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:23.820
<v Speaker 4>content that way and let people </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment and then we can have people </v>

2589
02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:25.780
<v Speaker 4>review the content as part of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>education,</v>

2590
02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 4>generate questions about the content as </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of their assignments,</v>

2591
02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:34.060
<v Speaker 4>rate the questions as part of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>assignments and rate the content,</v>

2592
02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:39.480
<v Speaker 4>and then if we charged people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine you had to pay $50 a month to </v>

2593
02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:39.480
<v Speaker 4>enroll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2594
02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:43.250
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we would allow you when you first </v>
<v Speaker 4>enroll,</v>

2595
02:18:43.251 --> 02:18:47.890
<v Speaker 4>maybe you get to use $5 of it as </v>
<v Speaker 4>disposable income.</v>

2596
02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:49.750
<v Speaker 4>You can award that to any creator you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want,</v>

2597
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:54.990
<v Speaker 4>but as you progress through the courses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right to determine where your </v>

2598
02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:58.060
<v Speaker 4>money goes would increase as you became </v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more educated.</v>

2599
02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:00.820
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully that way we would get some </v>
<v Speaker 4>quality control built into it.</v>

2600
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:02.740
<v Speaker 4>So those are some of the ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>

2601
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:06.830
<v Speaker 4>that were starting to play around with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the only one I'm considered.</v>

2602
02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Modista motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

2603
02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:12.280
<v Speaker 4>The motivation issue for individuals?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2604
02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:16.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to go into that because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>would take too long,</v>

2605
02:19:16.211 --> 02:19:21.211
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but rest assured that we are thinking </v>

2606
02:19:21.211 --> 02:19:23.581
<v Speaker 4>about that very hard as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to build competition into </v>

2607
02:19:23.581 --> 02:19:26.971
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to build cooperation into </v>

2608
02:19:26.971 --> 02:19:26.971
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We hope to build peer interrelationships</v>

2609
02:19:26.971 --> 02:19:28.400
<v Speaker 4>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I all that's possible but,</v>

2610
02:19:28.670 --> 02:19:29.750
<v Speaker 4>but complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2611
02:19:29.751 --> 02:19:34.751
<v Speaker 4>Because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know how to build an online </v>

2612
02:19:34.751 --> 02:19:34.990
<v Speaker 4>education system really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2613
02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:38.480
<v Speaker 4>but it would be fun to experiment and </v>
<v Speaker 4>see if we can figure out how to do it.</v>

2614
02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:40.650
<v Speaker 4>So thank you.</v>

2615
02:19:46.130 --> 02:19:47.500
<v Speaker 9>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

2616
02:19:47.501 --> 02:19:52.501
<v Speaker 9>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I couldn't really zero in on any </v>

2617
02:19:52.501 --> 02:19:56.491
<v Speaker 9>particular question.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So it's more of a family questions that </v>

2618
02:19:56.491 --> 02:19:56.980
<v Speaker 9>I have about the nature and cultivation </v>
<v Speaker 9>of conscience,</v>

2619
02:19:57.340 --> 02:20:01.510
<v Speaker 9>which was in a sense of what the story a</v>
<v Speaker 9>exemplified about Abraham.</v>

2620
02:20:01.930 --> 02:20:02.590
<v Speaker 9>What,</v>
<v Speaker 9>why do you</v>

2621
02:20:02.670 --> 02:20:07.670
<v Speaker 4>say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that the story </v>

2622
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:08.460
<v Speaker 4>exemplified the development of conscious</v>
<v Speaker 4>of conscience specific specifically?</v>

2623
02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:11.100
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>going back to the Zig Zag,</v>

2624
02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:12.590
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the star.</v>

2625
02:20:12.591 --> 02:20:13.630
<v Speaker 9>How you have to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

2626
02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:18.640
<v Speaker 9>So that's what you were referring to.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Orienting yourself completely </v>

2627
02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:20.080
<v Speaker 9>autonomously on your own terms.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

2628
02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:21.410
<v Speaker 9>A toe.</v>

2629
02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:22.470
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2630
02:20:22.530 --> 02:20:24.390
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hit on some great there.</v>

2631
02:20:24.391 --> 02:20:25.170
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2632
02:20:25.620 --> 02:20:30.620
<v Speaker 4>this is something weirdly enough that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned most particularly from the </v>

2633
02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:35.180
<v Speaker 4>Pinocchio Movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I spent a lot of time studying is </v>

2634
02:20:35.180 --> 02:20:37.310
<v Speaker 4>because in the Pinocchio movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimminy Cricket is an Avatar of Christ </v>

2635
02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:42.081
<v Speaker 4>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's very strange because he's a </v>

2636
02:20:42.081 --> 02:20:44.301
<v Speaker 4>bug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first thing that's kind of </v>

2637
02:20:44.301 --> 02:20:45.210
<v Speaker 4>weird because Jimminy cricket is </v>
<v Speaker 4>southern US slang for Jesus Christ among</v>

2638
02:20:45.211 --> 02:20:48.480
<v Speaker 4>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But these things get aggregated in,</v>

2639
02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:51.900
<v Speaker 4>in great mythic dramas like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a great mythic drama.</v>

2640
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:57.230
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that really makes </v>

2641
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.840
<v Speaker 4>jimminy cricket different from Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart from the fact that Christ wasn't a</v>

2642
02:20:57.841 --> 02:21:02.460
<v Speaker 4>cricket is that created the cricket </v>
<v Speaker 4>learns as he progresses,</v>

2643
02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:04.590
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though he's the conscience.</v>

2644
02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:07.200
<v Speaker 4>And so you'd think that he would be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>infallible guide.</v>

2645
02:21:07.380 --> 02:21:08.940
<v Speaker 4>That isn't how the movie makers set it </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

2646
02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:13.940
<v Speaker 4>And that's so cool is that he's just as </v>
<v Speaker 4>muddle headed as Pinocchio at the </v>

2647
02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:15.810
<v Speaker 4>beginning and he's a bit arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>puffed up to.</v>

2648
02:21:16.170 --> 02:21:19.440
<v Speaker 4>And so it took me a long time to think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that through.</v>

2649
02:21:19.441 --> 02:21:20.700
<v Speaker 4>And then I realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2650
02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:25.590
<v Speaker 4>you have the voice of the voice of </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture in you.</v>

2651
02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:27.720
<v Speaker 4>You have the voice of culture within </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2652
02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:32.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's old and dead and out of date </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not fully articulated.</v>

2653
02:21:32.791 --> 02:21:37.791
<v Speaker 4>An updated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then what happens is that if you </v>

2654
02:21:37.791 --> 02:21:39.801
<v Speaker 4>enter into a dialogue with it and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>hammer yourself against the world,</v>

2655
02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:43.260
<v Speaker 4>then you get hammered into shape and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>does your conscience.</v>

2656
02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:47.270
<v Speaker 4>And so you both become elevated and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2657
02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:48.610
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>

2658
02:21:49.050 --> 02:21:52.440
<v Speaker 4>that's ridiculously cool because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>means that your conscience,</v>

2659
02:21:52.470 --> 02:21:57.470
<v Speaker 4>you don't have an infallible guide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have something within you that </v>

2660
02:21:57.470 --> 02:22:00.231
<v Speaker 4>you could build into an infallible guide</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you cooperated with it and fed it so </v>

2661
02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:03.540
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that's very interesting.</v>

2662
02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:08.790
<v Speaker 9>So that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the picture that I have in my mind of </v>

2663
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:11.440
<v Speaker 9>the cultivation of virtue in general,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's kind of like taking a,</v>

2664
02:22:11.610 --> 02:22:14.800
<v Speaker 9>a block of wood and trying to carve out </v>
<v Speaker 9>a sphere out of it.</v>

2665
02:22:15.010 --> 02:22:17.560
<v Speaker 9>It'll never be perfectly round.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But the more you carve,</v>

2666
02:22:17.561 --> 02:22:18.980
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>The rounder and Roderick,</v>

2667
02:22:19.390 --> 02:22:21.550
<v Speaker 9>that successive approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2668
02:22:21.551 --> 02:22:23.640
<v Speaker 9>Well one of it's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

2669
02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:26.520
<v Speaker 9>what do you call compound interest?</v>

2670
02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:31.940
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the things that's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think this puts you on the to </v>

2671
02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:34.080
<v Speaker 4>those who more shall be given part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the curve.</v>

2672
02:22:34.470 --> 02:22:36.030
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2673
02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:41.260
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to improve yourself very </v>
<v Speaker 4>much each week to really improve </v>

2674
02:22:41.641 --> 02:22:44.040
<v Speaker 4>yourself on a ridiculous amount in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

2675
02:22:44.330 --> 02:22:45.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you could make,</v>

2676
02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:46.220
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>

2677
02:22:46.470 --> 02:22:51.470
<v Speaker 4>you could vow to make your day one 100th</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a percent better than the day before,</v>

2678
02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:57.180
<v Speaker 4>and that would do the trick if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were constant about that,</v>

2679
02:22:57.540 --> 02:22:59.250
<v Speaker 4>that would do the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

2680
02:22:59.251 --> 02:23:04.251
<v Speaker 4>that's the success of approximation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to underestimate the </v>

2681
02:23:04.251 --> 02:23:05.190
<v Speaker 4>utility of incremental progress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

2682
02:23:05.340 --> 02:23:08.580
<v Speaker 4>it's really kids deadly powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2683
02:23:09.130 --> 02:23:11.680
<v Speaker 9>so let's say you get to the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

2684
02:23:11.681 --> 02:23:13.150
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the higher ends of the curve,</v>

2685
02:23:13.151 --> 02:23:15.310
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're like a pretty virtuous person.</v>

2686
02:23:16.330 --> 02:23:19.510
<v Speaker 9>Let's say you even become a sage or </v>
<v Speaker 9>something of the sort,</v>

2687
02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:24.960
<v Speaker 9>and I mean one,</v>
<v Speaker 9>should you doubt your conscience,</v>

2688
02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:29.640
<v Speaker 9>like what are the things that we should </v>
<v Speaker 9>watch out for even when we got some.</v>

2689
02:23:29.710 --> 02:23:34.710
<v Speaker 9>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well that's okay just to get out of the </v>

2690
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.710
<v Speaker 9>way,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

2691
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:37.810
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know how much this relates.</v>

2692
02:23:38.310 --> 02:23:39.790
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it does relate,</v>

2693
02:23:39.791 --> 02:23:41.830
<v Speaker 9>but psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 9>for example,</v>

2694
02:23:41.860 --> 02:23:44.890
<v Speaker 9>the entire idea that they lack a </v>
<v Speaker 9>conscience and that's why,</v>

2695
02:23:45.070 --> 02:23:47.110
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's what psychopathy is.</v>

2696
02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:50.830
<v Speaker 9>Whether or not you agree with that </v>
<v Speaker 9>definition,</v>

2697
02:23:50.860 --> 02:23:52.690
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>But there's an issue of conscience,</v>

2698
02:23:52.691 --> 02:23:54.490
<v Speaker 9>again,</v>
<v Speaker 9>a play with psychopathy.</v>

2699
02:23:55.750 --> 02:24:00.750
<v Speaker 9>How can we the first question,</v>
<v Speaker 9>doubt ourselves in a way that's </v>

2700
02:24:01.931 --> 02:24:02.920
<v Speaker 9>warranted,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

2701
02:24:02.921 --> 02:24:07.921
<v Speaker 9>Regardless of how virtuous we've become.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And can you treat a psychopath?</v>

2702
02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:11.680
<v Speaker 9>Could they cultivate a conscience?</v>

2703
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:12.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's,</v>

2704
02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:15.500
<v Speaker 4>we'll start with the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Part of the reason that,</v>

2705
02:24:15.570 --> 02:24:20.130
<v Speaker 4>that I believe that freedom of speech is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the canonical,</v>

2706
02:24:21.150 --> 02:24:23.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an obligation,</v>

2707
02:24:23.101 --> 02:24:24.150
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>More importantly,</v>

2708
02:24:24.151 --> 02:24:28.650
<v Speaker 4>even obligation is that that's how you </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out if you're wrong,</v>

2709
02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:31.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because.</v>

2710
02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:32.590
<v Speaker 4>So I sit home and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think,</v>

2711
02:24:32.591 --> 02:24:34.600
<v Speaker 4>and I think let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm like,</v>

2712
02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:37.690
<v Speaker 4>who am I to think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many things.</v>

2713
02:24:37.691 --> 02:24:42.691
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the one I know compared to what </v>

2714
02:24:42.691 --> 02:24:47.191
<v Speaker 4>I don't know is so minuscule that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous act just to say something.</v>

2715
02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:51.700
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2716
02:24:51.850 --> 02:24:54.610
<v Speaker 4>so no matter how much I sit at home and </v>
<v Speaker 4>think I'm not going to fix that,</v>

2717
02:24:54.611 --> 02:24:56.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I have biases,</v>

2718
02:24:56.321 --> 02:25:01.321
<v Speaker 4>but my temperament and I have biases </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of my malevolence and I have </v>

2719
02:25:01.321 --> 02:25:03.400
<v Speaker 4>biases because of my gender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my sex,</v>

2720
02:25:03.401 --> 02:25:06.130
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since we're not so fond of that word.</v>

2721
02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:13.500
<v Speaker 4>So Eva,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter how much I sit home and think </v>

2722
02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:13.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm still going to be wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 4>malevolent,</v>

2723
02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:19.560
<v Speaker 4>so then whenever I have to do is I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk to some other people and I have </v>

2724
02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:22.771
<v Speaker 4>to say this is what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's going to be ugly,</v>

2725
02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:28.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because what the hell do I know?</v>

2726
02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:30.490
<v Speaker 5>But then if I listen,</v>

2727
02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:37.680
<v Speaker 4>people will tell me why I'm wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of people have been telling me why </v>

2728
02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:39.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm wrong like a lot and it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2729
02:25:39.970 --> 02:25:41.500
<v Speaker 4>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

2730
02:25:41.770 --> 02:25:44.680
<v Speaker 4>But I've learned something from it like </v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this</v>

2731
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:50.990
<v Speaker 4>revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say about being yelled at by your </v>

2732
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.510
<v Speaker 4>father.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I know that you can be yelled at too</v>

2733
02:25:51.511 --> 02:25:55.710
<v Speaker 4>much by your father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like you're wrong man.</v>

2734
02:25:56.340 --> 02:25:59.790
<v Speaker 4>And so someone's yelling at you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they're only 10 percent right?</v>

2735
02:26:00.330 --> 02:26:05.330
<v Speaker 4>But if you shut the hell up and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can figure out where you're </v>

2736
02:26:05.330 --> 02:26:09.411
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe you can be thankful for </v>

2737
02:26:09.411 --> 02:26:12.051
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe if you shut up and </v>

2738
02:26:12.051 --> 02:26:12.051
<v Speaker 4>listened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your father would quit yelling at you.</v>

2739
02:26:12.051 --> 02:26:13.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's wrong too.</v>

2740
02:26:13.291 --> 02:26:16.230
<v Speaker 4>What the hell does he know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows how to yell at you and tell you</v>

2741
02:26:16.231 --> 02:26:18.330
<v Speaker 4>how you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's throwing things out.</v>

2742
02:26:18.331 --> 02:26:23.331
<v Speaker 4>You add you that are probably not true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of it's true and you know,</v>

2743
02:26:23.851 --> 02:26:25.500
<v Speaker 4>if someone can tell you why you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong,</v>

2744
02:26:25.501 --> 02:26:29.880
<v Speaker 4>they've given you a great gift because </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you don't have to be wrong anymore.</v>

2745
02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:31.560
<v Speaker 4>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well who cares if you're wrong,</v>

2746
02:26:31.561 --> 02:26:34.470
<v Speaker 4>but you know there's a line in the new </v>
<v Speaker 4>testament too,</v>

2747
02:26:34.471 --> 02:26:37.770
<v Speaker 4>is if the blind lead the blind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>won't they fall in?</v>

2748
02:26:37.890 --> 02:26:42.890
<v Speaker 4>Won't they fall into a ditch?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that question by the </v>

2749
02:26:42.890 --> 02:26:42.890
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is yes,</v>

2750
02:26:42.890 --> 02:26:45.030
<v Speaker 4>they will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the reason that you want to think</v>

2751
02:26:45.031 --> 02:26:46.950
<v Speaker 4>is because thinking is how you.</v>

2752
02:26:47.890 --> 02:26:52.890
<v Speaker 4>It like when you think you created a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fictional world that's,</v>

2753
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:58.110
<v Speaker 4>that's an analog of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you make an Avatar of yourself </v>

2754
02:26:58.110 --> 02:26:58.850
<v Speaker 4>to act in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if the Avatar dies,</v>

2755
02:26:58.851 --> 02:27:01.010
<v Speaker 4>you don't act out those actions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2756
02:27:01.460 --> 02:27:04.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you think properly,</v>

2757
02:27:04.910 --> 02:27:08.540
<v Speaker 4>then you don't have to suffer and die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you can say what you think and</v>

2758
02:27:08.541 --> 02:27:13.541
<v Speaker 4>people can tell you why you're wrong and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know to say what you think under </v>

2759
02:27:13.541 --> 02:27:15.680
<v Speaker 4>extreme circumstances means that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to say things that no one wants to</v>

2760
02:27:15.681 --> 02:27:18.080
<v Speaker 4>hear because those are the things you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know about.</v>

2761
02:27:18.081 --> 02:27:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Those are the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflictual and difficult it,</v>

2762
02:27:20.770 --> 02:27:22.400
<v Speaker 4>those are going to be hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations,</v>

2763
02:27:22.401 --> 02:27:27.401
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're going to be wrong about them </v>

2764
02:27:27.401 --> 02:27:27.401
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't get to stumble forward with</v>

2765
02:27:27.401 --> 02:27:30.230
<v Speaker 4>your stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you can't be corrected.</v>

2766
02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:35.920
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there is no distinction between free </v>

2767
02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:38.771
<v Speaker 4>speech and thinking and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinction between thinking and </v>

2768
02:27:38.771 --> 02:27:41.771
<v Speaker 4>thriving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so those who want to inhibit free </v>

2769
02:27:41.771 --> 02:27:44.291
<v Speaker 4>speech do not wish for people to thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I believe that.</v>

2770
02:27:45.810 --> 02:27:46.350
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2771
02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:51.170
<v Speaker 4>thinking does not happen inside your </v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

2772
02:27:51.860 --> 02:27:53.510
<v Speaker 4>That's the only the beginnings of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>

2773
02:27:53.660 --> 02:27:56.390
<v Speaker 4>And it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're doing here that's thinking,</v>

2774
02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:59.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we have to protect that.</v>

2775
02:27:59.930 --> 02:28:02.870
<v Speaker 4>Psychopaths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2776
02:28:04.180 --> 02:28:06.280
<v Speaker 4>I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope non naively</v>

2777
02:28:07.290 --> 02:28:12.290
<v Speaker 4>also having dealt with psychopaths in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>clinical practice and I would say now </v>

2778
02:28:12.290 --> 02:28:15.000
<v Speaker 4>and then in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in psychopaths.</v>

2779
02:28:16.350 --> 02:28:20.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that we know enough to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say there are people born without,</v>

2780
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:27.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the psychometric </v>

2781
02:28:27.250 --> 02:28:28.340
<v Speaker 4>measurement of psychopathy is everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it should be.</v>

2782
02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:31.250
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to model it in the big </v>
<v Speaker 4>five domain.</v>

2783
02:28:31.251 --> 02:28:35.210
<v Speaker 4>I think now it's complicated because.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would say a psychopath,</v>

2784
02:28:35.211 --> 02:28:37.340
<v Speaker 4>a classic psychopath is likely </v>
<v Speaker 4>extroverted,</v>

2785
02:28:37.341 --> 02:28:42.341
<v Speaker 4>especially assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disagreeable and unconscientious and </v>

2786
02:28:42.341 --> 02:28:45.710
<v Speaker 4>maybe extremely low in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can't frighten them.</v>

2787
02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:51.400
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a rare combination because </v>

2788
02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:51.400
<v Speaker 4>it's extreme on many traits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2789
02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:56.560
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that that means that </v>

2790
02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:59.231
<v Speaker 4>someone with that personality </v>
<v Speaker 4>configuration is doomed from birth to a </v>

2791
02:28:59.231 --> 02:29:02.030
<v Speaker 4>pathological existence because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about psychopathy that,</v>

2792
02:29:02.510 --> 02:29:05.150
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the classifiers,</v>

2793
02:29:05.180 --> 02:29:10.180
<v Speaker 4>those who claim like clinically that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychopath is born in some sense can't </v>

2794
02:29:10.180 --> 02:29:10.700
<v Speaker 4>explain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2795
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:13.490
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about the cruelty?</v>

2796
02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:16.800
<v Speaker 4>It seems to be a motive there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2797
02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:19.570
<v Speaker 4>with are passionless and they lack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they lack emotion.</v>

2798
02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are they cruel then for </v>

2799
02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:24.770
<v Speaker 4>entertainment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2800
02:29:25.330 --> 02:29:28.160
<v Speaker 4>but then you have to explain the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entertainment motivation.</v>

2801
02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:33.520
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a failure in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the classic psychopathy theorists </v>

2802
02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:34.850
<v Speaker 4>to come to grips with the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 4>malevolence.</v>

2803
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:38.810
<v Speaker 4>It's skirted over and you can't do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're talking about psychopathy,</v>

2804
02:29:38.811 --> 02:29:40.910
<v Speaker 4>it's like malevolence is the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue here,</v>

2805
02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:41.900
<v Speaker 4>and so</v>

2806
02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:46.830
<v Speaker 4>the other issue with this psychopath is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's irredeemable,</v>

2807
02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:47.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea.</v>

2808
02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:53.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we know enough to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>such claims now and that doesn't.</v>

2809
02:29:54.040 --> 02:29:59.040
<v Speaker 4>I know the psychopathy literature quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>well and I have great respect for their </v>

2810
02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:00.410
<v Speaker 4>primary research is in the field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to make that perfectly clear,</v>

2811
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:02.690
<v Speaker 4>but we're talking at a different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking,</v>

2812
02:30:03.140 --> 02:30:05.750
<v Speaker 4>we're approaching the problem from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different level of analysis here.</v>

2813
02:30:05.751 --> 02:30:10.751
<v Speaker 4>Something like a spiritual level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>analysis and I don't think that there's </v>

2814
02:30:10.751 --> 02:30:14.411
<v Speaker 4>an easy easy translation from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>descriptive psychometric psychiatric </v>

2815
02:30:14.411 --> 02:30:19.181
<v Speaker 4>approach to the spiritual level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't match and I'm more likely to </v>

2816
02:30:20.091 --> 02:30:23.930
<v Speaker 4>say let's not assume the soul is doomed </v>
<v Speaker 4>from birth.</v>

2817
02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:29.020
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm loath to think that there are </v>

2818
02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:33.341
<v Speaker 4>people born irredeemable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although I do think there are </v>

2819
02:30:33.341 --> 02:30:37.211
<v Speaker 4>irredeemable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People knew that the death penalty </v>

2820
02:30:37.211 --> 02:30:37.211
<v Speaker 4>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting in that regard.</v>

2821
02:30:37.211 --> 02:30:42.131
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've read a lot about really </v>

2822
02:30:42.131 --> 02:30:44.531
<v Speaker 4>terrible people and I've also read a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>about what really terrible people said </v>

2823
02:30:44.531 --> 02:30:49.481
<v Speaker 4>about themselves and many of them wished</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the death penalty and so it's </v>

2824
02:30:49.481 --> 02:30:54.281
<v Speaker 4>absolutely clear that there are things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can do that deserved the death </v>

2825
02:30:54.281 --> 02:30:58.571
<v Speaker 4>penalty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean that the state </v>

2826
02:30:58.571 --> 02:30:58.571
<v Speaker 4>should have the right to impose it.</v>

2827
02:30:58.571 --> 02:31:02.720
<v Speaker 4>That's a different question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2828
02:31:03.550 --> 02:31:08.550
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

2829
02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:14.520
<v Speaker 10>In the previous lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you mentioned the 2008 economic crisis </v>

2830
02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:17.821
<v Speaker 10>and one of the very interesting themes </v>
<v Speaker 10>that's emerged at many levels be at </v>

2831
02:31:17.821 --> 02:31:19.090
<v Speaker 10>universities or economic policy is this </v>
<v Speaker 10>perceived culture war,</v>

2832
02:31:19.230 --> 02:31:24.230
<v Speaker 10>specifically the idea of Mark's versus </v>
<v Speaker 10>mill and you've criticized postmodern </v>

2833
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:26.150
<v Speaker 10>and neo Marxist thought very frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 10>One interesting critic of,</v>

2834
02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:27.780
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>policies of the EU,</v>

2835
02:31:27.781 --> 02:31:29.700
<v Speaker 10>specifically ECB,</v>
<v Speaker 10>ECB,</v>

2836
02:31:29.701 --> 02:31:32.910
<v Speaker 10>and IMF during the Greek debt crisis was</v>
<v Speaker 10>Yanis Varoufakis,</v>

2837
02:31:32.911 --> 02:31:36.720
<v Speaker 10>the former Greek finance minister and </v>
<v Speaker 10>his criticism of mill was the,</v>

2838
02:31:36.850 --> 02:31:41.850
<v Speaker 10>was mills alleged contempt for the </v>
<v Speaker 10>population and verify has comments on </v>

2839
02:31:41.850 --> 02:31:43.920
<v Speaker 10>the type of capitalism that results in </v>
<v Speaker 10>too big to fail.</v>

2840
02:31:44.160 --> 02:31:46.470
<v Speaker 10>He described themselves as an erratic </v>
<v Speaker 10>Marxist.</v>

2841
02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:51.530
<v Speaker 10>To me personally is an example of </v>
<v Speaker 10>someone whose position on the </v>

2842
02:31:51.530 --> 02:31:53.250
<v Speaker 10>philosophical moring of policy is </v>
<v Speaker 10>interesting to compare and contrast with</v>

2843
02:31:53.251 --> 02:31:55.890
<v Speaker 10>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He's certainly not your typical Marxist,</v>

2844
02:31:55.891 --> 02:32:00.891
<v Speaker 10>so postmodernist,</v>
<v Speaker 10>even though I'm not really sure what </v>

2845
02:32:00.891 --> 02:32:02.481
<v Speaker 10>that means,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but if you look at his work during the </v>

2846
02:32:02.481 --> 02:32:02.481
<v Speaker 10>Greek debt crisis and his current work </v>
<v Speaker 10>with [inaudible],</v>

2847
02:32:02.481 --> 02:32:05.760
<v Speaker 10>he seems to be well reasoned,</v>
<v Speaker 10>well positioned and and articulate.</v>

2848
02:32:05.790 --> 02:32:10.790
<v Speaker 10>Now I wanted to know if you had an </v>
<v Speaker 10>opinion on that type of criticism of </v>

2849
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:11.730
<v Speaker 10>mill or is taking of a position as an </v>
<v Speaker 10>erratic Marxist.</v>

2850
02:32:12.210 --> 02:32:17.210
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say I would say no to the </v>

2851
02:32:17.210 --> 02:32:22.041
<v Speaker 4>specifics of the question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that I have that detailed </v>

2852
02:32:22.291 --> 02:32:27.291
<v Speaker 4>expertise in order to answer the </v>
<v Speaker 4>question at the level of analysis that </v>

2853
02:32:27.291 --> 02:32:28.740
<v Speaker 4>you were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You formulated it,</v>

2854
02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:34.640
<v Speaker 4>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have something to say that's more </v>

2855
02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:34.640
<v Speaker 4>general about the set of phenomena that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you described.</v>

2856
02:32:35.010 --> 02:32:40.010
<v Speaker 4>There is no doubt that distribution is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>major problem that capitalism contends </v>

2857
02:32:41.221 --> 02:32:46.221
<v Speaker 4>with imperfectly at best and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>distribution problem is the prieto </v>

2858
02:32:47.101 --> 02:32:50.160
<v Speaker 4>distribution problem right in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and something that marks commented on,</v>

2859
02:32:50.161 --> 02:32:55.161
<v Speaker 4>which mostly in the monetary sphere is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that money tends to accumulate in the </v>

2860
02:32:55.161 --> 02:32:57.300
<v Speaker 4>hands of very few people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's no doubt about that.</v>

2861
02:32:57.360 --> 02:32:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as we've discussed before,</v>

2862
02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:04.230
<v Speaker 4>the people in whom hands the money </v>
<v Speaker 4>accumulates do turnover more than people</v>

2863
02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:06.510
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in,</v>

2864
02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:11.560
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in countries that are functioning </v>

2865
02:33:11.560 --> 02:33:14.300
<v Speaker 4>reasonably well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's really important that that </v>

2866
02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:14.300
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

2867
02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:14.300
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2868
02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:15.840
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't,</v>

2869
02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:21.920
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't solve the problem of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that produced goods gravitate </v>

2870
02:33:23.821 --> 02:33:28.821
<v Speaker 4>towards an extreme minority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there are also produced often by </v>

2871
02:33:28.821 --> 02:33:28.860
<v Speaker 4>extreme minority,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is also a problem.</v>

2872
02:33:29.530 --> 02:33:34.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say then that the idea that </v>

2873
02:33:34.891 --> 02:33:39.891
<v Speaker 4>capitalism is more prone to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>distribution problem than any other </v>

2874
02:33:40.981 --> 02:33:45.981
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that to have been </v>

2875
02:33:45.981 --> 02:33:48.771
<v Speaker 4>demonstrated at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that capitalism is actually </v>

2876
02:33:48.771 --> 02:33:51.480
<v Speaker 4>pretty good at self destruction except </v>
<v Speaker 4>when that's interfered with.</v>

2877
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:56.870
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's particularly the case</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the United States were generally the </v>

2878
02:33:56.911 --> 02:34:00.960
<v Speaker 4>policy has been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're an idol with feet of clay,</v>

2879
02:34:00.961 --> 02:34:03.870
<v Speaker 4>no matter how big you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to fail now.</v>

2880
02:34:03.871 --> 02:34:08.871
<v Speaker 4>That's been compromised severely in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last 20 years and we're probably going </v>

2881
02:34:10.591 --> 02:34:15.591
<v Speaker 4>to pay for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they really paid for that in </v>

2882
02:34:15.591 --> 02:34:15.591
<v Speaker 4>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2883
02:34:15.591 --> 02:34:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Where there was every attempt to prop </v>
<v Speaker 4>out the gods that should have died.</v>

2884
02:34:20.590 --> 02:34:21.160
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

2885
02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:27.070
<v Speaker 4>So fair enough for the critique of </v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalism.</v>

2886
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:32.560
<v Speaker 4>That's not the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The issue is do you have a better idea?</v>

2887
02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:37.000
<v Speaker 4>And if the idea is well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could kind of do it,</v>

2888
02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:42.001
<v Speaker 4>mark suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you don't get to have that position</v>

2889
02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:47.710
<v Speaker 4>and claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What should I say?</v>

2890
02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:54.000
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen any evidence that systems</v>
<v Speaker 4>predicated on that set of axioms have </v>

2891
02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:58.741
<v Speaker 4>done anything but more harm than good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when will you be announcing the </v>

2892
02:34:59.291 --> 02:35:00.850
<v Speaker 4>monthly extension to this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The series?</v>

2893
02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:04.870
<v Speaker 4>As soon as I find out whether or not I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can rent this theater in the fall.</v>

2894
02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2895
02:35:07.490 --> 02:35:09.710
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll see you next week.</v>
