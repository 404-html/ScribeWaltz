00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's</v>

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.100
<v Speaker 2>July 18th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday,</v>

3
00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:07.040
<v Speaker 2>July 18th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017,</v>

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.240
<v Speaker 2>and I've been working for the last few </v>
<v Speaker 2>days on the eighth lecture in my series,</v>

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 2>the psychological significance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical stories and I'm planning to </v>

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.121
<v Speaker 2>talk about the abrahamic stories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately follow the stories of Noah </v>

7
00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:26.491
<v Speaker 2>and the Tower of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as familiar with abrahamic </v>

8
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 2>stories as I am with the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earlier stories in genesis say from </v>

9
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:33.950
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the Bible through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories of Noah and the Tower of Babel.</v>

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not as familiar with abrahamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories as I am with the stories of </v>

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Moses that begin with exodus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuing to succeeding chapters.</v>

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 2>So I've had to do a lot of reading and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of thinking and,</v>

13
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 2>and some conversing as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as part of that process,</v>

14
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 2>I spoke once again with Jonathan Patio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 2>a carver of stone icons and an Orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian and student of religion.</v>

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.760
<v Speaker 2>And also this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I did a video with a while back,</v>

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.800
<v Speaker 2>you might remember called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphysics of pepe,</v>

18
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 2>where we discussed the psychology of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stranger and also some of the stories,</v>

19
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Speaker 2>abrahamic stories involving lot in Sodom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Gomorrah,</v>

20
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 2>and I also had the opportunity to meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>his brother Matthew Palio,</v>

21
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 2>who's been working on a book on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible for the last three and a half </v>

22
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

23
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 2>And so we spent 90 minutes talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the abrahamic stories and the conceptual</v>

24
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:25.700
<v Speaker 2>background that's necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand them.</v>

25
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:30.701
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I want to show you today</v>
<v Speaker 2>after this introduction.</v>

26
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 2>So I hope it's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to introduce both of you.</v>

27
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:41.121
<v Speaker 2>So Jonathan is a carver of icons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spoken with Jonathan a number of </v>

28
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 2>times already and he now has his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube channel as well,</v>

29
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 2>where he discusses issues that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar to the ones that we're going to </v>

30
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.611
<v Speaker 2>discuss today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Matthew is his brother who I haven't </v>

31
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 2>met before in Matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been working on a book for the last.</v>

32
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 2>How long?</v>

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.650
<v Speaker 3>Two and a half years.</v>

34
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Three and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you want to tell everyone very </v>

35
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 2>briefly about the book?</v>

36
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a book about symbolism,</v>

37
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:09.231
<v Speaker 3>but it's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to rediscover the world view </v>

38
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 3>that was present in the time of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible or at least actually not that long</v>

39
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 3>ago because modern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern interpretations of reality,</v>

40
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 3>materialists interpretations of reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't that old,</v>

41
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world view that was there when </v>

42
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 3>traditional societies were still there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

43
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 3>and so I'm trying to rediscover that </v>
<v Speaker 3>worldview and a,</v>

44
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 3>basically there are basic patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven and earth time and space,</v>

45
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 3>things like things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

46
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:47.541
<v Speaker 3>so it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cosmology that's been completely lost </v>

47
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 3>as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people have glimpses of it,</v>

48
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very general patterns that we </v>

49
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 3>have to re re understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can understand the Bible,</v>

50
00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other,</v>

51
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 3>other storage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get interested</v>

52
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it that compelled you to do</v>

53
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

54
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where to start.</v>

55
00:03:07.471 --> 00:03:08.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my whole life has been about that.</v>

56
00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:10.290
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

57
00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you read the Bible,</v>

58
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.970
<v Speaker 3>you can take it literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take it figuratively or you can </v>

59
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:17.640
<v Speaker 3>take it both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm trying to take it both ways.</v>

60
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to get rid of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy,</v>

61
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.080
<v Speaker 3>the dichotomy of symbolism and factual </v>
<v Speaker 3>description.</v>

62
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.580
<v Speaker 3>I think there is no such dichotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you understand what the words mean.</v>

63
00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:34.581
<v Speaker 3>If you have the right perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no more metaphors in the Bible.</v>

64
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.680
<v Speaker 3>There are no okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it takes a while to get there </v>

65
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.200
<v Speaker 3>because you have to adopt a completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different perspective than,</v>

66
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 3>than the materialistic when obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to be a materialist and,</v>

67
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.470
<v Speaker 3>and a Christian or we can be a religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a materialist.</v>

68
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.160
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

69
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things we're hoping is </v>

70
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.640
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

71
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.640
<v Speaker 4>we've been getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been getting a lot of questions and</v>

72
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 4>I know you probably Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me getting a lot of questions about this</v>

73
00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 4>question of metaphor and a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>have been asking me how do we reconcile,</v>

74
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.150
<v Speaker 4>how do I reconcile metaphors with what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Bible?</v>

75
00:04:06.151 --> 00:04:11.151
<v Speaker 4>How do I reconcile these metaphors with </v>
<v Speaker 4>how I'm supposed to live in the world </v>

76
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:14.721
<v Speaker 4>and I think that would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>matthew has been with his writing and </v>

77
00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:14.721
<v Speaker 4>what I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been reading it,</v>

78
00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that he,</v>

79
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.670
<v Speaker 4>he's really able to answer that question</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way that I think will be one of the</v>

80
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 4>most satisfying answers that we've seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>in in awhile.</v>

81
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.870
<v Speaker 4>So we're pretty excited to see how are </v>
<v Speaker 4>we going to get that out</v>

82
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.720
<v Speaker 2>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me start by telling you what I've</v>

83
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:35.721
<v Speaker 2>been thinking about just briefly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you guys can comment and I'd like </v>

84
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:37.260
<v Speaker 2>you to do most of the talking if we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage that.</v>

85
00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Although I'm so damn talkative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to imagine that'll happen,</v>

86
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.530
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been reading this book called </v>

87
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.120
<v Speaker 2>the disappearance of God and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>using it as a.</v>

88
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a body guy named Richard Friedman </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was published I think in 2005.</v>

89
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might have been earlier than that,</v>

90
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.610
<v Speaker 2>but he makes a couple of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>points about the all the braiding in the</v>

91
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:08.091
<v Speaker 2>old testament and and they're parallel </v>
<v Speaker 2>points and so the first is that the </v>

92
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.290
<v Speaker 2>closer you are to the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible,</v>

93
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:15.291
<v Speaker 2>the more God is present and and as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress towards the end of the Old </v>

94
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:22.641
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God sort of vanishes in stages until he </v>

95
00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:25.710
<v Speaker 2>only manifests himself if at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in prophetic visions.</v>

96
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.180
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time the parallel </v>
<v Speaker 2>development is that the stories of </v>

97
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.190
<v Speaker 2>individual human beings become more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more well developed.</v>

98
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.790
<v Speaker 2>So it's like as the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual personality emerges or the </v>

99
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:41.760
<v Speaker 2>fact of the individual personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerges.</v>

100
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.790
<v Speaker 2>The the presence of God as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a detectable entity like an external </v>

101
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:52.350
<v Speaker 2>entity even seems to decline </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportionately.</v>

102
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm trying to puzzle that out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a variety of different ways.</v>

103
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Partly neurologically because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some evidence that the domain of </v>

104
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:09.281
<v Speaker 2>experience that you might associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my associate with the divine is a </v>

105
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:15.041
<v Speaker 2>consequence of suppressed lemons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Left Hemisphere function and augmented </v>

106
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.701
<v Speaker 2>right hemisphere function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm trying to also consider </v>

107
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 2>that in relationship to the effect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals like silicide been,</v>

108
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 2>which obviously can produce powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystical experiences,</v>

109
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 2>so experiences of consciousness that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>really have a different type than normal</v>

110
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.420
<v Speaker 2>waking ego consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've also been reading humans mostly</v>

111
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:41.471
<v Speaker 2>commentaries about humans read book and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his attempts to use active imagination </v>

112
00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:46.211
<v Speaker 2>as a as a means to explore the contents </v>
<v Speaker 2>of different forms of consciousness,</v>

113
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 2>which is something that modern people </v>
<v Speaker 2>just really never do.</v>

114
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Although he did it for years and and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that was the red book,</v>

115
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 2>also the black books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which hasn't been published yet,</v>

116
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:00.420
<v Speaker 2>but the red book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a,</v>

117
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 2>which was I think published two or three</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

118
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 2>That was a collection of visionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences in his.</v>

119
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 2>His continuing discussions with figures </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his imagination,</v>

120
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 2>which he regarded as the most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>work he did in his life.</v>

121
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what's,</v>

122
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 2>what does that all boil down to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

123
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.310
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely possible for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have non can have to have experiences </v>

124
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:30.911
<v Speaker 2>outside the domain of their normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that produced the </v>

125
00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:35.531
<v Speaker 2>intimation of the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be factually indisputable.</v>

126
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Those were not exactly sure how those </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences manifested themselves in the</v>

127
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:45.730
<v Speaker 2>periods of time that are associated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early biblical stories.</v>

128
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

129
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.260
<v Speaker 2>the BIP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible talks about those sorts of </v>

130
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.161
<v Speaker 2>experiences very forthrightly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earliest abrahamic stories and also in </v>

131
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:57.090
<v Speaker 2>the story of Noah and obviously an Adam </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eve and all of that.</v>

132
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 2>God is very present and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappears over time and one of the </v>

133
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.781
<v Speaker 2>things that that I'm the guy who wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>the disappearance of God Friedman.</v>

134
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 2>One of the things he pointed out was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the fact of the disappearance of </v>

135
00:08:12.001 --> 00:08:14.850
<v Speaker 2>God in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that that's a.</v>

136
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.810
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a continual,</v>

137
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.870
<v Speaker 2>like it has narrative continuity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fact,</v>

138
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.530
<v Speaker 2>he already remarked on both those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course the books were written</v>

139
00:08:25.531 --> 00:08:27.420
<v Speaker 2>by different people and then they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggregated,</v>

140
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 2>but out of that came to elements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative continuity and one was the </v>

141
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.501
<v Speaker 2>gradual disappearance of God and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other was the gradual rise of the </v>

142
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:37.200
<v Speaker 2>increasingly well-defined and powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

143
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with that is the idea that as</v>

144
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:51.421
<v Speaker 2>God withdraws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also starts to manifest himself more </v>

145
00:08:51.421 --> 00:08:54.871
<v Speaker 2>through the idea of a covenant and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Covenant is something that's </v>

146
00:08:54.871 --> 00:08:58.801
<v Speaker 2>established with an individual all </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously also with the nation in the </v>

147
00:08:58.801 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 2>case of Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's mediated through individuals.</v>

148
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

149
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.430
<v Speaker 2>that's a brief wander through the sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of cloud of associations that make up my</v>

150
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the topic at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

151
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you described sounds a lot like </v>

152
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.010
<v Speaker 3>what would you see in the Bible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure about the god is more </v>

153
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.460
<v Speaker 3>distant part in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>further on and goes,</v>

154
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I understand,</v>

155
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.460
<v Speaker 3>there are two kinds of consciousness in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bible.</v>

156
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.570
<v Speaker 3>One of them is it's called inhabiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the land.</v>

157
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.650
<v Speaker 3>That's when reality fits the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the theory.</v>

158
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the principal and the fact that </v>

159
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.400
<v Speaker 3>grief,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so their loss and people follow the laws</v>

160
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.940
<v Speaker 3>or there's an idea and reality fits with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that idea.</v>

161
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.860
<v Speaker 3>So that's called inhabiting the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>

162
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.790
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's familiar space.</v>

163
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you live in that space,</v>

164
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.530
<v Speaker 3>things make sense because your ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>match what's happening,</v>

165
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you can fall away from that.</v>

166
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.870
<v Speaker 3>That's the covenant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A covenant is an agreement between </v>

167
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.030
<v Speaker 3>theory and practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what a covenant is in the Bible.</v>

168
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm so God gives laws and the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to agree to follow the law </v>

169
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.060
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the law is,</v>

170
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.560
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an identity.</v>

171
00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:26.780
<v Speaker 3>It's not just like you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do that.</v>

172
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:27.940
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

173
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:33.010
<v Speaker 3>it expresses God's identity in practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the facts match that identity,</v>

174
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.340
<v Speaker 3>that's like a soul and a body that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

175
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.210
<v Speaker 3>that a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

176
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.600
<v Speaker 3>So when you fall away from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fall into exile.</v>

177
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.980
<v Speaker 3>That's the other mode and it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

178
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.060
<v Speaker 3>that's what you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

179
00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:55.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure until you've talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a coconut,</v>

180
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.720
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

181
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.340
<v Speaker 3>that's when the meaning and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that do not know.</v>

182
00:11:01.341 --> 00:11:01.760
<v Speaker 3>Touch.</v>

183
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

184
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:07.551
<v Speaker 2>so let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you a couple of questions </v>

185
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:07.551
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

186
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:07.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I've been describing the cosmology in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible as mappable onto the domains </v>

188
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:18.621
<v Speaker 2>of order and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think the best way to </v>

189
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:20.930
<v Speaker 2>define the order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his order is the place you are when what</v>

190
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.090
<v Speaker 2>you're doing matches what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

191
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:29.091
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar to the idea that you just </v>

192
00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:29.091
<v Speaker 2>expressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's exactly it.</v>

193
00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:29.091
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

194
00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a state.</v>

195
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:34.050
<v Speaker 2>There's a state of harmony between </v>
<v Speaker 2>preconception and actuality.</v>

196
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:39.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the circumstance under which </v>

197
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.261
<v Speaker 2>people's emotions remain regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought about that neurologically </v>

198
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:46.101
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what happens is that under </v>

199
00:11:46.101 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 2>those conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your left hemisphere stays in charge and</v>

200
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 2>there's some evidence for that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing too.</v>

201
00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:51.610
<v Speaker 2>Especially from the writings of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurologist.</v>

202
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a neurologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name is Ramachandra and he's quite a</v>

203
00:11:55.841 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 2>famous brain scientist and he's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

204
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.550
<v Speaker 2>another neuropsychologist named El Conan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goldberg,</v>

205
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 2>who's also talked about hemispheric </v>
<v Speaker 2>function in the same way.</v>

206
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 2>And so when things are going according </v>
<v Speaker 2>to plan,</v>

207
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:14.041
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the individual ego </v>

208
00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:18.331
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's focused and specific stays in </v>

209
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:24.211
<v Speaker 2>charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that also keeps negative emotions </v>

210
00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 2>regulate it because there's no need for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because everything is working </v>

211
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you can fall out of that and</v>

212
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 2>you called that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you called that exile?</v>

213
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.460
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

214
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.820
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you fall away from it.</v>

215
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you fall away from the.</v>

216
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.350
<v Speaker 3>So that would be equivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also the flood.</v>

217
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.710
<v Speaker 3>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

218
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.390
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

219
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 2>So I was like the wandering in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>desert.</v>

220
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

221
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.040
<v Speaker 3>the idea of exile is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly what we said.</v>

222
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.100
<v Speaker 3>It's about serving strange things so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not in charge anymore.</v>

223
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Fax something else is what you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in that you live in a world where</v>

224
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.090
<v Speaker 3>you are not in charge or your identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not in charge of the facts and </v>

225
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.490
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't fit with reality.</v>

226
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 3>So that means something else is in </v>
<v Speaker 3>charge.</v>

227
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.830
<v Speaker 3>And so you're serving that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea of serving strangers in </v>

228
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 3>exile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it simply means,</v>

229
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.280
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really your identity doesn't </v>

230
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.280
<v Speaker 3>match reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

231
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.280
<v Speaker 3>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought of it</v>

232
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.700
<v Speaker 2>both that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea of serving strangers in exile.</v>

233
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.010
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

234
00:13:28.011 --> 00:13:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to branch off that a couple</v>

235
00:13:30.111 --> 00:13:35.111
<v Speaker 2>of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one idea there is that there was an </v>

236
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 2>idea from young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is paraphrased something like if </v>

237
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.271
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't act out your own myths and </v>

238
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:43.970
<v Speaker 2>you serve a bit part in the myths of </v>
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

239
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.160
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would be in keeping with that </v>

240
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.851
<v Speaker 2>idea of serving the stranger in exile </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next part would be when </v>

241
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:55.790
<v Speaker 2>you're in a chaotic state and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions are disregulated,</v>

242
00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 2>your personality fraction aids and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fractionated personality personalities,</v>

243
00:14:01.331 --> 00:14:06.331
<v Speaker 2>some personalities fight for control </v>
<v Speaker 2>over over over behavioral output so you,</v>

244
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you dissolved from a unity might have.</v>

245
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Think about it as a pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pyramid with with a unifying </v>

246
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.320
<v Speaker 2>conception at the top that </v>
<v Speaker 2>disintegrates.</v>

247
00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:20.321
<v Speaker 2>That would be like the Tower of Babel to</v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree that disintegrates and then </v>

248
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:22.790
<v Speaker 2>sub entities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could think about them as spirits or</v>

249
00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 2>think about them as psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>entities regulate your behavior.</v>

250
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.740
<v Speaker 2>That would be equivalent to a movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the left hemisphere to the right.</v>

251
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Because I think the right is dominated </v>
<v Speaker 2>by subcortical structures route.</v>

252
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that's how the animals exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

253
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.630
<v Speaker 2>is it's sequential domination by </v>
<v Speaker 2>subcortical structures rather than some </v>

254
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.230
<v Speaker 2>overarching conceptualization from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top down.</v>

255
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

256
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:52.170
<v Speaker 3>what you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left and the right is exactly the </v>

257
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:52.170
<v Speaker 3>opposite of the traditional left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

258
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you say left hemisphere,</v>

259
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:55.770
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

260
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 3>like what's the left hemisphere governs </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right hand.</v>

261
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the left hemisphere is the one that's</v>

262
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:08.110
<v Speaker 3>when it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's in charge and when everything </v>

263
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.110
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

264
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the opposite of the,</v>

265
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 3>of the traditional imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually the,</v>

266
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.200
<v Speaker 3>it's the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

267
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

268
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:17.370
<v Speaker 3>because they're using the hands.</v>

269
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

270
00:15:19.171 --> 00:15:24.171
<v Speaker 2>So the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right would be mapped onto the left </v>

271
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:24.171
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

272
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:25.410
<v Speaker 2>So that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

273
00:15:25.411 --> 00:15:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

274
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.850
<v Speaker 2>and the traditional imagery I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the hemispheric </v>

275
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.071
<v Speaker 2>specialization as well because the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>of right now I want to ask you a </v>

276
00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:38.260
<v Speaker 2>question about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that they,</v>

277
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.510
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

278
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.700
<v Speaker 2>the living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it you contrasted exile with?</v>

279
00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:48.710
<v Speaker 2>What was the other conceptualization </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabiting the homeland inhabit?</v>

280
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Inhabiting the homeland?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

281
00:15:50.131 --> 00:15:55.131
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Working on working on the homeland is </v>

282
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:55.200
<v Speaker 2>another way to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

283
00:15:55.201 --> 00:16:00.201
<v Speaker 2>now tell me again how you conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between God and and his</v>

284
00:16:03.061 --> 00:16:05.640
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say in the homeland.</v>

285
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

286
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.370
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said at the beginning,</v>

287
00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:16.371
<v Speaker 3>there's the idea of heaven and earth is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the basis and everything in the </v>

288
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So heaven is meaning and earth is fact.</v>

289
00:16:19.591 --> 00:16:24.591
<v Speaker 3>So in that relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's God,</v>

290
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.210
<v Speaker 3>it's always the name of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

291
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.580
<v Speaker 3>if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look in the way it's described in</v>

292
00:16:29.581 --> 00:16:30.880
<v Speaker 3>the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

293
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.480
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about the name of God.</v>

294
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:38.510
<v Speaker 3>So that means the meaning of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So God is not just meaning,</v>

295
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.980
<v Speaker 3>but when they talk about it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible,</v>

296
00:16:40.981 --> 00:16:45.330
<v Speaker 3>it's always about the name of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the name of God is an identity.</v>

297
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like a principal in axiom or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

298
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.690
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to embody itself in a physical </v>

299
00:16:55.321 --> 00:16:58.230
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flesh or in matter.</v>

300
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.620
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the role of the nation of Israel is to </v>

301
00:17:04.201 --> 00:17:09.201
<v Speaker 3>embody that identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also to embody it in reality,</v>

302
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:15.170
<v Speaker 3>not just in themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically there are a mediator </v>

303
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Speaker 3>between heaven and earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

304
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:21.100
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to make God's identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

305
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 3>practical or concrete or that's why it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>all about laws because you take a nap,</v>

306
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 3>it's like mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've taken that an abstract principle </v>

307
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.950
<v Speaker 3>that's really extremely simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

308
00:17:34.951 --> 00:17:38.250
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It contains much information,</v>

309
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take an axiom in mathematics,</v>

310
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.260
<v Speaker 3>but then you have to derive all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>implications,</v>

311
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's making it practical,</v>

312
00:17:45.361 --> 00:17:48.570
<v Speaker 3>that's making it concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's bringing heaven into the earth.</v>

313
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.280
<v Speaker 3>So that's their job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a cosmic mediator.</v>

314
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

315
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.350
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Follow you so far.</v>

316
00:17:57.351 --> 00:17:58.520
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

317
00:17:58.521 --> 00:18:01.460
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

318
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:08.230
<v Speaker 2>it looks like there's two ways maybe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the biblical narrative that that will,</v>

319
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.020
<v Speaker 2>is instantiated in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in reality,</v>

320
00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:17.021
<v Speaker 2>and one would be as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals aligning themselves with the</v>

321
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:22.251
<v Speaker 2>word of God and the other is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantiation of the word of God into </v>

322
00:18:22.251 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 2>the state of Israel seem seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>

323
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:30.861
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems to begin that that has </v>

324
00:18:30.861 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 2>its origin in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first abrahamic story.</v>

325
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:36.650
<v Speaker 2>So Abraham talks to God and God talks to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham and tells him that he's going to</v>

326
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.650
<v Speaker 2>be the father of the nation essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then</v>

327
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.240
<v Speaker 3>you'd like to inherit the land to order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing actually.</v>

328
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Those two things have the same is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to inherit the land and he's going to </v>

329
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.610
<v Speaker 3>become the principal of a great many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

330
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:59.020
<v Speaker 3>So that's like he's fleshing out an </v>
<v Speaker 3>identity,</v>

331
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives a nation instead of just </v>

332
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

333
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.890
<v Speaker 3>And he's going to become the identity of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nation.</v>

334
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so how do you understand the </v>

335
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.330
<v Speaker 2>description of that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the biblical narrative?</v>

336
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I find very strange </v>

337
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.961
<v Speaker 2>about abrahamic stories is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate presence of God and God shows </v>

338
00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:26.030
<v Speaker 2>up to Abraham and tells them this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Abraham makes an altar,</v>

339
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.420
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once he gets to the land where he's </v>

340
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.600
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes an altar and then.</v>

341
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 2>And then God appears to him again.</v>

342
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not again,</v>

343
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.040
<v Speaker 3>not again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>appears to him the first time.</v>

344
00:19:46.041 --> 00:19:51.041
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't appear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm pretty sure the first time </v>

345
00:19:51.041 --> 00:19:51.041
<v Speaker 3>God speaks to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

346
00:19:51.041 --> 00:19:52.200
<v Speaker 3>See that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's important.</v>

347
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second time</v>

348
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.760
<v Speaker 2>distinction important.</v>

349
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's just,</v>

350
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.000
<v Speaker 3>he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not physical.</v>

351
00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:05.050
<v Speaker 3>He's not a into practical reality yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's invisible.</v>

352
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:10.380
<v Speaker 3>So God speaks is he's not manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just an idea principal at word.</v>

353
00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And unmanifest word or it's like the </v>

354
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:16.690
<v Speaker 3>minimum of manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just language,</v>

355
00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:18.520
<v Speaker 3>just word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

356
00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:23.521
<v Speaker 3>So what he says is go to this place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to this land and you'll inherit the </v>

357
00:20:26.471 --> 00:20:31.471
<v Speaker 3>lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes there and then it says </v>

358
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:31.471
<v Speaker 3>God appeared to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

359
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:31.471
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

360
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:32.150
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>

361
00:20:32.151 --> 00:20:37.151
<v Speaker 2>there's a progression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Progressive Progressive Appearance of </v>

362
00:20:37.151 --> 00:20:39.950
<v Speaker 2>God and it's partly a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham's original,</v>

363
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obedience to the initial idea.</v>

364
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which was very abstract.</v>

365
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Me Go here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can be more simple than that.</v>

366
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

367
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.720
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean anything,</v>

368
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.910
<v Speaker 3>but it means everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very.</v>

369
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Everything we do is I go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go there and do something.</v>

370
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.770
<v Speaker 3>So it's like the principle of all things</v>
<v Speaker 3>appeared to Abraham saying,</v>

371
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.380
<v Speaker 3>just go there and you'll inherit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't really mean anything if it </v>

372
00:21:13.641 --> 00:21:15.350
<v Speaker 3>contains everything humans do.</v>

373
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

374
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.670
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting observation </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think of human beings as other</v>

375
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 2>very directional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always going from point a to </v>

376
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.021
<v Speaker 2>point b.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always aiming there like </v>

377
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:29.021
<v Speaker 2>archers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

378
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:30.590
<v Speaker 2>And it's definitely the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had someone write to me.</v>

379
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a Patriot interview with one</v>

380
00:21:34.161 --> 00:21:39.161
<v Speaker 2>of the people who's been supporting me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a young guy and uh,</v>

381
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about the idea of Christ</v>
<v Speaker 2>as redeemer and judge and he was,</v>

382
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.380
<v Speaker 2>this young man was unredeemed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say for a long period of time </v>

383
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.131
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't have any direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to have direction you have to know </v>

384
00:21:57.131 --> 00:21:59.690
<v Speaker 2>what's good and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because to have direction you have to go</v>

385
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.700
<v Speaker 2>towards what's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the judge is what helps you </v>

386
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.381
<v Speaker 2>figure out what's good and if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what's good then you can't be </v>

387
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:10.340
<v Speaker 2>redeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because to be redeemed as to be is to be</v>

388
00:22:10.341 --> 00:22:13.190
<v Speaker 2>moving towards the good and away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say evil.</v>

389
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.010
<v Speaker 2>And so the judge and the redeemer have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the same thing.</v>

390
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:21.460
<v Speaker 2>And that fits in with what you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the judge is the thing that </v>

391
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.250
<v Speaker 2>makes qualitative distinctions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

392
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.030
<v Speaker 2>and you need to make a qualitative </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction before you can move ahead.</v>

393
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so your point is that the principal </v>

394
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 2>that Abraham encounters to begin with is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the principle of directionality itself,</v>

395
00:22:35.841 --> 00:22:37.940
<v Speaker 2>qualitative directionality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

396
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.680
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

397
00:22:39.681 --> 00:22:40.250
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

398
00:22:40.251 --> 00:22:44.360
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the positive identity of anything.</v>

399
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a seed.</v>

400
00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.120
<v Speaker 3>It's the seed of a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the traditional way to understand</v>

401
00:22:50.121 --> 00:22:51.330
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a seed.</v>

402
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:57.010
<v Speaker 3>It contains everything in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in itself it's just something like </v>

403
00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 3>go there or something go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

404
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.840
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

405
00:22:58.841 --> 00:23:00.580
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

406
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I think for me to learn personally as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've moved through my life was that if I</v>

407
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:08.380
<v Speaker 2>ever actually did anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was worthwhile.</v>

408
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.130
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that something would come of it.</v>

409
00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:15.310
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't necessarily be what I expect</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to come of it,</v>

410
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.960
<v Speaker 2>but the act of going and doing did bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit.</v>

411
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's pretty much the story of </v>

412
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Abraham in a nutshell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually what you just said,</v>

413
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.520
<v Speaker 3>because God says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go here,</v>

414
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.910
<v Speaker 3>you only inherited the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abraham doesn't inherit the land.</v>

415
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.750
<v Speaker 3>He could have been right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could have gone there and it's yours,</v>

416
00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:42.140
<v Speaker 3>but no theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why it says as soon as he gets </v>

417
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:42.140
<v Speaker 3>there and says there's already people </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

418
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.970
<v Speaker 3>there's the land is already owned by </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

419
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.900
<v Speaker 3>There's a famine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

420
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:48.900
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

421
00:23:48.901 --> 00:23:51.140
<v Speaker 3>and that means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means,</v>

422
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.400
<v Speaker 3>like what I was saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the facts support the theory.</v>

423
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here is going to the land.</v>

424
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 3>That's the theory you will inherit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the theory.</v>

425
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.530
<v Speaker 3>And the facts don't support it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fun.</v>

426
00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The earth doesn't support you.</v>

427
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 3>The earth doesn't give you sustenance to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make it reality.</v>

428
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't give you matter.</v>

429
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you at that in Egypt,</v>

430
00:24:13.781 --> 00:24:18.781
<v Speaker 2>and I mean his wife is separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially because he lies about her.</v>

431
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.800
<v Speaker 2>But then it's so strange because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he tells the federal and the Pharaohs</v>

432
00:24:23.801 --> 00:24:26.740
<v Speaker 2>man that his wife is actually a sister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Sarah.</v>

433
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that how you say that changes?</v>

434
00:24:30.551 --> 00:24:35.551
<v Speaker 2>The name is actually his sister and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's to protect them and so the </v>

435
00:24:36.461 --> 00:24:41.461
<v Speaker 2>Pharaoh takes sariah and then it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolate something.</v>

436
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.020
<v Speaker 2>You bet there is</v>

437
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.600
<v Speaker 3>meaning to all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a meaning to it.</v>

438
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the idea is that when facts,</v>

439
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.120
<v Speaker 3>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>support the theory,</v>

440
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.850
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

441
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.400
<v Speaker 3>when the flesh supports the identity or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the matters,</v>

442
00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.170
<v Speaker 3>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Earth supports having things are square.</v>

443
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the traditional way of </v>

444
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.601
<v Speaker 3>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That basically means that what you see </v>

445
00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:06.730
<v Speaker 3>is what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

446
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.980
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's truth.</v>

447
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Things are true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the definition of meaning matches</v>

448
00:25:12.331 --> 00:25:16.260
<v Speaker 3>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true when pragmatic definition.</v>

449
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

450
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.500
<v Speaker 3>when the other side happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then things are around there.</v>

451
00:25:22.501 --> 00:25:23.750
<v Speaker 3>They're cyclical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

452
00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.040
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

453
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.730
<v Speaker 3>It's essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's time.</v>

454
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.310
<v Speaker 3>It's space and time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

455
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them.</v>

456
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:34.410
<v Speaker 3>You're falling into time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things are not square.</v>

457
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.760
<v Speaker 3>That means things do not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The meaning doesn't mask the fact.</v>

458
00:25:38.761 --> 00:25:40.530
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's all lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

459
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.680
<v Speaker 3>When they go into exile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about lies and it's all about </v>

460
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.140
<v Speaker 3>dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

461
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Because they are in that domain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in a domain where meaning in </v>

462
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.781
<v Speaker 3>fact doesn't match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything happens through lies and </v>

463
00:25:56.781 --> 00:26:00.530
<v Speaker 3>deception and even the whole idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

464
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:05.750
<v Speaker 3>my wife is my sister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that represents a cyclical paradox </v>

465
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.500
<v Speaker 3>that's supposed to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

466
00:26:10.501 --> 00:26:11.870
<v Speaker 3>why cyclical?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

467
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:17.790
<v Speaker 3>you're a parent has a son and a daughter</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get married.</v>

468
00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like a regression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

469
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're producing different things and </v>

470
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.571
<v Speaker 3>then you're joining them back together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's supposed to join back </v>

471
00:26:32.571 --> 00:26:34.200
<v Speaker 3>together because when you joined them </v>
<v Speaker 3>back together,</v>

472
00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:36.000
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're regressing.</v>

473
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.430
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you build something,</v>

474
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.470
<v Speaker 3>you start from principal and you develop</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

475
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make specializations.</v>

476
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.030
<v Speaker 3>That principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you start to mix them up again,</v>

477
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like a regression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

478
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.730
<v Speaker 3>you're going back to something more </v>
<v Speaker 3>primitive than before.</v>

479
00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:59.560
<v Speaker 2>How do you see that in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham's insistence that surgery,</v>

480
00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:00.610
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

481
00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.160
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his sister.</v>

482
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Sister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

483
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Because you're not supposed to marry </v>
<v Speaker 3>your sister.</v>

484
00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.960
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not saying that as a moralistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing even though it becomes one,</v>

485
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:17.350
<v Speaker 3>but the reason you shouldn't marry your </v>
<v Speaker 3>sister is because you're undoing the </v>

486
00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:21.260
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The specializations is that your,</v>

487
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:26.410
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your father or your mother Ha have </v>

488
00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:26.570
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like going back,</v>

489
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.660
<v Speaker 3>it's like regressing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like if you married your father or </v>

490
00:27:31.761 --> 00:27:35.240
<v Speaker 3>your mother or depending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going back,</v>

491
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.460
<v Speaker 3>it's a cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not speaking to that because it's</v>

492
00:27:37.461 --> 00:27:41.990
<v Speaker 3>like your annihilating something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was specified.</v>

493
00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you an example of like an </v>

494
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:48.420
<v Speaker 3>imagery of that that's pretty important </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

495
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.340
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the story of the flood,</v>

496
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.430
<v Speaker 3>there are traditions that the giants </v>
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>

497
00:27:52.431 --> 00:27:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Hybrids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

498
00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that giants like to do</v>

499
00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.020
<v Speaker 3>is create hybrids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are hybrids themselves,</v>

500
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:05.440
<v Speaker 3>but they created hybrids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took the species and they confuse </v>

501
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.870
<v Speaker 3>them back into who knows what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

502
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:14.110
<v Speaker 3>and that's very significant because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually means that you are regressing </v>

503
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.530
<v Speaker 3>in it confused manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

504
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:22.130
<v Speaker 3>That there's a connection between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flood and what I just said,</v>

505
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:27.190
<v Speaker 3>making hybrids and causing the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually considered one in the same</v>

506
00:28:27.231 --> 00:28:27.650
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

507
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes some sense.</v>

508
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about returning to confusion.</v>

509
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

510
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam named the animals had an adam named</v>

511
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.930
<v Speaker 3>the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God asked Adam to names and it.</v>

512
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.940
<v Speaker 3>It's his first job in the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's asking him to specify different </v>

513
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.850
<v Speaker 3>things that are all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all have the same source,</v>

514
00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:58.260
<v Speaker 3>the same as you differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea of incarnating a </v>

515
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.230
<v Speaker 3>principle into practice yet </v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiated.</v>

516
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

517
00:29:03.321 --> 00:29:08.321
<v Speaker 3>if you reverse that process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going back to a more primitive </v>

518
00:29:08.451 --> 00:29:13.451
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going back to the flood because </v>

519
00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:13.451
<v Speaker 3>the flood is the most primitive thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

520
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.100
<v Speaker 3>in that cosmology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

521
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.770
<v Speaker 3>It starts with a flooded world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means everything's in confusion.</v>

522
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.580
<v Speaker 3>So what'd you have to do is specify </v>
<v Speaker 3>things out,</v>

523
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.400
<v Speaker 3>but if you go back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that make sense?</v>

524
00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.070
<v Speaker 2>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>

525
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.970
<v Speaker 2>let me reformulate that and tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>what popped into mind.</v>

526
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So God gives Abraham the word and then </v>

527
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Abraham follows it and God manifests </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself more completely to Abraham.</v>

528
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham is twofold.</v>

529
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.880
<v Speaker 2>He ends up in a barren land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so nature rebels,</v>

530
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.300
<v Speaker 2>and he also ends up in a tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

531
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Because he is not only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only does the land not produced,</v>

532
00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:55.630
<v Speaker 2>so it's in a famine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Egypt eventually.</v>

533
00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Egypt is generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assemble for for tyranny throughout the </v>

534
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:03.940
<v Speaker 2>initial parts of the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you see that with the Pharaoh,</v>

535
00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:08.941
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the symbolism in the mosaic story </v>

536
00:30:08.941 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

537
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.950
<v Speaker 2>of Egypt always being associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone instead of water,</v>

538
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.200
<v Speaker 2>and so you could say that God gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham the command to move forward,</v>

539
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:22.770
<v Speaker 2>but he has to contend with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intransigent sea of nature which rejects</v>

540
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.770
<v Speaker 2>him because there was a famine and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>he becomes subjugate some.</v>

541
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It becomes subject to both tyranny and </v>
<v Speaker 2>deceit,</v>

542
00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

543
00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.260
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

544
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.740
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any are a look.</v>

545
00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it this way.</v>

546
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.310
<v Speaker 3>It's more about the tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>

547
00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.690
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're not in charge,</v>

548
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

549
00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.130
<v Speaker 3>When you're you or whoever you identify </v>
<v Speaker 3>with is not in charge,</v>

550
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.150
<v Speaker 3>you're a slave to some other principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

551
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.060
<v Speaker 3>You're embodying some other wheel that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not you.</v>

552
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's tyranny,</v>

553
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:02.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

554
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.830
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In that sense,</v>

555
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.930
<v Speaker 3>it's really directly relate to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>of tyranny.</v>

556
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.550
<v Speaker 3>You serving strangers,</v>

557
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

558
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:09.780
<v Speaker 3>It says it all.</v>

559
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:13.930
<v Speaker 2>So motivates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That also motivates Abraham's deception,</v>

560
00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:18.931
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's terrified that the </v>

561
00:31:18.931 --> 00:31:18.931
<v Speaker 2>strangers that he's serving will kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

562
00:31:18.931 --> 00:31:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For his wife,</v>

563
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.990
<v Speaker 2>for his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why he likes it.</v>

564
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.270
<v Speaker 2>He's afraid that he's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated very badly.</v>

565
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:30.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he doesn't want strangers to </v>

566
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.720
<v Speaker 3>have his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His wife is like the earth.</v>

567
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:37.810
<v Speaker 3>His wife is how he will incarnate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can self or express itself in the world.</v>

568
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 3>He's like the seed and the wife is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

569
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.120
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth,</v>

570
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.030
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she's the.</v>

571
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 3>She is like his earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a major version of heaven and </v>

572
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:52.720
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The male is,</v>

573
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.200
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

574
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.250
<v Speaker 3>is the heaven and the female is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

575
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.040
<v Speaker 3>In that case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole idea.</v>

576
00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:01.850
<v Speaker 3>He's not in charge of facts anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That includes his wife,</v>

577
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.960
<v Speaker 3>that ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he doesn't want other men,</v>

578
00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:11.020
<v Speaker 3>other principals to control his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

579
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

580
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

581
00:32:12.951 --> 00:32:16.520
<v Speaker 2>it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also seems to me that because he's,</v>

582
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.880
<v Speaker 2>the land isn't fruitful for him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's serving strangers in a </v>

583
00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:26.981
<v Speaker 2>strange land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's also correct to be afraid for the </v>

584
00:32:26.981 --> 00:32:27.470
<v Speaker 2>loss of his wife.</v>

585
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how does he get out of it?</v>

586
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:35.850
<v Speaker 3>By being deceitful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's in the cycle is in that.</v>

587
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean are you supposed to be truthful?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your adversary usually know,</v>

588
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:48.250
<v Speaker 3>especially when your editor series </v>
<v Speaker 3>hostile and if you're an enemy </v>

589
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.581
<v Speaker 3>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your morality changes because all of a </v>

590
00:32:51.581 --> 00:32:54.500
<v Speaker 3>sudden it's not about being truthful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about surviving.</v>

591
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:59.501
<v Speaker 3>It's about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the most primitive existence </v>

592
00:32:59.501 --> 00:33:03.761
<v Speaker 3>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more primitive states of existence </v>

593
00:33:03.761 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 3>are more about the seat than about </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

594
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.680
<v Speaker 3>It's an advance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an advanced state to talk about </v>

595
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.000
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's when we all agree,</v>

596
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.330
<v Speaker 3>we all agree on at least something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before that it's every man or woman </v>

597
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.530
<v Speaker 3>for him or herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about the seat.</v>

598
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:19.490
<v Speaker 3>It's all about survival.</v>

599
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

600
00:33:21.061 --> 00:33:26.061
<v Speaker 2>so now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the next thing that happens </v>

601
00:33:26.061 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 2>essentially is that the pharaoh gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>played and he's wondering why.</v>

602
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:34.460
<v Speaker 2>So because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the story indicates that the Pharaoh </v>

603
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.840
<v Speaker 2>has broken some natural law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

604
00:33:36.841 --> 00:33:40.260
<v Speaker 2>or some divine law and things go very </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly for him.</v>

605
00:33:40.261 --> 00:33:45.261
<v Speaker 2>And then he discovers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember how he discovers that </v>

606
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:45.850
<v Speaker 2>he's taken.</v>

607
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't say how it's right.</v>

608
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.890
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he discovers that he's taken Sarah,</v>

609
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.900
<v Speaker 2>but Sarah is Abraham's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then the pharaoh gives Abraham </v>

610
00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.990
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of goods and sends him on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

611
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's also quite confusing.</v>

612
00:34:03.731 --> 00:34:07.420
<v Speaker 2>So Abraham is rewarded for his decision.</v>

613
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Ill ill gotten goods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

614
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll go.</v>

615
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of her story is interesting </v>

616
00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:20.070
<v Speaker 2>because you also see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in not account,</v>

617
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:25.250
<v Speaker 2>some of the complexity that's embedded </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the old testament accounts is that </v>

618
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not a simple morality tale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

619
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:33.520
<v Speaker 2>You especially see that in the Abrahamic</v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts because it's Jacob who who so </v>

620
00:34:35.641 --> 00:34:37.030
<v Speaker 2>deceitful with Esol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

621
00:34:37.031 --> 00:34:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Nissan comes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

622
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.530
<v Speaker 2>he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gone out unconscious.</v>

623
00:34:40.531 --> 00:34:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Esau.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

624
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:47.840
<v Speaker 2>He gives things up too easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's too easily deceived and he's a bit </v>

625
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.501
<v Speaker 2>primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's a bit too primitive in a </v>

626
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:51.501
<v Speaker 2>bit too naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

627
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:56.000
<v Speaker 2>But Jacob plays and Rachel place some </v>
<v Speaker 2>really nasty tricks on him and yet they </v>

628
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.600
<v Speaker 2>come out ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

629
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.040
<v Speaker 2>And so that's also a very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to contend with.</v>

630
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

631
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.150
<v Speaker 3>there's this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in,</v>

632
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:07.040
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in traditional interpretation,</v>

633
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.100
<v Speaker 3>there's this idea that in Esol is </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually supposed to be that the key it </v>

634
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.830
<v Speaker 3>should be the only reason he isn't is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's something wrong.</v>

635
00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.120
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty much describe the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible in its entirety.</v>

636
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.990
<v Speaker 3>The there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the theory and the fact the fact</v>

637
00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:28.970
<v Speaker 3>is supposed to be king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

638
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like at matter is king it,</v>

639
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

640
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 3>And the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the stories are about redeeming.</v>

641
00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Redeeming that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking care of that problem.</v>

642
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like the facts don't match the </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>

643
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:52.530
<v Speaker 3>We have to redeem the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

644
00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:57.570
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty much all the stories in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bible are about that and that's </v>

645
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.920
<v Speaker 3>pretty much what lock represents in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story of Abraham as well.</v>

646
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You represents a material reality.</v>

647
00:36:05.431 --> 00:36:08.940
<v Speaker 3>He represents facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something wrong with it.</v>

648
00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Let's go into the large story now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

649
00:36:11.181 --> 00:36:16.181
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Abraham leaves and I believe he </v>

650
00:36:16.181 --> 00:36:19.601
<v Speaker 2>leaves with lot and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lot also becomes quite wealthy and </v>

651
00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:25.220
<v Speaker 2>they go back to where Abraham had built </v>
<v Speaker 2>the altar initially,</v>

652
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:30.910
<v Speaker 2>but lot large men and Abraham's men </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to fight so they decide they're </v>

653
00:36:32.181 --> 00:36:36.640
<v Speaker 2>going to separate and they basically do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that somewhat arbitrarily could,</v>

654
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.180
<v Speaker 2>could have gone either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot ends up going to sort them.</v>

655
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Well actually there is something you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be aware of.</v>

656
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the stories in the Bible are </v>

657
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:55.220
<v Speaker 3>based on a really ancient way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that we don't really following </v>

658
00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:00.710
<v Speaker 3>you more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean in the Bible there is a </v>

659
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.710
<v Speaker 3>reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

660
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 3>the directions of the travels that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not just random,</v>

661
00:37:04.471 --> 00:37:09.471
<v Speaker 3>like Egypt represents the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

662
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:13.890
<v Speaker 3>what's the name of the city?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the name of the place of both her</v>

663
00:37:13.891 --> 00:37:16.770
<v Speaker 3>and I think the place where he goes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>meet.</v>

664
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

665
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.610
<v Speaker 3>it's in the north.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

666
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

667
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I remember the name of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

668
00:37:22.421 --> 00:37:27.421
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Iran that represents </v>

669
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:27.421
<v Speaker 3>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

670
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 3>And there's a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just arbitrary,</v>

671
00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:32.661
<v Speaker 3>it's because Egypt is south and south is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going down.</v>

672
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still say that when,</v>

673
00:37:35.141 --> 00:37:36.870
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say that someone's gone south,</v>

674
00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:39.630
<v Speaker 2>we say that means that they've gone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>seed or they've gone down.</v>

675
00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

676
00:37:41.141 --> 00:37:44.350
<v Speaker 3>so in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially in Genesis,</v>

677
00:37:44.351 --> 00:37:46.240
<v Speaker 3>especially in finances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

678
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.990
<v Speaker 3>the south represents the earth and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>north represents that happens.</v>

679
00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I said,</v>

680
00:37:51.131 --> 00:37:56.131
<v Speaker 3>it's not arbitrary it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it corresponds to the geography of the </v>

681
00:37:56.131 --> 00:37:59.671
<v Speaker 3>region.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them goes uphill and the other </v>

682
00:37:59.671 --> 00:38:00.130
<v Speaker 3>one goes downhill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the north there's mountains,</v>

683
00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:05.340
<v Speaker 3>snowy mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the south there's a Egypt which is </v>

684
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:05.380
<v Speaker 3>like the low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a low place and yeah.</v>

685
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So north literally is up.</v>

686
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a metaphor.</v>

687
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally is close going,</v>

688
00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:14.170
<v Speaker 3>getting closer to heaven and the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>one going into the earth.</v>

689
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 3>So when they go and excited to Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

690
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.870
<v Speaker 3>it's actually means they're going into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>

691
00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like a descent into the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like death.</v>

692
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:29.730
<v Speaker 3>It's death and they say it a few times </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the book of Genesis it talk about </v>

693
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.810
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like dying.</v>

694
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.300
<v Speaker 3>Going it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to Egypt is like a death.</v>

695
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then now.</v>

696
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:42.510
<v Speaker 2>So then we moved to the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers.</v>

697
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weight,</v>

698
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.220
<v Speaker 2>not who you were going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the separation of the land with lot </v>

699
00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:52.720
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Abraham.</v>

700
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

701
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:57.320
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that lot takes the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

702
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.240
<v Speaker 2>the south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

703
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.180
<v Speaker 2>And then Abraham.</v>

704
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the whole point of that.</v>

705
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:05.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot as a reason why he takes the </v>

706
00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:07.510
<v Speaker 3>south.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the lowest place on Earth Sodom and</v>

707
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Gomorrah that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that place.</v>

708
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.940
<v Speaker 3>It's the lowest place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

709
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 3>So literally the lowest place on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

710
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

711
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that region actually is the </v>

712
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.560
<v Speaker 3>lowest place on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the story that that's how,</v>

713
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 3>that's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means it's the lowest plates.</v>

714
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 2>So it's a place that's farthest away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from heaven.</v>

715
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

716
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:35.160
<v Speaker 2>it's the idea that Milton develops with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to Satan when he's thrown from </v>

717
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.751
<v Speaker 2>heaven because the hell that Satan </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabits is the furthest possible away </v>

718
00:39:39.751 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 2>from heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it's defined essentially.</v>

719
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

720
00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a journey into the earth.</v>

721
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.570
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same as,</v>

722
00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:51.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it needs the same thing as,</v>

723
00:39:51.591 --> 00:39:56.591
<v Speaker 3>as falling asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exiled and sleep are the same in the </v>

724
00:39:56.591 --> 00:39:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sleep is,</v>

725
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.400
<v Speaker 3>is a form of exile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

726
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:04.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the next thing that happens is that </v>

727
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:05.580
<v Speaker 2>we get the first warning about Sodom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gomorrah.</v>

728
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

729
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 2>That's just a very brief sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a foreshadowing.</v>

730
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:18.820
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's an episode where there is a</v>

731
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:23.821
<v Speaker 2>war among kings and the kings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

732
00:40:24.281 --> 00:40:29.281
<v Speaker 2>it's the King of Sodom takes a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abraham has to go rescue him.</v>

733
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.460
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the other way around.</v>

734
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it's things from the north.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They come down and uh,</v>

735
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:44.460
<v Speaker 3>take Sodom and Gomorrah and lot is part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

736
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.400
<v Speaker 3>And so is the king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The King of Sodom and Gomorrah.</v>

737
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:48.270
<v Speaker 3>They have to flee.</v>

738
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:52.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they flee with,</v>

739
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>do they flee with lot?</v>

740
00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Law is taken by these chains from the </v>

741
00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.221
<v Speaker 3>north and I'm the King of Sodom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think hides or something like that.</v>

742
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Fleece</v>

743
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.320
<v Speaker 2>the king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the King of Sodom at the end gives gifts</v>

744
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:11.920
<v Speaker 2>to Abraham to thank him that he rescued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

745
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.660
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is that,</v>

746
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:18.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says in and it came to pass in the </v>

747
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:18.980
<v Speaker 2>days of Amarillo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elle,</v>

748
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:18.980
<v Speaker 2>king of Shinar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

749
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:23.581
<v Speaker 2>that these made war with Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 2>King of Sodom and with Burger King of </v>

750
00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

751
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.250
<v Speaker 2>and these were all joined together in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the veil of cinnamon,</v>

752
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.710
<v Speaker 2>which is in the old seat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the salt seat,</v>

753
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.880
<v Speaker 2>so I presume that would be the Dead Sea </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would be the low point that </v>

754
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.050
<v Speaker 2>you're describing is the dead seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty interesting.</v>

755
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.100
<v Speaker 2>And the veil of cinema was full of slime</v>
<v Speaker 2>pits and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah</v>

756
00:41:45.171 --> 00:41:50.171
<v Speaker 2>fled and fell there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they took away all the goods of </v>

757
00:41:50.171 --> 00:41:53.351
<v Speaker 2>Sodom and Gomorrah and older victuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they took lot Abram's brother's son </v>

758
00:41:53.351 --> 00:41:57.401
<v Speaker 2>who dealt in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dwelt in Sodom and his goods and </v>

759
00:41:57.401 --> 00:41:57.401
<v Speaker 2>departed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

760
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 4>you can really see this whole geography </v>
<v Speaker 4>that matthew is talking about.</v>

761
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:05.390
<v Speaker 4>When they say that Sodom and Gomorrah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to flee and fall into pits.</v>

762
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:10.420
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like they're laying it out </v>
<v Speaker 4>for us that they had to almost kind of </v>

763
00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.630
<v Speaker 4>go even further down into the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hide from these,</v>

764
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

765
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.650
<v Speaker 4>these invaders of the north that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming to take their land.</v>

766
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.590
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

767
00:42:17.591 --> 00:42:22.510
<v Speaker 2>So Abraham goes and rescues lot and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does not successfully.</v>

768
00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.490
<v Speaker 2>And the Ndaa also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

769
00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:27.670
<v Speaker 2>there's kings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he.</v>

770
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Did he freeze as far as I can tell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

771
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:38.210
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the kings wanted to reward him and </v>

772
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Abraham says to the King of Sodom and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want any reward.</v>

773
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:47.140
<v Speaker 2>And the reason he doesn't want any </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward except for what is men have </v>

774
00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.291
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want any reward because I </v>

775
00:42:50.291 --> 00:42:53.690
<v Speaker 2>will not take anything that is thein </v>
<v Speaker 2>lest thou should say I have made Abraham</v>

776
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:58.691
<v Speaker 2>rich save only that which the young men </v>
<v Speaker 2>have eaten and the portion of men which </v>

777
00:42:58.691 --> 00:43:02.801
<v Speaker 2>went with me and it looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See God has already promised Abraham </v>

778
00:43:06.111 --> 00:43:11.111
<v Speaker 2>everything in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it looks like he doesn't want to </v>

779
00:43:11.111 --> 00:43:14.531
<v Speaker 2>take anything at Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't want to take anything from </v>

780
00:43:14.531 --> 00:43:17.381
<v Speaker 2>anyone else because what would it do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it interfere with the purity of </v>

781
00:43:18.061 --> 00:43:20.220
<v Speaker 2>his accomplishments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

782
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

783
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know for certain because,</v>

784
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:26.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just a line I guess,</v>

785
00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 3>but in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the story,</v>

786
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:32.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that much of a big part of the </v>

787
00:43:32.441 --> 00:43:33.710
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way I see it is I think he says,</v>

788
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:37.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to take even this shoe lash</v>
<v Speaker 3>to latch for me.</v>

789
00:43:37.971 --> 00:43:42.971
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a reason why he says that </v>

790
00:43:42.971 --> 00:43:45.400
<v Speaker 3>because the shoe is the lowest part is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lowest clothing,</v>

791
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on the feet.</v>

792
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:53.470
<v Speaker 3>So it's all related to the idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth needs to be redeemed.</v>

793
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.160
<v Speaker 3>Need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to be rectified.</v>

794
00:43:55.430 --> 00:44:00.430
<v Speaker 3>And it in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like he's not allowed to accept</v>

795
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:05.650
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing is not eating the </v>

796
00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:07.391
<v Speaker 3>forbidden fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are things in the world that are </v>

797
00:44:07.391 --> 00:44:10.061
<v Speaker 3>poisonous to humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't eat them because they don't </v>

798
00:44:10.061 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 3>agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are our patterns,</v>

799
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.250
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

800
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.300
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our mind.</v>

801
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:19.750
<v Speaker 3>So if you eat poison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go into that place where things </v>

802
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 3>don't agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind and your body don't agree.</v>

803
00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:24.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

804
00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take,</v>

805
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.030
<v Speaker 3>if you drink alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

806
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:34.480
<v Speaker 3>that takes you into the where your mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your body don't agree.</v>

807
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:40.190
<v Speaker 3>The theory doesn't match the fact and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you go into that whole confusion.</v>

808
00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

809
00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.570
<v Speaker 2>could it be that when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

810
00:44:43.571 --> 00:44:44.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't,</v>

811
00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:50.220
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want to take from Sodom </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Sodom is already what we know </v>

812
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:50.220
<v Speaker 2>saw them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

813
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.931
<v Speaker 2>it already represents kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the land that can't hold and will be </v>

814
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:54.931
<v Speaker 2>burned off.</v>

815
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something he can,</v>

816
00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:58.680
<v Speaker 3>he can integrate something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

817
00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.640
<v Speaker 3>that's why I said the forbidden fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to eat.</v>

818
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.210
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to accept mattered that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't handle,</v>

819
00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:10.330
<v Speaker 3>that you can integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's something in that place that </v>

820
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:16.030
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't know how to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to do with it and he doesn't want </v>

821
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:17.510
<v Speaker 3>his riches to come from that place.</v>

822
00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want his riches to come from </v>

823
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 2>that place because it would compromise </v>
<v Speaker 2>them</v>

824
00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.970
<v Speaker 3>because he doesn't know how to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it yet.</v>

825
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Maybe someday he will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

826
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.870
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually,</v>

827
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:35.050
<v Speaker 3>here's an interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot represents that place that will one </v>

828
00:45:36.441 --> 00:45:39.340
<v Speaker 3>day be redeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

829
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:44.480
<v Speaker 3>The reason why they talk about lots so </v>
<v Speaker 3>much in the story of Abraham is because </v>

830
00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:49.540
<v Speaker 3>he represents King David.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is the ancestor of the nation that </v>

831
00:45:50.541 --> 00:45:52.610
<v Speaker 3>will give rise to King David.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

832
00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like a secondary story within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

833
00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's meant to be interpreted in terms of</v>

834
00:45:59.931 --> 00:46:04.931
<v Speaker 3>a future redemption of that place that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he can handle,</v>

835
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.280
<v Speaker 3>that Abraham couldn't handle at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

836
00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:12.320
<v Speaker 3>And that place will be redeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm giving you a lot of tradition here,</v>

837
00:46:12.321 --> 00:46:14.660
<v Speaker 3>but this is what I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

838
00:46:14.661 --> 00:46:16.820
<v Speaker 3>I've learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's King David.</v>

839
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the future king.</v>

840
00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole story of luck is about King</v>

841
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:23.780
<v Speaker 2>David.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

842
00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 2>and of course Lord is Abraham's </v>
<v Speaker 2>descendants as well because he's his </v>

843
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 2>nephew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

844
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:32.700
<v Speaker 2>So Abraham's nephew descends into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lowest place essentially.</v>

845
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

846
00:46:34.881 --> 00:46:37.730
<v Speaker 3>look it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story that starts out pretty clear,</v>

847
00:46:37.731 --> 00:46:41.810
<v Speaker 3>it starts out there's three sons to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tear up.</v>

848
00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:46.190
<v Speaker 3>One of them is harass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other one's not horror.</v>

849
00:46:46.191 --> 00:46:48.020
<v Speaker 3>And the other one's Abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

850
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:51.890
<v Speaker 3>Heroin dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how the story starts.</v>

851
00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:57.690
<v Speaker 3>That's like the beginning of this story </v>
<v Speaker 3>is Aaron dies and he has a son called </v>

852
00:46:58.461 --> 00:47:00.050
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

853
00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.420
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is it's the same idea.</v>

854
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:09.440
<v Speaker 3>The son of this heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he represents death.</v>

855
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:14.470
<v Speaker 3>He represents the thing we can't handle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You represents the material facts that </v>

856
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:20.710
<v Speaker 3>we can explain with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with our theories or with our identity </v>

857
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 3>is the thing we is the matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't handle it.</v>

858
00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.600
<v Speaker 3>And that's why in the story starts with </v>
<v Speaker 3>he dies the father of lot dice.</v>

859
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:29.760
<v Speaker 3>It a</v>

860
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:35.420
<v Speaker 5>lot represents some fact that we cannot </v>
<v Speaker 5>correctly,</v>

861
00:47:35.421 --> 00:47:35.490
<v Speaker 5>okay</v>

862
00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:40.550
<v Speaker 4>integrate into our universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This could be interpreted in so many </v>

863
00:47:42.181 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 4>different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

864
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.430
<v Speaker 4>that's basically what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that makes sense,</v>

865
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.870
<v Speaker 4>but the idea the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

866
00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:52.650
<v Speaker 4>the idea is that I think we need to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

867
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:57.710
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that an orphan or a widow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they always represent.</v>

868
00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.210
<v Speaker 4>They represent something that have lost </v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

869
00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 4>their principle that unifies them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're here.</v>

870
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:06.150
<v Speaker 4>They're kind of disconnected from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy of the family.</v>

871
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.300
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

872
00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.890
<v Speaker 4>so a lot losing is the fact that losing </v>
<v Speaker 4>his father died me,</v>

873
00:48:10.891 --> 00:48:14.310
<v Speaker 4>that he loses the thing that gives him </v>
<v Speaker 4>identity and so he's like this,</v>

874
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:15.450
<v Speaker 4>he's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

875
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.220
<v Speaker 4>a piece of birth that is lost attachment</v>
<v Speaker 4>or last meeting or.</v>

876
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

877
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:24.080
<v Speaker 2>that reminds me of what happens to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>his son</v>

878
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:25.200
<v Speaker 1>who</v>

879
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.260
<v Speaker 2>sees him naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

880
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

881
00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.870
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because,</v>

882
00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.560
<v Speaker 2>because to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me,</v>

883
00:48:35.561 --> 00:48:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to talk about this a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit tonight,</v>

884
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.950
<v Speaker 2>that to see noah gets drunk and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

885
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 2>which son is that have pam ham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

886
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm really first sees him but doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>respond properly.</v>

887
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.920
<v Speaker 2>The other sons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they see no one naked,</v>

888
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:58.950
<v Speaker 2>they cover him up and they don't look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like they're not exposing </v>

889
00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:01.690
<v Speaker 2>their fathers weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His mortality is his,</v>

890
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.880
<v Speaker 2>his insufficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

891
00:49:03.881 --> 00:49:06.910
<v Speaker 2>They didn't retain respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ham doesn't do that.</v>

892
00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:12.410
<v Speaker 4>But there's also more what matthew was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about before they're in that </v>

893
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:16.381
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's two things that are implied of </v>

894
00:49:16.381 --> 00:49:18.541
<v Speaker 4>what matthew was talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this idea of wine that brings you into </v>

895
00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:21.010
<v Speaker 4>this cycle where causality ceases to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a direct.</v>

896
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.910
<v Speaker 4>And then what happened to the faction?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

897
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:28.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that he sees his father </v>

898
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:31.231
<v Speaker 4>naked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he discovers his nakedness is also a </v>

899
00:49:31.231 --> 00:49:33.940
<v Speaker 4>kind of suggestion of incest as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same type,</v>

900
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:35.620
<v Speaker 4>the same type of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

901
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.420
<v Speaker 4>of inappropriate causality that you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the story of the two,</v>

902
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:40.930
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

903
00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:44.010
<v Speaker 4>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abraham's sister marrying his sister,</v>

904
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.500
<v Speaker 4>luck with his two daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two daughters.</v>

905
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:47.680
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

906
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's transgression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets some funding.</v>

907
00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Transgression against some fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundary.</v>

908
00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Against the,</v>

909
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.480
<v Speaker 4>the hierarchical relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And have a family,</v>

910
00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:00.900
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

911
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.390
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to make loops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a tree.</v>

912
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to make loops in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tree.</v>

913
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:11.280
<v Speaker 4>So you can say like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really simple and that's supposed </v>

914
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 4>to regress and I supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You produce things,</v>

915
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:15.340
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to turn back on </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

916
00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:17.020
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to go back.</v>

917
00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:23.340
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe that's why lot's wife has </v>

918
00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:23.340
<v Speaker 2>turned into a pillar of salt</v>

919
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:24.920
<v Speaker 4>because she lives back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

920
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:26.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

921
00:50:26.241 --> 00:50:27.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to do it.</v>

922
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 4>Looking back to the mental</v>

923
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:29.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

924
00:50:29.361 --> 00:50:31.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

925
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.240
<v Speaker 2>and pines for something that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

926
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

927
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:39.380
<v Speaker 2>and she's commanded not to look back </v>
<v Speaker 2>once you,</v>

928
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:43.460
<v Speaker 2>once you escape from that catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to be nostalgic for it.</v>

929
00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing happens in the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Moses because what happens to the </v>

930
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Israelites when they were out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>desert is they start to become nostalgic</v>

931
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 2>for Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the tyranny.</v>

932
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also,</v>

933
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:57.320
<v Speaker 2>I think when God starts to send </v>
<v Speaker 2>poisonous snakes among them,</v>

934
00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.270
<v Speaker 2>because right though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't they,</v>

935
00:50:59.271 --> 00:51:04.271
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start to pine for Egypt and </v>

936
00:51:04.271 --> 00:51:04.760
<v Speaker 2>complain about Moses and then they start</v>
<v Speaker 2>to worship other idols.</v>

937
00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:06.920
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of that confusion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about.</v>

938
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:12.160
<v Speaker 2>And then God gets irritated and throws a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of poisonous snakes in there to </v>

939
00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:12.160
<v Speaker 2>give them a good chomping.</v>

940
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the snakes come as a result of</v>

941
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.490
<v Speaker 3>them wanting to go back.</v>

942
00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

943
00:51:20.891 --> 00:51:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

944
00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.490
<v Speaker 2>That makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

945
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.120
<v Speaker 2>and you see that nostalgia for tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

946
00:51:27.121 --> 00:51:30.550
<v Speaker 2>you see that the Soviet Union in Russia </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now with regards to stolen.</v>

947
00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.400
<v Speaker 2>And so the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>

948
00:51:35.401 --> 00:51:40.401
<v Speaker 2>I think this is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy who wrote the disappearance </v>

949
00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:44.121
<v Speaker 2>of God mentioned this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to be well fed as a slave or</v>

950
00:51:44.731 --> 00:51:48.150
<v Speaker 2>hungry and freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

951
00:51:48.151 --> 00:51:49.530
<v Speaker 2>And the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

952
00:51:49.531 --> 00:51:52.450
<v Speaker 2>fed as a slave is not a good choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

953
00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.110
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

954
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:55.530
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when Jonathan,</v>

955
00:51:55.531 --> 00:52:00.531
<v Speaker 2>you and I talked a fair bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story of Abraham and the strangers </v>

956
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:03.390
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm.</v>

957
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:09.760
<v Speaker 2>So God decides to reward Abraham and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells him that just like he told him </v>

958
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.230
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he repeats it,</v>

959
00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:17.260
<v Speaker 2>that he's going to be the founder of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nation and he,</v>

960
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:23.660
<v Speaker 2>and he tells them that Sarah is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear a child.</v>

961
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:30.140
<v Speaker 2>And Sarah of course is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't believe that.</v>

962
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

963
00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:35.140
<v Speaker 2>let me just find this here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

964
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

965
00:52:40.401 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that God's God,</v>

966
00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.330
<v Speaker 2>God's word comes into Abraham in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision.</v>

967
00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.380
<v Speaker 2>So what's the word again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saying that his reward will be great and</v>

968
00:52:51.381 --> 00:52:54.920
<v Speaker 2>that he's going to be the father of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nations,</v>

969
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.310
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't have any children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so isn't that when he takes</v>

970
00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.140
<v Speaker 2>you take Sarah's servant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hagar?</v>

971
00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

972
00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:08.820
<v Speaker 2>and that gives rise to Ishmael.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't until later that Sarah is </v>

973
00:53:10.991 --> 00:53:15.991
<v Speaker 2>informed that she's sorry that he went </v>
<v Speaker 2>fancy your question.</v>

974
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:19.460
<v Speaker 2>She wants one.</v>

975
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Answer your question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be curious to know what she has </v>

976
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:25.120
<v Speaker 3>found you.</v>

977
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 2>She closed her down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

978
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty strange.</v>

979
00:53:29.901 --> 00:53:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Intermission there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

980
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

981
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:37.270
<v Speaker 2>so Abraham has to take kind of a detour </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to have a child and he lays </v>

982
00:53:38.091 --> 00:53:40.270
<v Speaker 2>with Hagar and Hagar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

983
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:45.260
<v Speaker 2>we don't know much about her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she gets he right away and starts to</v>

984
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:50.680
<v Speaker 2>despise Sarah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Sarah actually beats her as far as I</v>

985
00:53:52.911 --> 00:53:57.911
<v Speaker 2>can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says Sarah delk hardly with her and </v>

986
00:53:57.911 --> 00:53:59.800
<v Speaker 2>then Hagar fleets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she ends up by A.</v>

987
00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're an angel.</v>

988
00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Appears to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

989
00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:10.180
<v Speaker 2>the angel tells her that her son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her child is going to be the father of </v>

990
00:54:12.431 --> 00:54:15.920
<v Speaker 2>the nation as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

991
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:23.230
<v Speaker 2>so the first question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that Abraham,</v>

992
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:29.890
<v Speaker 2>at this point in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it necessary for the story that </v>

993
00:54:29.901 --> 00:54:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Abraham takes a detour and has a child </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Hagar?</v>

994
00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.230
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that signifies?</v>

995
00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.300
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

996
00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.120
<v Speaker 3>it's always the same problem in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible.</v>

997
00:54:40.121 --> 00:54:45.121
<v Speaker 3>It's always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it starts with confusion and it has to </v>

998
00:54:46.351 --> 00:54:51.351
<v Speaker 3>develop towards something that is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying that yourself,</v>

999
00:54:52.351 --> 00:54:53.400
<v Speaker 3>when you say detour?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1000
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:54.960
<v Speaker 3>it's a detour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1001
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.290
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a detour.</v>

1002
00:54:59.650 --> 00:54:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1003
00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:02.990
<v Speaker 3>That's not necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it happens.</v>

1004
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1005
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:11.060
<v Speaker 3>D two is teach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Detours are the doors are things that </v>

1006
00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:11.060
<v Speaker 3>are not necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the end</v>

1007
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:14.820
<v Speaker 4>there's something also in that detour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that he gives birth to Ishmael,</v>

1008
00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:20.010
<v Speaker 4>which has to do with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this turning because God kind of </v>

1009
00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:23.731
<v Speaker 4>promises that Ishmael is going to come </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and he's going to be a big problem </v>

1010
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:28.651
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be a father of a great </v>

1011
00:55:28.651 --> 00:55:30.661
<v Speaker 4>nation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's going to be a big problem for </v>

1012
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:30.661
<v Speaker 4>you later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's going to be.</v>

1013
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:32.380
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be fighting between </v>
<v Speaker 4>between your sons basically.</v>

1014
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:34.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's that idea.</v>

1015
00:55:34.921 --> 00:55:35.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1016
00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1017
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1018
00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:44.130
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be associated with an idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you might take about as success of </v>

1019
00:55:44.731 --> 00:55:47.510
<v Speaker 2>approximation to an ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1020
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:52.550
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized sort of visually is,</v>

1021
00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:57.930
<v Speaker 2>and this is associated with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jupiter wishing on a star.</v>

1022
00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:03.390
<v Speaker 2>It was so what's your who does when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to facilitate the transformation </v>

1023
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:06.891
<v Speaker 2>of Nokia was lifted his eyes up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest thing that he can conceive of </v>

1024
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.960
<v Speaker 2>and Orient Yourself with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is is that as you move </v>

1025
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.950
<v Speaker 2>through life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're oriented by the highest</v>

1026
00:56:13.951 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 2>thing you can conceive of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as you move towards it,</v>

1027
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:21.380
<v Speaker 2>you transform and then and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualization of what's the highest </v>

1028
00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:26.210
<v Speaker 2>shifts as you transform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're aiming at the highest thing </v>

1029
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:29.820
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your perhaps your ability to </v>

1030
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize what's the highest thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>develops as you move towards it.</v>

1031
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.530
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means in practice is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you do take detours because you aim</v>

1032
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:40.770
<v Speaker 2>at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're aim is off and you move </v>

1033
00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 2>towards it and then you get to a point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can correct your aim.</v>

1034
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.870
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not like you've made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>

1035
00:56:43.871 --> 00:56:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1036
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.880
<v Speaker 2>you're farther ahead than you were and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've corrected your aim,</v>

1037
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:54.300
<v Speaker 2>but your aim wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weren't aiming at exactly the right </v>

1038
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:54.300
<v Speaker 2>thing to begin with.</v>

1039
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

1040
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:57.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

1041
00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's what's happening to Abraham</v>

1042
00:56:59.101 --> 00:57:00.150
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:05.570
<v Speaker 2>you could almost say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if Ishmael is a practice </v>

1044
00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:06.210
<v Speaker 2>run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1045
00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.070
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1046
00:57:11.071 --> 00:57:13.140
<v Speaker 2>so then you were going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you matthew,</v>

1047
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:14.460
<v Speaker 2>you were to say something about that.</v>

1048
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:18.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say that</v>

1049
00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.800
<v Speaker 3>exiled in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1050
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:27.910
<v Speaker 3>there's always a reason for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not necessarily a logical </v>

1051
00:57:28.101 --> 00:57:28.860
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1052
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:30.950
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like what you described.</v>

1053
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:32.120
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1054
00:57:32.121 --> 00:57:37.121
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you'd know what you're aiming </v>

1055
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:37.121
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think you know what you want,</v>

1056
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:39.800
<v Speaker 3>you think you know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happens that you didn't plan.</v>

1057
00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:42.620
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't look like it's part of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were aiming.</v>

1058
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:44.600
<v Speaker 3>It makes you take a detour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1059
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:46.490
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this site is all about detours.</v>

1060
00:57:46.491 --> 00:57:49.040
<v Speaker 3>It's all about turning around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where you're going.</v>

1061
00:57:49.041 --> 00:57:50.720
<v Speaker 3>You're lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1062
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.730
<v Speaker 3>but in the end it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it brings about something that maybe you</v>

1063
00:57:55.731 --> 00:57:57.480
<v Speaker 3>weren't even aiming at in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1064
00:57:57.490 --> 00:58:02.490
<v Speaker 3>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What might be better than what you were </v>

1065
00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:03.680
<v Speaker 3>in yet in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not all bad.</v>

1066
00:58:03.681 --> 00:58:08.681
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of the whole idea of exile is </v>

1067
00:58:09.171 --> 00:58:14.171
<v Speaker 3>that there it renews your plans,</v>

1068
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't die,</v>

1069
00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't die,</v>

1070
00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.570
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you do die,</v>

1071
00:58:23.571 --> 00:58:26.610
<v Speaker 3>it renews your planning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1072
00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:27.130
<v Speaker 3>so now.</v>

1073
00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the next thing that happens is that </v>

1074
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:36.090
<v Speaker 2>the strangers come to visit Abraham and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he treats them hospitably and so now we </v>

1075
00:58:39.161 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 2>might say that that's an indication of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his increasing alignment with the good.</v>

1076
00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because he does right by the stranger</v>

1077
00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:55.270
<v Speaker 2>and one of the consequences of that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the angels,</v>

1078
00:58:55.271 --> 00:58:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I guess we find out that there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>angels.</v>

1079
00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Tell him that Sarah is going to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth to someone and Abraham finds that </v>

1080
00:59:02.531 --> 00:59:07.531
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Sarah finds it so difficult to </v>

1081
00:59:07.531 --> 00:59:07.531
<v Speaker 2>believe that she actually laughs about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1082
00:59:07.531 --> 00:59:08.440
<v Speaker 2>She overhears it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she laughs about it,</v>

1083
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:10.210
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

1084
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.840
<v Speaker 2>he has the strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he feeds them.</v>

1085
00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:17.230
<v Speaker 2>He has them wash their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

1086
00:59:17.231 --> 00:59:19.480
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

1087
00:59:19.481 --> 00:59:24.481
<v Speaker 2>he treats them hospitably at well and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a blessing as a consequence of </v>

1088
00:59:24.481 --> 00:59:28.421
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something we talked about a </v>

1089
00:59:28.421 --> 00:59:30.491
<v Speaker 2>fair bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan when we were talking about the </v>

1090
00:59:30.491 --> 00:59:31.670
<v Speaker 2>things that doesn't fit in categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:32.840
<v Speaker 2>The Stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1092
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Which is that invitation to chaos as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well that you were talking about </v>

1093
00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:41.381
<v Speaker 2>matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the stranger is while the thing </v>

1094
00:59:41.381 --> 00:59:44.711
<v Speaker 2>that you can be subjugated to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also something that will bring </v>

1095
00:59:44.711 --> 00:59:47.081
<v Speaker 2>something new and potentially disruptive</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also potentially beneficial.</v>

1096
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:52.450
<v Speaker 2>And so then the idea there is whether or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the stranger is disruptive or </v>

1097
00:59:52.641 --> 00:59:56.420
<v Speaker 2>beneficial depends to a large degree on </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you treat the stranger.</v>

1098
00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 2>And that strikes me as very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very possible.</v>

1099
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:06.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one thing that that's one of </v>

1100
01:00:06.131 --> 01:00:06.470
<v Speaker 2>the things that has really entered my </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination as a clinician.</v>

1101
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're approached by someone who's </v>

1102
01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.460
<v Speaker 2>very in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequence of that is very </v>

1103
01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:20.921
<v Speaker 2>dependent on how you interact with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it can go any way and they're </v>

1104
01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:25.331
<v Speaker 2>not really in control because there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>so chaotic and so if you're careful and </v>

1105
01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:29.600
<v Speaker 2>awake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can keep things moving in the proper</v>

1106
01:00:29.601 --> 01:00:34.601
<v Speaker 2>direction and maybe even benefit from it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's Kinda like the idea of </v>

1107
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:41.170
<v Speaker 2>walking with God because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons that no one gets through the </v>

1108
01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:41.570
<v Speaker 2>flood is because he is oriented </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

1109
01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:47.290
<v Speaker 2>He's walking with God and so you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that exile can.</v>

1110
01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.230
<v Speaker 2>It's something like exile can expand </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1111
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.680
<v Speaker 2>If you stay properly oriented while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in exile,</v>

1112
01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:58.510
<v Speaker 3>it could fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can fix your mistakes.</v>

1113
01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.790
<v Speaker 3>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It cleans you.</v>

1114
01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:05.791
<v Speaker 3>It renews you because you make mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they become part of you and if </v>

1115
01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.440
<v Speaker 3>you're stuck with your mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're rigid about your own estates.</v>

1116
01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.360
<v Speaker 3>You need something outer to something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you don't know,</v>

1117
01:01:13.361 --> 01:01:16.480
<v Speaker 3>something that you don't understand to </v>
<v Speaker 3>clean your mistakes away.</v>

1118
01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's like</v>

1119
01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:20.480
<v Speaker 2>the Golden Dragon Horse with the Virgin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dragon Horts,</v>

1120
01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:20.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1121
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:26.380
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the dragon represents that chaotic </v>

1122
01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.760
<v Speaker 2>would say Exxon state that drag the gold</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the and the virgin both represent </v>

1123
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:34.100
<v Speaker 2>that which can be assimilated as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of being in that situation.</v>

1124
01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:39.980
<v Speaker 2>The funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in the hero myths going into exile on</v>

1125
01:01:40.141 --> 01:01:43.410
<v Speaker 2>purpose works way better than going into</v>
<v Speaker 2>exile accidentally.</v>

1126
01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.040
<v Speaker 2>So that's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1127
01:01:47.041 --> 01:01:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1128
01:01:47.641 --> 01:01:48.000
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1129
01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:54.070
<v Speaker 3>can I say something about the part you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were describing that the whole story of </v>

1130
01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:54.890
<v Speaker 3>Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the big picture,</v>

1131
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:59.950
<v Speaker 3>it's really about progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a progressive Lee knowing something.</v>

1132
01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:05.350
<v Speaker 3>So it started with just the voice of </v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1133
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Go here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean much goes there.</v>

1134
01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.730
<v Speaker 3>Then it becomes a little more precise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will give you this land.</v>

1135
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:15.380
<v Speaker 3>So now it's more specific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then as the further he goes,</v>

1136
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:18.980
<v Speaker 3>the more it becomes explicit what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to.</v>

1137
01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 3>So I'll give you a sudden when I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1138
01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.610
<v Speaker 3>someday it doesn't say later on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes more and more explicit,</v>

1139
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.640
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he says like in the party we were </v>

1140
01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:31.640
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>

1141
01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.640
<v Speaker 3>three men come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are angels as,</v>

1142
01:02:34.641 --> 01:02:37.600
<v Speaker 3>as it becomes clear later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is God,</v>

1143
01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>God sending his message in a clear </v>

1144
01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.890
<v Speaker 3>manner and it's more specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then before he says,</v>

1145
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.820
<v Speaker 3>this time next year you will have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sound good.</v>

1146
01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.060
<v Speaker 2>So okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a couple of things about that.</v>

1147
01:02:52.061 --> 01:02:57.061
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways that I've conceptualized</v>

1148
01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:02.290
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between the Old </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament and the new testament and I,</v>

1149
01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.750
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of a classic Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualization,</v>

1150
01:03:04.751 --> 01:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also,</v>

1151
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:12.150
<v Speaker 2>it's also analogous to what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moses because Moses doesn't get to the </v>

1152
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.970
<v Speaker 2>promised land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea,</v>

1153
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Christian idea that the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moses can't get to the promised land is </v>

1154
01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:21.100
<v Speaker 2>because he only represents the law now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I thought about that.</v>

1155
01:03:21.101 --> 01:03:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1156
01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:27.450
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to say about four stories at </v>

1157
01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:29.770
<v Speaker 2>the same time here at him to get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parallelism right.</v>

1158
01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:33.130
<v Speaker 2>So the first is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not so easy to speak the truth,</v>

1159
01:03:33.131 --> 01:03:38.131
<v Speaker 2>but it's fairly easy to stop light and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so as you stop lying,</v>

1160
01:03:38.411 --> 01:03:43.411
<v Speaker 2>you get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to approximate speaking the </v>

1161
01:03:43.411 --> 01:03:46.201
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way you start isn't by speaking </v>

1162
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:46.201
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>

1163
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 2>The way you start is by stopping light </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a lot of the rules in the Old </v>

1164
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:53.101
<v Speaker 2>Testament or prohibitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a bunch of things you shouldn't </v>

1165
01:03:53.101 --> 01:03:56.131
<v Speaker 2>do that you might be inclined to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea there would be if you </v>

1166
01:03:56.131 --> 01:03:57.970
<v Speaker 2>stopped doing all the things you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't do,</v>

1167
01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:59.870
<v Speaker 2>then you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your head clears up,</v>

1168
01:03:59.871 --> 01:04:02.590
<v Speaker 2>but now so you can start to see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you should do.</v>

1169
01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:06.580
<v Speaker 2>And so then in the Abrahamic story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's something like this,</v>

1170
01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:11.740
<v Speaker 2>you said you implied matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Abraham originally follow something</v>

1171
01:04:11.741 --> 01:04:16.741
<v Speaker 2>like a vague and ill defined whim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he has enough faith to move forward </v>

1172
01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.240
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that it's vague and ill</v>
<v Speaker 2>defined.</v>

1173
01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.940
<v Speaker 2>And then as a consequence of moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>

1174
01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:26.710
<v Speaker 2>it becomes more and more concretized and</v>
<v Speaker 2>and differentiated and clear.</v>

1175
01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right man,</v>

1176
01:04:28.511 --> 01:04:29.440
<v Speaker 2>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1177
01:04:29.441 --> 01:04:34.441
<v Speaker 2>it's funny because the future authoring </v>
<v Speaker 2>program we've developed sort of </v>

1178
01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:37.441
<v Speaker 2>predicated on that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you do is wander around </v>

1179
01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:41.370
<v Speaker 2>in a kind of confused days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find a direction of </v>

1180
01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:45.241
<v Speaker 2>orientation and then you clarify that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And partly you do that by continuing to </v>

1181
01:04:45.241 --> 01:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also clarified by acting on it.</v>

1182
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1183
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that these three men that </v>

1184
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:56.580
<v Speaker 3>come visit him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1185
01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.480
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason why there's three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1186
01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:00.820
<v Speaker 3>It's because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1187
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.550
<v Speaker 3>it's trying to express the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more expressed,</v>

1188
01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.530
<v Speaker 3>it's more explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just the seed anymore,</v>

1189
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:10.460
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a branch.</v>

1190
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got it.</v>

1191
01:05:11.261 --> 01:05:16.261
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got something that looks like a </v>

1192
01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:17.380
<v Speaker 3>branch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's branching out into a more concrete </v>

1193
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.890
<v Speaker 3>thing and at first it's just a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it's a vision that it's actual </v>

1194
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:22.480
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1195
01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1196
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:29.310
<v Speaker 2>So here's another idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say if you're beginning to </v>

1197
01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:35.860
<v Speaker 2>develop morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1198
01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 2>you behave so that the people who share </v>
<v Speaker 2>your morality can get along with you.</v>

1199
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:45.400
<v Speaker 2>That means you follow the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're dealing with strangers,</v>

1200
01:05:45.401 --> 01:05:50.401
<v Speaker 2>it's a different issue because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't part of your morality and so the </v>

1201
01:05:50.401 --> 01:05:55.291
<v Speaker 2>question then is how do you act properly</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're not in the domain of your </v>

1202
01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:59.191
<v Speaker 2>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I always thought about that as a </v>

1203
01:05:59.191 --> 01:06:01.890
<v Speaker 2>matter moral domain and it seems to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's the domain that Christ </v>

1204
01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:05.521
<v Speaker 2>occupies because he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like the mediator between </v>

1205
01:06:05.521 --> 01:06:09.030
<v Speaker 2>morality's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in no man's land and is the </v>

1206
01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:10.480
<v Speaker 2>mediator between moralities and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

1207
01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:13.900
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've oriented yourself properly,</v>

1208
01:06:13.901 --> 01:06:18.901
<v Speaker 2>then you even know how to act with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There aren't any rules and that's why </v>

1209
01:06:18.901 --> 01:06:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Abraham can act properly in relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the strangers.</v>

1210
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:22.590
<v Speaker 2>He's awake enough so that when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers show up,</v>

1211
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:27.630
<v Speaker 2>shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can pay attention to the way they're </v>

1212
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:30.660
<v Speaker 2>acting and could act spontaneously as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of paying attention and </v>

1213
01:06:30.911 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 2>things go well and so the strangers </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't hostile.</v>

1214
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:36.340
<v Speaker 2>They don't kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't take his wife.</v>

1215
01:06:36.341 --> 01:06:41.341
<v Speaker 2>They don't do any of the terrible things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that strangers could do and he gets a </v>

1216
01:06:41.341 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 2>blessing as a consequence of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that seem reasonable?</v>

1217
01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:51.290
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have to understand that these </v>

1218
01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:51.290
<v Speaker 3>strangers</v>

1219
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.240
<v Speaker 2>are</v>

1220
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:56.980
<v Speaker 3>come from heaven in the sense that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are bringing a message.</v>

1221
01:06:56.981 --> 01:06:59.950
<v Speaker 3>They're not just random strangers right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there sent,</v>

1222
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:05.370
<v Speaker 3>but maybe he would have acted the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way with a stranger that wasn't sent and</v>

1223
01:07:05.801 --> 01:07:07.330
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know.</v>

1224
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:13.100
<v Speaker 3>He acts in a way that allows for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the one that sent it can be </v>

1225
01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:13.450
<v Speaker 3>received.</v>

1226
01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's very interesting too because </v>

1227
01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.321
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I think you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening as a consequence of the </v>

1228
01:07:20.321 --> 01:07:24.761
<v Speaker 2>transition from the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new testament is that part of </v>

1229
01:07:25.881 --> 01:07:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Christ's message is to act in exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>

1230
01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:34.180
<v Speaker 2>is to act in a manner that allows for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of the emergence of the </v>

1231
01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.720
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something like that.</v>

1232
01:07:35.721 --> 01:07:40.721
<v Speaker 2>Something like what would you describe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it as a description of the necessity of </v>

1233
01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:44.291
<v Speaker 2>faith and you know like let's say you </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretch out your hand to someone in </v>

1234
01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:44.480
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be naive,</v>

1235
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:46.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's a precondition for good things </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

1236
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're distrustful and you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>every reason to be because people are </v>

1237
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.470
<v Speaker 2>full of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're distrustful,</v>

1238
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:57.220
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you foreclose the opportunity for </v>

1239
01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.880
<v Speaker 2>cooperative progress instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might protect yourself against being</v>

1240
01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:03.890
<v Speaker 2>bitten now in that so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there is a dramatic relationship </v>

1241
01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:07.430
<v Speaker 2>between the manner in which you open </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself up to the world and the way the</v>

1242
01:08:07.431 --> 01:08:12.431
<v Speaker 2>world treats you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that seems to be </v>

1243
01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:14.450
<v Speaker 2>really emphasized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more implicit in the Old Testament,</v>

1244
01:08:14.451 --> 01:08:19.451
<v Speaker 2>more explicit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The New Testament is that the more you </v>

1245
01:08:19.451 --> 01:08:23.591
<v Speaker 2>open yourself up to the possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 2>good things will happen and that's </v>

1246
01:08:23.591 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 2>partly by accepting your vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as I can tell,</v>

1247
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:28.040
<v Speaker 2>the higher the probability is that good </v>
<v Speaker 2>things will in fact happen.</v>

1248
01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1249
01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:38.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I would definitely say that in </v>

1250
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:39.630
<v Speaker 4>the story of Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the like we were kind of flirting around</v>

1251
01:08:39.631 --> 01:08:44.631
<v Speaker 4>that idea before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the reason why he was able to </v>

1252
01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:48.710
<v Speaker 4>receive them as these angel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were able to manifest </v>

1253
01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:50.340
<v Speaker 4>themselves as these angels was because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was willing to host them properly.</v>

1254
01:08:50.341 --> 01:08:51.390
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he like,</v>

1255
01:08:51.391 --> 01:08:54.090
<v Speaker 4>it's as if he had his family just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarah,</v>

1256
01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:59.120
<v Speaker 4>like Sarah is his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is he was the right ground for that </v>

1257
01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.930
<v Speaker 4>manifestation at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1258
01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:05.490
<v Speaker 2>well you say that they wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been angels if he wouldn't have treated </v>

1259
01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:05.490
<v Speaker 2>them properly.</v>

1260
01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:05.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might've been.</v>

1261
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.080
<v Speaker 3>It might've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might have done what they did in </v>

1262
01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Sodom and Gomorrah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole point.</v>

1263
01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:11.700
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1264
01:09:11.701 --> 01:09:13.940
<v Speaker 3>so now I want to switch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to flip ahead.</v>

1265
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:19.630
<v Speaker 2>This is really what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of all the things I wanted to </v>

1266
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:23.350
<v Speaker 2>discuss with you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is the one that's most </v>

1267
01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:23.480
<v Speaker 2>crucial because.</v>

1268
01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we're in,</v>

1269
01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:30.810
<v Speaker 2>let's say we're in of with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the angels and we're,</v>

1270
01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:35.930
<v Speaker 2>we're in the part of the story where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>townspeople of Sodom gather around the </v>

1271
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:40.311
<v Speaker 2>house and they tell lot and unless he </v>
<v Speaker 2>throws out the strangers so that they </v>

1272
01:09:40.311 --> 01:09:41.770
<v Speaker 2>can be raped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1273
01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:42.190
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1274
01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:47.280
<v Speaker 2>the townspeople demand that and then um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot offers them his daughters,</v>

1275
01:09:48.301 --> 01:09:50.910
<v Speaker 2>which seems like a hell of a thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1276
01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:54.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like the sacrifice of Isaac to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

1277
01:09:55.530 --> 01:10:00.530
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's willing to sacrifice his daughters </v>

1278
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.500
<v Speaker 2>to protect the strangers now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1279
01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:06.501
<v Speaker 2>so that's morally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call that a morally ambiguous </v>

1280
01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:09.201
<v Speaker 2>element of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the townspeople reject that and</v>

1281
01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell,</v>

1282
01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:16.220
<v Speaker 2>they basically tell him that he has no </v>
<v Speaker 2>right or power to bargain and that not </v>

1283
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.400
<v Speaker 2>only are they going to take his </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughters,</v>

1284
01:10:17.401 --> 01:10:20.130
<v Speaker 2>but they're also going to take the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers so it doesn't work,</v>

1285
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.160
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a,</v>

1286
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.280
<v Speaker 2>to modern sensibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the offering of his daughters is a </v>

1287
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.081
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to be it in the context of </v>

1288
01:10:30.081 --> 01:10:34.281
<v Speaker 2>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an indication of how hard lot is </v>

1289
01:10:34.281 --> 01:10:37.521
<v Speaker 2>trying to treat the strangers properly </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a place where that's essentially </v>

1290
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:37.521
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>

1291
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole point of that story.</v>

1292
01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.830
<v Speaker 3>That place is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole point.</v>

1293
01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I think what he just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1294
01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.330
<v Speaker 3>There's no way out of it.</v>

1295
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leonard Cohen said something about that.</v>

1296
01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:56.230
<v Speaker 2>He said there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a line that I remember quite </v>

1297
01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:58.871
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said there's no decent place to </v>

1298
01:10:58.871 --> 01:11:00.380
<v Speaker 2>stand in the massacre and what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to mean is that something.</v>

1299
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:05.410
<v Speaker 2>It's something like you can get into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place where it's made of such a compound</v>

1300
01:11:06.411 --> 01:11:10.400
<v Speaker 2>of errors and deceit and catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that no matter which way you turn,</v>

1301
01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:11.970
<v Speaker 2>there is no good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1302
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people like that in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical practice.</v>

1303
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:16.920
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no good,</v>

1304
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.890
<v Speaker 2>there's no good alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is sin.</v>

1305
01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:20.970
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of,</v>

1306
01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:24.180
<v Speaker 2>no matter which way you shoot your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to hit the mark because</v>

1307
01:11:24.181 --> 01:11:25.830
<v Speaker 2>you're not somewhere where the market </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be hit.</v>

1308
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I've been trying to think about the </v>

1309
01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 2>story of Sodom and Gomorrah in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to modern sexual confusion,</v>

1310
01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 2>so this is what I see happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice front,</v>

1311
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.270
<v Speaker 2>let's say on the one hand since the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties and probably as a consequence of</v>

1312
01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:47.970
<v Speaker 2>the birth control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other factors as well.</v>

1313
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:53.210
<v Speaker 2>There's been tremendous stress placed on</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual liberation and so there's this </v>

1314
01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:58.161
<v Speaker 2>idea that I think is associated in large</v>
<v Speaker 2>part right now with the radical left of </v>

1315
01:11:58.471 --> 01:12:03.471
<v Speaker 2>total sexual freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time there's increasing </v>

1316
01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:08.871
<v Speaker 2>emphasis from exactly the same sources </v>
<v Speaker 2>on restricting sexual interactions.</v>

1317
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.540
<v Speaker 2>So you see this in the campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1318
01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:17.541
<v Speaker 2>where increasingly particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>heterosexual contact is regulated by a </v>

1319
01:12:17.731 --> 01:12:22.731
<v Speaker 2>doctrine that says you have to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoken permission for every move in the </v>

1320
01:12:22.731 --> 01:12:27.060
<v Speaker 2>mating process and so you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know I'm not expressing myself </v>

1321
01:12:29.731 --> 01:12:34.731
<v Speaker 2>very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there seems to be in our current </v>

1322
01:12:34.731 --> 01:12:34.731
<v Speaker 2>culture there seems to be massive sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>confusion.</v>

1323
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:39.830
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's some weird combination of extreme </v>

1324
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:42.471
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism and extreme authoritarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>attitudes towards sexuality and and </v>

1325
01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:48.380
<v Speaker 2>obviously in the story of Sodom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of what's happening happening and </v>

1326
01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:53.270
<v Speaker 2>is that sex impulsive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexual gratification trumps everything.</v>

1327
01:12:54.961 --> 01:12:59.961
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know there's more to what's </v>

1328
01:12:59.961 --> 01:13:00.600
<v Speaker 2>going on inside them than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's certainly that and so.</v>

1329
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure out what to say </v>

1330
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:08.340
<v Speaker 2>about that tonight because there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lesson in there.</v>

1331
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.660
<v Speaker 2>The lesson is something like,</v>

1332
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:16.570
<v Speaker 2>don't let sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't let impulsive sexuality get the </v>

1333
01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:20.081
<v Speaker 2>upper hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that or all hell </v>

1334
01:13:20.081 --> 01:13:22.331
<v Speaker 2>will break loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I actually happen to agree with </v>

1335
01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:26.020
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been able to talk about in our </v>

1336
01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:28.451
<v Speaker 2>culture I think is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take the idea of the phenomena of </v>

1337
01:13:28.451 --> 01:13:32.550
<v Speaker 2>aids aids mutated to take advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>promiscuous sexuality and that's just </v>

1338
01:13:34.311 --> 01:13:37.700
<v Speaker 2>nothing you never hear that publicized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1339
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:41.300
<v Speaker 2>people had associated aids with </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality and there was a reason for</v>

1340
01:13:41.301 --> 01:13:46.301
<v Speaker 2>that because it's much more easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmitted as a consequence of </v>

1341
01:13:46.301 --> 01:13:48.941
<v Speaker 2>homosexual sex than heterosexual sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the anus is a much more delicate</v>

1342
01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:54.880
<v Speaker 2>physiological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as robust and it can be much </v>

1343
01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.361
<v Speaker 2>more easily damaged and and and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>with disease resulting as a consequence,</v>

1344
01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:02.000
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't only the manner of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>

1345
01:14:02.001 --> 01:14:07.001
<v Speaker 2>that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the fact that promiscuity </v>

1346
01:14:07.001 --> 01:14:10.070
<v Speaker 2>provided the evolutionary platform for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the AIDS virus to mutate into a very,</v>

1347
01:14:10.190 --> 01:14:13.430
<v Speaker 2>into the form that it took and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>only through the school,</v>

1348
01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.050
<v Speaker 2>by the skin of our teeth that we escaped</v>
<v Speaker 2>a totalizing plague.</v>

1349
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:23.370
<v Speaker 2>No had that emerged a hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows how many people would </v>

1350
01:14:24.651 --> 01:14:27.210
<v Speaker 2>have died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It AIDS was unbelievably fatal.</v>

1351
01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:33.770
<v Speaker 2>So I know that's a mishmash of ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure how to see my way </v>

1352
01:14:34.351 --> 01:14:39.351
<v Speaker 2>clear through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a clear warning in that </v>

1353
01:14:39.351 --> 01:14:41.420
<v Speaker 2>story about about something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to do with,</v>

1354
01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.680
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with sexual inequity,</v>

1355
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:49.870
<v Speaker 3>but in the Bible that sexuality has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>two Poles that define it and it's pretty</v>

1356
01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:54.060
<v Speaker 3>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

1357
01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:59.150
<v Speaker 3>one side is reproduction and the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>side is with let's say recreation.</v>

1358
01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those are the two bowls of sexuality </v>

1359
01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.740
<v Speaker 3>in a normal work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just for reproduction and </v>

1360
01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.120
<v Speaker 3>it's not just for recreation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's both.</v>

1361
01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:13.560
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the idea.</v>

1362
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:16.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a natural idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you.</v>

1363
01:15:16.410 --> 01:15:19.800
<v Speaker 3>If there's a balance there that should </v>
<v Speaker 3>be had.</v>

1364
01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:24.810
<v Speaker 3>If you lose this balance and it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>just about reproduction,</v>

1365
01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.750
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it becomes just about recreation,</v>

1366
01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.650
<v Speaker 3>that's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1367
01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that complicated really,</v>

1368
01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:36.980
<v Speaker 3>but it's so politically incorrect to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about these things even though </v>

1369
01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.490
<v Speaker 3>they're obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody dares to talk about it.</v>

1370
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.710
<v Speaker 2>The thing is is that the most difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to talk about are the things that</v>

1371
01:15:42.711 --> 01:15:46.880
<v Speaker 2>are obvious because when they're obvious</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to talk about them and so</v>

1372
01:15:46.881 --> 01:15:49.070
<v Speaker 2>then when people start to question the </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>

1373
01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.290
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1374
01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>

1375
01:15:52.971 --> 01:15:56.360
<v Speaker 2>we would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about the slut walks,</v>

1376
01:15:56.361 --> 01:16:01.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so women go out and they dress very </v>

1377
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:04.451
<v Speaker 2>provocatively and they go out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest their right to be as </v>

1378
01:16:04.451 --> 01:16:07.370
<v Speaker 2>provocative as they possibly can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>without being interfered with.</v>

1379
01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:13.060
<v Speaker 2>And I have some sympathy for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective because it seems to me </v>

1380
01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.430
<v Speaker 2>appropriate for women to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The final arbiter is in sexual contact,</v>

1381
01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.140
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also,</v>

1382
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:23.000
<v Speaker 2>it's that whole exercise is blind to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that clothing,</v>

1383
01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:25.100
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has communicative intent</v>

1384
01:16:25.930 --> 01:16:26.800
<v Speaker 1>and that</v>

1385
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.890
<v Speaker 2>people broadcast their invitation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual congress in a million ways.</v>

1386
01:16:32.891 --> 01:16:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Subtle and not so subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can't just say,</v>

1387
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I have the right to broadcast myself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any manner possible and be completely,</v>

1388
01:16:43.290 --> 01:16:45.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1389
01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:47.560
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be worked completely immune from the</v>

1390
01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.690
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong with that.</v>

1391
01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:52.690
<v Speaker 2>And with regards to basic sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality,</v>

1392
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.320
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read things about like slut shaming</v>

1393
01:16:56.321 --> 01:17:00.010
<v Speaker 2>is that the more radical feminist types,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1394
01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:04.360
<v Speaker 2>claim that women shouldn't be held </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for their sexual behavior in</v>

1395
01:17:04.361 --> 01:17:05.980
<v Speaker 2>some sense it shouldn't be held against </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1396
01:17:05.981 --> 01:17:07.720
<v Speaker 2>how many men they've slept with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1397
01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.890
<v Speaker 2>But then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1398
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:13.670
<v Speaker 2>you'd never recommend to someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they laid down naked on the,</v>

1399
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:17.480
<v Speaker 2>on the side of the street with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs spread and invite anybody who walks</v>

1400
01:17:17.481 --> 01:17:22.481
<v Speaker 2>by to partake of the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would regard that as </v>

1401
01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:25.730
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think without question.</v>

1402
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:31.300
<v Speaker 2>And so what that indicates is that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of sexual propriety is Both </v>

1403
01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:37.420
<v Speaker 2>normative and ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course you can start asking </v>

1404
01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.961
<v Speaker 2>yourself about what that degree of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social sexual impropriety should be.</v>

1405
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And It does have something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the balance between reproduction</v>

1406
01:17:44.301 --> 01:17:45.980
<v Speaker 2>and recreation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1407
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1408
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:50.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing,</v>

1409
01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.380
<v Speaker 3>even in the bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the two aspects.</v>

1410
01:17:55.381 --> 01:17:58.550
<v Speaker 3>Some stories are about just this aspect </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1411
01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.660
<v Speaker 3>there are the most strange stories in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bible.</v>

1412
01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:05.960
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story of I'm tamar is one of those.</v>

1413
01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:08.350
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1414
01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:10.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that story,</v>

1415
01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:12.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the,</v>

1416
01:18:12.091 --> 01:18:17.091
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's intercut with the story of joseph </v>

1417
01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:21.190
<v Speaker 3>in Egypt and it's essentially a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says that judah had children with </v>

1418
01:18:24.211 --> 01:18:28.170
<v Speaker 3>some woman and I think it's a stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't necessarily say so,</v>

1419
01:18:28.171 --> 01:18:33.171
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the sons die off.</v>

1420
01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:39.050
<v Speaker 3>And then there's this woman called tamar</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she disguises herself as a </v>

1421
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.670
<v Speaker 3>prostitute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1422
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:45.500
<v Speaker 3>And she has a kid with judah himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all of the symbols are in that story.</v>

1423
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Elements of his clothing.</v>

1424
01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Demonstrate as a,</v>

1425
01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:53.170
<v Speaker 3>as a bride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Essentially</v>

1427
01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:57.370
<v Speaker 2>wants to indicate later that he's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one who slept with.</v>

1428
01:18:57.810 --> 01:18:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1429
01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.680
<v Speaker 3>So that story is about the necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the need for the recreative part of </v>

1430
01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.280
<v Speaker 3>sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about that symbolism.</v>

1431
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:11.340
<v Speaker 3>It's all about the seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about incest.</v>

1432
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.760
<v Speaker 3>It's all about death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>

1433
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:18.600
<v Speaker 3>The idea is it's to raise the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1434
01:19:18.601 --> 01:19:20.660
<v Speaker 3>It's not clear in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you understand,</v>

1435
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:22.530
<v Speaker 3>if you understand the imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it's about.</v>

1436
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.800
<v Speaker 3>It's about regressing back to an error </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was made.</v>

1437
01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And raising the dead so,</v>

1438
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.080
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just the idea that in the bible</v>

1439
01:19:34.081 --> 01:19:39.081
<v Speaker 3>there's both to the hearse reproduction </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's recreation and the </v>

1440
01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:44.440
<v Speaker 3>recreation is renewal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the renewal sexuality's about </v>

1441
01:19:44.581 --> 01:19:47.970
<v Speaker 3>renewal too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that aspect of the symbolism is,</v>

1442
01:19:47.971 --> 01:19:51.660
<v Speaker 3>is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say obscure because it's</v>

1443
01:19:51.661 --> 01:19:55.770
<v Speaker 3>actually right there if you can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's strange.</v>

1444
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:57.600
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange.</v>

1445
01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1446
01:19:58.130 --> 01:20:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now another element of this might be </v>

1447
01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:03.750
<v Speaker 2>the fact that in modern identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

1448
01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:09.050
<v Speaker 2>sexual choice is a canonical identifier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that also seems to me to be </v>

1449
01:20:09.151 --> 01:20:14.151
<v Speaker 2>something wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things I've seen </v>

1450
01:20:14.151 --> 01:20:15.330
<v Speaker 2>happening in toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's the same in montreal,</v>

1451
01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:19.350
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to do this awkwardly.</v>

1452
01:20:19.351 --> 01:20:24.351
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put this awkwardly because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been able to sort through it </v>

1453
01:20:24.351 --> 01:20:24.560
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1454
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:29.070
<v Speaker 2>pride week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pride day has turned into pride week and</v>

1455
01:20:29.071 --> 01:20:34.071
<v Speaker 2>that's turned into pride month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that seems to me to be </v>

1456
01:20:34.071 --> 01:20:37.941
<v Speaker 2>pushing against some kind of limit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the first question that I have </v>

1457
01:20:37.941 --> 01:20:42.741
<v Speaker 2>is like I was reading this book the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day by a friend of mine from </v>

1458
01:20:42.741 --> 01:20:46.500
<v Speaker 2>ottawa who's a gay conservative and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said he had a lot harder time coming out</v>

1459
01:20:46.501 --> 01:20:51.501
<v Speaker 2>as a conservative than he had as coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>out as gay and he talked about the </v>

1460
01:20:52.711 --> 01:20:57.711
<v Speaker 2>degree to which homosexuals were </v>
<v Speaker 2>persecuted in Canada before say the 19 </v>

1461
01:20:58.351 --> 01:21:03.330
<v Speaker 2>eighties and it's quite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes quite a harsh reading,</v>

1462
01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:08.450
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so and so fair enough to the,</v>

1463
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:14.690
<v Speaker 2>to the civil rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say it,</v>

1464
01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:19.430
<v Speaker 2>that that has brought homosexuality into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the norm or that into the mainstream.</v>

1465
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1466
01:21:20.931 --> 01:21:25.250
<v Speaker 2>but that conversation still has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of development.</v>

1467
01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.900
<v Speaker 2>It's necessary because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand exactly.</v>

1468
01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.680
<v Speaker 2>It isn't obvious to me what integration </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the mainstream precisely means </v>

1469
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.730
<v Speaker 2>because a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been a lot of talk so far about</v>

1470
01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:46.320
<v Speaker 2>respecting the rights of gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very little talk about what the </v>

1471
01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:50.701
<v Speaker 2>accompanying responsibilities might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That actually it seems to me to be a </v>

1472
01:21:50.701 --> 01:21:52.810
<v Speaker 2>problem and I mean I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had a letter from,</v>

1473
01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:58.260
<v Speaker 2>from guy gay guy who has been wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this because he's not sure how to </v>

1474
01:21:59.141 --> 01:22:01.900
<v Speaker 2>be gay and to be ethical at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1475
01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:07.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he sees part of normative </v>

1476
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.181
<v Speaker 2>behavior is taking wife and having </v>
<v Speaker 2>children and not and can see the value </v>

1477
01:22:09.181 --> 01:22:12.841
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's certainly not the direction </v>

1478
01:22:12.841 --> 01:22:12.841
<v Speaker 2>of his proclivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we wrote,</v>

1479
01:22:12.841 --> 01:22:16.750
<v Speaker 2>wrote to me asking me what he should do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1480
01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't have an answer for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the answer to that is,</v>

1481
01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:26.220
<v Speaker 2>but I know that it might be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be worth talking about and </v>

1482
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:29.840
<v Speaker 2>it's part of this current confusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>about sexual identity and sexual </v>

1483
01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 2>pleasure and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll even gender identity for that </v>

1484
01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:35.650
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1485
01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:38.410
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so your idea was,</v>

1486
01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:42.640
<v Speaker 2>well the balance between recreation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduction had gone,</v>

1487
01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.990
<v Speaker 2>was completely absent inside them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all recreation.</v>

1488
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:49.270
<v Speaker 2>It was all instant gratification and </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulse.</v>

1489
01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it's put in the contrast </v>

1490
01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:57.410
<v Speaker 3>with the abraham bit because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same angels.</v>

1491
01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:00.020
<v Speaker 3>But in that case he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have a son this time next year.</v>

1492
01:23:00.021 --> 01:23:05.021
<v Speaker 3>So it's the reproduction part is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when he gets to the</v>

1493
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.560
<v Speaker 2>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not there anymore.</v>

1494
01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:11.050
<v Speaker 2>It's only the recreation part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1495
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:13.030
<v Speaker 2>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1496
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:18.031
<v Speaker 2>they're meant to be contested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those two stores actually in the story </v>

1497
01:23:18.031 --> 01:23:20.260
<v Speaker 2>of abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty clear.</v>

1498
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.930
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1499
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:27.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this will make sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>because when the angels come it says,</v>

1500
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he washes their feet and then he feeds </v>

1501
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:33.160
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1502
01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:38.340
<v Speaker 2>That's actually the recreation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduction part that not in terms of </v>

1503
01:23:38.771 --> 01:23:43.771
<v Speaker 2>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's in terms of meaning the </v>

1504
01:23:43.771 --> 01:23:48.180
<v Speaker 2>renewal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the washing of the feet is the </v>

1505
01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:48.180
<v Speaker 2>recreation part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their renewal,</v>

1506
01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:52.240
<v Speaker 2>they're restarting and the feeding is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reproduction part,</v>

1507
01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:57.300
<v Speaker 2>not in a sexual way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you feed something food and he </v>

1508
01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:57.300
<v Speaker 2>eats it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it integrates,</v>

1509
01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:01.711
<v Speaker 2>it integrates it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like our reproduction of your </v>

1510
01:24:01.711 --> 01:24:01.711
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1511
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:04.240
<v Speaker 2>you're staying yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reproducing yourself.</v>

1512
01:24:04.241 --> 01:24:05.890
<v Speaker 2>So when you eat food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're doing.</v>

1513
01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1514
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:09.700
<v Speaker 2>not in a sexual way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has exactly the same.</v>

1515
01:24:09.701 --> 01:24:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Meaning if you eat something that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can integrate correctly,</v>

1516
01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:17.440
<v Speaker 2>you're like reproducing your pattern is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the correct version of yourself.</v>

1517
01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:23.250
<v Speaker 2>The other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the washing is that like is that little </v>

1518
01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:23.250
<v Speaker 2>flood</v>

1519
01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:25.360
<v Speaker 3>the fuck so many flood,</v>

1520
01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:27.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an acceptable.</v>

1521
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:31.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a controlled one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're washing the dust off your.</v>

1522
01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.570
<v Speaker 2>The roads dust off your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that you're.</v>

1523
01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:38.890
<v Speaker 2>You're passing from one mode of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>into another because you're.</v>

1524
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.470
<v Speaker 2>You're cleaning off the debris of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

1525
01:24:41.471 --> 01:24:44.940
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that and that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about renewal next year,</v>

1526
01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:46.840

<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
