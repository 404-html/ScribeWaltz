1
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Today I want to present to you some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things I've been thinking and </v>

2
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.291
<v Speaker 1>writing about his Easter approached.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this in five separate </v>

3
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>parts which hopefully will make up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coherent hole.</v>

4
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read all of this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated in part one,</v>

5
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>the nature of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two ways of looking at the </v>

6
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.511
<v Speaker 1>world as a place of things and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>forum for action because we are living </v>

7
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>beings and must make our way </v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatically in the world.</v>

8
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>The second way of looking has to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>precedence.</v>

9
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>This means that the world as a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things is nested inside the world as a </v>

10
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>forum for action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that our conceptualization of</v>

11
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:07.991
<v Speaker 1>the world as objective must remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate to our conceptualization of </v>

12
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:13.601
<v Speaker 1>the world as a place of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from the first part of my book.</v>

13
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Maps</v>

14
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 2>meaning quote,</v>

15
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.360
<v Speaker 1>the world can be validly construed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>forum for action or place of things.</v>

16
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>The former manner of interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more primordial and less clearly </v>

17
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.261
<v Speaker 1>understood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finds its expression in the arts or </v>

18
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enriched reuel drama,</v>

19
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>literature and mythology of the world as</v>
<v Speaker 1>forum for auction is a place of value,</v>

20
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>a place where all things have meaning.</v>

21
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>This meaning which is shaped as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of social interaction is </v>

22
00:01:56.201 --> 00:02:01.201
<v Speaker 1>implication for action or at a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis implication for the </v>

23
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:07.231
<v Speaker 1>configuration of the Interpretive Schema</v>
<v Speaker 1>that produces or guides action the </v>

24
00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:13.801
<v Speaker 1>ladder manner of interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world as place of things finds its </v>

25
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 1>formal expression in the methods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories of science.</v>

26
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Science allows for increasingly precise </v>
<v Speaker 1>determination of the consensually </v>

27
00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:28.681
<v Speaker 1>validatable properties of things and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient utilization of precisely </v>

28
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:34.171
<v Speaker 1>determined things as tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once the direction such use is to take </v>

29
00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 1>has been determined through application </v>
<v Speaker 1>of more fundamental narrative processes.</v>

30
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>No complete world picture can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated without use of both modes of </v>

31
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:50.071
<v Speaker 1>construal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that one mode is generally set </v>

32
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:53.611
<v Speaker 1>at odds with the other means only that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of their respective domains </v>

33
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:58.051
<v Speaker 1>remains insufficiently discriminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adherence of the mythological worldview </v>

34
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.110
<v Speaker 1>tend to regard the statements of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>creeds as indistinguishable from </v>

35
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.221
<v Speaker 1>empirical fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though such statements were </v>

36
00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>generally formulated long before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of objective reality emerged,</v>

37
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.970
<v Speaker 1>those who by contrast except the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective who assumed that </v>

38
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:23.671
<v Speaker 1>it is or might become complete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget that an impossible golf currently</v>

39
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>divides what is from what should be.</v>

40
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.250
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this a little later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also relevant as introduction to </v>

41
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.811
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to discuss in a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world can be validly construed as a </v>

42
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:42.720
<v Speaker 1>forum for action as well as a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

43
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.890
<v Speaker 1>We described the world as a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things using the formal methods of </v>

44
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.570
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The techniques of narrative,</v>

45
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.070
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>myth,</v>

46
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drama portray the world as a forum </v>

47
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.191
<v Speaker 1>for action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two forms of representation have </v>

48
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.821
<v Speaker 1>been unnecessarily set at odds because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have not yet formed a clear picture </v>

49
00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:08.831
<v Speaker 1>of their respective domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The domain of the former scientific </v>

50
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:15.171
<v Speaker 1>domain is the objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is from the perspective of </v>

51
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.540
<v Speaker 1>intersubjective perception?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The domain of the ladder drama narrative</v>

52
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.780
<v Speaker 1>is the world of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is and what should be from the </v>

53
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.551
<v Speaker 1>perspective of emotion and action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world as a forum for action presents</v>

54
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:38.240
<v Speaker 1>itself in two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The normal story,</v>

55
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I was at point a and I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>point b and the revolutionary story.</v>

56
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.260
<v Speaker 1>I was at point a and well going to point</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

57
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>something entirely unexpected and earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>shattering happened meant I had to </v>

58
00:04:57.281 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>abandon my story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>question my assumptions,</v>

59
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 1>a lot of my old beliefs to die and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reborn.</v>

60
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>A new.</v>

61
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>The second story which is deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is essentially religious part to some </v>

62
00:05:15.561 --> 00:05:18.230
<v Speaker 1>axioms of the Christian revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

63
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to decide that and then enact the </v>

64
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.700
<v Speaker 1>proposition that being is good despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>its tragedy and malevolence.</v>

65
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work in consequence for the continual</v>

66
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:39.510
<v Speaker 1>and eternal improvement of that being </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to know that as love.</v>

67
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do such work in truth.</v>

68
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Number four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to let everything inadequate burn off in</v>

69
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>that pursuit and to welcome its </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement by what is better.</v>

70
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Number five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know that as the sacred imitation of </v>

71
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number six,</v>

72
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>do you understand that although Christ's</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice redeemed us,</v>

73
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:14.531
<v Speaker 1>all the work still has to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number seven,</v>

74
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.020
<v Speaker 1>to accept that work as the sacred </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of life.</v>

75
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Number eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to strive toward the heavenly city on </v>

76
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.051
<v Speaker 1>the hill in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part three,</v>

77
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.130
<v Speaker 1>narratives and sacrifice for my new </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

78
00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:39.400
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule seven,</v>

79
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.300
<v Speaker 1>pursue what is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what is expedient.</v>

80
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Every man for himself and the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the hindmost as the old proverb </v>

81
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.560
<v Speaker 1>hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not simply take everything you can </v>

82
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.761
<v Speaker 1>get whenever the opportunity arises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not determined to live in that </v>

83
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:00.820
<v Speaker 1>manner</v>

84
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.210
<v Speaker 1>or is there an alternative and if so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should we bother with it?</v>

85
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Our ancestors worked out very </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated answers to such questions,</v>

86
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.220
<v Speaker 1>but we still don't understand them very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

87
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.370
<v Speaker 1>This is because they are in large part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still implicit manifest primarily in </v>

88
00:07:23.551 --> 00:07:27.930
<v Speaker 1>ritual and myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as of yet in completely articulated,</v>

89
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.650
<v Speaker 1>we act them out and represent them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>

90
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 1>but we're not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it enough to formulate them </v>

91
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.201
<v Speaker 1>explicitly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still chimps in a troop or wolves </v>

92
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:41.070
<v Speaker 1>in a pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how to behave.</v>

93
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 1>We know who's who and why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've learned that through experience or</v>

94
00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:49.440
<v Speaker 1>knowledge has been shaped by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction with others.</v>

95
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.640
<v Speaker 1>We've established predictable routines </v>
<v Speaker 1>and patterns of behavior,</v>

96
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really understand them or </v>
<v Speaker 1>know where they originated.</v>

97
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.630
<v Speaker 1>They've evolved over great expanses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

98
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.710
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't and still don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it all meant.</v>

99
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:10.860
<v Speaker 1>The Biblical narrative of Paradise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fall is one such story fabricated by</v>

100
00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:14.160
<v Speaker 1>our collective imagination working over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the centuries.</v>

101
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 1>It provides a profound account of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of being and points the way to a </v>

102
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.331
<v Speaker 1>mode of conceptualization and action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well matched to that nature in the </v>

103
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:29.070
<v Speaker 1>garden of Eden prior to the dawn of self</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

104
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.400
<v Speaker 1>so goes the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings were sinless.</v>

105
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Our primordial parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve walked with God,</v>

106
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.100
<v Speaker 1>then tempted by the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first couple ate from the tree of </v>

107
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.181
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered death and vulnerability and </v>

108
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:50.381
<v Speaker 1>turned away from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mankind was exiled from paradise and </v>

109
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>began it's effortful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortal existence,</v>

110
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.370
<v Speaker 3>the of sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Enter soon afterward,</v>

111
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 3>beginning with the account of Cain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abel and developing through the </v>

112
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Abrahamic Adventures and the exodus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After much contemplation,</v>

113
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.820
<v Speaker 3>struggling humanity learns that God's </v>
<v Speaker 3>favor could be gained and his wrath </v>

114
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.991
<v Speaker 3>averted through proper sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also that bloody murder might be </v>

115
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 3>motivated among those unwilling or </v>
<v Speaker 3>unable to succeed in this matter.</v>

116
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 3>The delay of gratification when engaging</v>
<v Speaker 3>in sacrifice,</v>

117
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:29.691
<v Speaker 3>our forefathers began to act out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be considered a proposition if it </v>

118
00:09:29.691 --> 00:09:34.491
<v Speaker 3>were stated in words that something </v>
<v Speaker 3>better might be attained in the future </v>

119
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 3>by giving up something of value in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

120
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Recall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

121
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 3>that the necessity for work is one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the curses placed by God upon Adam and </v>

122
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.590
<v Speaker 3>his descendants in consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>original sin.</v>

123
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Adam's waking to the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>constraints of his being,</v>

124
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:57.790
<v Speaker 3>his vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His eventual death is equivalent to his </v>

125
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.610
<v Speaker 3>discovery of the future.</v>

126
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 4>The future</v>

127
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.230
<v Speaker 3>that's where you go to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully not too soon.</v>

128
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Your demise might be staved off through </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

129
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.730
<v Speaker 3>through the sacrifice of the now to gain</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit later.</v>

130
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.630
<v Speaker 3>It is for this reason among others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt that the concept of sacrifice </v>

131
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.760
<v Speaker 3>is introduced in the biblical chapter </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately following the drama of the </v>

132
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.841
<v Speaker 3>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's little difference between </v>

133
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:31.640
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice and work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're also both uniquely human.</v>

134
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes animals act as if they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>working,</v>

135
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.940
<v Speaker 3>but they are really only following the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dictates of their nature.</v>

136
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Beavers build dams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do so because they are beavers,</v>

137
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.180
<v Speaker 3>beavers build dams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't think,</v>

138
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:51.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd rather be on a beach in Mexico </v>

139
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:51.270
<v Speaker 3>with my girlfriend while they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

140
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Prosaically such sacrifice work is delay</v>
<v Speaker 3>of gratification,</v>

141
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.220
<v Speaker 3>but that's a very mundane phrase to </v>
<v Speaker 3>describe something of soul shattering </v>

142
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.091
<v Speaker 3>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The discovery that gratification could </v>

143
00:11:07.091 --> 00:11:10.481
<v Speaker 3>be delayed was similar to the discovery </v>
<v Speaker 3>of time and with it causality,</v>

144
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.620
<v Speaker 3>at least the causal force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a voluntary human action.</v>

145
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Long ago in the mists of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we began to realize that reality was </v>

146
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.900
<v Speaker 3>structured as if it could be bargained </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

147
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.370
<v Speaker 3>We learned that behaving properly now in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the present,</v>

148
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.640
<v Speaker 3>regulating our impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>considering the plight of others could </v>

149
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.460
<v Speaker 3>bring rewards in the future in a time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and place that did not yet exist.</v>

150
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.960
<v Speaker 3>We began to inhibit control and organize</v>
<v Speaker 3>our immediate impulses so that we could </v>

151
00:11:44.751 --> 00:11:48.830
<v Speaker 3>stop interfering with other people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>our future selves.</v>

152
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Doing so was indistinguishable from </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizing the discovery of the causal </v>

153
00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 3>relationship between our efforts today </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the quality of tomorrow.</v>

154
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Motivated the social contract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the organization that enables today's </v>

155
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.361
<v Speaker 3>work to be stored reliably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly in the form of promises from </v>

156
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:14.851
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Understanding is often acted out before </v>

157
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:21.571
<v Speaker 3>it can be articulated just as a child </v>
<v Speaker 3>acts out what it means to be mother or </v>

158
00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 3>father before being able to give a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spoken account of what those roles mean.</v>

159
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.620
<v Speaker 3>The act of making a ritual sacrifice to </v>
<v Speaker 3>God was an early and sophisticated </v>

160
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 3>enactment of the idea of the usefulness </v>
<v Speaker 3>of delay.</v>

161
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 3>There is a long conceptual journey </v>
<v Speaker 3>between merely feasting,</v>

162
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:46.321
<v Speaker 3>hungrily and learning to set aside some </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra meat smoke by the fire for the end</v>

163
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.210
<v Speaker 3>of the day or for someone who isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>

164
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to learn to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything later for yourself or to share </v>

165
00:12:56.361 --> 00:13:01.361
<v Speaker 1>it with someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are very much the same thing </v>

166
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:03.350
<v Speaker 1>as in the former case you are sharing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your future self.</v>

167
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 1>It is much easier and far more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfishly and immediately wolf down </v>

168
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:14.261
<v Speaker 1>everything in sight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are similar long journeys between </v>

169
00:13:14.301 --> 00:13:19.301
<v Speaker 1>every leap and sophistication with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to delay and its </v>

170
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:21.140
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short term sharing,</v>

171
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:26.350
<v Speaker 1>storing away for the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of that storage in the </v>

172
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.821
<v Speaker 1>form of records and later in the form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>currency and ultimately the saving of </v>

173
00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:34.670
<v Speaker 1>money in a bank or other social </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution.</v>

174
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Some conceptualizations had to serve as </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermediaries or the full range of our </v>

175
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:45.611
<v Speaker 1>practices and ideas surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and work and their </v>

176
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:49.511
<v Speaker 1>representation could have never emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our ancestors acted out a drama fiction.</v>

177
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:58.330
<v Speaker 1>They personified the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that governance fate as a spirit that </v>

178
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.111
<v Speaker 1>can be bargained with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traded with as if it were another human </v>

179
00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:05.450
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the amazing thing is that it worked.</v>

180
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.820
<v Speaker 1>This was in part because the future is </v>
<v Speaker 1>largely composed of other human beings,</v>

181
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 1>often precisely those who have watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evaluated and to praise the tiniest </v>

182
00:14:16.371 --> 00:14:21.371
<v Speaker 1>details of your past behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not very far from that to God </v>

183
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>sitting above on high tracking your </v>
<v Speaker 1>every move and writing it down for </v>

184
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.931
<v Speaker 1>further reference in a big book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a productive symbolic idea.</v>

185
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.770
<v Speaker 1>The future is a judgmental father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good start,</v>

186
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but two additional archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundational questions arose because of </v>

187
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.971
<v Speaker 1>the discovery of sacrifice of work both </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do with the ultimate extension </v>

188
00:14:49.851 --> 00:14:54.851
<v Speaker 1>of the logic of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sacrifice now to gain later.</v>

189
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.530
<v Speaker 1>First question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what must be sacrificed?</v>

190
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Small sacrifices maybe sufficient to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve small singular problems,</v>

191
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but it is possible that larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more comprehensive sacrifices might </v>

192
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.771
<v Speaker 1>solve an array of large and complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems all at the same time.</v>

193
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.900
<v Speaker 1>That's harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be better adapting to the </v>

194
00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:27.720
<v Speaker 1>necessary discipline of medical school </v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

195
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.750
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fatally interfere with a licentious </v>

196
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.650
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle of a hardcore undergraduate </v>
<v Speaker 1>party animal.</v>

197
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Giving that up is a sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a physician can quote George W </v>

198
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.850
<v Speaker 1>really put food on his family that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of trouble dispensed with over a </v>

199
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:50.060
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time,</v>

200
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.040
<v Speaker 1>so sacrifices are necessary to improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and larger sacrifices can be </v>

201
00:15:57.341 --> 00:16:00.930
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second question,</v>

202
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.660
<v Speaker 1>set of related questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

203
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Speaker 1>we've already established the basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle sacrifice will improve the </v>

204
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.941
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a principal once established has to </v>

205
00:16:13.981 --> 00:16:18.981
<v Speaker 1>be fleshed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full extension or significance has </v>

206
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:23.481
<v Speaker 1>to be understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is implied by the idea that </v>

207
00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:28.071
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice will improve the future in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most extreme and final of cases,</v>

208
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.890
<v Speaker 1>where does that basic principle find its</v>
<v Speaker 1>limits?</v>

209
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:37.410
<v Speaker 1>We must ask to begin what would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest,</v>

210
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:42.470
<v Speaker 1>most effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most pleasing of all possible </v>

211
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.450
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then how good mike the best possible</v>

212
00:16:45.451 --> 00:16:49.710
<v Speaker 1>future be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the most effective sacrifice could be</v>

213
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:54.711
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Biblical story of Cain and Abel,</v>

214
00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve sons immediately follows </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the expulsion from </v>

215
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.580
<v Speaker 1>paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As mentioned previously,</v>

216
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel are really the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans since their parents were made </v>

217
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.830
<v Speaker 1>directly by God and not born in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard manner.</v>

218
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel live in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in Eden.</v>

219
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.960
<v Speaker 1>They must work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must make sacrifices to please God </v>

220
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.850
<v Speaker 1>and they do so with alter and proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>ritual,</v>

221
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.560
<v Speaker 1>but things get complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ables offerings pleased God,</v>

222
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but canes do not able is rewarded many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times over,</v>

223
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.070
<v Speaker 1>but Kane is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not precisely clear why,</v>

224
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.120
<v Speaker 1>although the tech strongly hints that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Keynes Heart is just not in it.</v>

225
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the quality of what came put </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward was low.</v>

226
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe his spirit was begrudging or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>God was vexed for some secret reasons of</v>

227
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:55.350
<v Speaker 1>his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of this is realistic,</v>

228
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 1>including the texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vagueness of explanation.</v>

229
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Not all sacrifices are of equal quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>

230
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.960
<v Speaker 1>it often appears that sacrifices of </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently high quality or not rewarded </v>

231
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 1>with a better future and it's not clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

232
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.990
<v Speaker 1>why isn't God happy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would have to change to make him </v>

233
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.941
<v Speaker 1>so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are difficult questions and </v>

234
00:18:22.941 --> 00:18:27.480
<v Speaker 1>everyone asks them all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they don't notice.</v>

235
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Asking such questions is </v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from thinking.</v>

236
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.960
<v Speaker 1>The realization that pleasure could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>usefully forestalled dawned on us with </v>

237
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.701
<v Speaker 1>great difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It runs absolutely contrary to our </v>

238
00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:47.061
<v Speaker 1>ancient fundamental animal instincts </v>
<v Speaker 1>which demand immediate satisfaction,</v>

239
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 1>particularly under conditions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation,</v>

240
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.770
<v Speaker 1>which are both inevitable and common </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

241
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:58.610
<v Speaker 1>and to complicate the matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such delay only becomes useful when </v>

242
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 1>civilization has stabilized itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to guarantee the existence of the</v>

243
00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:07.491
<v Speaker 1>delayed reward in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everything you save will be destroyed</v>

244
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 1>or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen,</v>

245
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.470
<v Speaker 1>there's no point in saving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is for this reason that a wolf will </v>

246
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.390
<v Speaker 1>down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>meal.</v>

247
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 1>He isn't thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

248
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:25.791
<v Speaker 1>I hate it when I binge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should save some of this for next </v>

249
00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:29.570
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how was it that those two impossible </v>

250
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.391
<v Speaker 1>and necessarily simultaneous ad call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>months delay and the stabilization of </v>

251
00:19:32.391 --> 00:19:36.720
<v Speaker 1>society into the future could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>have manifested themselves?</v>

252
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Here is a developmental progression from</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal to human.</v>

253
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt in the details,</v>

254
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's sufficiently correct for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes in theme first,</v>

255
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.730
<v Speaker 1>there's excess food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large carcasses.</v>

256
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Mammoths are other massive herbivores </v>
<v Speaker 1>might provide that.</v>

257
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.080
<v Speaker 1>We a lot of Mammas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe all of the with a large animal.</v>

258
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:08.300
<v Speaker 1>There's some left for later after a kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's accidental at first,</v>

259
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:14.300
<v Speaker 1>but eventually the utility of for later </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to be appreciated.</v>

260
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Some provisional notion of sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>develops at the same time.</v>

261
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 1>If I leave some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I wanted now,</v>

262
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I won't have to be hungry later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That provisional notion develops to the </v>

263
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.970
<v Speaker 1>next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I leave some for later,</v>

264
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I won't have to go hungry and neither </v>
<v Speaker 1>will those I care for and then to the </v>

265
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:43.611
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't possibly eat all of this </v>

266
00:20:43.611 --> 00:20:46.641
<v Speaker 1>mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't store the rest for too long </v>

267
00:20:46.641 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should feed to other people,</v>

268
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:54.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'll remember and feed me some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their mammoth when they have some and</v>

269
00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:59.621
<v Speaker 1>I have none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll get some mammoth now and some </v>

270
00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:04.591
<v Speaker 1>mammoth later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good deal and maybe those I'm </v>

271
00:21:04.591 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 1>sharing with will come to trust me more </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally.</v>

272
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe then we could trade forever in </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a manner.</v>

273
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Mammoth becomes future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammoth and future.</v>

274
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:22.591
<v Speaker 1>Mammoth becomes personal reputation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of the social contract to </v>

275
00:21:25.321 --> 00:21:30.321
<v Speaker 1>share does not mean to give away </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you value and get nothing </v>

276
00:21:30.321 --> 00:21:34.071
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is instead only what every child </v>

277
00:21:34.071 --> 00:21:37.641
<v Speaker 1>who refuses to share fears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means to share means properly to </v>

278
00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:42.210
<v Speaker 1>initiate the process of trade.</v>

279
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.200
<v Speaker 1>A child who can't share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can't trade,</v>

280
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.430
<v Speaker 1>can't have any friends because having </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends is a form of trade.</v>

281
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>newcomer to a neighborhood ask a new </v>

282
00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:00.480
<v Speaker 1>neighbor to do him or her a favor citing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this old maxim.</v>

283
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:06.860
<v Speaker 1>He that is once done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a kindness will be more ready to do </v>

284
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.641
<v Speaker 1>you another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he whom you yourself have obliged </v>

285
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.980
<v Speaker 1>in Franklin's opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking someone for something not too </v>

286
00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.701
<v Speaker 1>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously was the most useful and </v>

287
00:22:19.701 --> 00:22:21.900
<v Speaker 1>immediate invitation to social </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction and trade,</v>

288
00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.480
<v Speaker 1>such asking on the part of the newcomer </v>
<v Speaker 1>provided the neighbor with an </v>

289
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.871
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to show him or herself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good person at first encounter.</v>

290
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.440
<v Speaker 1>It also meant that the ladder could now </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask the former for a favor in return </v>

291
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.270
<v Speaker 1>because of the debt incurred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing their mutual familiarity and </v>

292
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:47.681
<v Speaker 1>trust in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both parties could overcome their </v>

293
00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:50.930
<v Speaker 1>natural hesitancy and mutual fear of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stranger.</v>

294
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.190
<v Speaker 1>It is better to have something than </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

295
00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It's better yet to share generously this</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you have.</v>

296
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.440
<v Speaker 1>It's even better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

297
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.620
<v Speaker 1>to become widely known for generous </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharing.</v>

298
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.490
<v Speaker 1>That's something that lasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that something that's reliable,</v>

299
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.600
<v Speaker 1>and at this point of abstraction we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>observe how the ground work for the </v>

300
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.960
<v Speaker 1>conceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>

301
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:25.020
<v Speaker 1>honest and generous have been laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basis for an articulated morality </v>

302
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.890
<v Speaker 1>has been put in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The productive,</v>

303
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:35.040
<v Speaker 1>truthful sharer is the prototype for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good citizen and the good man we can see</v>

304
00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:42.580
<v Speaker 1>in this manner how from the simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion that leftovers are a good idea,</v>

305
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.800
<v Speaker 1>the highest moral principles might </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>

306
00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:52.620
<v Speaker 1>It's as if something like the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened as humanity developed first </v>

307
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.620
<v Speaker 1>where the endless tens or hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years prior to the </v>

308
00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.521
<v Speaker 1>emergence of written history and drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>

309
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:07.620
<v Speaker 1>the twin practices of delay and exchange</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to emerge slowly and painfully.</v>

310
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Then they become represented in </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical abstraction as rituals and </v>

311
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:20.521
<v Speaker 1>tales of sacrifice told in a manner such</v>
<v Speaker 1>as this.</v>

312
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:26.790
<v Speaker 1>It's as if there's a powerful figure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky who sees all and is judging you,</v>

313
00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:33.160
<v Speaker 1>giving up something you value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to make them happy and you want to</v>

314
00:24:33.161 --> 00:24:36.670
<v Speaker 1>make them happy because all hell breaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>loose if you don't.</v>

315
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:42.510
<v Speaker 1>So practice sacrificing and sharing </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you become an expert at it and </v>

316
00:24:44.561 --> 00:24:45.970
<v Speaker 1>things will go well for you.</v>

317
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.120
<v Speaker 1>No one said any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least not so plainly and directly,</v>

318
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.420
<v Speaker 1>but it was implicit in the practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the stories auction came </v>

319
00:24:58.301 --> 00:25:00.300
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has it had to,</v>

320
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.590
<v Speaker 1>as the animals we once were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could act,</v>

321
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.620
<v Speaker 1>but could not think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Implicit,</v>

322
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.680
<v Speaker 1>unrecognized value came first as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions that proceeded thought embodied </v>

323
00:25:12.041 --> 00:25:15.160
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did not make that value explicit.</v>

324
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:21.630
<v Speaker 1>People watched the success will succeed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the unsuccessful fail for thousands </v>

325
00:25:22.241 --> 00:25:26.260
<v Speaker 1>and thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We thought it over a drew,</v>

326
00:25:26.261 --> 00:25:31.261
<v Speaker 1>a conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The successful among us delay </v>

327
00:25:31.261 --> 00:25:34.540
<v Speaker 1>gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the successful among us bargain with the</v>

328
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:38.680
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great idea begins to emerge.</v>

329
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Taking evermore clearly articulated form</v>
<v Speaker 1>in evermore clearly articulated stories.</v>

330
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.240
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and the unsuccessful?</v>

331
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:55.030
<v Speaker 1>The successful sacrifice things get </v>
<v Speaker 1>better as the successful practice,</v>

332
00:25:55.721 --> 00:26:00.721
<v Speaker 1>their sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questions become increasingly </v>

333
00:26:00.721 --> 00:26:04.711
<v Speaker 1>precise and Cymbalta caneously broader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the greatest possible sacrifice </v>

334
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:12.750
<v Speaker 1>for the greatest possible good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answers become increasingly </v>

335
00:26:13.001 --> 00:26:18.001
<v Speaker 1>deeper and profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The God of western tradition like so </v>

336
00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:23.791
<v Speaker 1>many gods requires sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already examined why,</v>

337
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:30.210
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes he goes even further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He demands not only sacrifice,</v>

338
00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.780
<v Speaker 1>but the sacrifice of precisely what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved best.</v>

339
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:41.200
<v Speaker 1>This is most starkly portrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most confusingly evident in the story of</v>

340
00:26:41.201 --> 00:26:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Abraham and Isaac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham,</v>

341
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.520
<v Speaker 1>beloved of God long wanted to Sun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>God promised them exactly that after </v>

342
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:55.671
<v Speaker 1>many delays and under the apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible conditions of old age and the</v>

343
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 1>long barren wife,</v>

344
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 1>but not so long afterward when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>miraculous we born,</v>

345
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Isaac is still a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God turns around and an unreasonable and</v>

346
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:11.481
<v Speaker 1>apparently barbaric fashion demands that</v>
<v Speaker 1>his faithful servant offer his son as a </v>

347
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story ends happily.</v>

348
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.960
<v Speaker 1>God sends an angel to stay Abraham's </v>
<v Speaker 1>obedient hand and accepts a ram in Isaac</v>

349
00:27:22.301 --> 00:27:25.580
<v Speaker 1>stead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing,</v>

350
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.520
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really address the issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>at hand.</v>

351
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Why is God's going further necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does he?</v>

352
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Why does life impose such demands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll start our analysis with a truism </v>

353
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 1>stark self evident and understated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes things do not go well.</v>

354
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:58.560
<v Speaker 1>That seems to have much to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible nature of the world with its </v>

355
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.730
<v Speaker 1>plagues and famines and tyrannies and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>trails.</v>

356
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:07.090
<v Speaker 1>But here's the rub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when things are not going </v>

357
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the world that's the cause.</v>

358
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.360
<v Speaker 1>The cause is instead that which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently most valued subjectively and </v>

359
00:28:14.441 --> 00:28:17.180
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

360
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Because the world is revealed to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indeterminate degree through the </v>

361
00:28:23.981 --> 00:28:27.800
<v Speaker 1>template of your values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>

362
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.370
<v Speaker 1>if the world you are seeing is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world you want,</v>

363
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
<v Speaker 1>it's time to examine your values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to rid yourself of your </v>

364
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.120
<v Speaker 1>current presuppositions.</v>

365
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:44.570
<v Speaker 1>It's time to let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might even be time to sacrifice what </v>

366
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:49.491
<v Speaker 1>you love best so that you can become who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might become instead of staying who </v>

367
00:28:50.071 --> 00:28:55.071
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an old and possibly apocryphal </v>

368
00:28:55.071 --> 00:28:59.730
<v Speaker 1>story about how to catch a monkey that </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrates this set of ideas very well.</v>

369
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:05.540
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must find a large narrow neck jar </v>

370
00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.470
<v Speaker 1>just barely wide enough in diameter at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top for a monkey to put his hand </v>

371
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:13.911
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you must fill the jar parkway with </v>

372
00:29:13.911 --> 00:29:16.530
<v Speaker 1>rocks so it is too heavy for a monkey to</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry.</v>

373
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Then you must scatter some treats </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive to monkeys near the jar to </v>

374
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.850
<v Speaker 1>attract one and put some more inside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jar.</v>

375
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:30.070
<v Speaker 1>A monkey will come along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach into the narrow opening and grab </v>

376
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:34.690
<v Speaker 1>while the grabbing is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we won't be able to extract his </v>

377
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:38.681
<v Speaker 1>fist now full of treats from the jar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not without unclenching his hand,</v>

378
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 1>not without relinquishing what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>already has,</v>

379
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 1>and that's just what he won't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The monkey capture can then walk over to</v>

380
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:53.851
<v Speaker 1>the jar and pick up the monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animal will not sacrifice the part </v>

381
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:59.550
<v Speaker 1>to preserve the whole something valuable</v>
<v Speaker 1>given up ensures future prosperity,</v>

382
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:07.840
<v Speaker 1>something valuable sacrificed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleases the Lord.</v>

383
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.590
<v Speaker 1>What is most valuable and best </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed,</v>

384
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.420
<v Speaker 1>or what is it least emblematic of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice cut of meat,</v>

385
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.230
<v Speaker 1>the best animal in a flock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our most valued possession.</v>

386
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:29.370
<v Speaker 1>What's above even that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely personal and painful to give </v>

387
00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:35.401
<v Speaker 1>up that symbolized perhaps in God's </v>
<v Speaker 1>insistence on circumcision as part of </v>

388
00:30:36.491 --> 00:30:41.491
<v Speaker 1>Abraham sacrificial routine where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part is offered symbolically to redeem </v>

389
00:30:42.581 --> 00:30:46.400
<v Speaker 1>the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's beyond that?</v>

390
00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.900
<v Speaker 1>What pertains more closely to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>person rather than to the part</v>

391
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:57.490
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes the ultimate sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the gain of the ultimate prize?</v>

392
00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a close race between child and </v>
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>

393
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:07.890
<v Speaker 1>The sacrifice of the mother offering her</v>
<v Speaker 1>child to the world is exemplified </v>

394
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.190
<v Speaker 1>profoundly by Michelangelo's great </v>
<v Speaker 1>sculpture.</v>

395
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:15.250
<v Speaker 1>The Pieta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo Crafted Mary cradling the </v>

396
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.400
<v Speaker 1>nearly naked body of her adult son </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucified and ruined.</v>

397
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
<v Speaker 1>It's her fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was through her that he entered the </v>

398
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.661
<v Speaker 1>world and it's great drama of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it right to bring a baby into this </v>

399
00:31:30.111 --> 00:31:35.111
<v Speaker 1>terrible world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every woman asks herself that question.</v>

400
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Some say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have their reasons.</v>

401
00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Mary answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

402
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily knowing full well what's to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come as do all mothers if they allow </v>

403
00:31:47.031 --> 00:31:52.031
<v Speaker 1>themselves to see it's an act of supreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage when it's undertaken </v>

404
00:31:52.581 --> 00:31:53.540
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily.</v>

405
00:31:55.150 --> 00:32:00.150
<v Speaker 1>In turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary's son Christ offers himself to God </v>

406
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:04.201
<v Speaker 1>and the world to be trail torture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>death to the very point of despair on </v>

407
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:10.471
<v Speaker 1>the cross where he cries out those </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible words from Matthew Twenty </v>

408
00:32:10.571 --> 00:32:12.190
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>46,</v>

409
00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.100
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

410
00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:20.790
<v Speaker 1>why Hast Thou forsaken me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the archetypal story of the man </v>

411
00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.690
<v Speaker 1>who gives his all for the sake of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

412
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Who offers up his life for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancement of being who allows God's </v>

413
00:32:31.301 --> 00:32:36.301
<v Speaker 1>will to become manifest fully within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>confines of a single mortal life?</v>

414
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:43.620
<v Speaker 1>That is the model for the honorable man </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Christ case.</v>

415
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:46.730
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he sacrifices himself,</v>

416
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.370
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father is similar,</v>

417
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:54.910
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing his son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is for this reason that the Christian</v>

418
00:32:55.231 --> 00:33:00.231
<v Speaker 1>sacrificial drama of Sun and self is </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal story at the limit where </v>

419
00:33:02.801 --> 00:33:06.890
<v Speaker 1>nothing more extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing greater can be imagined.</v>

420
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:12.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the very definition of archetypal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the core of what constitutes </v>

421
00:33:13.801 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 1>a religious pain and suffering.</v>

422
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Define the world of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There can be no doubt.</v>

423
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifice can hold pain and suffering in</v>
<v Speaker 1>abeyance to a greater or lesser degree </v>

424
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.520
<v Speaker 1>and greater sacrifices can do that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively than lesser of that.</v>

425
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.340
<v Speaker 1>There can be no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone holds this knowledge in their </v>

426
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.670
<v Speaker 1>souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>

427
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.190
<v Speaker 1>the person who wishes to alleviate </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

428
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.640
<v Speaker 1>who wishes to rectify the flaws and Ba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to bring about the best of all</v>

429
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:53.840
<v Speaker 1>possible futures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to create heaven on earth will</v>

430
00:33:53.841 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 1>make the greatest of sacrifices of self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of child,</v>

431
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.800
<v Speaker 1>of everything that is loved to live a </v>
<v Speaker 1>life aimed at the good he will forego </v>

432
00:34:03.801 --> 00:34:08.801
<v Speaker 1>expediency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will pursue the path of ultimate </v>

433
00:34:08.801 --> 00:34:12.731
<v Speaker 1>meaning and he will in that manner bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>salvation to the ever desperate world.</v>

434
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Part four from my blog on the Ark of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>covenant,</v>

435
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.520
<v Speaker 1>the Cathedral and the Cross Easter </v>
<v Speaker 1>message,</v>

436
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:30.521
<v Speaker 1>one abridged from wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ark of the covenant was elicited.</v>

437
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Gold leafed wouldn't chest containing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two stone tablets of the Ten </v>

438
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:42.991
<v Speaker 1>Commandments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to various texts within the </v>

439
00:34:42.991 --> 00:34:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Hebrew Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also contained Aaron's Rod and a part</v>

440
00:34:46.171 --> 00:34:51.171
<v Speaker 1>of Manna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God was said to have spoken with Moses </v>

441
00:34:51.171 --> 00:34:53.770
<v Speaker 1>from between the two Cherubim on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arcs cover,</v>

442
00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.520
<v Speaker 1>the biblical account states that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arch was created a year after the </v>

443
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Israelite exodus from Egypt according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pattern given to Moses by God at the </v>

444
00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:09.200
<v Speaker 1>foot of Mount Sinai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thereafter,</v>

445
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.320
<v Speaker 1>the gold plated acacia chest was carried</v>
<v Speaker 1>by it staves while en route by the Levi.</v>

446
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It's in advance of the people went on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the march towards the promised land or </v>

447
00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:24.290
<v Speaker 1>at the head of the Israelite army in </v>
<v Speaker 1>transport.</v>

448
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:29.270
<v Speaker 1>The arc was concealed under a large veil</v>
<v Speaker 1>made of skins and blue cloth,</v>

449
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.840
<v Speaker 1>carefully hidden even from the eyes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the priests and the Levi who carried it </v>

450
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.220
<v Speaker 1>when at rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a portable building,</v>

451
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.260
<v Speaker 1>the tabernacle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning residents or dwelling place was </v>

452
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:46.281
<v Speaker 1>set up to how's the arc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was built of woven layers of curtains</v>

453
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:51.530
<v Speaker 1>along with 48 boards clad with polished </v>
<v Speaker 1>gold standing like vertical blinds.</v>

454
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem superseded</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as the dwelling place of God.</v>

455
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Some 300 years later commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a bridge between the </v>

456
00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:10.851
<v Speaker 1>finite and the infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a place where the </v>

457
00:36:10.851 --> 00:36:15.141
<v Speaker 1>ephemeral meets the eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a bridge between the </v>

458
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:20.541
<v Speaker 1>knowable and the unknowable and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be bedrock at the foundation.</v>

459
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.950
<v Speaker 1>The arc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the portal to God,</v>

460
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:32.160
<v Speaker 1>is to be carried on the shoulders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who are holding it is not to be </v>

461
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.560
<v Speaker 1>touched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To touch the ark is to risk death.</v>

462
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:40.910
<v Speaker 1>There are holy things that cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 1>touched except at mortal risk.</v>

463
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Those things that cannot be touched or </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the very foundation of the community,</v>

464
00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.430
<v Speaker 1>the art must be placed at the center of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the temple.</v>

465
00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:56.230
<v Speaker 1>The temple must be placed at the center </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the community.</v>

466
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:02.030
<v Speaker 1>The community must be arranged around </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is untouchable and unshakeable.</v>

467
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:06.950
<v Speaker 1>The untouchable and unshakeable is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is axiomatic.</v>

468
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.560
<v Speaker 1>The people following the arc have </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined to journey together toward </v>

469
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.251
<v Speaker 1>the eternal promised land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The city arranged properly around the </v>

470
00:37:18.711 --> 00:37:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Ark of the covenant is eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem,</v>

471
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.570
<v Speaker 1>something must be axiomatic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

472
00:37:26.571 --> 00:37:31.571
<v Speaker 1>Shakes and falls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The axiomatic to not be expressed fully </v>

473
00:37:31.731 --> 00:37:35.390
<v Speaker 1>in words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead the axiomatic,</v>

474
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.480
<v Speaker 1>untouchable and unshakeable is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes communication in words possible.</v>

475
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.410
<v Speaker 1>The axiomatic is a spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a process,</v>

476
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.620
<v Speaker 1>a living force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its manifestations.</v>

477
00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:50.210
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our concrete,</v>

478
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.260
<v Speaker 1>that is the transformation of the spirit</v>
<v Speaker 1>into matter.</v>

479
00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.490
<v Speaker 1>That is the generation of the tablets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

480
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:05.550
<v Speaker 1>The Ark of the covenant contains the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules that are derived in the first </v>

481
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.820
<v Speaker 1>order from the axiomatic principle.</v>

482
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:12.250
<v Speaker 1>That principle is the spirit that made </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules manifest.</v>

483
00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.660
<v Speaker 1>That spirit is the ultimate inhabitant </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the arch and the rules,</v>

484
00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.550
<v Speaker 1>the result of its action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That spirit is the creative logos,</v>

485
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:27.390
<v Speaker 1>the Ark of the covenant and the Temple </v>
<v Speaker 1>are replaced by the Cathedral at the </v>

486
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:32.101
<v Speaker 1>center of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cathedral is the cross in </v>

487
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:36.211
<v Speaker 1>architectural form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Cross is where the transformation </v>

488
00:38:36.211 --> 00:38:40.290
<v Speaker 1>takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The transformation is the incorporation </v>

489
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:44.131
<v Speaker 1>of the body of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That incorporation is a dramatic ritual,</v>

490
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:49.090
<v Speaker 1>is the embodiment of the decision not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in Christ,</v>

491
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but to act him out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to believe in a much deeper </v>

492
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:58.501
<v Speaker 1>manner than to merely believe Christ is </v>
<v Speaker 1>he who transcends death.</v>

493
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.920
<v Speaker 1>By voluntarily accepting death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ is he who rejects the kingdoms of</v>

494
00:39:05.741 --> 00:39:08.290
<v Speaker 1>this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the Kingdom of God.</v>

495
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Christ is he who speaks the truth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>creates the habitable order that is </v>

496
00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:18.601
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the chaos of potential that exists </v>

497
00:39:18.601 --> 00:39:22.410
<v Speaker 1>prior to the materialization of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ is he who wields potential as the</v>

498
00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:29.440
<v Speaker 1>sword that cleaves death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ is he who's radical,</v>

499
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:33.670
<v Speaker 1>acceptance of the conditions of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defeats the hatred,</v>

500
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:38.730
<v Speaker 1>bitterness and vengefulness that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and malevolence that taints </v>

501
00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 1>being otherwise produces</v>

502
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.880
<v Speaker 1>without the acceptance of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitterness,</v>

503
00:39:44.881 --> 00:39:47.210
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hell triumphs.</v>

504
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Christ is the potential of men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

505
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:56.850
<v Speaker 1>It is said that men and women alike are </v>
<v Speaker 1>made in the image of God and that God is</v>

506
00:39:56.851 --> 00:40:01.851
<v Speaker 1>he who uses the eternal logos to </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate habitable order from the chaos </v>

507
00:40:01.851 --> 00:40:04.680
<v Speaker 1>of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the axiom.</v>

508
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.830
<v Speaker 1>This is the diamond at the center of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

509
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:11.430
<v Speaker 1>This is the spirit in the arch that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>untouchable.</v>

510
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:17.300
<v Speaker 1>This is the bedrock of the culture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings peace and prosperity and that </v>

511
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.250
<v Speaker 1>respects the dignity of man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the great truth.</v>

512
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:26.120
<v Speaker 1>This is the responsibility who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance allows each of us to live </v>

513
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.890
<v Speaker 1>despite the catastrophic fragility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our limited being.</v>

514
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Our likeness to God gives each of us a </v>
<v Speaker 1>value that transcends the finite </v>

515
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:40.650
<v Speaker 1>individual and society of like are </v>
<v Speaker 1>charged with the ethical demand to </v>

516
00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:44.451
<v Speaker 1>respect that value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not only the presumption that </v>

517
00:40:44.451 --> 00:40:48.411
<v Speaker 1>grounds the idea of the rights of man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the presumption that lays upon </v>

518
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:53.570
<v Speaker 1>each of us the ultimate responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the inevitable corollary of </v>

519
00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:58.050
<v Speaker 1>those rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Face the chaos of the future.</v>

520
00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Employ the logos of which you are a part</v>
<v Speaker 1>to transform that chaos into habitable </v>

521
00:41:04.801 --> 00:41:08.310
<v Speaker 1>order that is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speak the truth,</v>

522
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.990
<v Speaker 1>embodied the truth</v>

523
00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:16.240
<v Speaker 1>except impossibly the limitations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make being possible dispense in that </v>

524
00:41:17.811 --> 00:41:20.210
<v Speaker 1>manner with resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred,</v>

525
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and the desire for infinite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbounded vengeance and all the cruelty </v>

526
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:29.651
<v Speaker 1>and evil that accompanies it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pick up the cross of your tragedy and </v>

527
00:41:29.781 --> 00:41:32.090
<v Speaker 1>betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it's terrible.</v>

528
00:41:32.091 --> 00:41:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoisted</v>

529
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:39.130
<v Speaker 3>onto your shoulders and struggle </v>
<v Speaker 3>impossibly upward toward the Kingdom of </v>

530
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:44.770
<v Speaker 3>God on the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The alternative is death and hell.</v>

531
00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:50.850
<v Speaker 3>Part Five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The psychological meaning of the death </v>

532
00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:54.931
<v Speaker 3>and resurrection of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Easter message to this is a somewhat </v>

533
00:41:56.411 --> 00:42:01.411
<v Speaker 3>extended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an altered version of a commentary that </v>

534
00:42:01.411 --> 00:42:02.350
<v Speaker 3>I wrote for the London Sunday Times </v>
<v Speaker 3>magazine.</v>

535
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.900
<v Speaker 3>In the beginning only the king was </v>
<v Speaker 3>sovereign.</v>

536
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Then the nobles became sovereign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then with the Greeks,</v>

537
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.720
<v Speaker 3>all men became sovereign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then came the Christian revolution,</v>

538
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.230
<v Speaker 3>and every individual male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>

539
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 3>beggar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men,</v>

540
00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:29.380
<v Speaker 3>tax collector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitute and thief became so </v>

541
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.761
<v Speaker 3>impossibly equally sovereign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then our cultural and legal systems </v>

542
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:39.161
<v Speaker 3>wrapped themselves tightly around that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately unlikely narrative of </v>

543
00:42:39.161 --> 00:42:43.061
<v Speaker 3>individual sovereignty and made it their</v>
<v Speaker 3>central unshakable pillar.</v>

544
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Now we all give each other the respect </v>
<v Speaker 3>of individual citizens who are sovereign</v>

545
00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.450
<v Speaker 3>without remembering or noticing that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are assembled,</v>

546
00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:58.070
<v Speaker 3>accepting the proposition that every </v>
<v Speaker 3>single one of us is a divine center of </v>

547
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:02.841
<v Speaker 3>logos at the center of the eternal word </v>
<v Speaker 3>that brings habitable order into being </v>

548
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.440
<v Speaker 3>through the voluntary truthful </v>
<v Speaker 3>confrontation with chaos and the </v>

549
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.041
<v Speaker 3>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if any one of us has not treated in </v>

550
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:14.070
<v Speaker 3>this manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If anyone,</v>

551
00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.770
<v Speaker 3>no matter how powerful reacts to any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

552
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 3>no matter how downtrodden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as if our freewill is illusory or our </v>

553
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.580
<v Speaker 3>role in choosing the outcomes of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>

554
00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:28.590
<v Speaker 3>nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we get offended and angry and </v>

555
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.031
<v Speaker 3>agitated and insulted and rightly so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are spectacularly and miraculously </v>

556
00:43:33.601 --> 00:43:38.601
<v Speaker 3>functional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Western legal systems are predicated on </v>

557
00:43:38.601 --> 00:43:41.661
<v Speaker 3>the acceptance of the intrinsic value of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the individual predicated on the idea </v>

558
00:43:41.671 --> 00:43:46.671
<v Speaker 3>that each person can step forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily accept the burden of being </v>

559
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.740
<v Speaker 3>transformed positively in consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and share the results of that </v>

560
00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.881
<v Speaker 3>transformation with everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is in that manner that each of us </v>

561
00:43:55.881 --> 00:44:00.411
<v Speaker 3>pushes everything away from the abyss </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a bit more heavenward is the </v>

562
00:44:01.231 --> 00:44:05.520
<v Speaker 3>apparent necessity for such insanely </v>
<v Speaker 3>high regard an illusion.</v>

563
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:12.240
<v Speaker 3>It is certain that it is at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>functional and therefore not so </v>

564
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.261
<v Speaker 3>obviously illusory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is also equally certain that we have </v>

565
00:44:16.261 --> 00:44:19.450
<v Speaker 3>not outlined any more viable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>materialistic alternative</v>

566
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.940
<v Speaker 3>you might well ask is the hypothesis of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic human value justified is our </v>

567
00:44:27.391 --> 00:44:32.391
<v Speaker 3>apparent ability to face the as of yet </v>
<v Speaker 3>unmanifest future and decide on the </v>

568
00:44:32.391 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 3>nature of its realization in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>present,</v>

569
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:39.620
<v Speaker 3>genuine and real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it true despite the </v>

570
00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:43.880
<v Speaker 3>incomprehensibility that we are free </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious beings and that our conscious </v>

571
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 3>freedom plays a role in constructing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmos?</v>

572
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.760
<v Speaker 3>It could merely be as the cynics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reductionists hold that consciousness is</v>

573
00:44:52.921 --> 00:44:57.921
<v Speaker 3>an Epi phenomenon of materialistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>processes that there is no free will or </v>

574
00:44:58.141 --> 00:45:03.141
<v Speaker 3>at least none of any genuine import,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is no accompanying moral </v>

575
00:45:03.141 --> 00:45:07.191
<v Speaker 3>responsibility or freely chosen destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are however valid and not so </v>

576
00:45:08.971 --> 00:45:13.971
<v Speaker 3>simply dispensed with reasons to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>too premature and casual acceptance of </v>

577
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:19.431
<v Speaker 3>such conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the greatest of us do not </v>

578
00:45:19.431 --> 00:45:23.031
<v Speaker 3>understand consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a bit much less comprehend the role </v>

579
00:45:23.031 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 3>it plays in being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea currently,</v>

580
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:32.030
<v Speaker 3>seriously no idea how the material </v>
<v Speaker 3>substrate of the brain produces the </v>

581
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:36.561
<v Speaker 3>awareness and more the self awareness </v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems so vital to the existence of </v>

582
00:45:37.231 --> 00:45:38.100
<v Speaker 3>the cosmos.</v>

583
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.510
<v Speaker 3>If there is no center of experience to </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience something,</v>

584
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.080
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it is very difficult to say in what</v>

585
00:45:46.081 --> 00:45:49.380
<v Speaker 3>manner that's something or anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>

586
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Reality requires an observer and as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as we can tell that observer is </v>

587
00:45:55.891 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even more so self consciousness,</v>

588
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:06.080
<v Speaker 3>our awareness or self awareness appears </v>
<v Speaker 3>to confront the unformed potential of </v>

589
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 3>the future and to cast it into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>concrete reality of the present.</v>

590
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Our consciousness acts on possibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the logos of the father acted on </v>

591
00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 3>the pre cosmogony chaos at the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>

592
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:24.620
<v Speaker 3>It is in that manner that we are made in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the image of God and we all demand to be</v>

593
00:46:24.661 --> 00:46:29.661
<v Speaker 3>treated as if that were true and who </v>
<v Speaker 3>would dare to deny that such a demand is</v>

594
00:46:30.061 --> 00:46:33.960
<v Speaker 3>made for valid and perhaps even </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimately valid reasons.</v>

595
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:40.430
<v Speaker 3>Consider the evidence from our actions </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you treat yourself as if you matter</v>

596
00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 3>than you thrive.</v>

597
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:47.690
<v Speaker 3>When you treat those around you as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they are inhabited by a spark of </v>

598
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:50.961
<v Speaker 3>divinity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then your relationships stabilize and </v>

599
00:46:50.961 --> 00:46:54.471
<v Speaker 3>grow simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we produce societies predicated on </v>

600
00:46:55.051 --> 00:47:00.051
<v Speaker 3>the great idea of the inherent value of </v>
<v Speaker 3>each individual from st to criminal than</v>

601
00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:06.501
<v Speaker 3>men become free and productive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of living the meaningful lives </v>

602
00:47:06.501 --> 00:47:11.421
<v Speaker 3>that lended dignity to the tragedy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their limited existences and when we </v>

603
00:47:11.881 --> 00:47:15.210
<v Speaker 3>fail to do so than our society's </v>
<v Speaker 3>degenerate,</v>

604
00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:20.211
<v Speaker 3>into the tyrannical and murderous tribal</v>
<v Speaker 3>structures that seem to exist as the </v>

605
00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:25.371
<v Speaker 3>only certainly manifest alternative is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this not all indicative of the existence</v>

606
00:47:26.221 --> 00:47:31.221
<v Speaker 3>of some profound truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously we are constrained and </v>

607
00:47:31.681 --> 00:47:35.370
<v Speaker 3>severely so by the manner of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporeal being.</v>

608
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:41.020
<v Speaker 3>We're subject to deterministic rules in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a seriously profound manner.</v>

609
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:47.100
<v Speaker 3>We do not have the power to shape things</v>
<v Speaker 3>in any old way whatsoever at any time or</v>

610
00:47:47.471 --> 00:47:52.471
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can certainly and demonstrably </v>

611
00:47:52.471 --> 00:47:55.860
<v Speaker 3>and apparently willfully advance in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction of our imagination and in </v>

612
00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 3>quite a staggering and compelling </v>
<v Speaker 3>manner.</v>

613
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Is this not indicative of who we </v>
<v Speaker 3>genuinely are?</v>

614
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:08.080
<v Speaker 3>Is this not as perhaps the primal </v>
<v Speaker 3>existential truth?</v>

615
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:14.870
<v Speaker 3>We are in danger in the west of </v>
<v Speaker 3>abandoning our culture of leaving our </v>

616
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:18.300
<v Speaker 3>great foundational stories to die on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>altar of our inquisitiveness,</v>

617
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:23.360
<v Speaker 3>cynicism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carelessness of degenerating into </v>

618
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.931
<v Speaker 3>nihilism or returning in a reactionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>manner to an archaic and destructive </v>

619
00:48:26.931 --> 00:48:31.911
<v Speaker 3>tribalism of the right or the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It matters not these twin dread paths </v>

620
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:38.600
<v Speaker 3>will not lead us to where we would want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be if we decided to be conscious and </v>

621
00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:38.700
<v Speaker 3>careful.</v>

622
00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.880
<v Speaker 3>Such abandonment will weaken us fatally </v>
<v Speaker 3>as individuals.</v>

623
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:49.210
<v Speaker 3>It will lay us open to possession by all</v>
<v Speaker 3>manner of demonic conceptual </v>

624
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:53.231
<v Speaker 3>alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will make us vulnerable to our </v>

625
00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:53.300
<v Speaker 3>enemies within and without.</v>

626
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:59.290
<v Speaker 3>It is psychologically true that each of </v>
<v Speaker 3>us should open ourselves up to the </v>

627
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:03.071
<v Speaker 3>tragedy of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is psychologically true that we </v>

628
00:49:03.071 --> 00:49:05.150
<v Speaker 3>should pick up our tragic burdens and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crosses,</v>

629
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.080
<v Speaker 3>die continually and renew our souls </v>
<v Speaker 3>continually.</v>

630
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:13.070
<v Speaker 3>It may be more than psychologically true</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

631
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:16.040
<v Speaker 3>It may be a truth of cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 3>significance.</v>

632
00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:22.060
<v Speaker 3>That is the death and resurrection </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrated by Easter and it is time for </v>

633
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:26.951
<v Speaker 3>us to wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>become conscious and recognize it as </v>

634
00:49:26.951 --> 00:49:28.880
<v Speaker 3>such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not possible to encapsulate within</v>

635
00:49:28.881 --> 00:49:33.881
<v Speaker 3>any finite written account the total </v>
<v Speaker 3>import of the idea of Christ's death and</v>

636
00:49:33.921 --> 00:49:38.921
<v Speaker 3>rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the impossible claim of the bodily </v>

637
00:49:38.921 --> 00:49:42.221
<v Speaker 3>resurrection of one man conjoined with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the notion that this event was both of </v>

638
00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:46.370
<v Speaker 3>world redeeming and cosmic significance </v>
<v Speaker 3>simply cannot be understood once and for</v>

639
00:49:46.371 --> 00:49:49.760
<v Speaker 3>all within any singular frame of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation,</v>

640
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:54.200
<v Speaker 3>even for die hard atheists have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific type.</v>

641
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Think Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A great mystery remains.</v>

642
00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Why has this strange and thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 3>implausible story exercise such immense </v>

643
00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:09.580
<v Speaker 3>impact?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is because each life is a tragedy </v>

644
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:13.330
<v Speaker 3>tainted by malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is because life is suffering as we </v>

645
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:17.141
<v Speaker 3>all are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each of us vulnerable and ignorant made </v>

646
00:50:17.141 --> 00:50:20.360
<v Speaker 3>all too frequently bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resentful and angry because of just that</v>

647
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:24.020
<v Speaker 3>and more than willing to make things </v>
<v Speaker 3>worse in that anger,</v>

648
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 3>but we all admire courage and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>willingness to abide by the truth.</v>

649
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.420
<v Speaker 3>No matter how terrible in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that suffering,</v>

650
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 3>we all recognize in such courage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>

651
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:40.070
<v Speaker 3>at least by our admiration of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an antidote to the catastrophe of life.</v>

652
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:44.030
<v Speaker 3>We all know that in the absence of such </v>
<v Speaker 3>courage and truth,</v>

653
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:48.950
<v Speaker 3>mirror catastrophe degenerates all too </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently into hell.</v>

654
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:54.460
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that acceptance of vulnerability</v>
<v Speaker 3>in ignorance is the precondition for </v>

655
00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:58.631
<v Speaker 3>growth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that confrontation with the </v>

656
00:50:58.631 --> 00:51:02.291
<v Speaker 3>terrible unknown with it's paralyzing </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifestations of tragedy and </v>

657
00:51:02.291 --> 00:51:06.170
<v Speaker 3>malevolence is necessary to catalyze </v>
<v Speaker 3>both wisdom and maturity.</v>

658
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:12.160
<v Speaker 3>Imagine finally that human consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>plays some central and as of yet poorly </v>

659
00:51:12.351 --> 00:51:15.080
<v Speaker 3>understood role in the reality of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmos,</v>

660
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.480
<v Speaker 3>at least as necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Observer.</v>

661
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.400
<v Speaker 3>Imagine all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then ask yourself,</v>

662
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.880
<v Speaker 3>what is the absolute hypothetical limit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of human attainment with vulnerability </v>

663
00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:30.650
<v Speaker 3>and ignorance are fully and completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>accepted.</v>

664
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:34.880
<v Speaker 3>When the unknown is squarely confronted </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when consciousness is given,</v>

665
00:51:34.881 --> 00:51:37.640
<v Speaker 3>it's due as the very center of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

666
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:41.180
<v Speaker 3>That's Christ's acceptance of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crucifix.</v>

667
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:46.870
<v Speaker 3>That's his willingness to be betrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>subject to the evil of his closest </v>

668
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:50.570
<v Speaker 3>companions and the state and his embrace</v>
<v Speaker 3>of brokenness and death.</v>

669
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:56.650
<v Speaker 3>It is pure truth that even a small </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving of humility and courage in </v>

670
00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:57.530
<v Speaker 3>genders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resilience,</v>

671
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 3>progress and growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is pure truth.</v>

672
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:06.100
<v Speaker 3>That resentful rejection of the price of</v>
<v Speaker 3>finite being multiplies suffering </v>

673
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.450
<v Speaker 3>endlessly and unnecessarily.</v>

674
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:14.110
<v Speaker 3>What is the ultimate expression of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>truths taken to their final conclusion?</v>

675
00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Who is to say who we are and what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be capable of achieving if we </v>

676
00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:22.180
<v Speaker 3>develop the courage to accept our </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible fates,</v>

677
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:27.270
<v Speaker 3>live in truth and stumble uphill?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the question posed by </v>

678
00:52:27.731 --> 00:52:32.731
<v Speaker 3>Christianity and its very essence would </v>
<v Speaker 3>you put everything you have and </v>

679
00:52:32.731 --> 00:52:37.381
<v Speaker 3>everything you are on the line so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could learn to conduct yourself in </v>

680
00:52:37.381 --> 00:52:41.521
<v Speaker 3>the best possible manner?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you be willing to allow who you </v>

681
00:52:41.521 --> 00:52:45.931
<v Speaker 3>might be to continually and painfully </v>
<v Speaker 3>triumph over who you currently are in </v>

682
00:52:47.441 --> 00:52:52.441
<v Speaker 3>the most ancient religious language?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you sacrifice what you love most </v>

683
00:52:52.541 --> 00:52:57.541
<v Speaker 3>to God to find out who and what you are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are in the final analysis,</v>

684
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:05.110
<v Speaker 3>neither structured nor chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each of us is instead best understood as</v>

685
00:53:05.111 --> 00:53:08.650
<v Speaker 3>a process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a living dynamic process,</v>

686
00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:11.740
<v Speaker 3>as the very process by which what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

687
00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:16.630
<v Speaker 3>what we know so insufficiently is </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformed into what could yet be.</v>

688
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:20.950
<v Speaker 3>That is the process by which our </v>
<v Speaker 3>continued forward.</v>

689
00:53:20.951 --> 00:53:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Movement through life is constantly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitably dependent.</v>

690
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 3>To understand that and to welcome it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is voluntary.</v>

691
00:53:30.331 --> 00:53:35.331
<v Speaker 3>Acceptance of the necessity of eternal </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation as an alternative to </v>

692
00:53:35.401 --> 00:53:40.401
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic despair or desperate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fatal identification with the state.</v>

693
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.930
<v Speaker 3>This is the idea enacted during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ceremony of the Christian Eucharist.</v>

694
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Incorporation of the body of Christ is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the symbolic transformation of the </v>

695
00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:54.510
<v Speaker 3>participant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not into a believer of a set of fact,</v>

696
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 3>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>though those facts may appear,</v>

697
00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:02.030
<v Speaker 3>but into the act of imitator of Christ </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the person willing to undergo </v>

698
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 3>whatever death is necessary to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the next and better state of being</v>

699
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:11.780
<v Speaker 3>into the person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to embrace his or her </v>

700
00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.360
<v Speaker 3>confrontation with the tragedy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence of life.</v>

701
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:17.630
<v Speaker 3>To learn from that process of embrace </v>
<v Speaker 3>and to move one step closer in </v>

702
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:21.450
<v Speaker 3>consequence to the eternally receding </v>
<v Speaker 3>city of God.</v>

703
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:27.200
<v Speaker 3>The idea of the dying and resurrected </v>
<v Speaker 3>God is one of the oldest ideas of </v>

704
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.951
<v Speaker 3>mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>widespread and exceptionally variant in </v>

705
00:54:30.951 --> 00:54:34.191
<v Speaker 3>its forms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It forms part of the set of </v>

706
00:54:34.191 --> 00:54:37.071
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions that underlie the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient shamonic rituals carried over </v>

707
00:54:37.071 --> 00:54:41.900
<v Speaker 3>perhaps from the stone age itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is echoed in the foundational stories</v>

708
00:54:42.241 --> 00:54:45.390
<v Speaker 3>of ancient Mesopotamia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Egypt and Greece.</v>

709
00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:50.100
<v Speaker 3>It manifests itself in allegorical forms</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the figure of the Phoenix,</v>

710
00:54:50.101 --> 00:54:52.410
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which emulates itself,</v>

711
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:57.330
<v Speaker 3>regains its youthful form and rises in </v>
<v Speaker 3>triumph from the ashes.</v>

712
00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 3>It recurs repeatedly in the tropes of </v>
<v Speaker 3>popular culture as well,</v>

713
00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:07.020
<v Speaker 3>bringing even those entirely devoid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious education under the spell,</v>

714
00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Marvel's iconic ironman plummets like </v>
<v Speaker 3>icarus from sky to ground.</v>

715
00:55:12.361 --> 00:55:17.361
<v Speaker 3>After saving the world from demonic </v>
<v Speaker 3>serpentine other world forces and then </v>

716
00:55:17.491 --> 00:55:20.580
<v Speaker 3>arises from his death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the child wizard,</v>

717
00:55:20.581 --> 00:55:25.170
<v Speaker 3>Harry Potter must ultimately die and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>reborn to defeat voldemort,</v>

718
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.630
<v Speaker 3>a very thinly disguised Satan.</v>

719
00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:33.650
<v Speaker 3>All of that creative variation on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>theme speaks of a deep ineradicable and </v>

720
00:55:34.651 --> 00:55:37.920
<v Speaker 3>eternally re-emergent psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

721
00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:44.070
<v Speaker 3>We all see this in our day to day lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we all know it because we see it.</v>

722
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 3>A small failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a small disappointment,</v>

723
00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:50.460
<v Speaker 3>frustration or disenchantment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>genders within us,</v>

724
00:55:50.461 --> 00:55:54.060
<v Speaker 3>a small death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a small descent into the underworld,</v>

725
00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:59.350
<v Speaker 3>a small requirement for rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A large failure produces a </v>

726
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 3>proportionately large catastrophe and </v>
<v Speaker 3>transformation.</v>

727
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 3>When you are compelled to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone because you faced divorce or the</v>

728
00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:12.360
<v Speaker 3>failure of a treasured ambition or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>illness or death of someone close,</v>

729
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:17.070
<v Speaker 3>you are walking yourself through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eternal narrative stability,</v>

730
00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:19.140
<v Speaker 3>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>

731
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:21.840
<v Speaker 3>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebirth.</v>

732
00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:24.520
<v Speaker 3>That's the story of our lives.</v>

733
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:28.030
<v Speaker 3>That's the fall and the reestablishment </v>
<v Speaker 3>of paradise.</v>

734
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:34.140
<v Speaker 3>The idea that the savior is the figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>who dies and resurrect is a </v>

735
00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:38.251
<v Speaker 3>representation in dramatic or narrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of the brute fact that </v>

736
00:56:38.251 --> 00:56:43.111
<v Speaker 3>psychological progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>indeed learning itself requires </v>

737
00:56:43.111 --> 00:56:46.450
<v Speaker 3>continual death and rebirth of lesser </v>
<v Speaker 3>and greater magnitude.</v>

738
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:52.500
<v Speaker 3>If you are engaged in this serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpersonal conflict or argument or </v>

739
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:56.491
<v Speaker 3>facing a true crisis in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new information confronting you </v>

740
00:56:56.491 --> 00:57:00.571
<v Speaker 3>cannot be incorporated without the old </v>
<v Speaker 3>so painful demise of your previous </v>

741
00:57:00.761 --> 00:57:05.761
<v Speaker 3>conceptions and all of the resistance </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehension of that pain necessarily </v>

742
00:57:06.431 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 3>entails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part and parcel of the process so</v>

743
00:57:10.601 --> 00:57:15.340
<v Speaker 3>famously described as assimilation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>accommodation by the great developmental</v>

744
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:20.170
<v Speaker 3>psychologists jumped piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we each confront the world with a set of</v>

745
00:57:20.171 --> 00:57:25.171
<v Speaker 3>preconceptual patients whose function is</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cymbalta obviously to delimit and render</v>

746
00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:29.020
<v Speaker 3>pragmatic are very perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts,</v>

747
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.400
<v Speaker 3>and actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the absence of this eight priority,</v>

748
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:38.580
<v Speaker 3>we simply cannot function nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is still insufficient.</v>

749
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:44.050
<v Speaker 3>No one ever knows enough and what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>each do not yet know will at some moment</v>

750
00:57:44.051 --> 00:57:49.051
<v Speaker 3>of crisis become a vital importance when</v>
<v Speaker 3>something new and like confronts us and </v>

751
00:57:49.841 --> 00:57:54.841
<v Speaker 3>shakes us to our core.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is old and anachronistic within </v>

752
00:57:54.841 --> 00:57:58.711
<v Speaker 3>must therefore emulate itself and die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is very rare indeed to learn </v>

753
00:57:59.021 --> 00:58:04.021
<v Speaker 3>something profound without suffering the</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible pain of dashed dreams and the </v>

754
00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:07.090
<v Speaker 3>soul shaking terror of uncertainty and </v>
<v Speaker 3>doubt.</v>

755
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:14.190
<v Speaker 3>This means that none of us should </v>
<v Speaker 3>identify in the most fundamental sense </v>

756
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:17.110
<v Speaker 3>with what we currently know and presume </v>
<v Speaker 3>means as well,</v>

757
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:22.200
<v Speaker 3>that we should all come to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>that so that we do not remain confused </v>

758
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:26.191
<v Speaker 3>about who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This means that it is never sufficient </v>

759
00:58:26.191 --> 00:58:30.301
<v Speaker 3>to be conservative or to identify with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the past or to become ideologically or </v>

760
00:58:30.301 --> 00:58:34.960
<v Speaker 3>dogmatically committed or to remain </v>
<v Speaker 3>stubbornly anachronistic and unchanged.</v>

761
00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:40.180
<v Speaker 3>The environment transforms headlong </v>
<v Speaker 3>around us and we all must run as fast as</v>

762
00:58:40.181 --> 00:58:45.181
<v Speaker 3>we can as Ellis as red queen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well new just to stay in the same place.</v>

763
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:51.780
<v Speaker 3>It is not sufficient either to abandon </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition and structure entirely in a </v>

764
00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:56.341
<v Speaker 3>headlong and irresponsible rush towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>the anomalous and revolutionary </v>

765
00:58:57.010 --> 00:59:02.010
<v Speaker 3>structure is insufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is still necessary and the </v>

766
00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:05.671
<v Speaker 3>ethical requirement for respecting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintaining it is still a paramount </v>

767
00:59:05.671 --> 00:59:07.720
<v Speaker 3>import.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We each must as well.</v>

768
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid falling prey to the temptation of </v>

769
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.810
<v Speaker 3>identifying with the chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressing,</v>

770
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:18.990
<v Speaker 3>anxiety ridden and nihilism inducing </v>
<v Speaker 3>state of affairs in gendered by the </v>

771
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:21.890
<v Speaker 3>terrible confrontation with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>genuinely unknown,</v>

772
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.820
<v Speaker 3>even when thrust into the underworld by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dread events of our life,</v>

773
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:30.940
<v Speaker 3>we must not characterize ourselves as </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanent inhabitants of that dark and </v>

774
00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 3>dread place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lest we lose hope,</v>

775
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 3>despair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and seek revenge to progress.</v>

776
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must let go sacrifice time and again</v>

777
00:59:42.351 --> 00:59:46.220
<v Speaker 3>in the face of success of obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must abandon those things.</v>

778
00:59:46.221 --> 00:59:50.420
<v Speaker 3>That and often those people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>impeding your progress,</v>

779
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:55.570
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact that you may have held </v>
<v Speaker 3>them very close to your heart when </v>

780
00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've missed the mark,</v>

781
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.110
<v Speaker 3>when you've sinned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that is the meaning of sin.</v>

782
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:04.160
<v Speaker 3>You must let the part of you that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong and aiming improperly die.</v>

783
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:09.910
<v Speaker 3>Then you must allow the new spirit </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifesting itself within two spring to </v>

784
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that new spirit,</v>

785
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:17.470
<v Speaker 3>that's the terrible information </v>
<v Speaker 3>contained in whatever error you </v>

786
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:21.761
<v Speaker 3>committed in living conjunction with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>now transformed structures you </v>

787
01:00:21.761 --> 01:00:26.210
<v Speaker 3>originally employed to frame the </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation that new spirit,</v>

788
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.690
<v Speaker 3>it's a manifestation as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in other words,</v>

789
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.840
<v Speaker 3>have the potential within you that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>not yet been called forth by the </v>

790
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.290
<v Speaker 3>previous travails of your life.</v>

791
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:43.180
<v Speaker 3>Christ is symbolically the way and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth of life and no one comes to the </v>

792
01:00:43.911 --> 01:00:48.911
<v Speaker 3>father except through him embracing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>process of voluntary death and rebirth </v>

793
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.580
<v Speaker 3>that is identical with psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>development means determining to move </v>

794
01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.990
<v Speaker 3>forward and upward despite the horrors </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>

795
01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:00.590
<v Speaker 3>It means as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolically speaking,</v>

796
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:05.770
<v Speaker 3>rejuvenating the dead father or rescuing</v>
<v Speaker 3>him from stagnation and deterioration in</v>

797
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:11.240
<v Speaker 3>the eternal underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forthright individual confrontation with</v>

798
01:01:11.241 --> 01:01:13.670
<v Speaker 3>the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>renews the Individual,</v>

799
01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:16.970
<v Speaker 3>but also catalyze this cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>revitalization.</v>

800
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:22.900
<v Speaker 3>This is the essence of Christian ritual </v>
<v Speaker 3>and belief articulated as a </v>

801
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.191
<v Speaker 3>psychological principle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We must identify with that part of </v>

802
01:01:27.191 --> 01:01:31.241
<v Speaker 3>ourselves that is always stretching </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond what we currently know and has </v>

803
01:01:31.241 --> 01:01:35.321
<v Speaker 3>the faith to let go of old certainties </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that new patterns of being can be </v>

804
01:01:35.321 --> 01:01:35.900
<v Speaker 3>brought into place.</v>

805
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:41.450
<v Speaker 3>It is through identification with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>process symbolized by Easter,</v>

806
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.410
<v Speaker 3>that we are each redeemed and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture revivified and salvaged.</v>

807
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:48.890
<v Speaker 3>We are all the slaves of Pharisees and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers,</v>

808
01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:53.150
<v Speaker 3>have those who place dogma above spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the cost of spirit.</v>

809
01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.360
<v Speaker 3>We're all subject to be trail by </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves and by all those who surround </v>

810
01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:02.891
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all facing extinction in the most </v>

811
01:02:02.891 --> 01:02:06.011
<v Speaker 3>torturous of manners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is a spirit within us with </v>

812
01:02:06.011 --> 01:02:10.241
<v Speaker 3>sufficient courage to confront the true </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrors of existence forthrightly to </v>

813
01:02:10.341 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 3>allow the transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even death that's such confrontation.</v>

814
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Catalyze this to occur and to leap </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward,</v>

815
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.320
<v Speaker 3>renewed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is it that life might prevail in the</v>

816
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:27.321
<v Speaker 3>face of death and hell with arms open </v>
<v Speaker 3>embracing its fate.</v>

817
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.770
<v Speaker 3>We are all fallen creatures and we all </v>
<v Speaker 3>know it.</v>

818
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:37.210
<v Speaker 3>We are all separated from what should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>and thrown into the world of death and </v>

819
01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 3>despair.</v>

820
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:40.380
<v Speaker 3>We're all brutally crucified on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cross.</v>

821
01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:45.381
<v Speaker 3>That is the reality of life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To rebel against that fate merely </v>

822
01:02:45.381 --> 01:02:50.271
<v Speaker 3>worsens it transforming what could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>mirrored tragedy into something </v>

823
01:02:50.271 --> 01:02:54.411
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from hell to argue </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitterly and despair around the deathbed</v>

824
01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.680
<v Speaker 3>of a loved one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To take a single example is to turn all </v>

825
01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.250
<v Speaker 3>the pain of death and loss into </v>
<v Speaker 3>something far worse.</v>

826
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:07.910
<v Speaker 3>To accept instead is that simultaneously</v>
<v Speaker 3>to transcend it?</v>

827
01:03:08.591 --> 01:03:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Certainly courage and truth and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 3>even love,</v>

828
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 3>and these three forces are something to </v>
<v Speaker 3>behold.</v>

829
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Are they more powerful than despair and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the desire for vengeance?</v>

830
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.800
<v Speaker 3>That is the Christian suggestion and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian command to act out the </v>

831
01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:30.291
<v Speaker 3>proposition that courage and truth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>love are more powerful than death and </v>

832
01:03:30.291 --> 01:03:33.390
<v Speaker 3>despair and to accept what transpires as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a consequence.</v>

833
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.620
<v Speaker 3>That is Easter and the death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>resurrection of Christ.</v>

834
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:43.290
<v Speaker 3>We forget or remain blind to such things</v>
<v Speaker 3>at our great peril.</v>
