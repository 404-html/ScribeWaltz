1
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to launch right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like this story as well.</v>

2
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>This is the story of Noah and the flood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the tower of Babel,</v>

3
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>which I think are juxtaposed very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly.</v>

4
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>The Tower of Babel is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories like cain enabled.</v>

5
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:33.860
<v Speaker 1>It's only a few lines long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fragment in some sense,</v>

6
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>although the story of noise quite a well</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed narrative,</v>

7
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the other stories that we've </v>

8
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.581
<v Speaker 1>covered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is relevant at multiple levels of </v>

9
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:49.901
<v Speaker 1>analysis simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm going to do to begin </v>

10
00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>with is to start with some background </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

11
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:58.721
<v Speaker 1>so some psychological background </v>
<v Speaker 1>information so that the story makes </v>

12
00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing that I'd like to,</v>

13
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to make a case for is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>you bringing to bear on the world and a </v>

14
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:13.691
<v Speaker 1>priority of perceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really an embodied structure </v>

15
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:18.311
<v Speaker 1>and it's a consequence of the three and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a half billion years that you've spent </v>

16
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>putting your body together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a tremendous amount of time and</v>

17
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>not only your body but your mind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

18
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>because your mind is part of your body.</v>

19
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>And very much embedded within it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

21
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think that you have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain in your head and it's sort of </v>

22
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>floating separate from the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

23
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:39.071
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're tremendous massive system of </v>

24
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.100
<v Speaker 1>neurons running through your entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

25
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 1>autonomic neurons in the autonomic </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system than there are on the </v>

26
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 1>central nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lot of neurons.</v>

27
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>And then your central nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

28
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:56.891
<v Speaker 1>enables you to exercise voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over your musculature and also </v>

29
00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:59.810
<v Speaker 1>to receive information from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is really distributed through</v>

30
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:04.811
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you may not know is </v>

31
00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:05.920
<v Speaker 1>that people who are paraplegic can walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

32
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:10.921
<v Speaker 1>if you suspend them above a treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their legs will walk by themselves with </v>

33
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:14.381
<v Speaker 1>no voluntary control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your spine is capable of quite </v>

34
00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>complex activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

35
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:17.240
<v Speaker 1>when you walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly it's a controlled fall and mostly</v>

36
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>your spine is doing it.</v>

37
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

38
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Speaker 1>the point of all that is that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a blank slate consciousness that's </v>

39
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:33.011
<v Speaker 1>interpreting a world that manifests </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself as segregated objects in some </v>

40
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 1>straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since you have a built in interpretive </v>

41
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.131
<v Speaker 1>system that's extraordinarily deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded and invisible because you might</v>

42
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 1>think about it as the implicit structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your unconscious.</v>

43
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.540
<v Speaker 1>It's what it's what gives rise to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious experience and and it presents</v>

44
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:55.541
<v Speaker 1>you with the world that that's one way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about attending a good way </v>

45
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:56.270
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalytic way of thinking about</v>

46
00:02:56.271 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>it as well as the neuroscientific way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking</v>

47
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>about it because one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty interesting about modern </v>

48
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>neuroscientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the top rate ones,</v>

49
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>and those are usually the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on emotions.</v>

50
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:11.881
<v Speaker 2>As far as I've been able to tell our are</v>
<v Speaker 2>often quite enamored of the </v>

51
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:17.491
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalyst Jaak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Panksepp was a good example of that </v>

52
00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:20.311
<v Speaker 2>because they came to understand that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysts insistence on underlying </v>

53
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:27.061
<v Speaker 2>unconscious personified motivations was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually an accurate reflection of how </v>

54
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:31.381
<v Speaker 2>the brain worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to think of yourself as a loose </v>

55
00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:34.171
<v Speaker 2>collection of autonomous spirits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's governed by some overarching </v>

56
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.690
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is is is a reasonable way of thinking </v>

57
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

58
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:45.361
<v Speaker 2>or a question that arises from that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the nature of this a priority </v>

59
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:50.340
<v Speaker 2>structure that you use to interpret the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and I think the clearest answer to</v>

60
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:57.211
<v Speaker 2>that is that it's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you live inside the story and </v>

61
00:03:57.211 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting to me because I believe</v>

62
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of videos that laid this</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

63
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I believe that Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions,</v>

64
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.030
<v Speaker 2>or at least as fundamental as Newtonian </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions.</v>

65
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I actually think they're more </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental and that the fact that we've</v>

66
00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:23.621
<v Speaker 2>evolved story like structures through </v>
<v Speaker 2>which to interpret the world indicates </v>

67
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:28.961
<v Speaker 2>to me that there's something deeply true</v>
<v Speaker 2>about story like structures where their </v>

68
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:33.731
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in so far as the fact that </v>

69
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.230
<v Speaker 2>we've developed them means that here we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are living and that it's taken three and</v>

70
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:38.060
<v Speaker 2>a half billion years to develop them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

71
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 2>they're highly functional and so we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have much better definition of </v>

72
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.950
<v Speaker 2>truth and highly functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that that's about as good as it</v>

73
00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:50.951
<v Speaker 2>gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly because we're limited creatures </v>

74
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.861
<v Speaker 2>and we don't have omniscience knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the best we can do with our </v>

75
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:54.290
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

76
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:57.710
<v Speaker 2>is to note its functionality and improve</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

77
00:04:57.711 --> 00:05:02.711
<v Speaker 2>When it fails to work properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the scientific method actually </v>

78
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:06.251
<v Speaker 2>does that and so the fact that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved a story like structure through </v>

79
00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 2>which to interpret the world.</v>

80
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty damn interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says something fundamental about </v>

81
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.701
<v Speaker 2>stories and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's strange in the same way that the </v>

82
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.181
<v Speaker 2>fact that we have hemispheric </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialization for the known and the </v>

83
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:22.751
<v Speaker 2>unknown or for chaos and order order and</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos or respectively also says </v>

84
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:25.670
<v Speaker 2>something fundamental about the nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>

85
00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:30.671
<v Speaker 2>If you assume that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've evolved to reflect the structure </v>

86
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:34.271
<v Speaker 2>of the world broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's obviously not just the </v>

87
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:36.170
<v Speaker 2>physical structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the atoms and the molecules,</v>

88
00:05:36.171 --> 00:05:41.171
<v Speaker 2>but all of the pattern manifestations of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the physical molecules as they build </v>

89
00:05:41.271 --> 00:05:44.240
<v Speaker 2>structures of increasing complexity </v>
<v Speaker 2>across time.</v>

90
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.840
<v Speaker 2>That would include human interactions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of and political interactions,</v>

91
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.450
<v Speaker 2>economic act interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>familiar interactions.</v>

92
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.890
<v Speaker 2>All of those things that are a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important part of our reality,</v>

93
00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps in some sense not as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental,</v>

94
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 2>the physical attributes that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physicists concentrate on.</v>

95
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.370
<v Speaker 2>So we live in stories and so I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to you a little bit about stories </v>

96
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:12.431
<v Speaker 2>and about their structure because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand a little bit about the </v>

97
00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 2>structure of stories than a whole array </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things about mythology,</v>

98
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:20.921
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden make overwhelming sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so useful because what you see </v>

99
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:25.991
<v Speaker 2>is that many of the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard occurrences in your life,</v>

100
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.960
<v Speaker 2>everyone's life that are portrayed </v>
<v Speaker 2>universally and mythology and it's very </v>

101
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 2>helpful because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dee Dee isolates you.</v>

102
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.820
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you learn as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical psychologist contra the anti </v>

103
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 2>psychiatry lists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

104
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 2>is that diagnosis is often a relief to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

105
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.530
<v Speaker 2>You know there's a problem with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed because then you might be </v>

106
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 2>labeled and then the label can follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for the rest of your life.</v>

107
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:59.051
<v Speaker 2>And once you're labeled as something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then strange things happen around you </v>

108
00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:03.701
<v Speaker 2>that is often reinforced that label.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you start acting it out more or </v>

109
00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 2>are you adopted as an identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a flip side of that,</v>

110
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:10.811
<v Speaker 2>which is that the last thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever want to hear when you go see a </v>

111
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 2>physician or psychologist is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a case like yours </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

113
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not a relief man,</v>

114
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:23.531
<v Speaker 2>because if the message is I've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard anything like what you're telling </v>

115
00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outcome is either going to be not so</v>

116
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 2>good for you or you're not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to it all,</v>

117
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

118
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Because you're such an anomaly that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

119
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.810
<v Speaker 2>you're actually in your existence is </v>
<v Speaker 2>annoying to the integrated knowledge </v>

120
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.691
<v Speaker 2>structure of the medical professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are attempting to receive </v>

121
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:40.691
<v Speaker 2>advice from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

122
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely the case because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 2>if you can be put in a box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the box tells the doctor what to do</v>

124
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 2>with you and that's actually a relief to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doctor,</v>

125
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 2>but also a relief to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

126
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Because you want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you come and you say,</v>

127
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go out of my house much anymore.</v>

128
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid on elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

129
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I have heart palpitations and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they end up in the emergency </v>

130
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.271
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Increasingly my interactions in the </v>

131
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 2>world are restricted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find myself staying at home afraid I'm</v>

132
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 2>going to die of a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the psychologist says,</v>

133
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have agora phobia,</v>

134
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.120
<v Speaker 2>and it's like lots of people have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's usually how it develops and </v>

135
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 2>here's the treatment course and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

136
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 2>we can probably do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

137
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to die of a heart </v>

138
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.000
<v Speaker 2>attack now probably that's a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>relief.</v>

139
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.200
<v Speaker 2>You're not crazy in a completely unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and you're crazy in a way that might</v>

140
00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 2>be treatable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:34.590
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

142
00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 2>it's such a relief because people come </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there with a pile of snakes,</v>

143
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.110
<v Speaker 2>have indeterminant magnitude and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk out with one manageable snake and </v>

144
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 2>it's still a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

145
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.480
<v Speaker 2>one manageable snake beats a hydra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

146
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

147
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back,</v>

148
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 2>back to stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

149
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:08.530
<v Speaker 2>the stories that we tell and that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in are fundamentally ways that we </v>

150
00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:16.241
<v Speaker 2>deal with the complexity of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fundamental problem with the </v>

151
00:09:16.241 --> 00:09:20.561
<v Speaker 2>world as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that not only is it complex beyond </v>

152
00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:25.931
<v Speaker 2>your comprehension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the complexity shifts in </v>

153
00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:29.021
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the Darwinian conundrum </v>

154
00:09:29.021 --> 00:09:33.941
<v Speaker 2>actually that's wide darwinism seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a practical necessity with regards to</v>

155
00:09:34.821 --> 00:09:39.821
<v Speaker 2>the continuation of life because because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the complexity changes unpredictably,</v>

156
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.520
<v Speaker 2>you can't necessarily tell what's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work in the future.</v>

157
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.880
<v Speaker 2>And so the Darwinian process solves that</v>
<v Speaker 2>by generating quasi random variations </v>

158
00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:53.990
<v Speaker 2>and letting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whichever one by happenstance happens to</v>

159
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:55.730
<v Speaker 2>work in that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

160
00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not random precisely because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the underlying structure is conserved.</v>

161
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.230
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that a child would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>born with an extra arm or something like</v>

162
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.690
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the skeletal structure that you</v>

163
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:13.370
<v Speaker 2>inhabit is shared by animals going way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back.</v>

164
00:10:13.371 --> 00:10:16.700
<v Speaker 2>In evolutionary history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of conservation and in the</v>

165
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:21.701
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so there's variation within </v>

166
00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:21.701
<v Speaker 2>conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like music.</v>

167
00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:23.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

168
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.280
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

169
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

170
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.020
<v Speaker 2>the stories that we tell have exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same structure.</v>

171
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:34.000
<v Speaker 2>They have this,</v>

172
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.160
<v Speaker 2>this core element with variations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

173
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.860
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll turn to the stories.</v>

174
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 2>And so the first problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned,</v>

175
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:48.141
<v Speaker 2>is a complexity problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are just too complicated to get a</v>

176
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:53.211
<v Speaker 2>handle on and that actually has serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences because what happens to </v>

177
00:10:53.211 --> 00:10:56.310
<v Speaker 2>everyone eventually is that their lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>become so complicated that they die.</v>

178
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.600
<v Speaker 2>So and that and that and many terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>things can happen to you on the way to </v>

179
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 2>dying as well that are complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity related,</v>

180
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can develop a serious illness that </v>

181
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't get a handle on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hit a,</v>

182
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call an impasse in your </v>

183
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.210
<v Speaker 2>relationship that you cannot get past </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see?</v>

184
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:17.910
<v Speaker 2>No way out of that happens to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite frequently.</v>

185
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.980
<v Speaker 2>People who are suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

186
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:24.981
<v Speaker 2>they often feel like they've been backed</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a corner that know that they have </v>

187
00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:24.981
<v Speaker 2>no options.</v>

188
00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 2>They have no good options,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter which way they turn.</v>

189
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 2>There's something terrible to face and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't see any way out of it.</v>

190
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.230
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes that's more true than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd like to think because we also tend</v>

191
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 2>to like to think that people's problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>are primarily psychological,</v>

192
00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:44.871
<v Speaker 2>but they're not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing you learned quite </v>

193
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.210
<v Speaker 2>rapidly as a clinician is that most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time people don't come to you </v>

194
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.171
<v Speaker 2>because they have mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come to you because they have a </v>

195
00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:52.830
<v Speaker 2>complexity management problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their lives have got out of hand on them</v>

196
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know how to get them back</v>
<v Speaker 2>under control,</v>

197
00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:01.290
<v Speaker 2>and so all sorts of things can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course that can make you </v>

198
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 2>anxious or depressed to can trigger all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of illnesses,</v>

199
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:06.961
<v Speaker 2>but the fundamental problem is still </v>
<v Speaker 2>that things have got beyond you and that</v>

200
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 2>actually has a psychophysiological cost </v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't merely psychological.</v>

201
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.000
<v Speaker 2>You have a limited amount of capacity </v>
<v Speaker 2>from from,</v>

202
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a resource perspective,</v>

203
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 2>to deal with the emergent complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just.</v>

204
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.750
<v Speaker 2>There's just not enough of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

205
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.530
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll exhaust your psychophysiological </v>

206
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.020
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get into a situation that's too </v>

207
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.140
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's what this.</v>

208
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:34.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what the idea of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents.</v>

209
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 2>It represents that underlying complexity</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can manifest itself at any time and</v>

210
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:40.030
<v Speaker 2>it can manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

211
00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:45.031
<v Speaker 2>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wake up in the morning and you </v>

212
00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:48.571
<v Speaker 2>know you'll feel an ache of some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps it's nothing and you ignore </v>

213
00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:49.780
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it gets worse and you ended up going</v>

214
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:53.200
<v Speaker 2>to the hospital and you find out perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

215
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:58.201
<v Speaker 2>that you have pancreatic cancer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to live for six months and </v>

216
00:12:58.201 --> 00:12:58.650
<v Speaker 2>that's the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's,</v>

217
00:12:58.950 --> 00:12:59.970
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

218
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.640
<v Speaker 2>it's at that moment that you break </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the thin ice that everyone walks</v>

219
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:08.641
<v Speaker 2>on and you see what's underneath and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's underneath is the ineradicable </v>

220
00:13:08.641 --> 00:13:12.820
<v Speaker 2>complexity of life and that's chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's now.</v>

221
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:18.420
<v Speaker 2>It's taken people a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time to get a grip on this </v>

222
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 2>conceptuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you call it?</v>

223
00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:26.581
<v Speaker 2>Conceptual Schema.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the and human beings have done it </v>

224
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:31.831
<v Speaker 2>mostly with image and story before </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been able to do it in any </v>

225
00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:34.921
<v Speaker 2>articulated manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there are a set of images that </v>

226
00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 2>represent this underlying chaos and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them is the dragon of chaos that,</v>

227
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 2>that precisely that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the dragon that the hero goes</v>

228
00:13:42.311 --> 00:13:44.440
<v Speaker 2>out to confront.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the symbol of the unknown.</v>

229
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:48.080
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that lurks underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that also guards treasure</v>

230
00:13:48.081 --> 00:13:53.081
<v Speaker 2>because in the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's possibility also the water that </v>

231
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 2>was there that we talked about in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>

232
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.480
<v Speaker 2>the water that's there at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

233
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Speaker 2>both assault and the fresh water is </v>
<v Speaker 2>often assemble of pre cosmogony chaos.</v>

234
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Often people have dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

235
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 2>some of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had this dream,</v>

236
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I suspect you'll dream that you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>house that you know,</v>

237
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:16.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now all of a sudden you discover a new </v>

238
00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:16.990
<v Speaker 2>room or a set of new rooms or maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of rooms in the basement,</v>

239
00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 2>and often the rooms are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

240
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.100
<v Speaker 2>are not well organized and they're full </v>
<v Speaker 2>of water.</v>

241
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Those are very common things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is that you've </v>

242
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.790
<v Speaker 2>broken through the constraints of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious self understanding to a new </v>

243
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 2>domain of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of possibility,</v>

244
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 2>but a new domain that needs a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of work.</v>

245
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:37.420
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

246
00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:40.210
<v Speaker 2>here's a new part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not well developed.</v>

247
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.160
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

248
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.420
<v Speaker 2>it's flooded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's flooded with chaos.</v>

249
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's water,</v>

250
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:50.371
<v Speaker 2>I think partly because chaos is not only</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you fall into when you're not </v>

251
00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:55.531
<v Speaker 2>expecting it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the unknown that you </v>

252
00:14:55.531 --> 00:14:58.061
<v Speaker 2>confront forthrightly and generate new </v>
<v Speaker 2>things out of and water is a symbol of </v>

253
00:14:58.061 --> 00:15:01.901
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the desert and of course </v>

254
00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.851
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is dependent on water and so </v>

255
00:15:03.851 --> 00:15:06.760
<v Speaker 2>water's a natural symbol to utilize when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about something that's </v>

256
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:12.941
<v Speaker 2>life giving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also potentially deadly because a </v>

257
00:15:12.941 --> 00:15:12.941
<v Speaker 2>little bit of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a drink,</v>

258
00:15:12.941 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of water.</v>

259
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.810
<v Speaker 2>That's a ship wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

260
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:17.810
<v Speaker 2>And so and those are the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the extremes.</v>

261
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are accounts that are sort of </v>

262
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.491
<v Speaker 2>subtexts in genesis and elsewhere in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old Testament of God conquering a great </v>

263
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.530
<v Speaker 2>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leviathan or or a a,</v>

264
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.540
<v Speaker 2>a moth that has these sort of serpent </v>
<v Speaker 2>tile elements and making the world as a </v>

265
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:46.241
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this idea that the world </v>

266
00:15:46.241 --> 00:15:48.140
<v Speaker 2>creating force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we've talked about as the logos,</v>

267
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.440
<v Speaker 2>is the thing that continually confronts </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and that one way of thinking about</v>

268
00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:58.841
<v Speaker 2>chaos is as a predatory reptilian </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster and often one that lives in the </v>

269
00:15:58.841 --> 00:16:03.581
<v Speaker 2>depths or perhaps underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of that I think is because we </v>

270
00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 2>actually use our Predator detection </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuit to do this sort of pre cognitive</v>

271
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:11.021
<v Speaker 2>processing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the notion fundamentally is </v>

272
00:16:11.021 --> 00:16:14.350
<v Speaker 2>anything that threatens you </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously is something that your </v>

273
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Predator detection circuit should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>working with.</v>

274
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 2>It's fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fast,</v>

275
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:21.020
<v Speaker 2>it's low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have a lot of ideas,</v>

276
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fast.</v>

277
00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:28.121
<v Speaker 2>And that also accounts for capability </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tendency to very rapidly treat.</v>

278
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:33.791
<v Speaker 2>People who are upset are conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures as enemies of the predatory </v>

279
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:41.231
<v Speaker 2>variety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can fall into that in no time flat </v>

280
00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 2>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the archetype.</v>

281
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Here's something comes along to knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for a loop.</v>

282
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that lurks under the </v>

283
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.040
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that'll pull you down.</v>

284
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.401
<v Speaker 2>It's an enemy and and you should get </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared and that's a reasonable </v>

285
00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:57.650
<v Speaker 2>defensive strategy even though it also </v>
<v Speaker 2>has its dangers.</v>

286
00:16:57.651 --> 00:17:02.651
<v Speaker 2>And can sometimes be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the landscape within which we have to</v>

287
00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:11.261
<v Speaker 2>erect our stories is fundamentally one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an overarching chaos and chaos that </v>

288
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:15.710
<v Speaker 2>exceeds our capacity to comprehend in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any sense,</v>

289
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.450
<v Speaker 2>individually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>familial,</v>

290
00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:18.680
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economically.</v>

291
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:24.010
<v Speaker 2>We're always threatened by the collapse </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the structures that we inhabit </v>

292
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:24.170
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

293
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 2>We have to work well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you own a house,</v>

294
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:29.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time do you spend maintaining a</v>

295
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:30.860
<v Speaker 2>house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

296
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why is that?</v>

297
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 2>Is because the house falls apart because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're stupid and the house falls apart.</v>

298
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Well because you do repair is wrong or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you ignore things.</v>

299
00:17:39.321 --> 00:17:44.321
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm saying this actually for </v>

300
00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:46.571
<v Speaker 2>technical reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the house falls apart because you're </v>

301
00:17:46.571 --> 00:17:46.571
<v Speaker 2>incompetent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even if you're competent,</v>

302
00:17:46.571 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 2>the house falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

303
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:52.571
<v Speaker 2>It's just entropy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so things have a proclivity to fall </v>

304
00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 2>apart on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just have to run like mad just to</v>

305
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 2>keep them doing what they're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be doing.</v>

306
00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.340
<v Speaker 2>And then of course that is complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>by your own willful blindness and </v>

307
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.911
<v Speaker 2>inadequacy as a repair person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>refusal to attend and all those other </v>

308
00:18:04.911 --> 00:18:04.911
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

309
00:18:04.911 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 2>So that's a very classic idea which </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll return to.</v>

310
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.340
<v Speaker 2>One of the ideas that that Mircea </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eliana,</v>

311
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 2>a famous historian of religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extracted from a very large corpus of </v>

312
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:23.421
<v Speaker 2>flood myths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the idea that the earth is </v>

313
00:18:23.421 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 2>periodically flooded for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is things fall apart,</v>

314
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 2>just entropy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight entropy.</v>

315
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:33.501
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember which law of </v>

316
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:34.971
<v Speaker 2>thermodynamics that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of the big laws of </v>

317
00:18:34.971 --> 00:18:38.061
<v Speaker 2>thermodynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's since it's one of the top three </v>

318
00:18:38.061 --> 00:18:39.540
<v Speaker 2>and things fall apart of their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>accord and that's one of the things that</v>

319
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:44.541
<v Speaker 2>we have to contend with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the rate at which things fall </v>

320
00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:47.910
<v Speaker 2>apart is sped by the sins of men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other idea.</v>

321
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:51.120
<v Speaker 2>And you know that everyone knows that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

322
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.210
<v Speaker 2>you know your car breaks down in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highway and you think,</v>

323
00:18:54.211 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so inconvenient.</v>

324
00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:18:56.071 --> 00:19:01.071
<v Speaker 2>you shake your fist at the sky and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's part of you in the back of your </v>

326
00:19:01.071 --> 00:19:01.071
<v Speaker 2>mind that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

327
00:19:01.071 --> 00:19:03.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that rattled that I wasn't paying</v>

328
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:06.510
<v Speaker 2>attention to actually signified </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

329
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

330
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.920
<v Speaker 2>I knew I should have paid attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I didn't,</v>

331
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:13.460
<v Speaker 2>and now I'm in the situation that I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 2>now and you know,</v>

332
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I know I bet you this happens to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>two or three times a week,</v>

333
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:20.310
<v Speaker 2>is they do something stupid that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>know they shouldn't have done,</v>

334
00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:25.311
<v Speaker 2>that they told themselves not to do mere</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds before and they know the voice </v>

335
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:26.730
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

336
00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

337
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.660
<v Speaker 2>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get nailed for it exactly the </v>

338
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.151
<v Speaker 2>way that you knew you would get nailed </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it and then you're hurt doubly </v>

339
00:19:35.151 --> 00:19:38.871
<v Speaker 2>because not only did it fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're the idiot that made it fall </v>

340
00:19:38.871 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing full well that was going to fall</v>

341
00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:43.800
<v Speaker 2>apart and ignoring it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the idea behind the notion</v>

342
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:46.620
<v Speaker 2>that there are two reasons that things </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall apart.</v>

343
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:52.370
<v Speaker 2>Thermodynamic entropy and the proclivity</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people not to attend to things they </v>

344
00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 2>know they should attend to and partly we</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that because if,</v>

345
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.430
<v Speaker 2>if a problem emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it always announces itself.</v>

346
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Unless it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really tiny problem and you're </v>

347
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:04.460
<v Speaker 2>approaching it voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily,</v>

348
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.691
<v Speaker 2>it always announces itself with negative</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion and that's part of the Predator </v>

349
00:20:08.691 --> 00:20:13.491
<v Speaker 2>detection circuited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It announces itself in frustration or </v>

350
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:16.170
<v Speaker 2>disappointment or emotional pain or </v>
<v Speaker 2>grief or the paramount one,</v>

351
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.010
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and and no wonder because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

352
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:25.011
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the logical one of the logical </v>

353
00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:25.011
<v Speaker 2>responses is to sort of freeze in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face of the problem,</v>

354
00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 2>but of course if it's a problem that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be addressed and solved,</v>

355
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.760
<v Speaker 2>freezing it and turning away from it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a good solution because since things</v>

356
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:36.900
<v Speaker 2>tend to fall apart on their own accord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just leave the thing alone,</v>

357
00:20:36.901 --> 00:20:39.570
<v Speaker 2>that's problem Madec.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to get worse,</v>

358
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:44.571
<v Speaker 2>not better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is one of the things that's very </v>

359
00:20:44.571 --> 00:20:44.571
<v Speaker 2>annoying about life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

360
00:20:44.571 --> 00:20:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get a warning message from the </v>

361
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Tax Department,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that ignoring that will </v>

362
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 2>make it go away is zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

363
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.900
<v Speaker 2>What'll happen instead is that the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>you ignore it,</v>

364
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:58.420
<v Speaker 2>the larger it will grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you ignore it long enough,</v>

365
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 2>then it will turn into something large </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to eat.</v>

366
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:05.830
<v Speaker 2>You and that will be the end of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read in Harper's magazine at one point</v>

367
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 2>that people would rather be mugged than </v>
<v Speaker 2>audited,</v>

368
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.280
<v Speaker 2>and so I believe that because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mugging man that's over a couple of </v>

369
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:17.280
<v Speaker 2>minutes of sheer terror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost your wallet,</v>

370
00:21:17.281 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 2>the way you walk the audit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

371
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.980
<v Speaker 2>that's like a semi fatal disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's chaos now.</v>

372
00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea here too is that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chaos.</v>

373
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:36.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the psychological ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also the chaos that whatever is </v>

374
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.801
<v Speaker 2>being represented in genesis as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit of God extracts order out of at </v>

375
00:21:40.801 --> 00:21:45.421
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of time and it's also that</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we're constantly contending with </v>

376
00:21:45.421 --> 00:21:49.810
<v Speaker 2>as we struggle in the same manner to </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct and maintain habitable world.</v>

377
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.720
<v Speaker 2>So it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliant.</v>

378
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:57.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first put together the </v>

379
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.881
<v Speaker 2>relationship between what Iliana called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pre cosmogony chaos and the Predator</v>

380
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:05.850
<v Speaker 2>predatory landscape that surrounded our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors and the manner in which we're </v>

381
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 2>structured neurologically to respond to </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

382
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:12.871
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like an an amazing epiphany </v>

383
00:22:12.871 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 2>because it's self evidently the case </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the world is too complicated for us</v>

384
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:21.001
<v Speaker 2>to deal with and that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems that we face on an ongoing </v>

385
00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:21.340
<v Speaker 2>basis and then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

386
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:23.890
<v Speaker 2>what do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you ignore it,</v>

387
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:28.891
<v Speaker 2>it gets worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so ignoring it doesn't work and so we </v>

388
00:22:28.891 --> 00:22:29.200
<v Speaker 2>know what doesn't work and so if </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignoring it doesn't work,</v>

389
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 2>then attending to it might work and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found out with the Egyptians,</v>

390
00:22:33.581 --> 00:22:36.600
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that horace was the god of attention.</v>

391
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:41.820
<v Speaker 2>In the same thing happened among the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamians with Marduk and his ring </v>

392
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:41.820
<v Speaker 2>of eyes.</v>

393
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's the way to forestall </v>
<v Speaker 2>the catastrophe of things falling apart </v>

394
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:51.841
<v Speaker 2>in the answer that is by attending to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the voluntarily attending to them and </v>

395
00:22:51.841 --> 00:22:55.411
<v Speaker 2>that slot very nicely into the hero </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology that promotes the idea that if</v>

396
00:22:55.661 --> 00:23:00.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a dragon in the whereabouts in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the near,</v>

397
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.160
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

398
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:06.260
<v Speaker 2>in the neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that hiding in the basement </v>

399
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.811
<v Speaker 2>just makes it grow larger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's time to go out and confront the </v>

400
00:23:09.811 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 2>damn thing and the general stories are </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

401
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.570
<v Speaker 2>You might get killed because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon,</v>

402
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:18.571
<v Speaker 2>but it's only might as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely will get killed if it happens</v>

403
00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:22.990
<v Speaker 2>to attack you at three in the morning at</v>
<v Speaker 2>home when you're hung over and it's been</v>

404
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:25.530
<v Speaker 2>a bad day and you don't have your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

405
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 2>are your sword and your shield at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready,</v>

406
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.480
<v Speaker 2>which is generally what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who avoid things,</v>

407
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.090
<v Speaker 2>so it's not something that should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommended.</v>

408
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:39.270
<v Speaker 2>You're screwed both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that's so nice </v>

409
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.361
<v Speaker 2>about being deeply pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so freeing because one of the </v>

410
00:23:42.361 --> 00:23:44.110
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

411
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:49.230
<v Speaker 2>it's very frequent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a relief and it is really a </v>

412
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:51.920
<v Speaker 2>useful habit to develop is sometimes no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter what you do,</v>

413
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:56.921
<v Speaker 2>you're in trouble and that's a relief </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then you can stop scrabbling </v>

414
00:23:56.921 --> 00:23:58.130
<v Speaker 2>around for the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way out man.</v>

415
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can pick murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wretched death,</v>

416
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.990
<v Speaker 2>a or slightly less wretched death be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

417
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that's a terrible way of </v>

418
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.721
<v Speaker 2>looking at things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is extraordinarily useful to </v>

419
00:24:13.721 --> 00:24:17.141
<v Speaker 2>understand that many times you get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice boils down to picking the least </v>

420
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:22.691
<v Speaker 2>bad option and if that's all you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's how life is revealing itself </v>

421
00:24:23.031 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

422
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more power to you,</v>

423
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.020
<v Speaker 2>the least bad option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best you can do.</v>

424
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.440
<v Speaker 2>And and it's good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially compared to the alternative </v>

425
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.840
<v Speaker 2>which is the most bad option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all right now.</v>

426
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 2>So the fundamental reality of things is </v>
<v Speaker 2>complexity beyond comprehension.</v>

427
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

428
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:49.451
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you manage that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And partly you manage that and this is </v>

429
00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:51.080
<v Speaker 2>where the PA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the image of the patriarchal order comes</v>

430
00:24:51.081 --> 00:24:55.640
<v Speaker 2>in in the positive manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might point out because in the absence</v>

431
00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 2>of patriarchal structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better lexicon,</v>

432
00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.510
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing but chaos and I wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>recommend chaos because it's it.</v>

433
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of it and there isn't that</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of you.</v>

434
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:13.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you think you can handle it </v>
<v Speaker 2>without an a priori structure and </v>

435
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:13.340
<v Speaker 2>without a sociological structures </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding you,</v>

436
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.070
<v Speaker 2>then you don't know anything at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about human beings.</v>

437
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things I've noticed </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

438
00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:23.411
<v Speaker 2>is that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable the degree to which </v>

439
00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 2>our sanity depends on our functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sociological structure.</v>

440
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.030
<v Speaker 2>And here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

441
00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:34.031
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of need to know what to do </v>

442
00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:34.031
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

443
00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:34.490
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a routine because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an animal,</v>

444
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know if you have a dog or a cat,</v>

445
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.770
<v Speaker 2>dogs are really good example of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs like routine,</v>

446
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:44.890
<v Speaker 2>they like to be walked the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>times a day that they're supposed to be </v>

447
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:45.200
<v Speaker 2>walked and they get quite sick very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly.</v>

448
00:25:45.201 --> 00:25:49.370
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't routinize their days,</v>

449
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.400
<v Speaker 2>children are exactly the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can overdo it,</v>

450
00:25:52.401 --> 00:25:53.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But still,</v>

451
00:25:53.631 --> 00:25:58.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know proximately when you </v>

452
00:25:58.631 --> 00:25:58.640
<v Speaker 2>should get up to be approximately the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same everyday.</v>

453
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.470
<v Speaker 2>You need to know approximately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going,</v>

454
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:05.471
<v Speaker 2>when you're going to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know what you're going to </v>

455
00:26:05.471 --> 00:26:05.471
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to know who you're going to eat</v>

456
00:26:05.471 --> 00:26:06.020
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know where to buy your food.</v>

457
00:26:06.021 --> 00:26:09.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like 80 percent of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of your life.</v>

458
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Something like that consists of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you do every single day that</v>

459
00:26:14.451 --> 00:26:19.451
<v Speaker 2>you repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are often the things that </v>

460
00:26:19.451 --> 00:26:19.940
<v Speaker 2>people think about as the trivial </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of their life,</v>

461
00:26:19.941 --> 00:26:24.941
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things I would like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>point out to you if you do the </v>

462
00:26:24.941 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 2>mathematics I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this with a client of mine who was</v>

463
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 2>having a hard time putting his child to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bet they were having a fight every night</v>

464
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:36.800
<v Speaker 2>and I knew by that time the studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate that most parents only spend 20</v>

465
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 2>minutes per day of one on one time with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their child.</v>

466
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Now the reason for that is that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are busy.</v>

467
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.680
<v Speaker 2>It's actually not that easy to Parse out</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes of one on one time.</v>

468
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot bloody more time than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

469
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.970
<v Speaker 2>but that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>

470
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Twenty minutes he's spending like 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes a day fighting with this kid,</v>

471
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:59.400
<v Speaker 2>trying to get the kid to go to bed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not very entertaining,</v>

472
00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:00.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

473
00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:02.850
<v Speaker 2>well it's just having a scrap with a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>about going to bed,</v>

474
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

475
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:03.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

476
00:27:03.431 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

477
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:05.910
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it happens every day,</v>

478
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you do the math,</v>

479
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 2>so it will say five hours a week for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sake of argument,</v>

480
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 2>just to keep it simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 20 hours a month.</v>

481
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:19.530
<v Speaker 2>It's 240 hours a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That 60 slash 40 hour work weeks.</v>

482
00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 2>So that guy was basically spending a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month and a half of work weeks doing </v>

483
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 2>absolutely nothing but having a wretched</v>
<v Speaker 2>time fighting with his son,</v>

484
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:30.870
<v Speaker 2>trying to get them to go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible.</v>

485
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just way too much time to spend </v>

486
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.421
<v Speaker 2>doing something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to actually have a positive </v>

487
00:27:38.421 --> 00:27:38.760
<v Speaker 2>relationship with someone because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just too.</v>

488
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.950
<v Speaker 2>It's just too punishing him so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need structure,</v>

489
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.920
<v Speaker 2>you need predictability and you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of it than you think.</v>

490
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Just to keep you sane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

491
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.320
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky and maybe a bit odd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can deviate five percent from the </v>

492
00:27:55.141 --> 00:28:00.141
<v Speaker 2>norm or 10 percent from the norm or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that carefully and </v>

493
00:28:00.141 --> 00:28:04.011
<v Speaker 2>cautiously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as the rest of you is all well </v>

494
00:28:04.011 --> 00:28:06.861
<v Speaker 2>ordered in informative manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to get away with that </v>

495
00:28:06.861 --> 00:28:09.921
<v Speaker 2>and you might be able to sustain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>across time and people might be able to </v>

496
00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:13.041
<v Speaker 2>tolerate you if you do it or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get really lucky and you happen </v>

497
00:28:13.041 --> 00:28:16.461
<v Speaker 2>to be creative but reasonably well put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and people will actually be </v>

498
00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:18.480
<v Speaker 2>happy that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiosyncratic and unique about you.</v>

499
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.930
<v Speaker 2>But even under those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly what you want is to have a </v>

500
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 2>routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's disciplined.</v>

501
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.240
<v Speaker 2>It's predictable and bloody well stick </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

502
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:31.620
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be way healthier and </v>
<v Speaker 2>happier and Saner if you do that.</v>

503
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:36.621
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing that you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is one of the things the </v>

504
00:28:36.621 --> 00:28:40.401
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysts got wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is that they overestimated the </v>

505
00:28:40.401 --> 00:28:42.540
<v Speaker 2>degree to which sanity was a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of internal,</v>

506
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.540
<v Speaker 2>of being properly structured internally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

507
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.090
<v Speaker 2>because from the psychoanalytic point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>

508
00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:53.091
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of an ego and that ego is </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside you and of course it rests on an </v>

509
00:28:53.091 --> 00:28:56.901
<v Speaker 2>unconscious structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the purpose of psychoanalytic </v>

510
00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:59.630
<v Speaker 2>analysis is to sort out that unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and the ego on top of it and </v>

511
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.460
<v Speaker 2>to make you a fully functioning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous individual,</v>

512
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.880
<v Speaker 2>but there's a problem with that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that you're saying as a fully</v>

513
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:14.181
<v Speaker 2>functional and antonymous human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't because you've organized your </v>

514
00:29:14.181 --> 00:29:15.180
<v Speaker 2>psyche even though that's important.</v>

515
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.600
<v Speaker 2>The reason that you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're aware,</v>

516
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:23.690
<v Speaker 2>if you have a well organized unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ego is because other people can </v>

517
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.790
<v Speaker 2>tolerate having you around for </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably extensive periods of time and</v>

518
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:31.791
<v Speaker 2>we'll cuff you across the back of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head every time you do something so </v>

519
00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:33.780
<v Speaker 2>stupid that people will dislike you </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanently if you continue,</v>

520
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.020
<v Speaker 2>and so what people are doing to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other all the time,</v>

521
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.200
<v Speaker 2>just nonstop is broadcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sanity signals back and forth,</v>

522
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:45.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you smile at people if they're</v>

523
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're not,</v>

524
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:51.091
<v Speaker 2>not only behaving property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but behaving in a way that you would </v>

525
00:29:51.091 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 2>like to see them continue to behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you frown at them.</v>

526
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:53.290
<v Speaker 2>If they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ignore them.</v>

527
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 2>If they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shun them.</v>

528
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:57.040
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you roll your eyes out them you manifest</v>

529
00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 2>to discuss face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't listen to them.</v>

530
00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 2>You interrupt them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't cooperate with them.</v>

531
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:06.270
<v Speaker 2>You won't compete with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're blasting signals and </v>

532
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.740
<v Speaker 2>other people about how to regulate their</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior so frequently.</v>

533
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just makes up all of your social </v>

534
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.421
<v Speaker 2>interaction and that's why we face each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and we have emotional displays on </v>

535
00:30:15.421 --> 00:30:17.680
<v Speaker 2>her face and we're looking at each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other's eyes and we know exactly.</v>

536
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.040
<v Speaker 2>We know as much as we can about what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on with each other given that we </v>

537
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 2>don't have immediate access to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contents of their consciousness,</v>

538
00:30:24.461 --> 00:30:29.461
<v Speaker 2>and so partly what you're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your routine is establishing yourself as</v>

539
00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:31.270
<v Speaker 2>a credible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable,</v>

540
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.300
<v Speaker 2>trustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially interesting human being who </v>

541
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.601
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to do anything too erratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>at any moment and everyone else is </v>

542
00:30:39.601 --> 00:30:41.980
<v Speaker 2>around there tapping you into shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making sure that that's exactly what you</v>

543
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 2>are and that's how you stay sane and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens to people too,</v>

544
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:50.551
<v Speaker 2>if they don't have a routine and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>get isolated as they start to drift and </v>

545
00:30:50.551 --> 00:30:55.201
<v Speaker 2>they drift badly because the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>too complicated for you to keep it </v>

546
00:30:55.201 --> 00:30:58.330
<v Speaker 2>organized all by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just cannot do it.</v>

547
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.540
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we outsource the problem of sanity </v>

548
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.520
<v Speaker 2>and it's very intelligent that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>outsourced the problem of sanity because</v>

549
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:12.510
<v Speaker 2>sanity is an impossibly complex problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the way that we manage the </v>

550
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:17.790
<v Speaker 2>incredibly complex problem is we have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very large number of brains working </v>

551
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.200
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously on the problem all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

552
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like a stock market for sanity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly I,</v>

553
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I use that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use that definition with purpose </v>

554
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.940
<v Speaker 2>because the stock market does the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of impossible thing,</v>

555
00:31:30.941 --> 00:31:35.941
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it tries to price things which </v>

556
00:31:35.941 --> 00:31:35.941
<v Speaker 2>is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is to how many things are there,</v>

557
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.040
<v Speaker 2>like a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How in the world do you decide what the </v>

558
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 2>price is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can decide what the price is.</v>

559
00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.280
<v Speaker 2>That's why you have a stock market as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

560
00:31:44.281 --> 00:31:45.450
<v Speaker 2>In a free market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for,</v>

561
00:31:45.451 --> 00:31:50.451
<v Speaker 2>for consumer goods is everyone's voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>on what the price of everything is all </v>

562
00:31:50.451 --> 00:31:51.520
<v Speaker 2>the time and that's the way we figure it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out because it's actually.</v>

563
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.820
<v Speaker 2>It's technically impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's partly why the stock market </v>

564
00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.370
<v Speaker 2>explodes now and then and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bubbles and all that sort of thing.</v>

565
00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.640
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point is things are chaotic.</v>

566
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 2>In Alice in Wonderland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Alice goes down the rabbit hole,</v>

567
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:08.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

568
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:14.850
<v Speaker 2>So now she's gone into the substructure </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being and she meets the Red Queen.</v>

569
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:20.650
<v Speaker 2>The Red Queen is Mother Nature and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother nature is running around yelling </v>

570
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 2>off with their heads off with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>heads,</v>

571
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:28.230
<v Speaker 2>which is of course what Mother Nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>Does and she tells Ellis in my kingdom,</v>

572
00:32:28.241 --> 00:32:31.540
<v Speaker 2>you have to run as fast as you can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay in the same place.</v>

573
00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:35.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a description of it.</v>

574
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.570
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary biologists,</v>

575
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.560
<v Speaker 2>psychologists have picked up on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>phrase,</v>

576
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:44.561
<v Speaker 2>they call it the red queen problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Red Queen problem is </v>

577
00:32:44.561 --> 00:32:49.390
<v Speaker 2>everything's after you all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not smart enough to do anything </v>

578
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.181
<v Speaker 2>about it or enough about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's a permanent existential </v>

579
00:32:52.181 --> 00:32:52.181
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

580
00:32:52.181 --> 00:32:54.380
<v Speaker 2>So how do you deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a biological structure,</v>

581
00:32:55.100 --> 00:33:00.100
<v Speaker 2>so your embodiment is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution to the problem and then you're </v>

582
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 2>enculturated and because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>enculturated,</v>

583
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 2>we're taught a lot of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to know,</v>

584
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:09.911
<v Speaker 2>but mostly what you're taught is how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with other people in an </v>

585
00:33:09.911 --> 00:33:13.111
<v Speaker 2>acceptable manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once you can communicate with </v>

586
00:33:13.111 --> 00:33:16.751
<v Speaker 2>people in an acceptable manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can outsource your problems </v>

587
00:33:16.751 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're doing constantly.</v>

588
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 2>And so we're in this continual dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange of problem solving.</v>

589
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a socialized person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you get access to.</v>

590
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's something to know if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have kids,</v>

591
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 2>and I mentioned this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a previous lecture,</v>

592
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:34.270
<v Speaker 2>the per.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The purpose of being a parent for very </v>

593
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.151
<v Speaker 2>young children is to make your children </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptionally socially desirable.</v>

594
00:33:37.221 --> 00:33:40.880
<v Speaker 2>By the age of four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you can do that,</v>

595
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:45.900
<v Speaker 2>there are set because everyone wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>them around and as soon as everybody </v>

596
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.360
<v Speaker 2>wants them around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to play with them,</v>

597
00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:49.520
<v Speaker 2>they want to cooperate when they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>compete with them.</v>

598
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like the door is open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doors open and they stay sane </v>

599
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.701
<v Speaker 2>because they've got all sorts of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who actually like them that are helping </v>

600
00:33:57.701 --> 00:34:00.851
<v Speaker 2>them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's your goal is to make them </v>

601
00:34:00.851 --> 00:34:01.440
<v Speaker 2>as socially acceptable as you possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

602
00:34:01.441 --> 00:34:03.470
<v Speaker 2>have socially desirable as you possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

603
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't mean you render them </v>
<v Speaker 2>obedient without spirit.</v>

604
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

605
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:14.381
<v Speaker 2>that's a tyrants motive of enforcing </v>
<v Speaker 2>social acceptability is like never do </v>

606
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:17.660
<v Speaker 2>anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not any way to.</v>

607
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a good piece of advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

608
00:34:19.981 --> 00:34:23.420
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's missing the other half which is</v>

609
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:25.370
<v Speaker 2>do a bunch of things that are right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

610
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:30.230
<v Speaker 2>so that people are thrilled to have you </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and do and encourage that.</v>

611
00:34:30.231 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what you want to do as a parent </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as inculcating the order.</v>

612
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.050
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

613
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:40.100
<v Speaker 2>and in this little diagram I indicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is God the father with his </v>

614
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.290
<v Speaker 2>son behind him and he's ruling over this</v>
<v Speaker 2>walled city,</v>

615
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:45.320
<v Speaker 2>so he's like the met has spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>walled city.</v>

616
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.420
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very nice,</v>

617
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 2>very nice image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant image.</v>

618
00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:53.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's the collective spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

619
00:34:53.631 --> 00:34:58.631
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the collective spirit of the city </v>

620
00:34:58.631 --> 00:35:01.510
<v Speaker 2>across time or the collective spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the force that built and maintained the </v>

621
00:35:01.581 --> 00:35:06.581
<v Speaker 2>city across time even better and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the sun because it's,</v>

622
00:35:06.711 --> 00:35:07.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

623
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:12.380
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's associated with enlightenment and </v>

624
00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.560
<v Speaker 2>illumination and all of those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we associate with higher </v>

625
00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.230
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So brilliant image.</v>

626
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 2>And then I overlaid this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

627
00:35:17.721 --> 00:35:22.721
<v Speaker 2>now of course the patriarchal aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence can become tyrannical.</v>

628
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Does that have quite regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the existential dangers of </v>

629
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:33.170
<v Speaker 2>human civilization is that civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a medication for chaos,</v>

630
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.440
<v Speaker 2>but it can spin out of control in and of</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself and become its own sort of </v>

631
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:43.071
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a hyper order problem </v>

632
00:35:43.071 --> 00:35:43.071
<v Speaker 2>generally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which then produces a chaos problem.</v>

633
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 2>So every solution carries within it </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain problems,</v>

634
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:52.491
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because no solution is perfect and so </v>

635
00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:54.531
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep things in balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of the reasons that I'm </v>

636
00:35:54.531 --> 00:35:57.501
<v Speaker 2>really a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call it irritated about the </v>

637
00:35:57.501 --> 00:36:02.031
<v Speaker 2>postmodernists because they keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>yammering about the patriarchy and it's </v>

638
00:36:02.031 --> 00:36:06.771
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very annoying because because it's self </v>

639
00:36:06.771 --> 00:36:08.580
<v Speaker 2>evident that social structures are </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical.</v>

640
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's not news folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's obvious,</v>

641
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.700
<v Speaker 2>but that's not all they are and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>

642
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:21.740
<v Speaker 2>It's the reduction of the entire complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>solution,</v>

643
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:26.130
<v Speaker 2>let's say to a unit dimensional problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just tight tyranny.</v>

644
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

645
00:36:27.211 --> 00:36:32.211
<v Speaker 2>actually it's not just tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you spend six months somewhere that </v>

646
00:36:32.211 --> 00:36:33.600
<v Speaker 2>was just tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd know the difference very,</v>

647
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:38.601
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't mean that everyone </v>

648
00:36:38.601 --> 00:36:41.930
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give up a pound or two or 10 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 of flesh to participate.</v>

649
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Even in a society that's as free as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western society is,</v>

650
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:50.490
<v Speaker 2>we all get crushed and molded by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical force of social convention,</v>

651
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:56.330
<v Speaker 2>but at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefit is worth the cost and then </v>

652
00:36:56.431 --> 00:37:01.431
<v Speaker 2>it's also up to you to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't sacrifice more to the group </v>

653
00:37:01.431 --> 00:37:05.300
<v Speaker 2>than you should and you can start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell if you're sacrificing more to the </v>

654
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.800
<v Speaker 2>group than you should because you start </v>
<v Speaker 2>to become resentful of other people.</v>

655
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:13.130
<v Speaker 2>That's part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of this psychological </v>

656
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.690
<v Speaker 2>mechanism that's informing you of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's up to you to fight against the,</v>

657
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:20.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overarching pressure for conformity </v>

658
00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.060
<v Speaker 2>to retain your individual logos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

659
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:26.390
<v Speaker 2>But that's sort of your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the group wants you to behave </v>

660
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.640
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could behave and be creatively </v>

661
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:31.640
<v Speaker 2>productive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much the better,</v>

662
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.781
<v Speaker 2>but that's pretty damn rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the group generally tends to settle </v>

663
00:37:35.781 --> 00:37:38.340
<v Speaker 2>just for behave and there's a tyrannical</v>
<v Speaker 2>element of that.</v>

664
00:37:38.341 --> 00:37:41.100
<v Speaker 2>But what the hell is the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

665
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our society is based on consensus and </v>

666
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.140
<v Speaker 2>the consensus is based on the sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a certain sacrifice of individuality.</v>

667
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Even though individualities absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary as a revitalizing force for </v>

668
00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.790
<v Speaker 2>the society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very tight touched,</v>

669
00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.420
<v Speaker 2>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough thing to manage property.</v>

670
00:37:57.421 --> 00:38:02.421
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the your physiological </v>

671
00:38:02.421 --> 00:38:07.191
<v Speaker 2>structure as your first line of ordering</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to chaos because your </v>

672
00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:09.630
<v Speaker 2>body presents you with the world in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way.</v>

673
00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:14.810
<v Speaker 2>And then the second line of defense is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like this sociological </v>

674
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.260
<v Speaker 2>structure that you inhabit and we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>call those the competency hierarchies or</v>

675
00:38:16.261 --> 00:38:19.830
<v Speaker 2>something like that and thank God for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because you know,</v>

676
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:24.980
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialize in one or two things in your </v>

677
00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.681
<v Speaker 2>life or five things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's 300 things you need to know </v>

678
00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:27.720
<v Speaker 2>and if it's just you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

679
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:32.721
<v Speaker 2>you'll be doing your genius level </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematics while your bath tub is </v>

680
00:38:32.721 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 2>leaking all over your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over your bathroom floor.</v>

681
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can call a plumber and hooray for</v>

682
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:37.360
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

683
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to cooperate to keep chaos under</v>

684
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:43.930
<v Speaker 2>control and we tend to cooperate to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>order under control.</v>

685
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's the political dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

686
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:53.190
<v Speaker 2>We maintain the culture to keep chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>under control and we balanced the </v>

687
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:58.351
<v Speaker 2>culture owed properly to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture under control and that way we </v>

688
00:38:58.351 --> 00:39:02.761
<v Speaker 2>get to live reasonably peacefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably productively for a reasonable</v>

689
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:07.891
<v Speaker 2>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the best that we can do and </v>

690
00:39:07.891 --> 00:39:10.891
<v Speaker 2>we should have some gratitude when </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's working because the default </v>

691
00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:15.360
<v Speaker 2>condition of things is that not only do </v>
<v Speaker 2>they not work very well,</v>

692
00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:19.540
<v Speaker 2>they work worse and worse over time all </v>
<v Speaker 2>by themselves,</v>

693
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.320
<v Speaker 2>so anytime anything is working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should just be amazed by it.</v>

694
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is the frame look like?</v>

695
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it looks something like this,</v>

696
00:39:28.691 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 2>and this is as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the bare bones.</v>

697
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.550
<v Speaker 2>This is the bare bones of a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

698
00:39:33.551 --> 00:39:37.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a bare bone story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a verbal and conceptual framework.</v>

699
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:41.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a bare bone dazzle to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak in Heideggerian terms.</v>

700
00:39:41.321 --> 00:39:43.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's the bare bones world that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in.</v>

701
00:39:43.721 --> 00:39:47.110
<v Speaker 2>You're always in one of these worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no getting out of them.</v>

702
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.680
<v Speaker 2>You can move from one to another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're always in a world like this </v>

703
00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.861
<v Speaker 2>and so this is the world that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're somewhere because you have to be </v>

704
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:58.690
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might not know where that is,</v>

705
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.810
<v Speaker 2>which means that the somewhere that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are is chaotic,</v>

706
00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:07.110
<v Speaker 2>in which case you need to go over your </v>
<v Speaker 2>past in great detail and figure out </v>

707
00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:07.150
<v Speaker 2>where you are.</v>

708
00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:12.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're lost right to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your last and the problem with being </v>

709
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:15.451
<v Speaker 2>last is when you're lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where to go and the </v>

710
00:40:15.451 --> 00:40:18.361
<v Speaker 2>problem with not knowing where to go is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a million places that you could </v>

711
00:40:18.361 --> 00:40:20.830
<v Speaker 2>go and a million places is too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>places for you to go without dying,</v>

712
00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 2>so being lost is not good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you need to know where you are.</v>

713
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we built online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my partners and I is this program called</v>

714
00:40:30.011 --> 00:40:35.011
<v Speaker 2>past authoring that helps people lay out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the narrative of their past to identify,</v>

715
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 2>to break their life down into six </v>
<v Speaker 2>stages,</v>

716
00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:44.371
<v Speaker 2>epochs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We called them and then to identify the </v>

717
00:40:44.371 --> 00:40:46.420
<v Speaker 2>emotionally significant moments in each </v>
<v Speaker 2>park and to write them out.</v>

718
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.760
<v Speaker 2>What happened negatively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened positively,</v>

719
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.880
<v Speaker 2>what the consequences were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you derive from it,</v>

720
00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:53.560
<v Speaker 2>perhaps what you could have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently,</v>

721
00:40:53.561 --> 00:40:58.561
<v Speaker 2>perhaps what you learned from it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that so that you can narrow in </v>

722
00:40:58.561 --> 00:41:02.580
<v Speaker 2>zero in on determining precisely where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that you are right now and people </v>

723
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:08.851
<v Speaker 2>are often loath to do that because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually don't want to know because </v>

724
00:41:08.851 --> 00:41:11.461
<v Speaker 2>they'd rather be spread out in as sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of half blind manner in the fog hoping </v>

725
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 2>that the place that they're at is better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than it really is,</v>

726
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.960
<v Speaker 2>and deluding themselves by remaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>vague.</v>

727
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Then to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right here right now with these </v>

728
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.661
<v Speaker 2>specific problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually better to do that </v>

729
00:41:27.661 --> 00:41:30.610
<v Speaker 2>because if you have a set of specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and you've really narrowed them</v>

730
00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:35.611
<v Speaker 2>down and really specified them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you probably start fixing them and </v>

731
00:41:35.611 --> 00:41:38.480
<v Speaker 2>you can start fixing them and Mike Micro</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

732
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.540
<v Speaker 2>bit by bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no way you can do that </v>

733
00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:43.790
<v Speaker 2>without knowing where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible and you can kind of tell</v>

734
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:46.940
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite straightforward.</v>

735
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.960
<v Speaker 2>If you are haunted by reveries of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past for events that are older than </v>

736
00:41:53.871 --> 00:41:57.410
<v Speaker 2>approximately 18 months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they continue to come up in your mind</v>

737
00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 2>over and over and your dreams over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

738
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:05.660
<v Speaker 2>you haven't extracted the world out from</v>
<v Speaker 2>your past experiences.</v>

739
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:10.280
<v Speaker 2>That potential is still trapped in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past and to confront the potential means</v>

740
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:15.281
<v Speaker 2>to confront the dragon of the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course that's terrifying and </v>

741
00:42:15.281 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Speaker 2>seriously be terrifying.</v>

742
00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.980
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're vague and ill formed and </v>

743
00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.310
<v Speaker 2>ill defined because you were abused very</v>
<v Speaker 2>badly when you were a child,</v>

744
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:23.780
<v Speaker 2>four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

745
00:42:23.781 --> 00:42:27.080
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you were abused by a family </v>
<v Speaker 2>member because that's generally who does</v>

746
00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:29.780
<v Speaker 2>the abusing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that just makes it worse.</v>

747
00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:33.920
<v Speaker 2>And then what that means is that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got a implicit.</v>

748
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:39.160
<v Speaker 2>You've had an implicit encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolent evil that no,</v>

749
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.360
<v Speaker 2>you've had to direct encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolent evil,</v>

750
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:45.710
<v Speaker 2>but you have an implicit hypothesis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolent evil that's plaguing you.</v>

751
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.170
<v Speaker 2>It's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's trapped in the memories,</v>

752
00:42:48.171 --> 00:42:48.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

753
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:54.040
<v Speaker 2>it's trapped in the representational </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and as an adult you're now </v>

754
00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.671
<v Speaker 2>faced with the necessity of articulating</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fully before you have any chance </v>

755
00:42:57.671 --> 00:42:59.360
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever of freeing yourself from it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's no joke.</v>

756
00:42:59.361 --> 00:43:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Lots of times people have to go into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

757
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:03.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what the psychoanalysts do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

758
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:08.830
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's something came along and just </v>

759
00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:09.770
<v Speaker 2>bloody well knocked me over and it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even that I repressed it,</v>

760
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.060
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think was,</v>

761
00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:17.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we won't talk about Freud's errors </v>

762
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.040
<v Speaker 2>because freud was a genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll just leave him alone,</v>

763
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.320
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's not repression.</v>

764
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.320
<v Speaker 2>It's just the terrible things happen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people at such a young age that there </v>

765
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.820
<v Speaker 2>isn't a bloody chance in hell of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can figure out why they happened or</v>

766
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:29.720
<v Speaker 2>what to do with them or what they mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can carry that with you and</v>

767
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:33.410
<v Speaker 2>you carry it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like fear your,</v>

768
00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.460
<v Speaker 2>your body encounters the world in stages</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it happens very rapidly.</v>

769
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can extend over years,</v>

770
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:41.060
<v Speaker 2>but the initial stages happen very </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly.</v>

771
00:43:41.061 --> 00:43:46.061
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're walking down the road and you </v>

772
00:43:46.061 --> 00:43:46.280
<v Speaker 2>hear a large noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a loud noise behind you,</v>

773
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:51.360
<v Speaker 2>he'll go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a Predator defense response by </v>

774
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.510
<v Speaker 2>the way you crouched down and that's to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop something from jumping on your back</v>

775
00:43:53.511 --> 00:43:56.320
<v Speaker 2>and getting at your neck too easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like few million,</v>

776
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.380
<v Speaker 2>a few hundred milliseconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really faster,</v>

777
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:03.400
<v Speaker 2>even faster than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it better be because something like </v>

778
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:03.400
<v Speaker 2>a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll say,</v>

779
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.060
<v Speaker 2>can nail you just right now so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>better be fast.</v>

780
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.330
<v Speaker 2>But it's low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like dangerous snake,</v>

781
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:10.870
<v Speaker 2>something like that or danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory cap.</v>

782
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.920
<v Speaker 2>It's that faxed and then you can unravel</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and categorize it.</v>

783
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.510
<v Speaker 2>But that takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do that with emotion and then you do</v>

784
00:44:20.511 --> 00:44:25.511
<v Speaker 2>it with cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can do that with longterm </v>

785
00:44:25.511 --> 00:44:25.511
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

786
00:44:25.511 --> 00:44:27.140
<v Speaker 2>because maybe you've encountered someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically malevolent and predatory at</v>

787
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:30.320
<v Speaker 2>work and it happens to people a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's operating as a,</v>

788
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:35.520
<v Speaker 2>as a destructive bully and who seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no positive function whatsoever.</v>

789
00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And his only living that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>

790
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.470
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

791
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.500
<v Speaker 2>you're in prey mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean this kind of mode,</v>

792
00:44:44.501 --> 00:44:49.501
<v Speaker 2>although that would help too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you're acting like a prey </v>

793
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:51.120
<v Speaker 2>animal and then you have this terribly </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex thing to decompose,</v>

794
00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 2>which is what the hell is up with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>

795
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:58.730
<v Speaker 2>Why are they making my life miserable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about B that allows them to </v>

796
00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:02.751
<v Speaker 2>make my life miserable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a nasty little road to walk down </v>

797
00:45:02.751 --> 00:45:06.410
<v Speaker 2>and you're stuck with having to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're stuck with having to decompose </v>

798
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:06.410
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can't.</v>

799
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe formulating and explicit </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy of good and evil to deal with</v>

800
00:45:10.831 --> 00:45:15.831
<v Speaker 2>something malevolent in your environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually just happens to be beyond you.</v>

801
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:21.890
<v Speaker 2>And that could easily be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly the case for people who </v>

802
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900
<v Speaker 2>are young and it's the case for plenty </v>
<v Speaker 2>of adults as well.</v>

803
00:45:21.901 --> 00:45:26.901
<v Speaker 2>It's no simple thing to matt to manage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something too that often soldiers </v>

804
00:45:26.901 --> 00:45:31.401
<v Speaker 2>who have posttraumatic stress disorder </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do because they've encountered </v>

805
00:45:31.401 --> 00:45:34.820
<v Speaker 2>terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've either done them or ran into </v>

806
00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.101
<v Speaker 2>them and they need to update their moral</v>
<v Speaker 2>model of the world or if they end up in </v>

807
00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:41.961
<v Speaker 2>something close to closely approximating</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell anyway.</v>

808
00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.200
<v Speaker 2>So you need to know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this.</v>

809
00:45:46.201 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you?</v>

810
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.270
<v Speaker 2>So you're navigating your navigator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a sailor on an ocean,</v>

811
00:45:51.271 --> 00:45:51.900
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>

812
00:45:51.901 --> 00:45:53.730
<v Speaker 2>That's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a mobile creature.</v>

813
00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:56.250
<v Speaker 2>You're going from point a to point b all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

814
00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 2>You're not sitting there glued to a rock</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some brainless,</v>

815
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:01.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sea creature.</v>

816
00:46:01.531 --> 00:46:03.570
<v Speaker 2>There's a funny little creature called a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hydra.</v>

817
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Very simple little creature in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>juvenile stage.</v>

818
00:46:07.081 --> 00:46:11.220
<v Speaker 2>It has a brain because it swims around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when it turns into an adult,</v>

819
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:15.000
<v Speaker 2>it latches itself to Iraq and promptly </v>
<v Speaker 2>digests it's brain.</v>

820
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're just sitting on a rock</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not moving,</v>

821
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:18.360
<v Speaker 2>you don't need a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

822
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 2>But that's not our issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

823
00:46:19.771 --> 00:46:21.720
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're zipping around in the world and so</v>

824
00:46:21.721 --> 00:46:24.390
<v Speaker 2>we're navigating agents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to navigate,</v>

825
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.790
<v Speaker 2>there's two things you need to know.</v>

826
00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And the first is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the hell are you?</v>

827
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely right.</v>

828
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Razor sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's good about you and what's bad </v>

829
00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:36.410
<v Speaker 2>about you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By your own,</v>

830
00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.890
<v Speaker 2>by your own reckoning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to.</v>

831
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.890
<v Speaker 2>You can ask other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a game you play yourself.</v>

832
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking star,</v>

833
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.760
<v Speaker 2>what is it that's okay about being what </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs some work and you've got to watch </v>

834
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.690
<v Speaker 2>to not be too self critical when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that too because that can just be </v>

835
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.690
<v Speaker 2>another kind of flaw and then the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

836
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:54.840
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well where are you going?</v>

837
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.020
<v Speaker 2>What's your destination?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

838
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.050
<v Speaker 2>and that's what the frame is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know you could do that in a very</v>

839
00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:06.051
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated way and you do that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking consciously about who it is </v>

840
00:47:06.051 --> 00:47:09.330
<v Speaker 2>that you are in an articulated manner </v>
<v Speaker 2>and where you want to go and why and how</v>

841
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:11.640
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get there and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardly ever do that.</v>

842
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's come as such an absolute shock to</v>

843
00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:19.671
<v Speaker 2>me as an educator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just because one of the other programs</v>

844
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:24.690
<v Speaker 2>I use this in my classes or what did the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other programs in this suite of programs</v>

845
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:29.691
<v Speaker 2>is called the future authoring program </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started developing my maps of </v>

846
00:47:29.691 --> 00:47:33.651
<v Speaker 2>meaning class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where some of this materials </v>

847
00:47:33.651 --> 00:47:33.651
<v Speaker 2>from andI got students to write about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their past.</v>

848
00:47:33.651 --> 00:47:33.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

849
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:35.740
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about stories,</v>

850
00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:37.960
<v Speaker 2>so let's tell your story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are you,</v>

851
00:47:37.961 --> 00:47:42.961
<v Speaker 2>how'd you get here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what are you now that usually helps </v>

852
00:47:42.961 --> 00:47:45.130
<v Speaker 2>people put things to rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it's quite stressful.</v>

853
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it.</v>

854
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Stress goes up when you're doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you feel miserable for a couple of</v>

855
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.020
<v Speaker 2>weeks and then stress goes down and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>stays down.</v>

856
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:58.050
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also why people don't do it </v>

857
00:47:58.050 --> 00:47:58.050
<v Speaker 2>because who the hell wants to have their</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress go up?</v>

858
00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.100
<v Speaker 2>But if it's temporary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sacrifice.</v>

859
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.140
<v Speaker 2>So then the next issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

860
00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 2>where are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that,</v>

861
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:07.050
<v Speaker 2>and this I just still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot understand you.</v>

862
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Students that had been in education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system for 15 years,</v>

863
00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.940
<v Speaker 2>14 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high end students,</v>

864
00:48:12.941 --> 00:48:16.120
<v Speaker 2>most of them not once in their whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody life.</v>

865
00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Did anyone ever get them to sit down for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a day and say,</v>

866
00:48:19.661 --> 00:48:22.990
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>justify your existence.</v>

867
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Like seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like here you are in university,</v>

868
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:31.531
<v Speaker 2>you're taking a bunch of courses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got some sort of vague career </v>

869
00:48:31.531 --> 00:48:34.861
<v Speaker 2>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like defend the damn thing a bit </v>

870
00:48:34.861 --> 00:48:35.860
<v Speaker 2>since you're going to go live it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

871
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 2>You're staking everything on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

872
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:43.230
<v Speaker 2>what's your damn plan and why are you so</v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that it's not the plan of a </v>

873
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:48.840
<v Speaker 2>babbling fool because if you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about identity is and if you </v>

874
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.500
<v Speaker 2>really want to go out there and live </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out,</v>

875
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things Carl Jung said was </v>

876
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 2>that you were in a story whether you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know it or not,</v>

877
00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 2>and then he made two nice comments about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

878
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:06.030
<v Speaker 2>If it's someone else's story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably going to get a bit part </v>

879
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.380
<v Speaker 2>and it might not be the one you want and</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a story that you don't know,</v>

880
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:13.381
<v Speaker 2>it might be one with a really bad ending</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it's just bad period with a </v>

881
00:49:13.381 --> 00:49:17.611
<v Speaker 2>worse ending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't know what the story </v>

882
00:49:17.611 --> 00:49:18.400
<v Speaker 2>that you're living out is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the one you know.</v>

883
00:49:18.401 --> 00:49:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you got that from your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got it from your grandmother.</v>

884
00:49:21.281 --> 00:49:24.940
<v Speaker 2>You got it from your aunt or God only </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows where you picked it up because you</v>

885
00:49:24.941 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 2>pick up things like mad because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what human beings are like,</v>

886
00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:31.510
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you're living a malevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy unconsciously,</v>

887
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.420
<v Speaker 2>and then one thing you might ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself is,</v>

888
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:36.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how wretched and miserable is your life?</v>

889
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Let's add few title to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How wretched,</v>

890
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:41.080
<v Speaker 2>miserable and futile is your life?</v>

891
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.870
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

892
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:45.340
<v Speaker 2>70 percent on each count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

893
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:50.520
<v Speaker 2>then you're probably unconsciously </v>
<v Speaker 2>living out a malevolent tragedy and </v>

894
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's not for the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

895
00:49:53.051 --> 00:49:54.850
<v Speaker 2>it's either that or the whole universe </v>
<v Speaker 2>hates you,</v>

896
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or 70 percent hates you,</v>

897
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:58.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

898
00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

899
00:50:00.041 --> 00:50:05.041
<v Speaker 2>we got students to start writing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail about not what they wanted.</v>

900
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:12.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not a career thing because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the closest people usually get is they </v>

901
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.610
<v Speaker 2>have a career plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

902
00:50:12.611 --> 00:50:13.060
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

903
00:50:13.061 --> 00:50:14.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not a career plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

904
00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.840
<v Speaker 2>that's peripheral important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But peripheral,</v>

905
00:50:16.841 --> 00:50:18.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

906
00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:19.690
<v Speaker 2>you got three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

907
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:24.990
<v Speaker 2>you're going to live them anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Devote those three years to setting the </v>

908
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:29.401
<v Speaker 2>world around you so that it's the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>it can possibly for you as if you were </v>

909
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:33.320
<v Speaker 2>taking care of yourself as if you cared </v>
<v Speaker 2>for yourself.</v>

910
00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would that look like?</v>

911
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say just for the sake of argument,</v>

912
00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.920
<v Speaker 2>if you figured out where you were that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have,</v>

913
00:50:39.921 --> 00:50:42.950
<v Speaker 2>what would be best for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

914
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.570
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you never asked.</v>

915
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:53.470
<v Speaker 2>People don't ask and so life comes out </v>
<v Speaker 2>them like random snakes and they sort of</v>

916
00:50:54.231 --> 00:50:59.231
<v Speaker 2>fend them off and life goes by and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things don't work out the way people </v>

917
00:50:59.231 --> 00:51:03.611
<v Speaker 2>expected them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a huge part of that is they didn't </v>

918
00:51:03.611 --> 00:51:07.361
<v Speaker 2>know where they were because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't look or didn't know that they </v>

919
00:51:07.361 --> 00:51:07.361
<v Speaker 2>should look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ignorance,</v>

920
00:51:07.361 --> 00:51:09.620
<v Speaker 2>willful blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to great catastrophes,</v>

921
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:13.160
<v Speaker 2>and they never figured out where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to go or why.</v>

922
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a problem with figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you want to go and the problem is </v>

923
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:22.941
<v Speaker 2>is that you make your conditions for </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure clear to yourself and people </v>

924
00:51:22.941 --> 00:51:25.250
<v Speaker 2>don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you keep yourself in the fog,</v>

925
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.860
<v Speaker 2>then you can't tell when you screwed up.</v>

926
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Now that isn't so good because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>still screwing up.</v>

927
00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:33.620
<v Speaker 2>You're just to blind self blind to </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice.</v>

928
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Although in in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the short term that's less painful.</v>

929
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 2>If you make your criteria for success </v>
<v Speaker 2>are razor sharp,</v>

930
00:51:40.611 --> 00:51:45.611
<v Speaker 2>then you know every time you screw up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's great because then you could </v>

931
00:51:45.611 --> 00:51:48.330
<v Speaker 2>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could either repair the,</v>

932
00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:53.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the behavioral inadequacy or that </v>

933
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.800
<v Speaker 2>conceptual inadequacy that you're using </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a tool in that situation.</v>

934
00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you could adjust your damn plan</v>
<v Speaker 2>either way you can fix it and so,</v>

935
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:05.920
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're living in one of these bloody </v>

936
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.501
<v Speaker 2>things and you might as well it seems to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me you might as well make it the best </v>

937
00:52:08.501 --> 00:52:11.150
<v Speaker 2>one you could live in because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have anything better to do.</v>

938
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't do that,</v>

939
00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:19.211
<v Speaker 2>if you don't do it consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what the psychoanalyst </v>

940
00:52:19.211 --> 00:52:22.021
<v Speaker 2>pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you have innumerable quasi </v>

941
00:52:22.021 --> 00:52:26.470
<v Speaker 2>autonomous subsystems that make you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will generate stories impulsively,</v>

942
00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:29.510
<v Speaker 2>and you'll just act them out.</v>

943
00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:32.960
<v Speaker 2>And you know that because you watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself over two weeks and you think,</v>

944
00:52:32.961 --> 00:52:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of stupid things in the last</v>

945
00:52:34.881 --> 00:52:36.890
<v Speaker 2>two weeks and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

946
00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:40.580
<v Speaker 2>And it's because you're a random here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collection of somewhat random,</v>

947
00:52:40.581 --> 00:52:45.560
<v Speaker 2>quasi autonomous personality units and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lacking a leader.</v>

948
00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.810
<v Speaker 2>They're just going to fire off whenever </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want.</v>

949
00:52:47.811 --> 00:52:48.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first you're hungry,</v>

950
00:52:48.891 --> 00:52:53.891
<v Speaker 2>then you're thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you want to go to bed with your </v>

951
00:52:53.891 --> 00:52:53.891
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

952
00:52:53.891 --> 00:52:54.200
<v Speaker 2>then you want to sleep in and you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell your boss off.</v>

953
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:56.720
<v Speaker 2>Then you want to curse at the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>cuts you off in traffic.</v>

954
00:52:56.721 --> 00:52:59.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're kind of like a two year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

955
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:04.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just it's one emotional frame after </v>

956
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:08.231
<v Speaker 2>another vying for dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no overarching hierarchy and </v>

957
00:53:08.231 --> 00:53:10.880
<v Speaker 2>there's no king at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

958
00:53:10.881 --> 00:53:15.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already talked about pyramids of </v>

959
00:53:15.881 --> 00:53:17.891
<v Speaker 2>competence in what's supposed to be at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top is you want to bring all those </v>

960
00:53:17.891 --> 00:53:19.280
<v Speaker 2>things together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We understand this neurologically.</v>

961
00:53:19.281 --> 00:53:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you some of that in a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

962
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:23.190
<v Speaker 2>We understand this neurologically how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

963
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how this maps some sense right?</v>

964
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Onto the neural structure of your being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to put something in control and</v>

965
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:37.310
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you should put in control</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the bloody thing that pays attention </v>

966
00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:37.310
<v Speaker 1>and learns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

967
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Everything else in the hierarchy should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be subordinate to the thing that pays </v>

968
00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.880
<v Speaker 1>attention and learns and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

969
00:53:44.881 --> 00:53:45.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

970
00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:48.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the message of the idea of logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure,</v>

971
00:53:48.421 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 1>because logos is partly attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly communication and you learn a lot</v>

972
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:54.510
<v Speaker 1>by communicating with others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

973
00:53:54.511 --> 00:53:58.770
<v Speaker 1>so you need to know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like your gps,</v>

974
00:53:58.771 --> 00:54:03.771
<v Speaker 1>which has both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closest thing we have to an </v>

975
00:54:03.771 --> 00:54:04.120
<v Speaker 1>intelligent cybernetic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those gps is in your cars.</v>

976
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Those bloody things are pretty smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can.</v>

977
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.610
<v Speaker 1>They knew where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know where you're going,</v>

978
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:11.250
<v Speaker 1>and if you go off course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they recalculate you're route.</v>

979
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:13.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like those things are damn near </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

980
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:18.110
<v Speaker 1>That's so close to intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's and you can tell that because they </v>

981
00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:19.620
<v Speaker 1>act intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they solve problems continually.</v>

982
00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:24.980
<v Speaker 1>So you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a cybernetic model by the </v>

983
00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.831
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cybernetic models where the models </v>

984
00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:27.831
<v Speaker 1>on which the GPS systems were based so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not accidental.</v>

985
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:33.050
<v Speaker 1>So you need to know where you are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know where you're going and </v>

986
00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:34.710
<v Speaker 1>then the next thing you need to know is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is that you're going to act,</v>

987
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:40.190
<v Speaker 1>move your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to propel yourself </v>

988
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:41.610
<v Speaker 1>through time and space to transform this</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>

989
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

990
00:54:43.261 --> 00:54:48.261
<v Speaker 1>And then we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can make that a little bit more </v>

991
00:54:48.261 --> 00:54:48.420
<v Speaker 1>complex because it's a bit too simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll do this.</v>

992
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.420
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live in one of these,</v>

993
00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:56.730
<v Speaker 1>it's that you live in a nested hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these and you could think of this as </v>

994
00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:58.020
<v Speaker 1>your own internal patriarchy.</v>

995
00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:03.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it could be a tyrant or maybe </v>

996
00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.910
<v Speaker 1>it could be something that gives you </v>
<v Speaker 1>security and functional autonomy.</v>

997
00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully that's the one you go for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a battle,</v>

998
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:13.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a little bit of tyranny exists </v>

999
00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:18.081
<v Speaker 1>in everyone and so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the very highest level of </v>

1000
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be the overarching story.</v>

1001
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you think I'd like to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person or a successful person,</v>

1002
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.920
<v Speaker 1>famous person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think goods probably be better because</v>

1003
00:55:28.921 --> 00:55:33.921
<v Speaker 1>you can come up with the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>good if you want as long as it doesn't </v>

1004
00:55:33.921 --> 00:55:36.951
<v Speaker 1>annoy other people too badly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just get in your way and that </v>

1005
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 1>will be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to negotiate it.</v>

1006
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:45.650
<v Speaker 1>But let's say you're a good person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the story at the top of the </v>

1007
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:49.620
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and then you could depo </v>
<v Speaker 1>decompose that into your primary roles.</v>

1008
00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're a good employer or maybe </v>

1009
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you're a good employee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a good sibling.</v>

1010
00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a good child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1011
00:55:56.731 --> 00:55:58.740
<v Speaker 1>those are major roles that you have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

1012
00:55:58.741 --> 00:56:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd say that what good person </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1013
00:56:02.221 --> 00:56:05.310
<v Speaker 1>is what's good about you across all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those roles.</v>

1014
00:56:05.311 --> 00:56:06.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1015
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a higher order abstraction from </v>
<v Speaker 1>something more concrete.</v>

1016
00:56:09.421 --> 00:56:11.420
<v Speaker 1>And then you can take the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:12.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role,</v>

1018
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:15.150
<v Speaker 1>good parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>

1019
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:20.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that constitutes a good </v>

1020
00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:20.300
<v Speaker 1>parent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

1021
00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:20.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good parent,</v>

1022
00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:24.410
<v Speaker 1>this isn't exhaustive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a good parent has a good job </v>

1023
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and takes</v>

1024
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:26.920
<v Speaker 2>care of his or her family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he might say,</v>

1025
00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:29.740
<v Speaker 2>well what does it mean to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your family?</v>

1026
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1027
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:31.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1028
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:34.270
<v Speaker 2>you can cook the odd meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not too odd.</v>

1029
00:56:34.271 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully you can cook the meal and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can play with play with the baby.</v>

1030
00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.290
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how do you play with a baby?</v>

1031
00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:42.640
<v Speaker 2>And then he might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1032
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.790
<v Speaker 2>you play peekaboo with the baby or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tickle the baby.</v>

1033
00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then what's a cool,</v>

1034
00:56:47.261 --> 00:56:51.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a cool shift there because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is all articulated and conceptual,</v>

1035
00:56:51.731 --> 00:56:53.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right down to this level.</v>

1036
00:56:53.441 --> 00:56:58.441
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden it's your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>because how do you play peekaboo with a </v>

1037
00:56:58.441 --> 00:56:58.870
<v Speaker 2>baby?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like have a chat about how you</v>

1038
00:56:58.871 --> 00:57:00.470
<v Speaker 2>play peekaboo with a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1039
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:05.490
<v Speaker 2>You go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was quite sudden you can even do it </v>

1040
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:05.490
<v Speaker 2>with older people.</v>

1041
00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:05.950
<v Speaker 2>They even smile about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1042
00:57:05.951 --> 00:57:10.390
<v Speaker 2>It's dad's gone and the babies all </v>
<v Speaker 2>shocked to death about that.</v>

1043
00:57:10.391 --> 00:57:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Where'd he go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>

1044
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:12.890
<v Speaker 2>he's back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1045
00:57:12.891 --> 00:57:16.360
<v Speaker 2>it's the baby is playing with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliability of the world,</v>

1046
00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:19.100
<v Speaker 2>so it's real intense game for a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1047
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:22.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like we're now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad's gone and oh look.</v>

1048
00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:23.920
<v Speaker 2>He showed up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

1049
00:57:23.921 --> 00:57:28.921
<v Speaker 2>he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then dad smiling to indicate that </v>

1050
00:57:28.921 --> 00:57:32.131
<v Speaker 2>those brief flashes into nonexistence </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't existentially terrifying beyond </v>

1051
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:33.790
<v Speaker 2>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1052
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:38.791
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is is that if you're </v>

1053
00:57:38.791 --> 00:57:38.791
<v Speaker 2>playing peekaboo with the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking anymore.</v>

1054
00:57:38.791 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not in the realm of articulation or</v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction.</v>

1055
00:57:40.841 --> 00:57:43.120
<v Speaker 2>It's actually something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing with your body.</v>

1056
00:57:43.121 --> 00:57:48.121
<v Speaker 2>And so to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a nice multistage solution to </v>

1057
00:57:48.121 --> 00:57:50.170
<v Speaker 2>the mind body problem because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens is the highest,</v>

1058
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:54.040
<v Speaker 2>the higher order of obstruction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's articulated and conceptual,</v>

1059
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:58.870
<v Speaker 2>but if you decompose it sufficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up with an actual action.</v>

1060
00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:02.170
<v Speaker 2>And the action involves the movement of </v>
<v Speaker 2>musculature.</v>

1061
00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:05.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not something conceptual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that's really cool</v>

1062
00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:09.970
<v Speaker 2>about this hierarchy is that it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>educational lessons.</v>

1063
00:58:09.971 --> 00:58:14.971
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things you want to do if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to teach someone </v>

1064
00:58:14.971 --> 00:58:15.310
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even yourself is you want to,</v>

1065
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:20.790
<v Speaker 2>you want to specify the thing that needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be doing at the highest resolution </v>

1066
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:24.040
<v Speaker 2>possible level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you just a brief example.</v>

1067
00:58:24.041 --> 00:58:26.890
<v Speaker 2>So let's say I may have read maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>repeating this,</v>

1068
00:58:26.891 --> 00:58:31.891
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say you've got a three year old kid and </v>

1069
00:58:31.891 --> 00:58:31.891
<v Speaker 2>they're in their room is chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1070
00:58:31.891 --> 00:58:35.010
<v Speaker 2>There's monsters are going to be coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>out under the bed in no time flat unless</v>

1071
00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 2>that thing room get some order in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you,</v>

1072
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:39.910
<v Speaker 2>you tell the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean up the room,</v>

1073
00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.250
<v Speaker 2>you know it's a mess and you leave and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you come back.</v>

1074
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:44.050
<v Speaker 2>And the kid's like throwing legos </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

1075
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:49.051
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not cleaning up and then you </v>

1076
00:58:49.051 --> 00:58:50.110
<v Speaker 2>think that's a bad kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I had some bad theory because you're</v>

1077
00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:55.111
<v Speaker 2>going right from here to here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to have a good fight with </v>

1078
00:58:55.111 --> 00:58:56.530
<v Speaker 2>someone and destroy them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's what you do.</v>

1079
00:58:56.531 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 2>You don't bother with the subtleties </v>
<v Speaker 2>down here.</v>

1080
00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:01.240
<v Speaker 2>You just go right from the right for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>juggler.</v>

1081
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:03.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid kid.</v>

1082
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:05.620
<v Speaker 2>You've always been that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're hopeless.</v>

1083
00:59:05.621 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 2>There's not a chance of teaching you </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1084
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can.</v>

1085
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.900
<v Speaker 2>That way you can nail the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the present,</v>

1086
00:59:10.901 --> 00:59:12.550
<v Speaker 2>and the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the same insults.</v>

1087
00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:15.500
<v Speaker 2>You've always been a terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1088
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:18.640
<v Speaker 2>there's no teaching you and your future </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to be exactly the same way.</v>

1089
00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Then the only thing that person can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do that to the missile hit you </v>

1090
00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:23.970
<v Speaker 2>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1091
00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:26.570
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no coming back from that.</v>

1092
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:31.571
<v Speaker 2>You boxed them completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you want to have a really </v>

1093
00:59:31.571 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 2>unproductive argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go right for this past,</v>

1094
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:34.820
<v Speaker 2>present and future that you're not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good person.</v>

1095
00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:39.821
<v Speaker 2>Demolish their entire conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and expose them completely </v>

1096
00:59:39.821 --> 00:59:41.480
<v Speaker 2>naked to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like great,</v>

1097
00:59:41.481 --> 00:59:46.481
<v Speaker 2>you won the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good thing to do to your </v>

1098
00:59:46.481 --> 00:59:46.580
<v Speaker 2>longterm partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1099
00:59:46.581 --> 00:59:49.670
<v Speaker 2>unless you want them terrified out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their skull and,</v>

1100
00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:53.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized and their attitude towards</v>

1101
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:56.630
<v Speaker 2>you characterized by nonstop extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment,</v>

1102
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:58.790
<v Speaker 2>it's probably not going to do your love </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1103
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:00.980
<v Speaker 2>A hell of a lot of good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1104
01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.250
<v Speaker 2>So with the three year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe what you do is you say you,</v>

1105
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:09.270
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pick the level of analysis at which </v>

1106
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.270
<v Speaker 2>they're actually functioning and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1107
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:11.210
<v Speaker 2>and this is something you can do if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to a kid,</v>

1108
01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:14.060
<v Speaker 2>and lots of people won't pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>to children because they're terrified of</v>

1109
01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:14.210
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1110
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:19.570
<v Speaker 2>They're terrified that they'll do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something wrong with them and or the </v>

1111
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:20.210
<v Speaker 2>that the kid won't like them or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn thing.</v>

1112
01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:25.211
<v Speaker 2>It's like all you have to do to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid to like you is pay attention to the </v>

1113
01:00:25.211 --> 01:00:28.931
<v Speaker 2>kid for like two seconds and the kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>will instantly like you because </v>

1114
01:00:28.931 --> 01:00:30.650
<v Speaker 2>attention is so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a.</v>

1115
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the ultimate currency for children,</v>

1116
01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:34.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1117
01:00:34.451 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need adult attention because adults</v>

1118
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:38.900
<v Speaker 2>know way more than kids and so they love</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

1119
01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:40.460
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1120
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 2>They will like you instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So can you tell the kid,</v>

1121
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 2>you see that teddy bear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kid goes,</v>

1122
01:00:47.181 --> 01:00:52.181
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you've established that the child </v>

1123
01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:54.731
<v Speaker 2>has mastered the art of perceiving a </v>
<v Speaker 2>teddy bear because they can say yes.</v>

1124
01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:56.210
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complicated thing,</v>

1125
01:00:56.211 --> 01:00:58.250
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a six month old isn't going to</v>

1126
01:00:58.251 --> 01:00:59.000
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1127
01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Three month old has got the whole teddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear identification.</v>

1128
01:01:02.181 --> 01:01:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Sub Routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Automatized.</v>

1129
01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:05.720
<v Speaker 2>So teddy bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1130
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Can you pick it up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1131
01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Pat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pat,</v>

1132
01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:10.880
<v Speaker 2>pat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good work.</v>

1133
01:01:10.881 --> 01:01:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the hole on that shelf?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1134
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.190
<v Speaker 2>Can you put the teddy bear in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole?</v>

1135
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go over.</v>

1136
01:01:17.721 --> 01:01:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pat.</v>

1137
01:01:18.711 --> 01:01:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pat.</v>

1138
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1139
01:01:20.961 --> 01:01:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Now we'll do thing number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing number three.</v>

1140
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.080
<v Speaker 2>So you're building up the micro routines</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cleaning up the room from the bottom </v>

1141
01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.951
<v Speaker 2>up right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're building it into their body </v>

1142
01:01:32.951 --> 01:01:34.070
<v Speaker 2>because you're starting with the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've already automatized and building</v>

1143
01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:39.071
<v Speaker 2>upwards towards abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so once the kid has all the micro </v>

1144
01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>routines down and maybe there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many micro routines are</v>

1145
01:01:40.881 --> 01:01:43.010
<v Speaker 2>there to clean up your room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>200,</v>

1146
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:47.810
<v Speaker 2>like a lot but not an infinite number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you teach them all the micro routines</v>

1147
01:01:47.811 --> 01:01:51.680
<v Speaker 2>and then you can say run sat of micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>routines,</v>

1148
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:54.320
<v Speaker 2>which means clean up room and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do it.</v>

1149
01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 2>They know what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1150
01:01:56.210 --> 01:02:00.200
<v Speaker 2>But you do the building from the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and lots of times when you're arguing</v>

1151
01:02:00.201 --> 01:02:02.720
<v Speaker 2>with someone that you live with and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically love,</v>

1152
01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:06.350
<v Speaker 2>although those two things are hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get together in the same relationship.</v>

1153
01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want to do is assume is assume </v>

1154
01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:14.720
<v Speaker 2>stupidity before you assume total,</v>
<v Speaker 2>total malevolence.</v>

1155
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:15.440
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1156
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:17.810
<v Speaker 2>that's a good rule of thumb for </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishing peace.</v>

1157
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.830
<v Speaker 2>So maybe if your won't do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it's,</v>

1158
01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.040
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you might want to assume to begin </v>

1159
01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.231
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually just don't know how to do </v>

1160
01:02:30.231 --> 01:02:32.151
<v Speaker 2>it and you need to decompose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe there's a way you want to be </v>

1161
01:02:32.151 --> 01:02:35.301
<v Speaker 2>greeted when you come home because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to come home everyday </v>

1162
01:02:35.301 --> 01:02:38.330
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's a five minute </v>

1163
01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:39.180
<v Speaker 2>interaction or a 10 minute interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an hour a week or four hours a</v>

1164
01:02:39.181 --> 01:02:44.181
<v Speaker 2>month or 50 hours a year or one solid </v>
<v Speaker 2>work week of coming home interactions.</v>

1165
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is get 50 </v>

1166
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>interactions like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1167
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 2>And you've got your relationships sorted</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1168
01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.630
<v Speaker 2>If that's something that's really worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about because that's it.</v>

1169
01:02:54.631 --> 01:02:56.490
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just don't have that much time,</v>

1170
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:58.500
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the meals sorted out.</v>

1171
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:03.501
<v Speaker 2>That's about five hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your sleeping time arrangements </v>

1172
01:03:03.501 --> 01:03:07.521
<v Speaker 2>sorted out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fundamental interactions that </v>

1173
01:03:07.521 --> 01:03:07.521
<v Speaker 2>you repeat with your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1174
01:03:07.521 --> 01:03:11.640
<v Speaker 2>worked out voluntarily and negotiated </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to cover 80 percent of your</v>

1175
01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:16.641
<v Speaker 2>life that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it can just run as a routine </v>

1176
01:03:16.641 --> 01:03:17.490
<v Speaker 2>and that's really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't do that consciously,</v>

1177
01:03:17.491 --> 01:03:22.491
<v Speaker 2>especially because our roles have </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragmented in most of the traditional </v>

1178
01:03:22.491 --> 01:03:25.491
<v Speaker 2>roles of disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so nobody knows who the hell is </v>

1179
01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:25.491
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do what in the kitchen for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

1180
01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:29.880
<v Speaker 2>So nobody does anything except bitch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and make wretched meals or,</v>

1181
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 2>or by or by a fast food or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1182
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:34.750
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1183
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:39.770
<v Speaker 2>the alternative to that catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure or continual resentment and </v>

1184
01:03:40.051 --> 01:03:42.930
<v Speaker 2>fighting is to rebuild the structures </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the bottom up,</v>

1185
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:45.580
<v Speaker 2>using consensus in negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1186
01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:50.850
<v Speaker 2>and you can do that so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of that as the patriarchal </v>

1187
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:51.090
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>

1188
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:56.150
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly psychological because these </v>

1189
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:58.281
<v Speaker 2>are things you do as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also partly political and </v>

1190
01:03:58.281 --> 01:04:01.350
<v Speaker 2>economic and sociological because while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing each of these things,</v>

1191
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 2>you're also doing them in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>

1192
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:08.280
<v Speaker 2>hopefully not just socially acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually socially desirable.</v>

1193
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.530
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the decomposition.</v>

1194
01:04:11.531 --> 01:04:16.531
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that this keeps chaos at </v>
<v Speaker 2>bay is because it isn't because of your </v>

1195
01:04:16.531 --> 01:04:20.280
<v Speaker 2>belief systems keep chaos at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that abstract.</v>

1196
01:04:20.281 --> 01:04:22.710
<v Speaker 2>It's that if you do things right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do these things right,</v>

1197
01:04:22.711 --> 01:04:25.380
<v Speaker 2>then terrible things happened to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>with less frequency.</v>

1198
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.680
<v Speaker 2>And that's not cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's partly psychological because </v>

1199
01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't fight as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're not as anxious as much.</v>

1200
01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're not as depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it's just practical.</v>

1201
01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:35.160
<v Speaker 2>If you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

1202
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:37.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your kid doesn't leave his skateboard</v>

1203
01:04:37.711 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 2>on the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't break your neck as often.</v>

1204
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:46.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's not just psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a good thing not to </v>

1205
01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:49.701
<v Speaker 2>break your neck so often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this structure isn't merely </v>

1206
01:04:49.701 --> 01:04:51.750
<v Speaker 2>something that keeps things at bay </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically.</v>

1207
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's a,</v>

1208
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:59.630
<v Speaker 2>here's another look at a hierarchy of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of narrative,</v>

1209
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:07.390
<v Speaker 2>the structure that keeps chaos at bay </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is maybe the hierarchy that I </v>

1210
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:10.380
<v Speaker 2>engage in when I'm writing and I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things at the same time.</v>

1211
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Now that's what's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1212
01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:15.240
<v Speaker 2>like when I ask students what are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing when you write an essay?</v>

1213
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's hard question,</v>

1214
01:05:17.861 --> 01:05:21.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like while you're fasted,</v>

1215
01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:24.100
<v Speaker 2>important question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the first thing you should do.</v>

1216
01:05:24.101 --> 01:05:29.101
<v Speaker 2>If you're writing an essay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're paying attention to the </v>

1217
01:05:29.101 --> 01:05:31.381
<v Speaker 2>words and the phrases and the sentences </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sentence relationship between </v>

1218
01:05:31.381 --> 01:05:35.941
<v Speaker 2>the sentences within the paragraphs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the paragraph relationships to one </v>

1219
01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:39.020
<v Speaker 2>another within the essay and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say relevance to the class and the class</v>

1220
01:05:39.021 --> 01:05:44.021
<v Speaker 2>has relevance to your life and like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>essay bleeds out across your entire </v>

1221
01:05:44.291 --> 01:05:47.320
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if I'm writing something,</v>

1222
01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:52.570
<v Speaker 2>well obviously at the most highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution level of analysis,</v>

1223
01:05:52.571 --> 01:05:57.571
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually moving my fingers on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>keyboard and moving my eyes back and </v>

1224
01:05:57.571 --> 01:05:59.680
<v Speaker 2>forth on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where the mind meets the body.</v>

1225
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:05.130
<v Speaker 2>But then I'm trying to formulate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence and so I tried to think up a </v>

1226
01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:08.671
<v Speaker 2>good sentence that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nailing what I am trying to </v>

1227
01:06:08.671 --> 01:06:10.480
<v Speaker 2>formulate and then I tried to pick it </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart and I do that a bunch of ways.</v>

1228
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I take the sentence and I put it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>another page and then I write like 10 </v>

1229
01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 2>different variants of the sentence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see if I can get a better variant.</v>

1230
01:06:16.901 --> 01:06:20.590
<v Speaker 2>And then I try to think of ways that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a stupid sentence to see if I can,</v>

1231
01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:26.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a pry bar underneath it and loosen </v>

1232
01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:26.010
<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I can't do anything,</v>

1233
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:31.230
<v Speaker 2>if I can't manage that and I keep the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence that I've got and then I do </v>

1234
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:34.201
<v Speaker 2>that with 10 sentences in a paragraph </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I make sure the sentences are all </v>

1235
01:06:34.201 --> 01:06:37.861
<v Speaker 2>arranged properly in the paragraph the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way by rewriting a bunch of </v>

1236
01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:41.491
<v Speaker 2>different variants of it and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the word right and the phrase right </v>

1237
01:06:41.491 --> 01:06:42.040
<v Speaker 2>and the sentence right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the sentence order right.</v>

1238
01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:43.810
<v Speaker 2>And the paragraph order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1239
01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:48.280
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell what it's right enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I can't make it any better.</v>

1240
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.670
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean it's right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just means I can't improve it.</v>

1241
01:06:51.671 --> 01:06:56.671
<v Speaker 2>And so I get to the point where if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing a paragraph and I write a </v>

1242
01:06:56.671 --> 01:07:00.181
<v Speaker 2>variant and I can't tell if their </v>
<v Speaker 2>variant is any better and it might be </v>

1243
01:07:00.181 --> 01:07:03.301
<v Speaker 2>worse than I'm done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've hit the limit of my intellectual </v>

1244
01:07:03.301 --> 01:07:04.300
<v Speaker 2>capacity and it's time to move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

1245
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:07.930
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't like the essay that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>

1246
01:07:07.931 --> 01:07:12.931
<v Speaker 2>let's say has a boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tightly drawn around the essay </v>

1247
01:07:12.931 --> 01:07:14.320
<v Speaker 2>because there's a reason I'm writing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day I'm an essay and that would be.</v>

1248
01:07:14.321 --> 01:07:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to write a whole manuscript.</v>

1249
01:07:17.561 --> 01:07:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully I'm trying to address an </v>
<v Speaker 2>important problem because why would I be</v>

1250
01:07:20.261 --> 01:07:23.560
<v Speaker 2>doing it otherwise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that'd be kind of pointless.</v>

1251
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:28.240
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's part of my role as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist and that's a subset of my role</v>

1252
01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:29.050
<v Speaker 2>as a professor.</v>

1253
01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:32.290
<v Speaker 2>And then that's a subset of my role as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>productive citizen.</v>

1254
01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:37.291
<v Speaker 2>And then that's a subset of my role of </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who confronts the unknown.</v>

1255
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:42.960
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the logos is the thing </v>

1256
01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.221
<v Speaker 2>that's at the top of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how the hierarchy should be </v>

1257
01:07:47.221 --> 01:07:50.281
<v Speaker 2>structured is that everything else </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be see because you have a </v>

1258
01:07:50.281 --> 01:07:50.290
<v Speaker 2>structure and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1259
01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:52.030
<v Speaker 2>what should the structure be subordinate</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1260
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:56.110
<v Speaker 2>and then the answer should be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the structure should be subordinate</v>

1261
01:07:56.111 --> 01:08:01.111
<v Speaker 2>to the process that generates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure or the structure should be </v>

1262
01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:03.310
<v Speaker 2>subordinate to the process that </v>
<v Speaker 2>generates and maintains the structure.</v>

1263
01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Well obviously how could it be any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>way unless the structures perfect when </v>

1264
01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:12.130
<v Speaker 2>in which case you dispense with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that generates it and improves it,</v>

1265
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.990
<v Speaker 2>but then you're a totalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1266
01:08:13.991 --> 01:08:15.290
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got the answer.</v>

1267
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1268
01:08:16.071 --> 01:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

1269
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 2>People are still suffering and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>still dying.</v>

1270
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the damn answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so maybe you have an answer.</v>

1271
01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:28.541
<v Speaker 2>That means that there isn't quite as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much suffering and dying as there could </v>

1272
01:08:28.541 --> 01:08:31.841
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's plenty of road to be </v>

1273
01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:34.481
<v Speaker 2>traveled yet and so that all makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect sense that all of this should </v>

1274
01:08:34.821 --> 01:08:38.810
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be nested within this highest.</v>

1275
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I think of it sort of as the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>order of moral striving and then that </v>

1276
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:47.300
<v Speaker 2>also gives you a moral hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most important thing.</v>

1277
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:52.630
<v Speaker 2>You do that with artists speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do that with attention and honest </v>

1278
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:55.961
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you do that and you don't </v>

1279
01:08:55.961 --> 01:08:59.171
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice that to any of this because if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do then then you're hurting your </v>

1280
01:08:59.931 --> 01:09:04.931
<v Speaker 2>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there's the idea in the new </v>

1281
01:09:04.931 --> 01:09:07.121
<v Speaker 2>testament that the sin against the Holy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ghost is the one sin that can't be </v>

1282
01:09:07.121 --> 01:09:07.121
<v Speaker 2>forgiven.</v>

1283
01:09:07.121 --> 01:09:09.020
<v Speaker 2>No one knows what the hell that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it doesn't mean anything,</v>

1284
01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:14.320
<v Speaker 2>but I think this is what it means is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because this process generates all </v>

1285
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:19.700
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you violate that process,</v>

1286
01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:24.701
<v Speaker 2>then there's no hope for you because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the process by which you improve </v>

1287
01:09:24.701 --> 01:09:26.900
<v Speaker 2>yourself and everyone else to everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1288
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:29.060
<v Speaker 2>So if you decide you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage in that,</v>

1289
01:09:29.061 --> 01:09:30.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1290
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:35.080
<v Speaker 2>there's no fixing that because you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>blown apart your relationship with the </v>

1291
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:39.101
<v Speaker 2>thing that does the fixing and so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's how you keep chaos at bay.</v>

1292
01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:43.460
<v Speaker 2>And so part of that is structural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1293
01:09:43.461 --> 01:09:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Because you know how to do these things </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less,</v>

1294
01:09:46.611 --> 01:09:49.250
<v Speaker 2>it's part of your skill set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you happened to be a writer,</v>

1295
01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.900
<v Speaker 2>you could build one of these for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plumber.</v>

1296
01:09:50.901 --> 01:09:52.640
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't make any difference really.</v>

1297
01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Although the outside things should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>

1298
01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:59.960
<v Speaker 2>which is I think partly why in the Judeo</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian tradition,</v>

1299
01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:05.340
<v Speaker 2>there's the assumption that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally equal before God and what </v>

1300
01:10:05.571 --> 01:10:07.610
<v Speaker 2>that means is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1301
01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:12.670
<v Speaker 2>they should be a nested everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of their particularities,</v>

1302
01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.960
<v Speaker 2>particularities as individuals.</v>

1303
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Their highest order function is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do it in whatever manner they can </v>

1304
01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:24.611
<v Speaker 2>manage and that's an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable or maybe the most </v>

1305
01:10:24.611 --> 01:10:27.530
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily valuable sociological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political and economic function,</v>

1306
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:32.710
<v Speaker 2>and so that's why people are valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we have this faculty to </v>

1307
01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:37.151
<v Speaker 2>continually generate improvements to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that we jointly inhabit.</v>

1308
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gives us.</v>

1309
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.490
<v Speaker 2>It's so cool because that gives us a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental unity.</v>

1310
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:48.790
<v Speaker 2>We've got the highest order of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis with with the room for as much </v>

1311
01:10:49.461 --> 01:10:51.560
<v Speaker 2>diversity as you can possibly manage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1312
01:10:51.561 --> 01:10:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Because it actually turns out that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>more the substructures differ,</v>

1313
01:10:55.641 --> 01:11:00.641
<v Speaker 2>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then you know you can be doing </v>

1314
01:11:00.641 --> 01:11:02.531
<v Speaker 2>something different than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that would be good because if we're </v>

1315
01:11:02.531 --> 01:11:02.570
<v Speaker 2>doing the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's just duplication of labor.</v>

1316
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:07.571
<v Speaker 2>If we could agree on the higher order </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle and then specialize at the </v>

1317
01:11:07.571 --> 01:11:11.501
<v Speaker 2>lower order levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's you get to have your </v>

1318
01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:12.740
<v Speaker 2>cake and eat it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't happen very often.</v>

1319
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:16.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and so.</v>

1320
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Then another rule of thumb is if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to solve a problem,</v>

1321
01:11:19.711 --> 01:11:23.790
<v Speaker 2>solve it at this level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highest resolution level possible before</v>

1322
01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:28.350
<v Speaker 2>you dare move up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dare move up the hierarchy because the,</v>

1323
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.480
<v Speaker 2>as you move up the abstraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

1324
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:35.481
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you'll make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic error while attempting to </v>

1325
01:11:35.481 --> 01:11:38.010
<v Speaker 2>fix the problem radically increases </v>
<v Speaker 2>because abstraction is very,</v>

1326
01:11:38.011 --> 01:11:40.560
<v Speaker 2>very powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you want to be very careful.</v>

1327
01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:42.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean we saw that when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

1328
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.540
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the mortgage market crashed,</v>

1329
01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:50.541
<v Speaker 2>the reason it crashed was because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange use of derivatives and </v>

1330
01:11:50.541 --> 01:11:53.781
<v Speaker 2>derivatives are like higher order </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractions in the financial world and </v>

1331
01:11:53.781 --> 01:11:57.470
<v Speaker 2>derivatives give you tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial leverage and power with huge </v>

1332
01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:00.690
<v Speaker 2>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the upside is massive.</v>

1333
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely massive because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiply your earnings,</v>

1334
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:08.420
<v Speaker 2>but the downside is complete bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe and so part of what I would </v>

1335
01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:11.820
<v Speaker 2>say an intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative ethos is,</v>

1336
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:15.980
<v Speaker 2>is solve the problem at the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of resolution,</v>

1337
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.010
<v Speaker 2>highest level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>local,</v>

1338
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.750
<v Speaker 2>most local level of resolution.</v>

1339
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:22.860
<v Speaker 2>It's safer and it's more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually produce a solution.</v>

1340
01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1341
01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.320
<v Speaker 2>so now you're in your plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've simplified it again just to </v>

1342
01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.020
<v Speaker 2>one little map,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1343
01:12:31.021 --> 01:12:32.760
<v Speaker 2>But all those other things are nested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1344
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.360
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens to you as you stroll</v>
<v Speaker 2>merrily on your way through life?</v>

1345
01:12:38.431 --> 01:12:43.431
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that as you're moving </v>

1346
01:12:43.431 --> 01:12:45.351
<v Speaker 2>from point a to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you encounter things and people think </v>

1347
01:12:45.351 --> 01:12:48.390
<v Speaker 2>that what they encounter are objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the case.</v>

1348
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.710
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the things that you encounter,</v>

1349
01:12:50.711 --> 01:12:53.460
<v Speaker 2>many of the things are actually other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and they're not objects.</v>

1350
01:12:53.461 --> 01:12:58.110
<v Speaker 2>They're too damn complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even apart from the social world,</v>

1351
01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.420
<v Speaker 2>the things that you encounter aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>objects.</v>

1352
01:13:00.421 --> 01:13:03.270
<v Speaker 2>They seem to be something more like </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools or obstacles.</v>

1353
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:06.930
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean that we see objects and</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn them into tools or obstacles.</v>

1354
01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:11.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean that we see tools and obstacles </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what happens is that when new </v>

1355
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:15.830
<v Speaker 2>array yourself towards a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the world transforms itself into </v>

1356
01:13:17.371 --> 01:13:20.310
<v Speaker 2>things that get in the way of that goal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and things that three things,</v>

1357
01:13:20.311 --> 01:13:22.490
<v Speaker 2>things that get in the way of the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1358
01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Those are things you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that facilitate your movement </v>

1359
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:30.891
<v Speaker 2>towards the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are things that you like and </v>

1360
01:13:30.891 --> 01:13:33.710
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant things and mostly you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant things because there's just </v>

1361
01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:37.551
<v Speaker 2>too damn many things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the category of irrelevant is when </v>

1362
01:13:37.551 --> 01:13:38.440
<v Speaker 2>you really like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most of the things,</v>

1363
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>most of everything is irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a good plan,</v>

1364
01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:46.160
<v Speaker 2>a few things are good because they move </v>
<v Speaker 2>you forward and some other things are </v>

1365
01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.280
<v Speaker 2>not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to go around the not so good </v>

1366
01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:49.280
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can manage them,</v>

1367
01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.790
<v Speaker 2>unless you'd like to run head forth into</v>
<v Speaker 2>like brick walls,</v>

1368
01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:53.520
<v Speaker 2>which is not particularly so learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

1369
01:13:53.521 --> 01:13:55.110
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't repeat it too many times.</v>

1370
01:13:55.830 --> 01:14:00.830
<v Speaker 2>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want the world to array itself as a </v>

1371
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:01.320
<v Speaker 2>set of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could say tools.</v>

1372
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Now what happens is that you have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual system that's mediated by </v>

1373
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:10.311
<v Speaker 2>dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same system that cocaine </v>

1374
01:14:10.311 --> 01:14:10.890
<v Speaker 2>activates or methamphetamine or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that people really like to,</v>

1375
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:16.590
<v Speaker 2>and it's the dopaminergic system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>responds with positive emotion to </v>

1376
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:20.941
<v Speaker 2>indications that you've encountered </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that will facilitate your </v>

1377
01:14:20.941 --> 01:14:23.791
<v Speaker 2>movement towards a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's really important to know </v>

1378
01:14:23.791 --> 01:14:26.320
<v Speaker 2>because people tend to think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're happy because they achieve goals</v>

1379
01:14:26.321 --> 01:14:29.890
<v Speaker 2>and that's not true what's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because as soon as you achieve a goal,</v>

1380
01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:32.050
<v Speaker 2>then you have a problem which is what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next goal,</v>

1381
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's actually a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You encounter that as soon as you </v>

1382
01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:37.200
<v Speaker 2>graduate from university for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1383
01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:42.210
<v Speaker 2>I made this joke before they graduation </v>
<v Speaker 2>day yours like king of the university </v>

1384
01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:45.640
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate hierarchy day after you're</v>

1385
01:14:45.641 --> 01:14:48.130
<v Speaker 2>unemployed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential starbucks employee.</v>

1386
01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like.</v>

1387
01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.900
<v Speaker 2>So obviously the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1388
01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the accomplishment per se as a source of</v>

1389
01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:59.821
<v Speaker 2>reward is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is problematic because when you </v>

1390
01:14:59.821 --> 01:14:59.821
<v Speaker 2>accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you run the,</v>

1391
01:14:59.821 --> 01:15:03.220
<v Speaker 2>the frame to its end and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem of needing a new frame.</v>

1392
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if what you're encountering instead </v>

1393
01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.130
<v Speaker 2>are things that will move you along your</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1394
01:15:09.131 --> 01:15:09.790
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1395
01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:14.791
<v Speaker 2>that's great and that's where you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your positive motivation and so that's </v>

1396
01:15:14.791 --> 01:15:15.880
<v Speaker 2>really thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so much we're thinking about.</v>

1397
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:21.120
<v Speaker 2>You can think about that for a year and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't even be enough to think </v>

1398
01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.971
<v Speaker 2>about it because here's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means in some sense that the </v>

1399
01:15:23.971 --> 01:15:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Buddhists are right with their claim </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Maya M,</v>

1400
01:15:25.091 --> 01:15:30.091
<v Speaker 2>a y a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means that people live in an </v>

1401
01:15:30.091 --> 01:15:30.580
<v Speaker 2>illusion and what they mean by that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you have goal,</v>

1402
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:35.970
<v Speaker 2>whatever your goal is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that goal gives relevance to the </v>

1403
01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:39.751
<v Speaker 2>world and you could change the relevance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world and the snap just by </v>

1404
01:15:39.751 --> 01:15:41.590
<v Speaker 2>changing your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do that.</v>

1405
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.640
<v Speaker 2>And so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1406
01:15:42.641 --> 01:15:44.890
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of an illusion because you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>just change it.</v>

1407
01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to push that line of </v>

1408
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.781
<v Speaker 2>argumentation too far because even if </v>
<v Speaker 2>the specific point can be changed,</v>

1409
01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.890
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you're in one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>frames cannot be changed.</v>

1410
01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.740
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to be in a frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although you get to pick the frame.</v>

1411
01:15:59.741 --> 01:16:04.741
<v Speaker 2>So there's still an absolute there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that you have to be in a frame </v>

1412
01:16:04.741 --> 01:16:05.350
<v Speaker 2>and that is not a trivial absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very.</v>

1413
01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a very major absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>

1414
01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:10.360
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of your positive emotion is going to</v>

1415
01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:12.940
<v Speaker 2>be experienced in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>

1416
01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Well then we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you could use some positive </v>

1417
01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:18.540
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good thing.</v>

1418
01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Positive emotion inhibits anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment and frustration and pain.</v>

1419
01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:27.640
<v Speaker 2>It does all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technically it does that.</v>

1420
01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.300
<v Speaker 2>That's why a football player with broken</v>
<v Speaker 2>thumb who wants to score a touchdown can</v>

1421
01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:33.910
<v Speaker 2>go out there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play the football game,</v>

1422
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:36.490
<v Speaker 2>even though it's a kind of an arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>

1423
01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:37.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1424
01:16:37.061 --> 01:16:42.061
<v Speaker 2>really you're going to go out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk your hand to fire a pigskin through</v>

1425
01:16:42.971 --> 01:16:44.920
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some polls.</v>

1426
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:50.250
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can say the same sort of </v>

1427
01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:50.620
<v Speaker 2>cynical thing about most of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people do,</v>

1428
01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:55.650
<v Speaker 2>but you can't say the cynical thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that they have to do </v>

1429
01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:56.440
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a,</v>

1430
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.510
<v Speaker 2>you have a point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have your aim,</v>

1431
01:16:58.511 --> 01:17:03.511
<v Speaker 2>you have your ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that's what turns the world </v>

1432
01:17:03.511 --> 01:17:04.900
<v Speaker 2>into a potentially positive place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the kicker.</v>

1433
01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:08.170
<v Speaker 2>This is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The higher they aim,</v>

1434
01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.750
<v Speaker 2>the more of the positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1435
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.730
<v Speaker 2>that's you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why should I bother?</v>

1436
01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Why should I bother doing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>lofty and difficult?</v>

1437
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like because it's worth it.</v>

1438
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:27.010
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the alternative is stupid </v>

1439
01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:27.530
<v Speaker 2>suffering because really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1440
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:32.531
<v Speaker 2>because what happens is like you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>need a framework in order to suffer.</v>

1441
01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.870
<v Speaker 2>You can just lay there day after day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer,</v>

1442
01:17:38.871 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's easy.</v>

1443
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:44.540
<v Speaker 2>So that's the default condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have a lofty ambition,</v>

1444
01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:49.900
<v Speaker 2>then you suffer miserably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is life is </v>

1445
01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:50.210
<v Speaker 2>really complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short,</v>

1446
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.690
<v Speaker 2>finite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full of suffering and beyond you.</v>

1447
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:56.630
<v Speaker 2>And so you can just lay there and think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that and it's horrible.</v>

1448
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:59.510
<v Speaker 2>And so that's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not useful.</v>

1449
01:17:59.511 --> 01:18:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1450
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.960
<v Speaker 2>people often say life is meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1451
01:18:02.961 --> 01:18:03.830
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1452
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:06.050
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was meaningless.</v>

1453
01:18:06.051 --> 01:18:07.910
<v Speaker 2>That'd be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just sit there and do nothing.</v>

1454
01:18:07.911 --> 01:18:08.960
<v Speaker 2>And it wouldn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1455
01:18:08.961 --> 01:18:13.961
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like you were lobotomized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sheep is just irrelevant.</v>

1456
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:18.200
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't what happens when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that life has no meaning.</v>

1457
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:22.520
<v Speaker 2>That isn't what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they mean is I'm suffering stupidly</v>

1458
01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:25.220
<v Speaker 2>and intensely and I don't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do about it.</v>

1459
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the suffering is meaningful.</v>

1460
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:29.240
<v Speaker 2>It's just dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of meaning you want.</v>

1461
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:33.140
<v Speaker 2>So how do you get out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You adopt you,</v>

1462
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:37.460
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you note the baseline of suffering,</v>

1463
01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:39.020
<v Speaker 2>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1464
01:18:39.021 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>

1465
01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.170
<v Speaker 2>And then you say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1466
01:18:42.171 --> 01:18:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I need to do something that justifies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1467
01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's not so easy because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseline for suffering is high.</v>

1468
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:50.810
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to make something of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

1469
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:55.870
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that it's worthwhile to exist in the </v>

1470
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:56.330
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to do.</v>

1471
01:18:56.390 --> 01:19:01.390
<v Speaker 2>You have to aim at something that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>well structured that you can say,</v>

1472
01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:03.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earthquakes,</v>

1473
01:19:03.351 --> 01:19:05.870
<v Speaker 2>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death of my family,</v>

1474
01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:09.050
<v Speaker 2>dissolution of my goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate futility of life,</v>

1475
01:19:09.051 --> 01:19:10.970
<v Speaker 2>and the heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death of the universe.</v>

1476
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

1477
01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:15.470
<v Speaker 2>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1478
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:22.600
<v Speaker 2>so now here's an here's another </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicating factor.</v>

1479
01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:24.740
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1480
01:19:24.741 --> 01:19:29.741
<v Speaker 2>there's three things that you can run </v>
<v Speaker 2>into when you're going about your your </v>

1481
01:19:29.741 --> 01:19:34.720
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I would say if you're going to form </v>

1482
01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.270
<v Speaker 2>a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to form a plan,</v>

1483
01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:40.700
<v Speaker 2>look about three to five years out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future because beyond that you get </v>

1484
01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:44.951
<v Speaker 2>something called commentorial explosion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it means that there's so many </v>

1485
01:19:45.951 --> 01:19:50.951
<v Speaker 2>variables that you just can't predict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's not that much point looking </v>

1486
01:19:50.951 --> 01:19:52.580
<v Speaker 2>out 20 years because like what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what's going to happen in 20</v>

1487
01:19:52.581 --> 01:19:53.630
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1488
01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you've got,</v>

1489
01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can chart a course to three </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1490
01:19:58.521 --> 01:19:59.720
<v Speaker 2>five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1491
01:19:59.721 --> 01:20:04.721
<v Speaker 2>So that's not a bad segment of time too </v>
<v Speaker 2>to consider and then consider what your </v>

1492
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.200
<v Speaker 2>life would have to be like in order for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be worthwhile for you.</v>

1493
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Knowing also what you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like if it isn't worthwhile for you and </v>

1494
01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:17.940
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to be like if it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>worthwhile for you is cane.</v>

1495
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's what that story's about.</v>

1496
01:20:21.931 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Because Abel is the guy who has a goal </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this making the proper sacrifices and</v>

1497
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Cain is the person for whom by his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>faults,</v>

1498
01:20:29.551 --> 01:20:32.130
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things aren't working out for.</v>

1499
01:20:32.131 --> 01:20:37.131
<v Speaker 2>And so the default for not doing this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like building resentment,</v>

1500
01:20:37.621 --> 01:20:41.010
<v Speaker 2>bitterness with an underlying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>

1501
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:45.330
<v Speaker 2>flavor enhancer of murderous resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

1502
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:50.420
<v Speaker 2>which you will act out in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>which people act out in the world all </v>

1503
01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:52.230
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's no wonder because without this,</v>

1504
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:57.290
<v Speaker 2>without something lofty pulling you </v>
<v Speaker 2>along than the baseline is stupid </v>

1505
01:20:57.961 --> 01:20:59.130
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1506
01:20:59.131 --> 01:21:04.131
<v Speaker 2>if you take an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dog and you just change it in the </v>

1507
01:21:04.131 --> 01:21:04.131
<v Speaker 2>backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when you put a collar on it,</v>

1508
01:21:04.131 --> 01:21:04.131
<v Speaker 2>there's too tight.</v>

1509
01:21:04.131 --> 01:21:07.710
<v Speaker 2>So it chafes all the time and it can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even bark and you know,</v>

1510
01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:11.010
<v Speaker 2>there's just dirt around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too God damn hot out in the sun and</v>

1511
01:21:11.011 --> 01:21:13.070
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't give it enough water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1512
01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be very happy dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basic condition is misery.</v>

1513
01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Well the same applies to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1514
01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:27.300
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're on your way to see you </v>

1515
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.040
<v Speaker 2>remember the survey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've all probably watched Pinocchio or</v>

1516
01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:34.041
<v Speaker 2>know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happens that's </v>

1517
01:21:34.041 --> 01:21:36.050
<v Speaker 2>really cool in Pinocchio is that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Decides that he wants his puppet to </v>

1518
01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:41.421
<v Speaker 2>be a genuine autonomous being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wishes upon a star.</v>

1519
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:47.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody just swallows it because </v>

1520
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:49.971
<v Speaker 2>we don't notice when we're swallowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are that are completely </v>

1521
01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:53.841
<v Speaker 2>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it's this animated puppeteer </v>

1522
01:21:53.841 --> 01:21:56.760
<v Speaker 2>wishes on a star that is puppet is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to become real,</v>

1523
01:21:56.761 --> 01:21:57.990
<v Speaker 2>and everybody nodded their head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

1524
01:21:57.991 --> 01:21:59.130
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

1525
01:21:59.280 --> 01:21:59.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1526
01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:02.160
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense at all,</v>

1527
01:22:02.161 --> 01:22:07.161
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make the sort of sense that </v>

1528
01:22:07.161 --> 01:22:09.711
<v Speaker 2>we normally associate with sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes it kind of medicines and </v>

1529
01:22:09.711 --> 01:22:12.861
<v Speaker 2>everybody understands it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is what your pedal is doing is </v>

1530
01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:14.070
<v Speaker 2>he's elevating his eyes above the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horizon.</v>

1531
01:22:14.071 --> 01:22:17.280
<v Speaker 2>So out of the realm of the worldly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1532
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:20.460
<v Speaker 2>to the transcendent and the transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 2>will say,</v>

1533
01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:25.610
<v Speaker 2>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the transcendent spread </v>

1534
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:25.610
<v Speaker 2>above you in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1535
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:25.610
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1536
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:28.190
<v Speaker 2>in the heaven that arches over us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1537
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:33.250
<v Speaker 2>it's close enough for our purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a star there and it started </v>

1538
01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:34.800
<v Speaker 2>something that's eternal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shines in the darkness.</v>

1539
01:22:34.801 --> 01:22:37.800
<v Speaker 2>And so Japan makes an agreement with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent.</v>

1540
01:22:37.801 --> 01:22:38.400
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1541
01:22:38.401 --> 01:22:42.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to do whatever it takes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>my creation becomes autonomous.</v>

1542
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.410
<v Speaker 2>While that's exactly the situation that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to set up for yourself is like,</v>

1543
01:22:46.411 --> 01:22:51.411
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to figure out what star you're </v>

1544
01:22:51.411 --> 01:22:53.970
<v Speaker 2>going to orient yourself by and you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ask yourself like no one's ever asked</v>

1545
01:22:53.971 --> 01:22:54.090
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1546
01:22:54.090 --> 01:22:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had the choice to make your life </v>

1547
01:22:59.090 --> 01:23:01.020
<v Speaker 2>worth living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your price?</v>

1548
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.200
<v Speaker 2>What do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just find out.</v>

1549
01:23:04.201 --> 01:23:05.860
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ask,</v>

1550
01:23:05.861 --> 01:23:08.380
<v Speaker 2>you'll tell yourself like you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid because he thought,</v>

1551
01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll never get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1552
01:23:09.701 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower your sights a little bit.</v>

1553
01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:16.291
<v Speaker 2>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ask for a 80 foot super yacht in </v>

1554
01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:17.050
<v Speaker 2>like six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just means you're stupid.</v>

1555
01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:19.900
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1556
01:23:19.901 --> 01:23:21.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to make you happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

1557
01:23:21.551 --> 01:23:22.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not.</v>

1558
01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not wise.</v>

1559
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.240
<v Speaker 2>You're asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be asking yourself </v>

1560
01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:30.240
<v Speaker 2>this question like you're someone you </v>
<v Speaker 2>care about.</v>

1561
01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:34.680
<v Speaker 2>So you imagine you're talking to some 12</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old kid that you kind of like </v>

1562
01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be so bad if this 12 year old</v>

1563
01:23:35.441 --> 01:23:38.780
<v Speaker 2>kid at a decent life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Youtube,</v>

1564
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.970
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be so bad.</v>

1565
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
<v Speaker 2>The universe wouldn't mind if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decent life if there was little less </v>

1566
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:45.370
<v Speaker 2>suffering on your part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specially if you didn't,</v>

1567
01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foisted off on other people.</v>

1568
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.920
<v Speaker 2>If there's a little less suffering on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your part and you made things a little </v>

1569
01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.620
<v Speaker 2>better everywhere you went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the universe would probably be</v>

1570
01:23:53.621 --> 01:23:55.300
<v Speaker 2>okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could.</v>

1571
01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:58.030
<v Speaker 2>I think you could get away with it if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a sort of quiet about it.</v>

1572
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.420
<v Speaker 2>And so now ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1573
01:24:01.421 --> 01:24:05.500
<v Speaker 2>so then once you've established your </v>
<v Speaker 2>target and you know where you are,</v>

1574
01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:09.100
<v Speaker 2>then you know what's good for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that moves you along.</v>

1575
01:24:09.101 --> 01:24:12.250
<v Speaker 2>And that happens at a perceptual level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to think about it anymore</v>

1576
01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:15.250
<v Speaker 2>and the experimental literature and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already quite clear.</v>

1577
01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:20.251
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I specify that podium as the target </v>

1578
01:24:20.251 --> 01:24:21.920
<v Speaker 2>for my action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1579
01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:27.060
<v Speaker 2>then I'm happy when I'm walking towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because there it is in everything </v>

1580
01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:27.060
<v Speaker 2>cooperating really nicely.</v>

1581
01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Then if I specify going to the exit sign</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you guys can't see,</v>

1582
01:24:31.181 --> 01:24:32.870
<v Speaker 2>that's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1583
01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.040
<v Speaker 2>that this is an obstacle in the front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1584
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Then as soon as I specify that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's an annoying obstacle.</v>

1585
01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:42.140
<v Speaker 2>And that's pre-cognitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happens immediately.</v>

1586
01:24:42.141 --> 01:24:46.300
<v Speaker 2>It happens instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it really is the case that you,</v>

1587
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1588
01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:51.460
<v Speaker 2>you're being manifests itself inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>these frames.</v>

1589
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.250
<v Speaker 2>And so what's so cool about that is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can change the frame.</v>

1590
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:57.610
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you can like juggle </v>
<v Speaker 2>planets or anything like that,</v>

1591
01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:01.090
<v Speaker 2>but it does give you quite a scope of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1592
01:25:01.210 --> 01:25:06.210
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what untrammeled action within the </v>

1593
01:25:06.210 --> 01:25:09.571
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the frame isn't working out then </v>

1594
01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:11.371
<v Speaker 2>you can tweak it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or sometimes you have to make a major </v>

1595
01:25:11.371 --> 01:25:11.371
<v Speaker 2>adjustment in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1596
01:25:11.371 --> 01:25:13.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to stick to the damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing like it's the ideology that you're</v>

1597
01:25:13.151 --> 01:25:14.320
<v Speaker 2>going to die for.</v>

1598
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.080
<v Speaker 2>It's attended of plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a work in progress and it's,</v>

1599
01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:19.480
<v Speaker 2>and that's with the future authoring </v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

1600
01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:24.481
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I recommend for people</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they should do it badly because </v>

1601
01:25:24.481 --> 01:25:25.150
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get it right </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

1602
01:25:25.151 --> 01:25:29.860
<v Speaker 2>but a reasonable plan is way better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>no plan.</v>

1603
01:25:29.861 --> 01:25:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Plus a reasonable plan is a plan that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has built into it.</v>

1604
01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:37.720
<v Speaker 2>The processes that will enable the plan </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get better as you implement it,</v>

1605
01:25:37.721 --> 01:25:41.410
<v Speaker 2>so you just start with a reasonable plan</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't have to worry about whether</v>

1606
01:25:41.411 --> 01:25:43.750
<v Speaker 2>it's correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not correct,</v>

1607
01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.060
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better than nothing.</v>

1608
01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:47.380
<v Speaker 2>That's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

1609
01:25:47.381 --> 01:25:52.381
<v Speaker 2>so you've got the world parsed up into </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are making or making you </v>

1610
01:25:52.381 --> 01:25:57.151
<v Speaker 2>happy when you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that get in the way that produce </v>

1611
01:25:57.151 --> 01:26:01.321
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion and then a whole host </v>
<v Speaker 2>of irrelevant things because almost </v>

1612
01:26:01.321 --> 01:26:03.830
<v Speaker 2>everything is irrelevant and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>where all the chaos is hiding.</v>

1613
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:08.300
<v Speaker 2>The chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1614
01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.600
<v Speaker 2>and that's very interesting observation </v>
<v Speaker 2>because since the chaos is virtually </v>

1615
01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:13.600
<v Speaker 2>infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real questions.</v>

1616
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Where the hell do you put it while you </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in,</v>

1617
01:26:15.891 --> 01:26:20.891
<v Speaker 2>what you ignore and you can ignore it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>long as it isn't actively interfering </v>

1618
01:26:20.891 --> 01:26:22.190
<v Speaker 2>with your movement forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can assume that it's,</v>

1619
01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:27.170
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't matter that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter that it doesn't matter.</v>

1620
01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>

1621
01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:31.440
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the kicker.</v>

1622
01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:36.441
<v Speaker 2>There's one more class of things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can run into along the way and this </v>

1623
01:26:37.141 --> 01:26:39.990
<v Speaker 2>is where the chaos breaks through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say</v>

1624
01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:51.240
<v Speaker 2>you're moving from point a to point b </v>
<v Speaker 2>and something that you don't expect </v>

1625
01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:56.580
<v Speaker 2>occurs and it gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that you're living with </v>

1626
01:26:58.121 --> 01:27:03.121
<v Speaker 2>someone and maybe you kind of like them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not married so you don't like </v>

1627
01:27:03.121 --> 01:27:03.760
<v Speaker 2>them that much because otherwise you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask them to marry you.</v>

1628
01:27:03.761 --> 01:27:05.890
<v Speaker 2>But anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1629
01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:11.090
<v Speaker 2>and so a quarter view is looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>something better and three quarters view</v>

1630
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:13.000
<v Speaker 2>is half satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1631
01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:17.650
<v Speaker 2>And then a person because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>ambivalent about such things.</v>

1632
01:27:17.651 --> 01:27:22.651
<v Speaker 2>And then the person you discover or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person announces that they've been </v>

1633
01:27:22.651 --> 01:27:23.350
<v Speaker 2>having an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1634
01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:26.500
<v Speaker 2>So then how are you supposed to respond </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally to that?</v>

1635
01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the part of you that wasn't all that </v>

1636
01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:31.860
<v Speaker 2>committed to the relationship is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>exhilarated by that.</v>

1637
01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:34.510
<v Speaker 2>And then the three quarters of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's half satisfied is hurt and,</v>

1638
01:27:34.810 --> 01:27:39.810
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to exploit that part </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure in the ensuing discussions and </v>

1639
01:27:39.810 --> 01:27:39.810
<v Speaker 2>not mention the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1640
01:27:39.810 --> 01:27:42.130
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of exciting that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>betrayed me that way.</v>

1641
01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:44.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1642
01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.170
<v Speaker 2>but the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you,</v>

1643
01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:52.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what's happened is a whole has you </v>

1644
01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.070
<v Speaker 2>have this structure that you're walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>on ice,</v>

1645
01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:59.100
<v Speaker 2>like the thin ice that you're skating on</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now there's a hole in it and the </v>

1646
01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.460
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even know how deep the hole is,</v>

1647
01:28:00.461 --> 01:28:03.370
<v Speaker 2>but you know there's a hole there and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're anxious about it.</v>

1648
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll maybe also a little bit excited </v>

1649
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.390
<v Speaker 2>because God only knows what's down </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1650
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:11.940
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know what to do with that </v>

1651
01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:12.970
<v Speaker 2>whole because it could spread very badly</v>
<v Speaker 2>on you.</v>

1652
01:28:12.971 --> 01:28:17.971
<v Speaker 2>It could be that you know the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship was a facade and that all </v>

1653
01:28:18.401 --> 01:28:20.620
<v Speaker 2>your relationships have been facades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facades,</v>

1654
01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.800
<v Speaker 2>and that the reason that is is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're so damn shallow that it's </v>

1655
01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.591
<v Speaker 2>impossible for you to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship that isn't just a facade </v>

1656
01:28:28.591 --> 01:28:32.100
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly because you don't pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>any attention to other people and it's </v>

1657
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:32.170
<v Speaker 2>also partly because you're malevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and selfish,</v>

1658
01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.500
<v Speaker 2>so that's a nasty thing to discover or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the sort of person that </v>

1659
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.710
<v Speaker 2>you're attracting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would make sense actually,</v>

1660
01:28:38.711 --> 01:28:41.320
<v Speaker 2>if that's the sort of person that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and so,</v>

1661
01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:46.000
<v Speaker 2>so there are certain things that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter that basically unglue you,</v>

1662
01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:51.360
<v Speaker 2>and what happens is that those moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being unglued travel up that entire </v>

1663
01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.630
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy of presuppositions.</v>

1664
01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:58.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like because the one of the logical</v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusions to being betrayed in a </v>

1665
01:28:58.070 --> 01:29:00.550
<v Speaker 2>relationship is that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're truly a bad person.</v>

1666
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Now another equally logical conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the person that you're with is </v>

1667
01:29:06.991 --> 01:29:11.991
<v Speaker 2>really a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and another logical conclusion is all </v>

1668
01:29:11.991 --> 01:29:12.960
<v Speaker 2>people are truly bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1669
01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:15.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1670
01:29:15.291 --> 01:29:16.460
<v Speaker 2>in macro ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

1671
01:29:16.461 --> 01:29:18.180
<v Speaker 2>in microwaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't trust anyone.</v>

1672
01:29:18.181 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 2>You can't trust women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't trust men.</v>

1673
01:29:19.861 --> 01:29:22.050
<v Speaker 2>You can't trust human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't trust yourself.</v>

1674
01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:25.380
<v Speaker 2>The whole place is a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a nightmare.</v>

1675
01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can fall through into chaos.</v>

1676
01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Now the way your body responds to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when some,</v>

1677
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:34.110
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you know you're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a promotion at work,</v>

1678
01:29:34.111 --> 01:29:39.111
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're all chipper about the promotion </v>

1679
01:29:39.111 --> 01:29:39.780
<v Speaker 2>at work and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you walk into your boss's office because</v>

1680
01:29:39.781 --> 01:29:43.530
<v Speaker 2>he or she wants to see you and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1681
01:29:43.531 --> 01:29:46.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've reviewed your performance over the</v>

1682
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:51.950
<v Speaker 2>last few years and your performance has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been somewhere between mediocre and </v>

1683
01:29:53.441 --> 01:29:56.760
<v Speaker 2>decent and we're downsizing and see you </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

1684
01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.590
<v Speaker 2>That's not a raise or a promotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1685
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:05.790
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole that you fall into and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the question is,</v>

1686
01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:07.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of that?</v>

1687
01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.390
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you frame that?</v>

1688
01:30:09.391 --> 01:30:13.230
<v Speaker 2>How do you take that emergent chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make habitable order out of?</v>

1689
01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:16.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the whole capitalist system rotten to</v>

1690
01:30:16.561 --> 01:30:17.760
<v Speaker 2>the core?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1691
01:30:17.761 --> 01:30:20.520
<v Speaker 2>that's a convenient explanation under </v>
<v Speaker 2>those circumstances.</v>

1692
01:30:20.521 --> 01:30:25.521
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you're working for a psychopathic </v>

1693
01:30:25.521 --> 01:30:28.221
<v Speaker 2>son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you make the wrong choice in </v>

1694
01:30:28.221 --> 01:30:31.401
<v Speaker 2>university and was that your father's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fault because you never did what you </v>

1695
01:30:31.401 --> 01:30:34.581
<v Speaker 2>wanted or was it your fault for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up to them or is it a dying </v>

1696
01:30:34.581 --> 01:30:38.660
<v Speaker 2>industry or is maybe there's a wake up </v>
<v Speaker 2>call that you should go do something </v>

1697
01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:41.601
<v Speaker 2>else that you've been waiting to do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you've actually wanted to do </v>

1698
01:30:41.601 --> 01:30:45.021
<v Speaker 2>your whole life and that's why you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing such a miserable job at your </v>

1699
01:30:45.021 --> 01:30:48.471
<v Speaker 2>current occupation because you're bitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and resentful about the fact that you </v>

1700
01:30:48.471 --> 01:30:48.471
<v Speaker 2>never did what you want.</v>

1701
01:30:48.471 --> 01:30:53.030
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all of those things at once and </v>

1702
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:56.061
<v Speaker 2>that's very stressful because all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things at once is too many things </v>

1703
01:30:56.061 --> 01:30:59.220
<v Speaker 2>and that's the reemergence of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the flood.</v>

1704
01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:02.490
<v Speaker 2>That's the return to the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos.</v>

1705
01:31:02.491 --> 01:31:04.170
<v Speaker 2>That's another way that it's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>represented.</v>

1706
01:31:04.171 --> 01:31:09.171
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead you voyage all the way back to </v>

1707
01:31:09.171 --> 01:31:12.021
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the cosmos when there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but undifferentiated chaos and </v>

1708
01:31:12.021 --> 01:31:15.750
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're confronting and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too much for you and often it is.</v>

1709
01:31:15.751 --> 01:31:20.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean that that can really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be traumatizing and it can hurt</v>

1710
01:31:20.941 --> 01:31:25.941
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's just too much for you to </v>

1711
01:31:25.941 --> 01:31:25.941
<v Speaker 2>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1712
01:31:25.941 --> 01:31:27.420
<v Speaker 2>You're stuck with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so how do you respond to that?</v>

1713
01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it is catastrophic negative </v>

1714
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:35.001
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You freeze and that's protective and </v>

1715
01:31:35.001 --> 01:31:35.001
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't even want to move.</v>

1716
01:31:35.001 --> 01:31:39.020
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to bloody well get out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bed for a week and that's because your </v>

1717
01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:42.621
<v Speaker 2>body is reacting as if the bedroom floor</v>
<v Speaker 2>is covered with snakes and the best </v>

1718
01:31:42.621 --> 01:31:44.310
<v Speaker 2>thing for you to do is just not move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just freeze.</v>

1719
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Not a pleasant situation to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's your hyperaroused very,</v>

1720
01:31:49.381 --> 01:31:54.381
<v Speaker 2>very physiologically demanding and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's zero about it that's productive </v>

1721
01:31:54.381 --> 01:31:56.190
<v Speaker 2>except maybe the snakes won't see you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've already seen you,</v>

1722
01:31:56.191 --> 01:32:01.191
<v Speaker 2>so that isn't helping very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got all this undifferentiated </v>

1723
01:32:01.191 --> 01:32:01.191
<v Speaker 2>native,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion,</v>

1724
01:32:01.191 --> 01:32:02.140
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>

1725
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.010
<v Speaker 2>hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>

1726
01:32:03.011 --> 01:32:03.910
<v Speaker 2>guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame,</v>

1727
01:32:03.911 --> 01:32:07.000
<v Speaker 2>emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole plethora of catastrophes.</v>

1728
01:32:07.210 --> 01:32:10.720
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe on the other side lurking</v>
<v Speaker 2>down there is,</v>

1729
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:13.730
<v Speaker 2>thank God I'm done with that job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just bloody well hated.</v>

1730
01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I dragged myself off to work every day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a little part of my soul </v>

1731
01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:23.611
<v Speaker 2>that so goddamn happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally got fired that I can hardly </v>

1732
01:32:23.611 --> 01:32:23.611
<v Speaker 2>stand it.</v>

1733
01:32:23.611 --> 01:32:27.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't even admit that to </v>

1734
01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:27.780
<v Speaker 2>yourself because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1735
01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:29.050
<v Speaker 2>that would mean that all that time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>spent at the job was just sunk costs.</v>

1736
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:31.670
<v Speaker 2>You're diluting yourself the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1737
01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:36.760
<v Speaker 2>It is an interesting thing to consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>those sometimes if you're in the </v>

1738
01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.560
<v Speaker 2>unpleasant circumstance of having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire someone,</v>

1739
01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes firing someone is the best </v>

1740
01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.381
<v Speaker 2>thing that can happen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't mean that you should go </v>

1741
01:32:46.381 --> 01:32:49.171
<v Speaker 2>out and like enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I have met very disagreeable </v>

1742
01:32:49.171 --> 01:32:54.031
<v Speaker 2>people who actually enjoyed firing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and I'll tell you a story about </v>

1743
01:32:54.031 --> 01:32:54.670
<v Speaker 2>that at some point because it's quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

1744
01:32:54.671 --> 01:32:59.671
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes if someone's just limping </v>

1745
01:32:59.671 --> 01:33:02.311
<v Speaker 2>along in their job and doing it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>miserably in wretchedly as they possibly</v>

1746
01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.220
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine,</v>

1747
01:33:03.221 --> 01:33:05.800
<v Speaker 2>the best thing you can do to them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ms dot say,</v>

1748
01:33:05.801 --> 01:33:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're failing at this and,</v>

1749
01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:14.970
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't necessarily mean that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have to be failing at </v>

1750
01:33:14.970 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the entire world,</v>

1751
01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:19.780
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you should just accept the dam </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure and go off and try something new</v>

1752
01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:23.470
<v Speaker 2>and I mean that's terrifying for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know they hate it and all that,</v>

1753
01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:25.650
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1754
01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:28.540
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's better than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative,</v>

1755
01:33:28.541 --> 01:33:30.970
<v Speaker 2>which is just slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>torturous death.</v>

1756
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.870
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1757
01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:40.300
<v Speaker 2>here's a funny way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you fall right into that </v>

1758
01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:44.180
<v Speaker 2>hole that's underneath any everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've hit an anomaly that you don't</v>

1759
01:33:44.181 --> 01:33:44.990
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

1760
01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.140
<v Speaker 2>what's that anomaly made out of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1761
01:33:48.141 --> 01:33:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a strange way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

1762
01:33:49.971 --> 01:33:51.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not.</v>

1763
01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Well you could say we'll just go along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1764
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:57.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that anomaly made out at?</v>

1765
01:33:57.410 --> 01:34:00.260
<v Speaker 2>Well here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's made out of spirit and matter.</v>

1766
01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:04.070
<v Speaker 2>And here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something I learned in part from</v>

1767
01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Piaget said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1768
01:34:06.711 --> 01:34:11.711
<v Speaker 2>it's made out of matter because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course that's the world matter and the </v>

1769
01:34:11.711 --> 01:34:15.731
<v Speaker 2>world is also what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's kind of a nice duality </v>

1770
01:34:15.731 --> 01:34:17.840
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's made out of spirit because when</v>

1771
01:34:17.841 --> 01:34:20.420
<v Speaker 2>you encounter something anomalous and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the rabbit hole,</v>

1772
01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:23.450
<v Speaker 2>when you go into the underworld that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath everything that you've relied</v>

1773
01:34:23.451 --> 01:34:25.910
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn things down there.</v>

1774
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:30.910
<v Speaker 2>So what's down there is information and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that now it's moved maybe way more </v>

1775
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:32.510
<v Speaker 2>information than you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is information.</v>

1776
01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.620
<v Speaker 2>It's information and what can you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you do with the information?</v>

1777
01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.740
<v Speaker 2>You can inform yourself with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

1778
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:44.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can put yourself information with </v>

1779
01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:47.450
<v Speaker 2>the information that's helpful too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and you think,</v>

1780
01:34:47.451 --> 01:34:49.490
<v Speaker 2>well you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a psyche.</v>

1781
01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're not a spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on whether you're a </v>

1782
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.191
<v Speaker 2>materialist or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least we can say that you're a </v>

1783
01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:57.191
<v Speaker 2>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

1784
01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:59.330
<v Speaker 2>what's your psyche made of all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obviously got a material substrate,</v>

1785
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:02.420
<v Speaker 2>but the the matter happens to be a raid </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1786
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:05.990
<v Speaker 2>in a particular order and that's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>information order.</v>

1787
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:11.350
<v Speaker 2>And so when you fall into the underworld</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's underneath everything and you </v>

1788
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 2>encountered that latent information than</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you can do is enhance your psyche.</v>

1789
01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:18.821
<v Speaker 2>You can grow your spirit because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do is you take the new information </v>

1790
01:35:18.821 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 2>and you incorporate it.</v>

1791
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:22.480
<v Speaker 2>That's like eating the apple that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam and eve ate.</v>

1792
01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 2>You incorporate that and that makes more</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you and that's not a metaphorical or </v>

1793
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:30.290
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not to say nothing other than well,</v>

1794
01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:33.050
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens when children learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>to think of what happens.</v>

1795
01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Charles three has a pretty low </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution representations of the world </v>

1796
01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:41.770
<v Speaker 2>and is a fairly low resolution human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

1797
01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.880
<v Speaker 2>God all the constituent elements there </v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't differentiated in any </v>

1798
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.080
<v Speaker 2>tremendous manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all still to come in the future,</v>

1799
01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 2>and so what does the child do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explore,</v>

1800
01:35:50.890 --> 01:35:53.930
<v Speaker 2>what are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explore things they don't understand.</v>

1801
01:35:53.931 --> 01:35:58.931
<v Speaker 2>That's where the information is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you already understand what you </v>

1802
01:35:58.931 --> 01:35:58.931
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no information there.</v>

1803
01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:01.190
<v Speaker 2>You go were there where you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1804
01:36:01.191 --> 01:36:03.800
<v Speaker 2>That's where the information is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and out of that information,</v>

1805
01:36:03.801 --> 01:36:08.801
<v Speaker 2>you generate a higher resolution world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you generate a higher resolution </v>

1806
01:36:08.801 --> 01:36:12.941
<v Speaker 2>self and so out of the combat with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying dragon of chaos,</v>

1807
01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:16.700
<v Speaker 2>you generate spirit and matter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you do when you go down into</v>

1808
01:36:16.701 --> 01:36:17.450
<v Speaker 2>the underworld.</v>

1809
01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.130
<v Speaker 2>So if it doesn't kill you or if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make you wish you were dead,</v>

1810
01:36:22.131 --> 01:36:27.131
<v Speaker 2>which it probably will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a bunch of you that has to </v>

1811
01:36:27.131 --> 01:36:29.951
<v Speaker 2>die down there anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe that's not such a bad thing </v>

1812
01:36:29.951 --> 01:36:30.800
<v Speaker 2>because if you had this relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>that ended in betrayal,</v>

1813
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:33.440
<v Speaker 2>then there's something that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly right.</v>

1814
01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something that went.</v>

1815
01:36:35.230 --> 01:36:38.600
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I'm saying that think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's kind of moralistic.</v>

1816
01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:43.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I don't mind being moralistic </v>

1817
01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:43.690
<v Speaker 2>in case you haven't noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1818
01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:48.270
<v Speaker 2>But that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fair comment because you're </v>

1819
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:50.801
<v Speaker 2>playing this stupid game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you live with someone in </v>

1820
01:36:50.801 --> 01:36:52.190
<v Speaker 2>fidelity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the game,</v>

1821
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You decided the rules with the game </v>

1822
01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.040
<v Speaker 2>comes to morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The morality are the rules of the game.</v>

1823
01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Well then the thing collapses into </v>
<v Speaker 2>infidelity.</v>

1824
01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:02.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1825
01:37:02.631 --> 01:37:04.760
<v Speaker 2>you played the game wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it was the wrong game.</v>

1826
01:37:04.761 --> 01:37:07.220
<v Speaker 2>One of those to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those two.</v>

1827
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:10.880
<v Speaker 2>You pick the damn game and having picked</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game,</v>

1828
01:37:10.881 --> 01:37:12.470
<v Speaker 2>you can't all of a sudden say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

1829
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.880
<v Speaker 2>those aren't the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1830
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1831
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:19.990
<v Speaker 2>If you pick the game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you picked the rules and if you fail at </v>

1832
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:21.410
<v Speaker 2>complying with the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you fail.</v>

1833
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1834
01:37:22.341 --> 01:37:23.600
<v Speaker 2>I can pick a different game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1835
01:37:23.601 --> 01:37:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how you solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're still stuck with the problem.</v>

1836
01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a moral problem fundamentally,</v>

1837
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:35.570
<v Speaker 2>and it might take some major league </v>
<v Speaker 2>retooling to to fix it.</v>

1838
01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:41.910
<v Speaker 2>So you're at point a trying to get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>point b.</v>

1839
01:37:42.090 --> 01:37:44.790
<v Speaker 2>that's not working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hit an anomaly,</v>

1840
01:37:45.630 --> 01:37:48.090
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting to point B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1841
01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Your medical school student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

1842
01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:53.610
<v Speaker 2>your m cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this test.</v>

1843
01:37:53.611 --> 01:37:55.200
<v Speaker 2>You have to right to go to medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

1844
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.290
<v Speaker 2>you get 25th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who you are,</v>

1845
01:37:58.291 --> 01:38:02.160
<v Speaker 2>but you're not a premed student and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you never were right?</v>

1846
01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:05.610
<v Speaker 2>And that's the rub man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so who the hell are you?</v>

1847
01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:10.700
<v Speaker 2>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsed down here into this </v>

1848
01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.360
<v Speaker 2>motivational conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this place of motivational and emotional</v>

1849
01:38:12.361 --> 01:38:15.420
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty and tremendous information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1850
01:38:15.421 --> 01:38:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a place of transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the phoenix that burns.</v>

1851
01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:20.910
<v Speaker 2>It's the burning part of the phoenix </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Burns.</v>

1852
01:38:20.911 --> 01:38:22.920
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the journey to the underworld.</v>

1853
01:38:22.921 --> 01:38:27.921
<v Speaker 2>It's the journey to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can really be a journey to hell </v>

1854
01:38:27.921 --> 01:38:30.681
<v Speaker 2>because you may find out that the reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're partner b trade you or that </v>

1855
01:38:30.681 --> 01:38:35.211
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get your damn promotion is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's seriously something </v>

1856
01:38:35.211 --> 01:38:36.840
<v Speaker 2>wrong with you and you know it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't just mean that you don't know what</v>

1857
01:38:36.841 --> 01:38:37.320
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

1858
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean that there is 25 percent of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has seriously aiming at things not </v>

1859
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:45.780
<v Speaker 2>being good and so you fall into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underworld and you find out that,</v>

1860
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got exactly what I was aiming </v>

1861
01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:54.831
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or I got exactly what the worst part of </v>

1862
01:38:54.831 --> 01:38:58.011
<v Speaker 2>me was aiming for and that worst part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something to clean up and that's </v>

1863
01:38:58.011 --> 01:38:58.890
<v Speaker 2>not going to be easy because it's got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>toxin.</v>

1864
01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Me like something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something ferocious,</v>

1865
01:39:01.681 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 2>something seriously ferocious and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been toying with it for a very long time</v>

1866
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:09.300
<v Speaker 2>and maybe I can't even detach it </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1867
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.840
<v Speaker 2>And so that's not so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see people like that in </v>

1868
01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.361
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy very frequently or you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>them wandering around on the streets </v>

1869
01:39:17.361 --> 01:39:21.300
<v Speaker 2>like absolute catastrophic former shells</v>
<v Speaker 2>of themselves.</v>

1870
01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've hit the underworld and </v>

1871
01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:26.760
<v Speaker 2>they ended up in hell and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting out of it,</v>

1872
01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:30.980
<v Speaker 2>and so those are the people you tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give a wide berth to when you walk down </v>

1873
01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 2>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there you are down in the underworld,</v>

1874
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.590
<v Speaker 2>right back where the latest information </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists in just too much of it.</v>

1875
01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.740
<v Speaker 2>And that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>

1876
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:44.940
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing and that's why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam and Eve stories archetipal,</v>

1877
01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:49.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we're always ingesting something</v>

1878
01:39:49.321 --> 01:39:54.321
<v Speaker 2>new that knocks us into a new state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>self consciousness and it's always a </v>

1879
01:39:54.781 --> 01:39:55.980
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic</v>

1880
01:39:56.890 --> 01:40:00.070
<v Speaker 2>demolition of our current,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our previous paradise.</v>

1881
01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Insufficient as that paradise was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something comes along to destroy it and </v>

1882
01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.140
<v Speaker 2>knocks the slots out of our life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a voyage to the underworld,</v>

1883
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:13.500
<v Speaker 2>out of the walled garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into chaos.</v>

1884
01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:23.040
<v Speaker 2>And so what is all of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1885
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:25.390
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of ways of construing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1886
01:40:26.650 --> 01:40:30.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a frame transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a walled city.</v>

1887
01:40:30.451 --> 01:40:33.270
<v Speaker 2>It's got a hole in it because all walled</v>
<v Speaker 2>cities have holes in them,</v>

1888
01:40:33.271 --> 01:40:38.271
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because everything's imperfect and </v>

1889
01:40:38.271 --> 01:40:39.891
<v Speaker 2>that's where the chaos comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you go out there like a </v>

1890
01:40:39.891 --> 01:40:42.180
<v Speaker 2>hero to fight the chaos and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reestablish the frame,</v>

1891
01:40:42.181 --> 01:40:47.181
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're supposed to do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you free some information while </v>

1892
01:40:47.181 --> 01:40:50.721
<v Speaker 2>you're doing that or maybe you establish</v>
<v Speaker 2>a relationship and so that's the</v>

1893
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.680
<v Speaker 1>frame damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

1894
01:40:57.490 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 1>voluntary confrontation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstitution of the world,</v>

1895
01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's human existence.</v>

1896
01:41:04.301 --> 01:41:09.301
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully it's not just linear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it's stepwise,</v>

1897
01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:15.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the you that emerges as a </v>

1898
01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:19.501
<v Speaker 1>consequence of your latest catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 1>is everything that you were before plus </v>

1899
01:41:19.501 --> 01:41:24.061
<v Speaker 1>something more and that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes what you might describe as </v>

1900
01:41:24.061 --> 01:41:25.780
<v Speaker 1>measurable progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1901
01:41:25.781 --> 01:41:30.781
<v Speaker 1>And that's another argument against </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral relativism because if you can do </v>

1902
01:41:30.781 --> 01:41:33.700
<v Speaker 1>everything that you could do before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do some more things,</v>

1903
01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:37.210
<v Speaker 1>we could just define that as better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad definition.</v>

1904
01:41:37.211 --> 01:41:39.580
<v Speaker 1>And then we have an APP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what you're trying to do is to</v>

1905
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:45.610
<v Speaker 1>differentiate the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate yourself.</v>

1906
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:48.160
<v Speaker 1>And every time you undergo one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutions,</v>

1907
01:41:48.161 --> 01:41:50.080
<v Speaker 1>then hopefully both of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1908
01:41:50.290 --> 01:41:52.480
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a moral to that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1909
01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:56.170
<v Speaker 1>which is do it voluntarily and maybe do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1910
01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Don't wait for it to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catastrophic.</v>

1911
01:42:00.661 --> 01:42:05.661
<v Speaker 1>Really keep your eyes open and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>something goes a little bit wrong that </v>

1912
01:42:06.041 --> 01:42:08.110
<v Speaker 1>you could fix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it.</v>

1913
01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't matter.</v>

1914
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it does matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is matter.</v>

1915
01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's exactly the matter out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you should be built.</v>

1916
01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the matter of which the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be built and if part of you is </v>

1917
01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:25.951
<v Speaker 1>telling you it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it means is that that part is </v>

1918
01:42:25.951 --> 01:42:30.280
<v Speaker 1>telling you that there's something there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need to engage with.</v>

1919
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:32.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means for something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

1920
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I really get out of the kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go out of the word matter </v>

1921
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:37.500
<v Speaker 1>because it's got these two weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings,</v>

1922
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:41.911
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the matter that everything is </v>

1923
01:42:41.911 --> 01:42:43.621
<v Speaker 1>made out of that materialists think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is made out of and that's </v>

1924
01:42:43.621 --> 01:42:46.240
<v Speaker 1>just dead matter and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter that life is made out of which is</v>

1925
01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:51.480
<v Speaker 1>what matters and now and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving through life and something </v>

1926
01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:51.480
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

1927
01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:55.240
<v Speaker 1>It's calling to you and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unrevealed world trying to reveal itself</v>

1928
01:42:55.241 --> 01:42:59.530
<v Speaker 1>to you and all you have to do is allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to reveal itself to you,</v>

1929
01:42:59.710 --> 01:43:04.710
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe what happens is that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minor share shift in shape is all that </v>

1930
01:43:04.991 --> 01:43:07.750
<v Speaker 1>has to happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to burn right down to the</v>

1931
01:43:07.751 --> 01:43:10.480
<v Speaker 1>bloody egg and and hatch out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1932
01:43:10.481 --> 01:43:15.481
<v Speaker 1>as a newborn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can just repair a little bit </v>

1933
01:43:15.481 --> 01:43:18.721
<v Speaker 1>of something that's gone wrong with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can undergo a sequence of </v>

1934
01:43:18.721 --> 01:43:22.261
<v Speaker 1>continual micro deaths instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the bloody catastrophe that </v>

1935
01:43:22.261 --> 01:43:23.800
<v Speaker 1>might send you so far down that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>never recover.</v>

1936
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:29.220
<v Speaker 1>And now you have to do is it tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what matters and your whole nervous </v>

1937
01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:30.940
<v Speaker 1>system is doing this for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a goal.</v>

1938
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It matters.</v>

1939
01:43:33.130 --> 01:43:34.600
<v Speaker 1>So what are you supposed to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1940
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:36.580
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to fix it.</v>

1941
01:43:36.581 --> 01:43:40.270
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to engage with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's calling out to you as if</v>

1942
01:43:40.271 --> 01:43:45.271
<v Speaker 1>it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's saying there's an indeterminant </v>

1943
01:43:45.271 --> 01:43:48.451
<v Speaker 1>part of the world here that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself into fully articulated </v>

1944
01:43:48.451 --> 01:43:50.800
<v Speaker 1>being and it's calling to you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1945
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And if you ignore</v>

1946
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.710
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it accumulates and accumulates,</v>

1947
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:59.711
<v Speaker 1>it turns into the dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it waits until you're not at </v>

1948
01:43:59.711 --> 01:44:01.160
<v Speaker 1>your best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it eats you.</v>

1949
01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:05.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that seems like a bad plan unless you</v>

1950
01:44:05.691 --> 01:44:08.210
<v Speaker 1>like being lunchmeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1951
01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:15.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's a long introduction to noah.</v>

1952
01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1953
01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:26.320
<v Speaker 1>You need it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1954
01:44:26.321 --> 01:44:28.360
<v Speaker 1>because he can understand the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>

1955
01:44:28.361 --> 01:44:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And so because that's what the story's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1956
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And now we can go through the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively rapidly,</v>

1957
01:44:35.591 --> 01:44:37.750
<v Speaker 1>although it doesn't look like we'll go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through all of it tonight.</v>

1958
01:44:39.250 --> 01:44:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll start with the next section of </v>

1959
01:44:44.250 --> 01:44:46.201
<v Speaker 1>Genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is immediately after Cain and </v>

1960
01:44:46.201 --> 01:44:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Abel and there's a short story to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with just to fragment.</v>

1961
01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I called it giants of the earth and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to pass when men began to multiply </v>

1962
01:44:53.651 --> 01:44:58.651
<v Speaker 1>on the face of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is after Cain and Abel that and </v>

1963
01:44:58.651 --> 01:45:02.131
<v Speaker 1>daughters were born unto them that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sons of God saw the daughters of men,</v>

1964
01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:06.580
<v Speaker 1>that they were fair and took them wives </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all which they chose,</v>

1965
01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:14.140
<v Speaker 1>and the Lord said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my spirit shall not always strive with </v>

1966
01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:17.231
<v Speaker 1>man for that he is also flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet his days will be 120 years.</v>

1967
01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:21.040
<v Speaker 1>There were giants in the earth in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1968
01:45:21.041 --> 01:45:26.041
<v Speaker 1>And also after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the sons of God came in unto the </v>

1969
01:45:26.041 --> 01:45:26.140
<v Speaker 1>daughters of men and they bare children </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them,</v>

1970
01:45:26.410 --> 01:45:29.860
<v Speaker 1>the same became mighty men were tour of </v>
<v Speaker 1>old men of renown.</v>

1971
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Now there's been all sorts of attempts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to interpret those few rather jumbled </v>

1972
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:39.551
<v Speaker 1>blinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I see it as a reflection of a </v>

1973
01:45:39.650 --> 01:45:42.220
<v Speaker 1>classic development of hero mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1974
01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.680
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of nostalgia for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

1975
01:45:44.890 --> 01:45:49.890
<v Speaker 1>One of the things Mircea Eliana pointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out was that what happens to human </v>

1976
01:45:52.031 --> 01:45:55.240
<v Speaker 1>memory in preliterate cultures because </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing is written down,</v>

1977
01:45:55.241 --> 01:45:59.230
<v Speaker 1>is that what needs to revert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve gets amalgamated.</v>

1978
01:45:59.231 --> 01:46:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And so imagine that you have a culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's based on fishing would say so you</v>

1979
01:46:03.191 --> 01:46:08.191
<v Speaker 1>have to be a good fisherman know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a human beings who use simple tools </v>

1980
01:46:08.711 --> 01:46:13.711
<v Speaker 1>to fish are unbelievably good fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know every bloody thing you can </v>

1981
01:46:13.711 --> 01:46:14.920
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine about fish because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they die.</v>

1982
01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:19.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's really important that they learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything about fish and maybe they'd </v>

1983
01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.220
<v Speaker 1>been fishing for like 13,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years or something like that.</v>

1984
01:46:21.221 --> 01:46:22.990
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of accumulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

1985
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:24.670
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1986
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:29.790
<v Speaker 1>who taught mankind how to fish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is fragments of </v>

1987
01:46:30.371 --> 01:46:33.100
<v Speaker 1>individuals across history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1988
01:46:33.101 --> 01:46:33.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna.</v>

1989
01:46:33.650 --> 01:46:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Remember the damn fragments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put them all together into the </v>

1990
01:46:38.650 --> 01:46:41.761
<v Speaker 1>amalgam of the heroic fishermen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the guy who established the </v>

1991
01:46:41.761 --> 01:46:44.230
<v Speaker 1>pattern for proper fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that pattern happens to be,</v>

1992
01:46:44.410 --> 01:46:49.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the patterns might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take all the damn fish because </v>

1993
01:46:49.410 --> 01:46:49.650
<v Speaker 1>there won't be any further next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that.</v>

1994
01:46:49.651 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1995
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:55.050
<v Speaker 2>all those fragments of discovery get </v>
<v Speaker 2>amalgamated into heroes of the past.</v>

1996
01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:57.210
<v Speaker 2>And then what you do if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fisherman,</v>

1997
01:46:57.211 --> 01:46:59.820
<v Speaker 2>is you act out the heroic fishermen of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the past,</v>

1998
01:46:59.821 --> 01:47:04.821
<v Speaker 2>and so the idea that there were men of </v>
<v Speaker 2>renown are heroes in the past is just a </v>

1999
01:47:05.281 --> 01:47:08.040
<v Speaker 2>fragmentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call?</v>

2000
01:47:08.170 --> 01:47:13.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just a fragment of that sequence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas that back in the past there were </v>

2001
01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:18.300
<v Speaker 2>mighty human beings who established the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper patterns of being and they were </v>

2002
01:47:19.081 --> 01:47:23.760
<v Speaker 2>the sons of God who took the daughters </v>
<v Speaker 2>of men to wife.</v>

2003
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's interesting too,</v>

2004
01:47:25.081 --> 01:47:30.081
<v Speaker 2>because we do know that the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>competent men are disproportionately </v>

2005
01:47:30.751 --> 01:47:35.751
<v Speaker 2>likely to leave offspring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>

2006
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:42.210
<v Speaker 2>formulating the circumstance onto the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flood.</v>

2007
01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:44.680
<v Speaker 2>This is from merchant Yada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

2008
01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.980
<v Speaker 2>who wrote a book called a history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious ideas,</v>

2009
01:47:46.981 --> 01:47:49.860
<v Speaker 2>which I strongly recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a three volume set.</v>

2010
01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:52.260
<v Speaker 2>It's quite readable and it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliant.</v>

2011
01:47:52.261 --> 01:47:57.261
<v Speaker 2>I really like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what materiality Adis had to</v>

2012
01:47:58.231 --> 01:48:03.231
<v Speaker 2>say about flood myths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as has been well known since the </v>

2013
01:48:03.231 --> 01:48:06.231
<v Speaker 2>compilations made by our Andre Age user </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Jg Fraser who wrote the golden </v>

2014
01:48:06.231 --> 01:48:11.031
<v Speaker 2>bough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Deluge myth of flood mid is almost </v>

2015
01:48:11.031 --> 01:48:12.720
<v Speaker 2>universally disseminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is documented on all the continents,</v>

2016
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:17.930
<v Speaker 2>although very rarely in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in the desert for an </v>

2017
01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:21.300
<v Speaker 2>unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although and on various cultural levels,</v>

2018
01:48:21.301 --> 01:48:26.301
<v Speaker 2>a certain number of variants seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the result of dissemination rather </v>

2019
01:48:26.301 --> 01:48:29.100
<v Speaker 2>than spontaneous regeneration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say first for Mesopotamia,</v>

2020
01:48:29.101 --> 01:48:34.101
<v Speaker 2>and then from India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is equally possible that one or </v>

2021
01:48:34.101 --> 01:48:36.240
<v Speaker 2>several dilute catastrophes gave rise to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fabulous narratives,</v>

2022
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:40.530
<v Speaker 2>but it would be risky to explain so </v>
<v Speaker 2>widespread myth by phenomena of which no</v>

2023
01:48:40.531 --> 01:48:43.280
<v Speaker 2>geological traces has been found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2024
01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Elliot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wrote this quite awhile ago,</v>

2025
01:48:44.761 --> 01:48:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I think he wrote that book perhaps in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the eighties,</v>

2026
01:48:47.011 --> 01:48:48.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but since then,</v>

2027
01:48:48.721 --> 01:48:50.670
<v Speaker 2>there actually has been quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

2028
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm advanced in various circles for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence of catastrophic floods that </v>

2029
01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.921
<v Speaker 2>occurred within the relative memory of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human relative human civilization </v>

2030
01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:01.980
<v Speaker 2>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

2031
01:49:01.981 --> 01:49:03.900
<v Speaker 2>So the West Coast Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2032
01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:06.960
<v Speaker 2>I suppose that's the wrong word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the west coast.</v>

2033
01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2034
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:11.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2035
01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Kwakwaka'Wakw carver who told me a flood</v>
<v Speaker 2>story and they have a story that's </v>

2036
01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:21.741
<v Speaker 2>almost identical to the story of Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except of course it involves giant </v>

2037
01:49:21.741 --> 01:49:21.741
<v Speaker 2>canoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2038
01:49:21.741 --> 01:49:25.530
<v Speaker 2>it's the same story they release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>

2039
01:49:25.531 --> 01:49:28.740
<v Speaker 2>a raisin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but noaa releases a raven first and then</v>

2040
01:49:28.741 --> 01:49:33.741
<v Speaker 2>a dove once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the flood comes to an end and it </v>

2041
01:49:33.741 --> 01:49:34.320
<v Speaker 2>has a tower of Babel issue to the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

2042
01:49:34.321 --> 01:49:37.170
<v Speaker 2>So the canoes are all put together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not one giant canoe.</v>

2043
01:49:37.171 --> 01:49:42.171
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of canoes altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They write out the flood and then the </v>

2044
01:49:42.171 --> 01:49:43.170
<v Speaker 2>canoes separate in and go all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2045
01:49:43.171 --> 01:49:45.030
<v Speaker 2>And that's why there are people all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

2046
01:49:45.031 --> 01:49:47.950
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story is very disseminated.</v>

2047
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:53.550
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were floods in North America not </v>

2048
01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:53.680
<v Speaker 1>that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there were floods.</v>

2049
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:56.890
<v Speaker 1>You can look up the missoula floods </v>
<v Speaker 1>15,000</v>

2050
01:49:56.891 --> 01:49:58.270
<v Speaker 1>to 13,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2051
01:49:58.271 --> 01:50:03.271
<v Speaker 1>And the core people have probably been </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the west coast for something like 13 </v>

2052
01:50:03.271 --> 01:50:03.310
<v Speaker 1>to 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2053
01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:04.490
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2054
01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:06.550
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can maintain an oral tradition for a</v>

2055
01:50:06.551 --> 01:50:07.780
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time,</v>

2056
01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:11.680
<v Speaker 1>you think no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but traditional societies don't change.</v>

2057
01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:16.800
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're traditional and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the same stories over </v>

2058
01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:16.800
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2059
01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:20.140
<v Speaker 1>they remember the same stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the missoula floods,</v>

2060
01:50:20.141 --> 01:50:24.700
<v Speaker 1>which were a consequence of melting </v>
<v Speaker 1>glacial ice discharged up,</v>

2061
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:28.570
<v Speaker 1>they figured there were 55,055</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them between 15,000</v>

2062
01:50:28.571 --> 01:50:29.830
<v Speaker 1>and 13,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2063
01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:33.610
<v Speaker 1>discharged volumes up to 15 times the </v>
<v Speaker 1>volume of the Amazon River.</v>

2064
01:50:33.611 --> 01:50:38.020
<v Speaker 1>So these are major league floods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then a sears at all,</v>

2065
01:50:38.021 --> 01:50:43.021
<v Speaker 1>published a paper in 2008 called climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change and post glacial human disperses </v>

2066
01:50:43.021 --> 01:50:47.611
<v Speaker 1>in Southeast Asia claiming that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were multiple floods particularly </v>

2067
01:50:47.611 --> 01:50:49.930
<v Speaker 1>affecting Southeast Asia between 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 7,000</v>

2068
01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:50.950
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2069
01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:54.370
<v Speaker 1>So there might elliot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be a bit wrong about the notion</v>

2070
01:50:54.371 --> 01:50:57.250
<v Speaker 1>that there were no geological traces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>such,</v>

2071
01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.710
<v Speaker 1>such catastrophic flooding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

2072
01:50:59.711 --> 01:51:04.711
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter because we're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at this from a psychological </v>

2073
01:51:04.711 --> 01:51:07.501
<v Speaker 1>perspective and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The majority of the flood myth Siemens </v>

2074
01:51:07.501 --> 01:51:08.800
<v Speaker 1>some sense to form part of the cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythm.</v>

2075
01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:14.130
<v Speaker 1>The old world people by a fallen </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity is submerged under the waters </v>

2076
01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:20.730
<v Speaker 1>and sometime later a new world emerges </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the aquatic chaos in large number </v>

2077
01:51:20.730 --> 01:51:25.051
<v Speaker 1>of variants that flood is the result of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sins or ritual faults of human </v>

2078
01:51:25.051 --> 01:51:29.341
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's results simply from the </v>

2079
01:51:29.341 --> 01:51:29.800
<v Speaker 1>wish of a divine being to put an end to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind.</v>

2080
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:34.480
<v Speaker 1>The chief causes lie at once in the sins</v>
<v Speaker 1>of men and the decrepitude of the world.</v>

2081
01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:39.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant analysis partly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it puts it.</v>

2082
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:45.510
<v Speaker 1>It draws this lovely parallel between </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are mentioned a bit earlier </v>

2083
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:48.220
<v Speaker 1>between the fact that things go wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>all by themselves,</v>

2084
01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:51.640
<v Speaker 1>but that you can speed that along by not</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying any attention.</v>

2085
01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:53.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're in a relationship,</v>

2086
01:51:53.650 --> 01:51:58.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship takes an awful lot of </v>

2087
01:51:58.650 --> 01:51:59.170
<v Speaker 1>maintenance and you knew what it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be maintained because you start</v>

2088
01:51:59.171 --> 01:52:02.530
<v Speaker 1>developing some distance from the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have the relationship with.</v>

2089
01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:07.740
<v Speaker 1>And then that starts to become tinged </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a little bit of dislike and </v>

2090
01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:11.251
<v Speaker 1>hopefully not contempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit of dislike and maybe </v>

2091
01:52:11.251 --> 01:52:11.251
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2092
01:52:11.251 --> 01:52:13.480
<v Speaker 1>some emotional distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you feel that and you think,</v>

2093
01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard tell what you think,</v>

2094
01:52:15.491 --> 01:52:19.360
<v Speaker 1>but you feel that anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's emerged and so then</v>

2095
01:52:19.361 --> 01:52:24.361
<v Speaker 1>you have a chance at at that point to </v>
<v Speaker 1>repair whatever's gone wrong.</v>

2096
01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:28.630
<v Speaker 1>And that would require some retooling on</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of your parts.</v>

2097
01:52:28.631 --> 01:52:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person more than the other,</v>

2098
01:52:30.761 --> 01:52:35.761
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would require a serious discussion </v>

2099
01:52:35.761 --> 01:52:35.761
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2100
01:52:35.761 --> 01:52:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed that this has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and maybe it's you and maybe </v>

2101
01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:41.500
<v Speaker 1>it's me and we should probably figure it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out because if it was you,</v>

2102
01:52:41.501 --> 01:52:44.020
<v Speaker 1>that'd be convenient and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it was me,</v>

2103
01:52:44.170 --> 01:52:45.710
<v Speaker 1>then I'd like to fix it because</v>

2104
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:50.980
<v Speaker 2>then it would be fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why you listen to your </v>

2105
01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:53.351
<v Speaker 2>partner because they might tell you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something stupid about you that </v>

2106
01:52:53.351 --> 01:52:53.450
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you could fix that,</v>

2107
01:52:53.451 --> 01:52:55.490
<v Speaker 2>then you wouldn't have to be stupid in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way anymore.</v>

2108
01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:57.890
<v Speaker 2>And it's actually one of the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful.</v>

2109
01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:03.400
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the genuinely useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>features of having a partner because do </v>

2110
01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:07.180
<v Speaker 2>you really want to be stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then continue to repeat your </v>

2111
01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:07.180
<v Speaker 2>mistakes ad Nauseum for the rest of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2112
01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I know it's more convenient to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>than to have a knock down drag out </v>

2113
01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:15.770
<v Speaker 2>argument about just exactly why you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid and how you could fix it,</v>

2114
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:18.350
<v Speaker 2>but still it's better to have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

2115
01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:25.740
<v Speaker 2>So the chief causes lie at once in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sins of man in the decrepitude of the </v>

2116
01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:29.581
<v Speaker 2>world and the sins there are generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>either acts of commission where people </v>

2117
01:53:30.041 --> 01:53:35.041
<v Speaker 2>do things that they know to be wrong or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they failed to do things that they know </v>

2118
01:53:35.041 --> 01:53:36.760
<v Speaker 2>would be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter.</v>

2119
01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:39.820
<v Speaker 2>The sins of commission are usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>judged more harshly,</v>

2120
01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:42.250
<v Speaker 2>say within the Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition.</v>

2121
01:53:42.251 --> 01:53:47.251
<v Speaker 2>But I think there might be a bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>error in that because sins of omission </v>

2122
01:53:47.251 --> 01:53:48.820
<v Speaker 2>can be a real catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so here's a flawed idea.</v>

2123
01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:51.280
<v Speaker 2>You tell me what you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

2124
01:53:51.281 --> 01:53:55.900
<v Speaker 2>so there's this idea that a judgmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>being will flood you out if you continue</v>

2125
01:53:55.901 --> 01:53:58.970
<v Speaker 2>on your way word ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems like a little bit,</v>

2126
01:53:59.260 --> 01:54:00.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the examples of,</v>

2127
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:04.330
<v Speaker 2>of Jehovah being a little on the harsh </v>
<v Speaker 2>side in the Old Testament,</v>

2128
01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:09.360
<v Speaker 2>not something that modern people really </v>
<v Speaker 2>a prove of so much because we like our </v>

2129
01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:12.400
<v Speaker 2>gods sort of domesticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

2130
01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.910
<v Speaker 2>And unfortunately that isn't how it </v>
<v Speaker 2>tends to work.</v>

2131
01:54:16.090 --> 01:54:21.090
<v Speaker 2>But I've often thought about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction in North America to the </v>

2132
01:54:21.641 --> 01:54:26.641
<v Speaker 2>hurricane in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New Orleans because there's two ways </v>

2133
01:54:28.371 --> 01:54:29.360
<v Speaker 2>of reading that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2134
01:54:29.361 --> 01:54:30.890
<v Speaker 2>One is mother nature</v>

2135
01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:37.010
<v Speaker 2>has a little fit and sends a hurricane </v>
<v Speaker 2>into New Orleans and wipes everyone out.</v>

2136
01:54:37.011 --> 01:54:40.370
<v Speaker 2>And isn't that a catastrophe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And isn't that an example of.</v>

2137
01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that example of our fragility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the force in the face of,</v>

2138
01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:50.590
<v Speaker 2>of natural power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's another way of reading it.</v>

2139
01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it'll do for the purposes of </v>

2140
01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:55.600
<v Speaker 2>illustration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2141
01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:55.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dutch build dikes,</v>

2142
01:54:55.781 --> 01:55:00.781
<v Speaker 2>right to keep the ocean back and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually pretty effective at that </v>

2143
01:55:00.781 --> 01:55:01.150
<v Speaker 2>because their country's mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwater.</v>

2144
01:55:01.151 --> 01:55:02.970
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out that if you go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Holland,</v>

2145
01:55:03.010 --> 01:55:06.790
<v Speaker 2>it's actually not underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're dikes are working.</v>

2146
01:55:06.791 --> 01:55:11.791
<v Speaker 2>And so the Dutch were very organized </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and they better be because their </v>

2147
01:55:11.791 --> 01:55:12.990
<v Speaker 2>country is supposed to be underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2148
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.030
<v Speaker 2>So you better be organized if your </v>
<v Speaker 2>country is supposed to be underwater.</v>

2149
01:55:16.630 --> 01:55:19.510
<v Speaker 2>And so they are very organized and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a rule for their dykes,</v>

2150
01:55:19.511 --> 01:55:24.511
<v Speaker 2>which is they try to estimate the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible oceanic storm that will come in</v>

2151
01:55:25.961 --> 01:55:30.961
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and made sure that the dikes will </v>

2152
01:55:30.961 --> 01:55:30.961
<v Speaker 2>withstand that.</v>

2153
01:55:30.961 --> 01:55:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Well from my reading,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Army Corps of Engineers in New </v>

2154
01:55:36.370 --> 01:55:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Orleans build the dikes for a storm </v>
<v Speaker 2>every hundred years and that's not so </v>

2155
01:55:41.370 --> 01:55:44.790
<v Speaker 2>good because we live about eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

2156
01:55:44.791 --> 01:55:48.270
<v Speaker 2>So that means the probability that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those storms is going come up and buy</v>

2157
01:55:48.450 --> 01:55:53.450
<v Speaker 2>in a lifespan is pretty damn high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so that perhaps wasn't the </v>

2158
01:55:54.031 --> 01:55:59.031
<v Speaker 2>wisest of planning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because some of New Orleans </v>

2159
01:55:59.031 --> 01:56:00.240
<v Speaker 2>is actually supposed to be underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then worse.</v>

2160
01:56:00.241 --> 01:56:02.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mississippi is a state that's quite well</v>

2161
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:07.401
<v Speaker 2>known for its corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might also say that a </v>

2162
01:56:07.401 --> 01:56:09.690
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of the money and time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and resources that could have and should</v>

2163
01:56:09.691 --> 01:56:14.691
<v Speaker 2>have and was planned to go towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>fixing the problem didn't eat,</v>

2164
01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:19.830
<v Speaker 2>and so the hurricane came along and Oh </v>
<v Speaker 2>my God wasn't in a natural disaster.</v>

2165
01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:25.040
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what bloody well makes you so sure that </v>

2166
01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.190
<v Speaker 2>it was a natural disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2167
01:56:26.190 --> 01:56:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Because if the infrastructure would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been maintained and built to the </v>

2168
01:56:31.190 --> 01:56:35.211
<v Speaker 2>specifications that were certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically possible and would have </v>

2169
01:56:35.211 --> 01:56:38.691
<v Speaker 2>actually been less expensive in the long</v>
<v Speaker 2>run to build and everyone knew it and </v>

2170
01:56:39.271 --> 01:56:41.100
<v Speaker 2>the hurricane came along and wiped build</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city,</v>

2171
01:56:41.101 --> 01:56:42.990
<v Speaker 2>why do you think that's a natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster?</v>

2172
01:56:43.230 --> 01:56:47.730
<v Speaker 2>To me that's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a natural example.</v>

2173
01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:52.230
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical perspective of a judgmental</v>

2174
01:56:52.231 --> 01:56:57.231
<v Speaker 2>God deciding to use a flood to teach a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral lesson,</v>

2175
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:59.610
<v Speaker 2>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2176
01:56:59.611 --> 01:57:02.010
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about all those floods survivors?</v>

2177
01:57:02.110 --> 01:57:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2178
01:57:03.330 --> 01:57:08.330
<v Speaker 2>the whole flood thing was kind of harsh </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so pointing out that there were </v>

2179
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:11.961
<v Speaker 2>steps that could have been taken and and</v>
<v Speaker 2>also that I doubt in the aftermath have </v>

2180
01:57:12.811 --> 01:57:17.811
<v Speaker 2>been taken even though everyone knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>now exactly what had happened is</v>

2181
01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:23.350
<v Speaker 2>you might consider the diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's irrelevant because what I,</v>

2182
01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:28.470
<v Speaker 2>what I'm really trying to tell you is </v>
<v Speaker 2>how the mythological stories would line </v>

2183
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:31.981
<v Speaker 2>up on this because you can tell a story </v>
<v Speaker 2>about mother nature manifesting her kick</v>

2184
01:57:32.770 --> 01:57:37.770
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe and potential for tragedy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell another story of an </v>

2185
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:41.701
<v Speaker 2>absolute failure of the human social </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and the human individual level</v>

2186
01:57:44.050 --> 01:57:49.050
<v Speaker 2>because of the corruption to address a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem that everyone knew was there and</v>

2187
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:54.510
<v Speaker 2>so that's a good example of how things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the flood comes when you're not </v>

2188
01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:56.080
<v Speaker 2>behaving properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2189
01:57:56.100 --> 01:58:01.100
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's quite </v>

2190
01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:02.311
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the old testament and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who wrote it is that they </v>

2191
01:58:02.311 --> 01:58:04.180
<v Speaker 2>always assume that if the flood comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that meant you weren't prepared.</v>

2192
01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:06.000
<v Speaker 2>If that's the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2193
01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:10.120
<v Speaker 2>That it's like the a priori axiom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got flooded out,</v>

2194
01:58:10.150 --> 01:58:11.470
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't prepared enough.</v>

2195
01:58:11.690 --> 01:58:14.200
<v Speaker 2>How can you tell what you got flooded </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

2196
01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:15.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the evidence,</v>

2197
01:58:15.761 --> 01:58:16.390
<v Speaker 2>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2198
01:58:16.391 --> 01:58:19.540
<v Speaker 2>that's not very fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fair isn't the point.</v>

2199
01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:23.170
<v Speaker 2>The point is do you want to get flooded </v>
<v Speaker 2>out again or not?</v>

2200
01:58:23.530 --> 01:58:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Because fair would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2201
01:58:24.761 --> 01:58:29.761
<v Speaker 2>you better figure out why you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>flooded out and fix it so it doesn't </v>

2202
01:58:29.761 --> 01:58:33.121
<v Speaker 2>happen again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the moral thing to do when </v>

2203
01:58:33.121 --> 01:58:34.810
<v Speaker 2>when you're thinking about morality as </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking the path,</v>

2204
01:58:34.811 --> 01:58:39.811
<v Speaker 2>it's most appropriate to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>destination that you think would be the </v>

2205
01:58:39.811 --> 01:58:39.910
<v Speaker 2>best possible destination</v>

2206
01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:47.510
<v Speaker 1>by the mere fact that it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is it lives in producers.</v>

2207
01:58:47.530 --> 01:58:50.980
<v Speaker 1>The cosmos gradually deteriorates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ends by falling into decay.</v>

2208
01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:54.130
<v Speaker 1>That is the reason why it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreated.</v>

2209
01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:59.340
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flood realizes on the macrocosmic </v>

2210
01:58:59.340 --> 01:58:59.890
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is symbolically affected during the</v>

2211
01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:01.810
<v Speaker 1>new year festival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the world,</v>

2212
01:59:01.811 --> 01:59:05.980
<v Speaker 1>and the end of a sinful humanity in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make a new creation possible.</v>

2213
01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting.</v>

2214
01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:10.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of information packed into</v>
<v Speaker 1>those few lines.</v>

2215
01:59:10.450 --> 01:59:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Delete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edit,</v>

2216
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.130
<v Speaker 1>wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he also,</v>

2217
01:59:13.110 --> 01:59:17.410
<v Speaker 1>at the at at in the Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals,</v>

2218
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:21.970
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamians would act out</v>

2219
01:59:23.630 --> 01:59:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of the kingdom into chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially after new year's festival.</v>

2220
01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:33.220
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of what you do when you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolutions because like it's a </v>

2221
01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:35.060
<v Speaker 1>degenerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you'd say is our proclivity to make</v>

2222
01:59:35.061 --> 01:59:37.550
<v Speaker 1>new year's resolutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a degenerate ritual,</v>

2223
01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:39.930
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean that it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that it,</v>

2224
01:59:39.931 --> 01:59:40.460
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2225
01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:43.220
<v Speaker 1>it's the remnants of something much </v>
<v Speaker 1>grander.</v>

2226
01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:45.740
<v Speaker 1>So the idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2227
01:59:45.741 --> 01:59:48.650
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamians would take their </v>
<v Speaker 1>emperor outside the city,</v>

2228
01:59:48.651 --> 01:59:53.651
<v Speaker 1>the walled city and once a year and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make them kneel and they take off </v>

2229
01:59:53.651 --> 01:59:56.420
<v Speaker 1>all his king close and then they'd whack</v>
<v Speaker 1>them with a glove,</v>

2230
01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:58.640
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the priest would do that and then they'd</v>

2231
01:59:58.641 --> 02:00:02.900
<v Speaker 1>make them recount all the ways that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't being a good emperor that year.</v>

2232
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:08.000
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't being a good Marduk because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was who he was supposed to be on </v>

2233
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:08.000
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the guy with eyes all the way</v>

2234
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>around his head speaks magic words that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transforms chaos into order.</v>

2235
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what dampers supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the question would be,</v>

2236
02:00:15.231 --> 02:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your emperor,</v>

2237
02:00:16.410 --> 02:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a little humility here because </v>

2238
02:00:21.410 --> 02:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>you're not God incarnate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably made some mistakes.</v>

2239
02:00:22.370 --> 02:00:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Can you think of any ways in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year that you didn't take every </v>

2240
02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:31.630
<v Speaker 1>advantage of every opportunity you </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly could have to take some spare </v>

2241
02:00:31.630 --> 02:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>chaos and transform it into a habit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>habitable order?</v>

2242
02:00:33.890 --> 02:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2243
02:00:35.181 --> 02:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're thinking about when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a new year's resolution,</v>

2244
02:00:37.731 --> 02:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>even though you don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2245
02:00:39.291 --> 02:00:44.291
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you be a better person in the </v>

2246
02:00:44.291 --> 02:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>upcoming year as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine the flood</v>

2247
02:00:52.850 --> 02:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>and then you can set yourself straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can prepare for it.</v>

2248
02:00:57.621 --> 02:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And that means maybe you can stave it </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

2249
02:00:59.811 --> 02:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>but it also means that maybe even if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't stave it off,</v>

2250
02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:08.530
<v Speaker 1>you could ride it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually the story of Noah </v>

2251
02:01:08.530 --> 02:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>because what happens with Noah is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he can see that things are not good and </v>

2252
02:01:13.461 --> 02:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>that there's a flood coming and God is </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe letting him know.</v>

2253
02:01:18.110 --> 02:01:20.600
<v Speaker 1>And it says in the story that Noah </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked with God,</v>

2254
02:01:20.601 --> 02:01:25.601
<v Speaker 1>remembering that's what Adam did before </v>
<v Speaker 1>he got all self conscious about the </v>

2255
02:01:25.601 --> 02:01:25.601
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He walked with God.</v>

2256
02:01:25.601 --> 02:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that more next time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what that would mean maybe is </v>

2257
02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:33.011
<v Speaker 1>because Noah was straight and he put </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself together and his familial </v>

2258
02:01:33.321 --> 02:01:38.321
<v Speaker 1>relationships were good because it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>says that that his antenna were working </v>

2259
02:01:38.321 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>and he could see little farther into</v>

2260
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.370
<v Speaker 2>the future than someone whose vision was</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely obscured by,</v>

2261
02:01:43.670 --> 02:01:48.670
<v Speaker 2>by fog and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he could tell that things were not </v>

2262
02:01:48.771 --> 02:01:53.180
<v Speaker 2>going to go well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he prepared for it and because he</v>

2263
02:01:53.181 --> 02:01:57.920
<v Speaker 2>prepared for it well then things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually went pretty well for Noah,</v>

2264
02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:03.220
<v Speaker 2>even though the flood came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an interesting thing </v>

2265
02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:06.191
<v Speaker 2>because that's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an indeterminant issue in human </v>

2266
02:02:06.191 --> 02:02:10.661
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How big a hurricane would it take to </v>

2267
02:02:10.661 --> 02:02:10.840
<v Speaker 2>wipe out New Orleans if everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared?</v>

2268
02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2269
02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:15.020
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to wipe out the Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's going to be a tough one,</v>

2270
02:02:15.021 --> 02:02:20.021
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to conjure up a </v>

2271
02:02:20.021 --> 02:02:20.021
<v Speaker 2>pretty damn big storm to take out their </v>
<v Speaker 2>dykes.</v>

2272
02:02:20.021 --> 02:02:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how thoroughly defendant could New </v>

2273
02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Orleans be if nobody in the municipal </v>
<v Speaker 2>municipal and state governments was </v>

2274
02:02:28.930 --> 02:02:31.100
<v Speaker 2>corrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2275
02:02:31.190 --> 02:02:36.190
<v Speaker 2>end of the hurricane problem because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that we could clearly </v>

2276
02:02:36.190 --> 02:02:36.190
<v Speaker 2>deal with.</v>

2277
02:02:36.190 --> 02:02:39.280
<v Speaker 2>We know how to do it and the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>applies in your own life is that there </v>

2278
02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:41.000
<v Speaker 2>are floods come and you can bloody well </v>
<v Speaker 2>be sure of that.</v>

2279
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:45.290
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely 100 percent certain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are going to be personal,</v>

2280
02:02:45.291 --> 02:02:50.291
<v Speaker 2>some of them are going to be familial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are going to be social and </v>

2281
02:02:50.291 --> 02:02:50.570
<v Speaker 2>political and economic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2282
02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:53.090
<v Speaker 2>are they going to be catastrophes for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

2283
02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Or going to ride them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to prepare?</v>

2284
02:02:56.700 --> 02:02:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first issue might be,</v>

2285
02:02:57.891 --> 02:03:02.891
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have your act together well </v>

2286
02:03:02.891 --> 02:03:04.481
<v Speaker 2>enough to see them coming with enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced warning so that you can take </v>

2287
02:03:04.481 --> 02:03:05.930
<v Speaker 2>proper measures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just decide step it,</v>

2288
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:08.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe just don't go where the flood is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be.</v>

2289
02:03:08.511 --> 02:03:11.300
<v Speaker 2>That's a simple thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you don't have that luxury.</v>

2290
02:03:11.301 --> 02:03:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it is going to be a catastrophe.</v>

2291
02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Maybe someone in your family is gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>get really,</v>

2292
02:03:17.151 --> 02:03:19.310
<v Speaker 2>really sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2293
02:03:19.311 --> 02:03:23.390
<v Speaker 2>And maybe maybe there's just a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway through that,</v>

2294
02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:26.900
<v Speaker 2>that everything doesn't fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't end in divorce,</v>

2295
02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.450
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't end in death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't end in sorrow,</v>

2296
02:03:29.451 --> 02:03:34.451
<v Speaker 2>doesn't end in catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the margin of error is slim down to </v>

2297
02:03:34.451 --> 02:03:38.021
<v Speaker 2>virtually zero in every imperfection </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you bring to that situation is </v>

2298
02:03:38.021 --> 02:03:42.791
<v Speaker 2>going to increase the probability that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that tragedy is going to turn it into </v>

2299
02:03:42.791 --> 02:03:44.420
<v Speaker 2>something indistinguishable from hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's coming.</v>

2300
02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:47.720
<v Speaker 2>It's coming your way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely certainly.</v>

2301
02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:49.550
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2302
02:03:49.551 --> 02:03:54.551
<v Speaker 2>since it's coming your way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the best thing to do is to put </v>

2303
02:03:54.551 --> 02:03:57.551
<v Speaker 2>yourself together so that when it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be the least amount of awful </v>

2304
02:03:57.551 --> 02:03:59.900
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll close with this story.</v>

2305
02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>This was a very affecting story for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother in law had frontal temporal </v>

2306
02:04:08.721 --> 02:04:10.610
<v Speaker 2>dementia and she developed it quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>

2307
02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:13.250
<v Speaker 2>She was about 55,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2308
02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:16.790
<v Speaker 2>And her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is very extroverted,</v>

2309
02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:19.760
<v Speaker 2>man about town guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a small town,</v>

2310
02:04:19.761 --> 02:04:22.730
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was charismatic,</v>

2311
02:04:23.150 --> 02:04:26.960
<v Speaker 2>drank too much charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good businessmen.</v>

2312
02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Quite a remarkable person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real character,</v>

2313
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:34.040
<v Speaker 2>but not exactly a family man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though he,</v>

2314
02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:36.800
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he provided for his family very,</v>

2315
02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but when</v>

2316
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>his wife got sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really took care of her man.</v>

2317
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:43.800
<v Speaker 1>He was something to see because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no joke.</v>

2318
02:04:44.070 --> 02:04:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Dealing with someone who has Alzheimer's</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes because </v>

2319
02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>they get taken away from you piece by </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece and that is not pretty.</v>

2320
02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:54.630
<v Speaker 1>And then it's also hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2321
02:04:54.750 --> 02:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard and Jesus,</v>

2322
02:04:57.751 --> 02:05:02.751
<v Speaker 1>he just stepped into that like perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was way less awful than it could </v>

2323
02:05:05.191 --> 02:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>have been way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a tragedy.</v>

2324
02:05:08.610 --> 02:05:13.610
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I was there when she died and </v>

2325
02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:19.320
<v Speaker 1>my wife's family are actually pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at dealing with death.</v>

2326
02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:24.350
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife's sister is a palliative care </v>

2327
02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:26.130
<v Speaker 1>nurse and you have to be a pretty tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>cookie to be a palliative care nurse,</v>

2328
02:05:26.131 --> 02:05:28.500
<v Speaker 1>but you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty interesting because that</v>

2329
02:05:28.501 --> 02:05:33.501
<v Speaker 1>means that you can go make relationships</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people at the last stages of their </v>

2330
02:05:33.501 --> 02:05:37.350
<v Speaker 1>life that are genuine relationships and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just die on you nonstop.</v>

2331
02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:38.820
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2332
02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:44.720
<v Speaker 1>she's a competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

2333
02:05:45.121 --> 02:05:46.800
<v Speaker 1>alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun person.</v>

2334
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>So like two thumbs up for her man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's someone you can rely on and in </v>

2335
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and her other sister is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacist and my wife has volunteered </v>

2336
02:05:57.631 --> 02:06:02.631
<v Speaker 1>in palliative care wards and is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at taking care of people who </v>

2337
02:06:02.631 --> 02:06:05.751
<v Speaker 1>are genuinely not in good health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we were there when my mother in </v>

2338
02:06:07.021 --> 02:06:12.021
<v Speaker 1>law died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course you can imagine here's a,</v>

2339
02:06:12.211 --> 02:06:17.211
<v Speaker 1>here's a deathbed situation for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mother in law is dying and </v>

2340
02:06:17.211 --> 02:06:20.160
<v Speaker 1>everyone's at each other's throats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like you think that's uncommon.</v>

2341
02:06:20.161 --> 02:06:25.161
<v Speaker 1>Then your eyes aren't open because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty bloody comment and then it's not </v>

2342
02:06:25.161 --> 02:06:25.860
<v Speaker 1>just a tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hell.</v>

2343
02:06:26.190 --> 02:06:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And like maybe you can stand the tragedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't stand the hell.</v>

2344
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:35.600
<v Speaker 1>And in this situation that isn't what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened is everybody pulled together </v>

2345
02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:39.620
<v Speaker 1>and what happened was while she died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what was so interesting was the </v>

2346
02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:44.451
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually came together more tightly </v>

2347
02:06:44.451 --> 02:06:44.451
<v Speaker 1>as a consequences.</v>

2348
02:06:44.451 --> 02:06:45.600
<v Speaker 1>So although there is something taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

2349
02:06:45.601 --> 02:06:49.080
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand there was something </v>
<v Speaker 1>gained on the other that wasn't trivial.</v>

2350
02:06:49.081 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not trying to be optimistic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2351
02:06:52.351 --> 02:06:54.930
<v Speaker 1>isn't the universe a wonderful place </v>
<v Speaker 1>about all this,</v>

2352
02:06:54.931 --> 02:06:57.870
<v Speaker 1>like someone died and in an ugly way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it,</v>

2353
02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:00.660
<v Speaker 1>and it was harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God,</v>

2354
02:07:00.661 --> 02:07:02.490
<v Speaker 1>it was a hell of a lot better than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been.</v>

2355
02:07:02.491 --> 02:07:04.530
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it was good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

2356
02:07:04.531 --> 02:07:09.531
<v Speaker 1>you know as that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that I constantly </v>

2357
02:07:09.531 --> 02:07:11.991
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if people did what they could to</v>

2358
02:07:12.121 --> 02:07:17.121
<v Speaker 1>speak the truth and pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe the tragedy that's part of </v>

2359
02:07:17.971 --> 02:07:22.971
<v Speaker 1>life wouldn't have to deteriorate into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unbearable hell that doesn't have to</v>

2360
02:07:23.641 --> 02:07:26.610
<v Speaker 1>be part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe we could actually tolerate the</v>

2361
02:07:26.611 --> 02:07:31.611
<v Speaker 1>tragedy or maybe we could even rise </v>
<v Speaker 1>above it and maybe we could even </v>

2362
02:07:31.611 --> 02:07:31.611
<v Speaker 1>mitigate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2363
02:07:31.611 --> 02:07:33.060
<v Speaker 1>because we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do that sort of thing all the time.</v>

2364
02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:35.160
<v Speaker 1>And so it's always an open question</v>

2365
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:41.010
<v Speaker 2>in the Iliad and put it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are the floods the consequence of the </v>

2366
02:07:41.471 --> 02:07:46.471
<v Speaker 2>fact that things fall apart?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or are the floods that consequence of </v>

2367
02:07:46.471 --> 02:07:50.191
<v Speaker 2>the fact that people make mistakes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know they shouldn't make and make </v>

2368
02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:53.770
<v Speaker 2>anyways they sin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2369
02:07:53.771 --> 02:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's to miss the mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2370
02:07:55.361 --> 02:07:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Because that's an archery term to sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

2371
02:07:57.071 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 2>That means maybe they don't even specify</v>
<v Speaker 2>the damn target,</v>

2372
02:08:00.010 --> 02:08:05.010
<v Speaker 2>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to hit it unless you </v>

2373
02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:06.670
<v Speaker 2>specified or having specified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just say,</v>

2374
02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hell with it.</v>

2375
02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:13.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not that important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you gotta be careful when you </v>

2376
02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.801
<v Speaker 2>say something like to hell with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that important because one of </v>

2377
02:08:16.801 --> 02:08:18.700
<v Speaker 2>the things that might happen to you if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say to hell with it,</v>

2378
02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:24.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not that important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you might actually end up in </v>

2379
02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:26.851
<v Speaker 2>hell for a pretty prolonged period of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time or maybe for the remainder of your </v>

2380
02:08:27.911 --> 02:08:29.110
<v Speaker 2>miserable existence.</v>

2381
02:08:29.110 --> 02:08:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Because it's certainly the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do exist there and I've seen them</v>

2382
02:08:32.951 --> 02:08:35.770
<v Speaker 2>exists there and once you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no trick.</v>

2383
02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:38.080
<v Speaker 2>It's no simple matter to get the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2384
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:42.670
<v Speaker 2>And so it might matter that the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that matter get addressed.</v>

2385
02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:46.510
<v Speaker 2>It might matter that you do what you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>to walk with God.</v>

2386
02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk more about that next time and</v>

2387
02:08:49.691 --> 02:08:54.691
<v Speaker 2>it might be that that is how you build </v>
<v Speaker 2>an Ark and are protected from the flood </v>

2388
02:08:54.691 --> 02:08:58.510
<v Speaker 2>even if the damn thing comes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

2389
02:08:58.511 --> 02:09:00.970
<v Speaker 2>it will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a funny thing too,</v>

2390
02:09:00.971 --> 02:09:05.971
<v Speaker 2>that I've noticed about our education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and the way we teach students and</v>

2391
02:09:06.731 --> 02:09:10.150
<v Speaker 2>their trigger warnings and all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute rubbish.</v>

2392
02:09:10.570 --> 02:09:15.570
<v Speaker 2>I think in most of my lectures I'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a trigger warning every 15 </v>

2393
02:09:15.570 --> 02:09:17.330
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

2394
02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:19.150
<v Speaker 2>tell my students when they're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2395
02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:20.740
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fool yourself.</v>

2396
02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:24.940
<v Speaker 2>You know you're going to develop a </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious illness.</v>

2397
02:09:25.330 --> 02:09:30.330
<v Speaker 2>At least one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe two or three and one of them is </v>

2398
02:09:30.330 --> 02:09:30.730
<v Speaker 2>likely to be chronic and if it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2399
02:09:30.731 --> 02:09:33.100
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be someone you love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be your husband,</v>

2400
02:09:33.101 --> 02:09:36.520
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be your parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be your kids that's coming</v>

2401
02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:42.180
<v Speaker 2>and so as a lot of death and pain and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just exactly what sort of person </v>

2402
02:09:43.001 --> 02:09:46.330
<v Speaker 2>are you going to be when that shows up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the right question.</v>

2403
02:09:46.690 --> 02:09:49.720
<v Speaker 2>It isn't how are you going to be happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life?</v>

2404
02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:51.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck with that.</v>

2405
02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:54.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a stupid ambition anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned because it's too</v>

2406
02:09:54.341 --> 02:09:56.080
<v Speaker 2>shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know happiness.</v>

2407
02:09:56.081 --> 02:10:01.081
<v Speaker 2>You're lucky that comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes and goes like the sun coming out </v>

2408
02:10:01.081 --> 02:10:01.450
<v Speaker 2>from behind the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're happy,</v>

2409
02:10:01.451 --> 02:10:02.980
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more power to you.</v>

2410
02:10:03.190 --> 02:10:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it.</v>

2411
02:10:04.751 --> 02:10:07.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a gift from the cosmos to be happy,</v>

2412
02:10:08.050 --> 02:10:09.900
<v Speaker 2>but at pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2413
02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:13.240
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pursuit is when the dam flood comes,</v>

2414
02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:19.200
<v Speaker 2>you want to be the person who built arc </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what the story of Noah is </v>

2415
02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:21.640
<v Speaker 2>about and the thing is the flood is </v>
<v Speaker 2>always coming.</v>

2416
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:25.510
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>commenting on with regards to this story</v>

2417
02:10:25.511 --> 02:10:30.511
<v Speaker 2>is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an apocalyptic element to the </v>

2418
02:10:30.511 --> 02:10:30.511
<v Speaker 2>Judeo Christian tradition.</v>

2419
02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:37.140
<v Speaker 2>There's an idea that the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is always at hand and that you </v>

2420
02:10:37.611 --> 02:10:42.611
<v Speaker 2>should prepare to be judged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about that is it's true </v>

2421
02:10:42.611 --> 02:10:46.720
<v Speaker 2>and the reason that's true is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of your world is at hand and it </v>

2422
02:10:47.601 --> 02:10:52.601
<v Speaker 2>will certainly come and when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be judged because it will be up</v>

2423
02:10:53.601 --> 02:10:56.990
<v Speaker 2>to you to figure out what to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that your world just collapsed.</v>

2424
02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:02.210
<v Speaker 2>And that'll be a moral problem of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate severity because it'll push you</v>

2425
02:11:02.211 --> 02:11:07.211
<v Speaker 2>right to your limits and you'll find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly where your unaddressed </v>

2426
02:11:07.211 --> 02:11:10.580
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses lie because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens in a crisis.</v>

2427
02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:15.880
<v Speaker 2>And so the reason that that's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal reality and it looks </v>

2428
02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:16.550
<v Speaker 2>underneath the entire Judaeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>

2429
02:11:16.551 --> 02:11:18.470
<v Speaker 2>the apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impending apocalypse,</v>

2430
02:11:18.471 --> 02:11:23.471
<v Speaker 2>is because we always live in apocalyptic</v>
<v Speaker 2>times and your world is always in small </v>

2431
02:11:24.291 --> 02:11:27.950
<v Speaker 2>ways and large ways coming to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what do you do?</v>

2432
02:11:28.490 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 2>You prepare for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you prepare for your world to come to an</v>

2433
02:11:33.021 --> 02:11:36.560
<v Speaker 2>end and then maybe when the end comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get another world.</v>

2434
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:41.770
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're ready for this next week.</v>

2435
02:11:48.010 --> 02:11:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2436
02:11:55.470 --> 02:12:00.470
<v Speaker 4>My question was regarding the online </v>
<v Speaker 4>university you plan to create and the </v>

2437
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:01.610
<v Speaker 4>plans you have for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My uh,</v>

2438
02:12:01.710 --> 02:12:03.480
<v Speaker 4>we've spoke briefly last week and I want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to ask you,</v>

2439
02:12:03.481 --> 02:12:06.180
<v Speaker 4>how can a student such as myself get </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved with this process?</v>

2440
02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2441
02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:16.090
<v Speaker 1>an online university that's perhaps a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandiose ambition,</v>

2442
02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:18.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that,</v>

2443
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:21.140
<v Speaker 1>so here's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's my rationale.</v>

2444
02:12:23.230 --> 02:12:28.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of things have dramatically </v>

2445
02:12:28.230 --> 02:12:29.290
<v Speaker 1>transformed in the last 20 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole swaths of</v>

2446
02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:36.100
<v Speaker 1>enterprise has been wiped out and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in a more and more rapid rate </v>

2447
02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:39.410
<v Speaker 1>as our technology progresses right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers are in the process of dying.</v>

2448
02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I actually think they're in the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>of committing suicide,</v>

2449
02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:47.080
<v Speaker 1>but they're in the process of dying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to happen very rapidly.</v>

2450
02:12:47.841 --> 02:12:52.841
<v Speaker 1>I think the globe and Mail lost 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of its readership in the last </v>

2451
02:12:52.841 --> 02:12:52.841
<v Speaker 1>three months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2452
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that new </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies come along to supplant the </v>

2453
02:12:58.671 --> 02:13:03.671
<v Speaker 1>old technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've watched a number of businesses </v>

2454
02:13:03.671 --> 02:13:03.770
<v Speaker 1>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some large businesses.</v>

2455
02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I knew some people who worked at digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment corporation when it was </v>

2456
02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:12.671
<v Speaker 1>failing and I've had some inside track </v>
<v Speaker 1>into failing businesses and I see when </v>

2457
02:13:12.671 --> 02:13:17.111
<v Speaker 1>they start to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to failure process tends to </v>

2458
02:13:17.111 --> 02:13:19.991
<v Speaker 1>tip and then accelerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can happen unbelievably quickly and </v>

2459
02:13:19.991 --> 02:13:23.291
<v Speaker 1>this is what it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how it looks to me in </v>

2460
02:13:23.291 --> 02:13:25.020
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the US,</v>

2461
02:13:25.070 --> 02:13:27.920
<v Speaker 1>although not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in humanities,</v>

2462
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:28.880
<v Speaker 1>although not only</v>

2463
02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>so number</v>

2464
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:37.070
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've recorded three years of my </v>

2465
02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:43.500
<v Speaker 1>personality lecture say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's have three years of lectures on</v>

2466
02:13:43.501 --> 02:13:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Freud now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I should do with those,</v>

2467
02:13:46.861 --> 02:13:51.861
<v Speaker 1>I think his Eq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edit them into one really good lecture </v>

2468
02:13:51.861 --> 02:13:54.891
<v Speaker 1>on Freud and then stop giving that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture because why would I give that </v>

2469
02:13:54.891 --> 02:13:55.560
<v Speaker 1>lecture again because I've already given</v>
<v Speaker 1>it an edited.</v>

2470
02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:58.230
<v Speaker 1>It's in good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it's a really good lecture,</v>

2471
02:13:58.231 --> 02:14:00.300
<v Speaker 1>then why does someone else have to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lecture?</v>

2472
02:14:00.301 --> 02:14:05.301
<v Speaker 1>Why does 300 other people have to give a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture on Freud and you know what I </v>

2473
02:14:05.301 --> 02:14:08.871
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen is there's gonna </v>

2474
02:14:08.871 --> 02:14:10.401
<v Speaker 1>be some really good lectures on subjects</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all that people are going to </v>

2475
02:14:10.401 --> 02:14:14.991
<v Speaker 1>need or want because the Internet tends </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move things towards winner take all </v>

2476
02:14:14.991 --> 02:14:19.971
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly and so it seems to me that </v>

2477
02:14:19.971 --> 02:14:24.530
<v Speaker 1>we're already at a point technologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we could identify 100 things that </v>

2478
02:14:24.601 --> 02:14:29.601
<v Speaker 1>people really need to know and do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of lectures on those things </v>

2479
02:14:29.601 --> 02:14:32.940
<v Speaker 1>that were outstanding and then they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be updated and attitude,</v>

2480
02:14:32.941 --> 02:14:36.270
<v Speaker 1>but then it's like it's a done game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's free.</v>

2481
02:14:36.930 --> 02:14:41.930
<v Speaker 1>So I know it started thinking about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year when I noticed that my </v>

2482
02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:44.370
<v Speaker 1>psychology lectures had a million views </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was last April and I thought,</v>

2483
02:14:44.371 --> 02:14:45.900
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A million views.</v>

2484
02:14:45.930 --> 02:14:47.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell that's,</v>

2485
02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the best set.</v>

2486
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:52.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of best selling book </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you never right,</v>

2487
02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:54.810
<v Speaker 1>because no one ever writes a bestselling</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

2488
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:57.780
<v Speaker 1>so a million views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something to pay attention to and</v>

2489
02:14:57.781 --> 02:15:01.920
<v Speaker 1>now it's way more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's videos and podcasts and that</v>

2490
02:15:01.921 --> 02:15:06.921
<v Speaker 1>means that people can listen when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing other things too and so </v>

2491
02:15:06.921 --> 02:15:08.010
<v Speaker 1>that's really cool and maybe people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen better than they can read.</v>

2492
02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:11.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a real possibility because we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>only been reneged silently for about,</v>

2493
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:17.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of like most of humanity for less </v>

2494
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:19.200
<v Speaker 1>than a hundred years and virtually no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one could read silently 500 years ago,</v>

2495
02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:24.500
<v Speaker 1>so really new skill and so maybe we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at listening and so all of a </v>

2496
02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:28.641
<v Speaker 1>sudden there's the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disseminating high quality educational </v>

2497
02:15:28.641 --> 02:15:29.880
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly produced,</v>

2498
02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:35.250
<v Speaker 1>highly vetted to millions of people for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2499
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to compete with that?</v>

2500
02:15:38.130 --> 02:15:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's worse because the humanities </v>

2501
02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:44.880
<v Speaker 1>which have become completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerated,</v>

2502
02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:46.260
<v Speaker 1>almost completed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerate,</v>

2503
02:15:46.261 --> 02:15:51.261
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have abandoned their valuable </v>

2504
02:15:51.261 --> 02:15:52.350
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the collective wisdom,</v>

2505
02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:56.190
<v Speaker 1>at least for the west of of Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization just sitting there.</v>

2506
02:15:56.250 --> 02:16:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Someone might as well steal it back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's the student loan debt cycle</v>

2507
02:16:01.831 --> 02:16:04.470
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's pronounced properly,</v>

2508
02:16:04.471 --> 02:16:07.310
<v Speaker 1>tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tobacco,</v>

2509
02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:12.370
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I've read that word more than </v>

2510
02:16:12.370 --> 02:16:12.660
<v Speaker 1>set it and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

2511
02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:18.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy write me today and he asked </v>

2512
02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:18.080
<v Speaker 1>if he should go to a private college for</v>
<v Speaker 1>$22,000</v>

2513
02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:23.061
<v Speaker 1>a year to produce produce to pursue an </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate in psychology so that he </v>

2514
02:16:23.101 --> 02:16:26.640
<v Speaker 1>could he get into clinical graduate </v>
<v Speaker 1>school or go to another university,</v>

2515
02:16:26.641 --> 02:16:31.641
<v Speaker 1>the State University for far less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him to go the state university </v>

2516
02:16:31.641 --> 02:16:32.530
<v Speaker 1>because it's the wise economic decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2517
02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:35.890
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to me that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable at all to load people up when</v>

2518
02:16:35.891 --> 02:16:39.850
<v Speaker 1>they're 22 with $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>of student debt that they cannot declare</v>

2519
02:16:39.851 --> 02:16:44.851
<v Speaker 1>bankruptcy for its indentured servitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there and to load up people when </v>

2520
02:16:45.761 --> 02:16:48.430
<v Speaker 1>they're 22 or 23 with debt of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude.</v>

2521
02:16:48.430 --> 02:16:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how the hell are they going to be </v>

2522
02:16:53.430 --> 02:16:55.171
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to take a risk with </v>

2523
02:16:55.171 --> 02:16:55.270
<v Speaker 1>$100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>debt load and who's going to marry you?</v>

2524
02:16:56.010 --> 02:16:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Well really Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2525
02:16:57.460 --> 02:16:59.470
<v Speaker 1>because another story I heard recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2526
02:16:59.471 --> 02:17:04.090
<v Speaker 1>well I just got married to my partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She brought into the marriage $120,000</v>

2527
02:17:04.091 --> 02:17:05.200
<v Speaker 1>in student debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2528
02:17:05.410 --> 02:17:08.050
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's crippling man.</v>

2529
02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Like once you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're making a substantial amount </v>

2530
02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:13.260
<v Speaker 1>of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're fortunate,</v>

2531
02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:15.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're in your forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could handle a debt load like that,</v>

2532
02:17:15.521 --> 02:17:17.500
<v Speaker 1>but in your twenties it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>crippling.</v>

2533
02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:22.920
<v Speaker 1>So you know the tuition fees of rat have</v>
<v Speaker 1>ratcheted up like mad in the last 30 </v>

2534
02:17:23.681 --> 02:17:24.250
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unit,</v>

2535
02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:27.490
<v Speaker 1>the colleges and universities have </v>
<v Speaker 1>become unbelievably administratively,</v>

2536
02:17:27.491 --> 02:17:31.120
<v Speaker 1>top heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're regulated to death by the,</v>

2537
02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:36.150
<v Speaker 1>by the legislative system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's ethics committees which are </v>

2538
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.550
<v Speaker 1>so counterproductive that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>

2539
02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:41.820
<v Speaker 1>There's this entire whole whole new </v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrous hyper accommodation movement </v>

2540
02:17:42.510 --> 02:17:45.260
<v Speaker 1>that that's that borders on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2541
02:17:45.330 --> 02:17:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll make a video about that soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

2542
02:17:47.021 --> 02:17:50.650
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely pathological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this whole postmodern,</v>

2543
02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:55.760
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's going on in the universities </v>

2544
02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:55.760
<v Speaker 1>and so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2545
02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:59.491
<v Speaker 1>how many mistakes does an institute plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>students aren't being taught how to </v>

2546
02:17:59.491 --> 02:18:00.970
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not being taught how to debate.</v>

2547
02:18:01.090 --> 02:18:05.080
<v Speaker 1>They're not being taught how to write </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't read difficult things.</v>

2548
02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:07.840
<v Speaker 1>They read French intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists,</v>

2549
02:18:07.841 --> 02:18:12.841
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they probably don't read those </v>

2550
02:18:12.841 --> 02:18:12.841
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They read secondarily derive.</v>

2551
02:18:12.841 --> 02:18:17.550
<v Speaker 1>They Skim secondarily derived papers </v>
<v Speaker 1>about French intellectual postmarks.</v>

2552
02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:23.420
<v Speaker 1>This postmodern is from the 19 seventies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the standards have been lowered </v>

2553
02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:26.680
<v Speaker 1>because there's too many people pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher education and so I think,</v>

2554
02:18:26.681 --> 02:18:31.681
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's eight dimensions of success and </v>

2555
02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:34.810
<v Speaker 1>on every single dimension there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

2556
02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:40.620
<v Speaker 1>The system's done the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the vision would be why not provide </v>

2557
02:18:40.991 --> 02:18:45.991
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the world with high quality</v>
<v Speaker 1>education in the humanities for like one</v>

2558
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:46.720
<v Speaker 1>50th.</v>

2559
02:18:46.730 --> 02:18:49.750
<v Speaker 1>The cost you can charge for </v>
<v Speaker 1>accreditation.</v>

2560
02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:51.460
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole separate issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2561
02:18:51.461 --> 02:18:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Accreditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the but the resources,</v>

2562
02:18:54.581 --> 02:18:56.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like why not make them available to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone?</v>

2563
02:18:57.610 --> 02:19:02.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know if I can do it or </v>

2564
02:19:02.610 --> 02:19:05.251
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's partly what I'm doing with his </v>

2565
02:19:05.251 --> 02:19:07.231
<v Speaker 1>biblical lecture series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of putting my toe in the </v>

2566
02:19:07.231 --> 02:19:10.171
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a plan and I have some good </v>

2567
02:19:10.171 --> 02:19:13.861
<v Speaker 1>programmers who are willing to help and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of people out there that </v>

2568
02:19:13.861 --> 02:19:13.861
<v Speaker 1>would help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

2569
02:19:13.861 --> 02:19:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm being flooded with offers of help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to take people up on the </v>

2570
02:19:17.170 --> 02:19:18.310
<v Speaker 1>offers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that easy to get someone to</v>

2571
02:19:18.311 --> 02:19:19.460
<v Speaker 1>help you do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2572
02:19:20.770 --> 02:19:23.280
<v Speaker 1>so that'd be the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2573
02:19:23.290 --> 02:19:28.290
<v Speaker 1>so what would the plan be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give people a high quality education in </v>

2574
02:19:28.290 --> 02:19:31.990
<v Speaker 1>the classic humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach them how to speak and write a </v>

2575
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:35.251
<v Speaker 1>credit them for one 10th the current </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost and do it with millions of people </v>

2576
02:19:35.251 --> 02:19:40.121
<v Speaker 1>instead of tens of thousands of asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>what plans do you have for the </v>

2577
02:19:40.121 --> 02:19:44.171
<v Speaker 1>accreditation side where people can show</v>
<v Speaker 1>something for what the time they spend </v>

2578
02:19:44.171 --> 02:19:44.171
<v Speaker 1>watching?</v>

2579
02:19:44.171 --> 02:19:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I would do for </v>

2580
02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:47.720
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is imagine that you were in a course and</v>

2581
02:19:47.721 --> 02:19:52.721
<v Speaker 1>so you have taken exam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's a multiple choice exam </v>

2582
02:19:52.721 --> 02:19:53.810
<v Speaker 1>just for the sake of argument because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're simpler.</v>

2583
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 1>The writing issue is a separate problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2584
02:19:57.531 --> 02:20:02.531
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that you would do </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you enrolled in the courses generate </v>

2585
02:20:02.531 --> 02:20:04.940
<v Speaker 1>multiple choice questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be one of your assignments.</v>

2586
02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's a lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate 10 multiple choice questions.</v>

2587
02:20:08.180 --> 02:20:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got a thousand people </v>
<v Speaker 1>generating 10 multiple choice questions.</v>

2588
02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Well then you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are statistical procedures that </v>

2589
02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:19.121
<v Speaker 1>help you figure out what valid multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice questions are.</v>

2590
02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:22.310
<v Speaker 1>You could have people vote on them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that matter if we put them on a website,</v>

2591
02:20:22.370 --> 02:20:25.250
<v Speaker 1>assignment number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's 100 multiple choice questions.</v>

2592
02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Pick the 10 that you think are most </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of the knowledge that </v>

2593
02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:30.470
<v Speaker 1>you've acquired.</v>

2594
02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Get 100 people to do that so you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowdsource the test construction and </v>

2595
02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:40.091
<v Speaker 1>then you could keep making the test </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and better as well because you </v>

2596
02:20:40.091 --> 02:20:42.851
<v Speaker 1>could build that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to build the system so that it </v>

2597
02:20:42.851 --> 02:20:44.891
<v Speaker 1>was self improving with a minimum of </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrative interference and so then </v>

2598
02:20:46.011 --> 02:20:48.620
<v Speaker 1>what would happen is that as you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>accredited,</v>

2599
02:20:48.621 --> 02:20:51.410
<v Speaker 1>so you start reading exams and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>write more and more of them.</v>

2600
02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd start to by voting power with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to the content of the courses </v>

2601
02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:58.760
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even the right to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>courses to put them up online.</v>

2602
02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:00.580
<v Speaker 1>So something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But our,</v>

2603
02:21:00.581 --> 02:21:05.581
<v Speaker 1>our strategy would be to build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to build a system that's </v>

2604
02:21:05.581 --> 02:21:08.150
<v Speaker 1>basically autonomous and self improving </v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning.</v>

2605
02:21:08.210 --> 02:21:12.560
<v Speaker 1>So minimum of administrative overhead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely low cost,</v>

2606
02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:18.010
<v Speaker 1>widespread availability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowdsourced and its structure and an </v>

2607
02:21:18.621 --> 02:21:21.830
<v Speaker 1>autonomous self improving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can do that.</v>

2608
02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we have the technology to do</v>

2609
02:21:26.481 --> 02:21:27.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

2610
02:21:27.801 --> 02:21:29.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's the plan,</v>

2611
02:21:29.811 --> 02:21:30.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>

2612
02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm always thinking of the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point b,</v>

2613
02:21:32.490 --> 02:21:34.880
<v Speaker 1>what's a good thing to do with life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the good,</v>

2614
02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:39.910
<v Speaker 1>good thing to do with your life is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most difficult God damned thing you can </v>

2615
02:21:39.910 --> 02:21:40.340
<v Speaker 1>think of that would do the most possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2616
02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:43.760
<v Speaker 1>That'll get you up in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because you think,</v>

2617
02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:45.530
<v Speaker 1>why should I get up in the morning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2618
02:21:45.531 --> 02:21:46.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2619
02:21:46.610 --> 02:21:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I've got $50 million people to educate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2620
02:21:49.071 --> 02:21:51.560
<v Speaker 1>that'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2621
02:21:51.561 --> 02:21:56.561
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that battle that'll overcome a lot of </v>

2622
02:21:56.561 --> 02:21:57.980
<v Speaker 1>anx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thinking so well.</v>

2623
02:21:57.981 --> 02:22:02.981
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that it's inevitable now </v>

2624
02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:07.310
<v Speaker 1>whether or not I can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different story,</v>

2625
02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:10.370
<v Speaker 1>but I can certainly start it and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to start it.</v>

2626
02:22:10.370 --> 02:22:11.800
<v Speaker 1>My partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my business partner,</v>

2627
02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:15.440
<v Speaker 1>the guy who helped me develop the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program,</v>

2628
02:22:15.441 --> 02:22:19.480
<v Speaker 1>which thousands of people are using that</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and we've helped thousands,</v>

2629
02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:22.130
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of students now stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>in university.</v>

2630
02:22:22.131 --> 02:22:25.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe not given the state of the.</v>

2631
02:22:26.770 --> 02:22:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm contributing to the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2632
02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're sticking out their plans.</v>

2633
02:22:32.971 --> 02:22:37.971
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually making plans and </v>

2634
02:22:37.971 --> 02:22:37.971
<v Speaker 1>sticking them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2635
02:22:37.971 --> 02:22:42.620
<v Speaker 1>So I think that we can and we know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start small with the way to build a </v>

2636
02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:44.910
<v Speaker 1>big system is to build a small system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that works and then scale it.</v>

2637
02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking with my partner,</v>

2638
02:22:49.041 --> 02:22:50.320
<v Speaker 1>his name is Daniel Higgins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2639
02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:55.400
<v Speaker 1>I have another partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Peele who used to be my graduate </v>

2640
02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:58.011
<v Speaker 1>supervisor at mcgill and we'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on this sort of thing for about </v>

2641
02:22:58.011 --> 02:23:01.230
<v Speaker 1>25 years and our goal has been right </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning to build low cost,</v>

2642
02:23:01.231 --> 02:23:04.630
<v Speaker 1>high quality psychoeducational </v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions and bring them to his wife</v>

2643
02:23:04.631 --> 02:23:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Deb market as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2644
02:23:07.330 --> 02:23:10.920
<v Speaker 1>and my Daniel in particular is devoted </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of his life to doing that.</v>

2645
02:23:10.921 --> 02:23:13.140
<v Speaker 1>It's been about 20 years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2646
02:23:14.810 --> 02:23:17.990
<v Speaker 1>so while that's a sketch of it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outline more of it on,</v>

2647
02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:19.720
<v Speaker 1>on the web at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of what,</v>

2648
02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:22.340
<v Speaker 1>what we've been deciding what we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>planning to do.</v>

2649
02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

2650
02:23:23.421 --> 02:23:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2651
02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

2652
02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:32.860
<v Speaker 5>When you were on the Rubin report not </v>
<v Speaker 5>too long ago,</v>

2653
02:23:32.861 --> 02:23:37.861
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that discussion you mentioned how a </v>

2654
02:23:37.861 --> 02:23:39.780
<v Speaker 5>use of psilocybin straightened out and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2655
02:23:39.850 --> 02:23:44.850
<v Speaker 5>can produce these transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences which is jarring for a </v>

2656
02:23:44.850 --> 02:23:48.511
<v Speaker 5>person who may have traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which for someone who became a Christian</v>

2657
02:23:49.901 --> 02:23:54.901
<v Speaker 5>as a result of their only time doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>magic mushrooms as jarring piece of </v>

2658
02:23:54.901 --> 02:23:55.300
<v Speaker 5>information,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just wondering if you could expand</v>

2659
02:23:55.301 --> 02:24:00.301
<v Speaker 5>on what you find intriguing about </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious experience and what we can </v>

2660
02:24:00.301 --> 02:24:01.210
<v Speaker 5>know about the transcendent from them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If anything,</v>

2661
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:08.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2662
02:24:14.450 --> 02:24:17.870
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between entheogenic </v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

2663
02:24:17.871 --> 02:24:22.871
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sometimes what those chemicals </v>

2664
02:24:22.871 --> 02:24:25.610
<v Speaker 1>are described and religious experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>unspecified,</v>

2665
02:24:26.060 --> 02:24:31.060
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like it's profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a man named Gordon West Saul </v>

2666
02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:33.650
<v Speaker 1>who wrote a book for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember correctly called Soma.</v>

2667
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:39.190
<v Speaker 1>He was investigating the potential use </v>
<v Speaker 1>of emoney to miscarrying mushrooms among</v>

2668
02:24:40.401 --> 02:24:45.080
<v Speaker 1>the people who wrote the Hindu holy </v>
<v Speaker 1>scriptures thousands of years ago,</v>

2669
02:24:45.081 --> 02:24:50.081
<v Speaker 1>and he felt that he identified the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical that they were using the sacred</v>

2670
02:24:50.241 --> 02:24:51.620
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2671
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:57.070
<v Speaker 1>the use of Iowasca and psilocybin </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and so forth as well document,</v>

2672
02:24:58.610 --> 02:25:01.580
<v Speaker 1>particularly in North America and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>

2673
02:25:01.581 --> 02:25:06.581
<v Speaker 1>the empirical evidence that under </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain conditions those chemicals can </v>

2674
02:25:06.581 --> 02:25:08.180
<v Speaker 1>produce religious experiences is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely overwhelming.</v>

2675
02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:13.550
<v Speaker 1>There's been good research done recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Johns Hopkins looking at Psilocybin,</v>

2676
02:25:13.551 --> 02:25:18.551
<v Speaker 1>the first research that's been done on </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogens really in 30 years because</v>

2677
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:22.580
<v Speaker 1>people were so terrified of them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties and for good reason.</v>

2678
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm indicated that the people that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>dosed with Psilocybin,</v>

2679
02:25:28.251 --> 02:25:32.200
<v Speaker 1>about 75 percent of them had a mystical </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience which they regarded as one of</v>

2680
02:25:32.201 --> 02:25:35.590
<v Speaker 1>the five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three to five most important experiences</v>

2681
02:25:35.591 --> 02:25:40.591
<v Speaker 1>of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a year later we're characterized by </v>

2682
02:25:40.591 --> 02:25:45.031
<v Speaker 1>permanent personality transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was an increase in trade openness </v>

2683
02:25:45.031 --> 02:25:46.630
<v Speaker 1>of one standard deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot by the way.</v>

2684
02:25:46.631 --> 02:25:49.510
<v Speaker 1>It moves you from 50th percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 85th percentile,</v>

2685
02:25:49.870 --> 02:25:50.600
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2686
02:25:50.650 --> 02:25:55.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that look permanent now whether or </v>

2687
02:25:55.650 --> 02:25:55.900
<v Speaker 1>not that's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different issue,</v>

2688
02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:57.820
<v Speaker 1>but they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful.</v>

2689
02:25:57.850 --> 02:26:02.850
<v Speaker 1>And they also did some recent research </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that psilocybin mushrooms were </v>

2690
02:26:02.850 --> 02:26:07.000
<v Speaker 1>an unbelievably effective smoking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cessation intervention.</v>

2691
02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:12.120
<v Speaker 1>So if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I may have this wrong because it's </v>

2692
02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:13.870
<v Speaker 1>been a while since I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had an 80 percent success rate in,</v>

2693
02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:18.900
<v Speaker 1>in stopping people from using a tobacco </v>
<v Speaker 1>with one silicide been experience and so</v>

2694
02:26:21.130 --> 02:26:22.780
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those things are very,</v>

2695
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:26.350
<v Speaker 1>all of that's very interesting to me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know what to make of it.</v>

2696
02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even a little bit,</v>

2697
02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:30.580
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2698
02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:37.900
<v Speaker 1>but the evidence for the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between met mystical experiences and </v>

2699
02:26:39.050 --> 02:26:42.140
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogen use of certain types is </v>
<v Speaker 1>incontrovertible.</v>

2700
02:26:42.141 --> 02:26:47.141
<v Speaker 1>And I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think anybody else knows </v>

2701
02:26:47.141 --> 02:26:47.150
<v Speaker 1>what to derive from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2702
02:26:47.151 --> 02:26:50.300
<v Speaker 1>one conclusion is something like</v>

2703
02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:58.100
<v Speaker 1>religious experiences are a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>concomitant of going temporarily insane </v>

2704
02:26:59.130 --> 02:27:01.560
<v Speaker 1>and that it's not a bad hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you see,</v>

2705
02:27:01.561 --> 02:27:06.561
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the prodrome of illnesses like </v>

2706
02:27:06.561 --> 02:27:09.471
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia and sometimes manic </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressive disorder two on the </v>

2707
02:27:09.471 --> 02:27:12.741
<v Speaker 1>mannequin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do see the emergence often of </v>

2708
02:27:12.741 --> 02:27:14.070
<v Speaker 1>religious type delusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that common,</v>

2709
02:27:14.071 --> 02:27:17.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not uncommon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's definitely the case that if your</v>

2710
02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:22.620
<v Speaker 1>brain function has been detrimentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>affected,</v>

2711
02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:27.830
<v Speaker 1>one of the consequences can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that are subjectively </v>

2712
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:29.400
<v Speaker 1>experienced as indistinguishable from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious.</v>

2713
02:27:29.580 --> 02:27:33.150
<v Speaker 1>You also see the same thing in cases of </v>
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy,</v>

2714
02:27:33.151 --> 02:27:36.240
<v Speaker 1>especially in the pro Jeroma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you have an epileptic condition,</v>

2715
02:27:36.241 --> 02:27:39.120
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you know that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a seizure.</v>

2716
02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:44.250
<v Speaker 1>You can feel it mounting and often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least occasionally,</v>

2717
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:49.790
<v Speaker 1>those experiences are associated with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevation of religious sensation </v>

2718
02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:56.360
<v Speaker 1>deepening meaning that increases in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>depth and complexity until it's </v>

2719
02:27:57.361 --> 02:28:01.800
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjectively brings on the seizure.</v>

2720
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how to disentangle </v>

2721
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:08.790
<v Speaker 1>causality in a circumstance like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky had seizures like that,</v>

2722
02:28:08.791 --> 02:28:10.440
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2723
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:11.650
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2724
02:28:11.850 --> 02:28:13.680
<v Speaker 1>the pessimistic viewpoint is</v>

2725
02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:18.760
<v Speaker 1>religious phenomenology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of brain disorder,</v>

2726
02:28:19.990 --> 02:28:24.990
<v Speaker 1>the positive more positive side is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious experience is a category of </v>

2727
02:28:29.151 --> 02:28:34.151
<v Speaker 1>experienced that's within the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human possibility and there are </v>

2728
02:28:34.151 --> 02:28:38.651
<v Speaker 1>different modes of eliciting it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that there are many modes of </v>

2729
02:28:38.651 --> 02:28:42.461
<v Speaker 1>eliciting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fasting can elicit it dancing under some</v>

2730
02:28:45.201 --> 02:28:50.201
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music enlisted at music elicits that </v>

2731
02:28:50.201 --> 02:28:53.020
<v Speaker 1>regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean basically as far as I'm </v>

2732
02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:53.020
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rock concerts are indistinguishable from</v>

2733
02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:55.310
<v Speaker 1>religious rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rituals,</v>

2734
02:28:55.311 --> 02:28:58.610
<v Speaker 1>not like they don't come with a dogmatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlay,</v>

2735
02:28:58.611 --> 02:29:03.611
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ritualistic structure is there </v>

2736
02:29:03.611 --> 02:29:03.611
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's there just listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

2737
02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means for the investigation of</v>

2738
02:29:07.041 --> 02:29:09.560
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

2739
02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:14.030
<v Speaker 1>And I would also certainly use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>caution that Carl,</v>

2740
02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:19.040
<v Speaker 1>you've developed when he was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about hallucinogens and he did that I </v>

2741
02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:22.271
<v Speaker 1>think only a very brief number of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think in relationship to Elvis </v>

2742
02:29:22.271 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Huxley's original work on Mescalin </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

2743
02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:29.120
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beware of wisdom that you didn't earn.</v>

2744
02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:32.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

2745
02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:36.320
<v Speaker 1>So I would say there is something to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned about.</v>

2746
02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:41.740
<v Speaker 1>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot to be learned about </v>

2747
02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:44.441
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There may be something to be learned </v>

2748
02:29:44.441 --> 02:29:44.441
<v Speaker 1>from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but having said that,</v>

2749
02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:49.130
<v Speaker 1>if you play with fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up burnt generally speaking.</v>

2750
02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:54.160
<v Speaker 1>So I'm all do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caution is in effect.</v>

2751
02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:56.630
<v Speaker 1>So one more,</v>

2752
02:29:58.650 --> 02:30:00.100
<v Speaker 6>I know your analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Huxley Fan.</v>

2753
02:30:00.101 --> 02:30:02.070
<v Speaker 6>So I thought I'd ask you this question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2754
02:30:02.940 --> 02:30:06.780
<v Speaker 6>after reading his book,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doors of perception in which he gives an</v>

2755
02:30:06.781 --> 02:30:11.781
<v Speaker 6>account of his experience taking the </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic drug Mescalin he stated that</v>

2756
02:30:12.990 --> 02:30:16.640
<v Speaker 6>in the final stages of egolessness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is an obscene knowledge.</v>

2757
02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Is that all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in all that</v>

2758
02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:24.660
<v Speaker 6>actually each.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He then went on to say that this is as </v>

2759
02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:28.471
<v Speaker 6>near I take it as a finite mind can ever</v>
<v Speaker 6>get to perceiving everything that is </v>

2760
02:30:28.471 --> 02:30:30.120
<v Speaker 6>happening in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2761
02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:35.380
<v Speaker 6>I was wondering if maybe you could </v>
<v Speaker 6>explain what that means because I've </v>

2762
02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:35.380
<v Speaker 6>been trying to understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2763
02:30:42.930 --> 02:30:47.930
<v Speaker 1>There is a neuroscientist a while back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose name I don't remember who had a </v>

2764
02:30:47.930 --> 02:30:51.821
<v Speaker 1>stroke and she being a neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was analyzing the neurological </v>

2765
02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:56.360
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the stroke as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred,</v>

2766
02:30:57.020 --> 02:31:02.020
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stroke either temporarily or </v>

2767
02:31:02.020 --> 02:31:06.290
<v Speaker 1>permanently took out the function of </v>
<v Speaker 1>large portions of her left hemisphere.</v>

2768
02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:11.620
<v Speaker 1>And she had exactly that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an experience of ego dissolution,</v>

2769
02:31:12.471 --> 02:31:13.810
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2770
02:31:14.350 --> 02:31:15.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2771
02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:20.410
<v Speaker 1>the felt sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of identity shifting from that sort of </v>

2772
02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:25.670
<v Speaker 1>narrow boundary maybe that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>define by the boundary of your physical </v>

2773
02:31:25.711 --> 02:31:30.711
<v Speaker 1>being into something that was much </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader and much like it gets,</v>

2774
02:31:30.900 --> 02:31:33.570
<v Speaker 1>it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets hard to describe this without,</v>

2775
02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:39.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerating into hippie poetry from </v>

2776
02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:39.020
<v Speaker 1>1967 very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

2777
02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:43.500
<v Speaker 1>But it's something like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense,</v>

2778
02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:47.190
<v Speaker 1>a sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the underlying unity of consciousness</v>

2779
02:31:47.191 --> 02:31:50.220
<v Speaker 1>that might be one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know much about consciousness.</v>

2780
02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:55.580
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we know anything about </v>

2781
02:31:55.580 --> 02:31:56.991
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is something that we all </v>

2782
02:31:56.991 --> 02:32:00.141
<v Speaker 1>share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also something that we seem to </v>

2783
02:32:00.141 --> 02:32:03.070
<v Speaker 1>also experience individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe our individual consciousness.</v>

2784
02:32:03.071 --> 02:32:08.071
<v Speaker 1>Is there something like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of something that's a </v>

2785
02:32:08.071 --> 02:32:10.560
<v Speaker 1>more unified consciousness underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's hardly an original idea,</v>

2786
02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:15.920
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem to be the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>under some circumstances there are </v>

2787
02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:17.520
<v Speaker 1>neurological transformations that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

2788
02:32:18.990 --> 02:32:22.140
<v Speaker 1>link more apparent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that the link exists now,</v>

2789
02:32:22.141 --> 02:32:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

2790
02:32:22.981 --> 02:32:26.370
<v Speaker 1>they're just producing a delusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the funny thing about,</v>

2791
02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:32.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing about delusions is that </v>

2792
02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:32.120
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2793
02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:35.571
<v Speaker 1>how do you know something's a delusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer that has to be something </v>

2794
02:32:35.571 --> 02:32:35.580
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2795
02:32:35.581 --> 02:32:38.460
<v Speaker 1>hardly anyone else thinks that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be criteria number one.</v>

2796
02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Criteria number two would be if you act </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the delusion,</v>

2797
02:32:42.811 --> 02:32:47.370
<v Speaker 1>do does your ships sink because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sick ship sinks,</v>

2798
02:32:47.371 --> 02:32:49.560
<v Speaker 1>then it was a delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

2799
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:52.950
<v Speaker 1>But if you act on your delusion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things get better,</v>

2800
02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:58.760
<v Speaker 1>well then maybe it wasn't a delusion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence from the silicide </v>

2801
02:32:58.760 --> 02:33:01.980
<v Speaker 1>been studies that have been conducted at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johns Hopkins that there was detrimental</v>

2802
02:33:01.981 --> 02:33:06.981
<v Speaker 1>effects for the participants and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>participants certainly don't think that </v>

2803
02:33:06.981 --> 02:33:07.770
<v Speaker 1>the effects were detrimental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2804
02:33:07.771 --> 02:33:10.710
<v Speaker 1>and I've been hesitant to talk about any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this for obvious reasons.</v>

2805
02:33:11.580 --> 02:33:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you something really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's funny.</v>

2806
02:33:14.071 --> 02:33:19.071
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had timothy leary's old job at </v>

2807
02:33:19.071 --> 02:33:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

2808
02:33:20.071 --> 02:33:25.071
<v Speaker 1>and so larry is a good object lesson and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being very careful about this sort of </v>

2809
02:33:25.071 --> 02:33:25.260
<v Speaker 1>thing because it certainly,</v>

2810
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:31.840
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious that his net effect was</v>
<v Speaker 1>good</v>

2811
02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:36.590
<v Speaker 1>and I say that with some caution because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry was a very smart person and he was</v>

2812
02:33:36.591 --> 02:33:41.591
<v Speaker 1>very creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got tangled up in that </v>

2813
02:33:41.591 --> 02:33:41.760
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic madhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2814
02:33:41.780 --> 02:33:46.780
<v Speaker 1>that had characterized the say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>period from 1965 to about 1970 and it,</v>

2815
02:33:47.031 --> 02:33:52.031
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't seem to me that that was </v>

2816
02:33:52.031 --> 02:33:54.071
<v Speaker 1>altogether a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thing is we have these chemicals now in </v>

2817
02:33:54.071 --> 02:33:57.671
<v Speaker 1>our culture and people are experimenting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them like mad and making them </v>

2818
02:33:57.951 --> 02:34:02.180
<v Speaker 1>illegal doesn't seem to be working in </v>
<v Speaker 1>large part because there,</v>

2819
02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I think there were seven known seven to </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 known psychoactive substances that </v>

2820
02:34:08.001 --> 02:34:13.001
<v Speaker 1>were illegal in the year 2000 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 400 now because labs all </v>

2821
02:34:14.331 --> 02:34:16.490
<v Speaker 1>over the world keep tweaking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules,</v>

2822
02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:19.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because molecule is illegal,</v>

2823
02:34:19.151 --> 02:34:24.151
<v Speaker 1>so chemists just shifted a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they have a new hallucinogen and </v>

2824
02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:27.430
<v Speaker 1>which might be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be because now and then you</v>

2825
02:34:27.431 --> 02:34:30.040
<v Speaker 1>can produce a chemical that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably dangerous.</v>

2826
02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:33.860
<v Speaker 1>Fentanyl's sort of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a drug a while back that I can</v>

2827
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:35.500
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name.</v>

2828
02:34:35.930 --> 02:34:38.110
<v Speaker 1>It was an acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fun drug.</v>

2829
02:34:38.590 --> 02:34:40.600
<v Speaker 1>If you took it once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gave you a permanent,</v>

2830
02:34:40.601 --> 02:34:45.601
<v Speaker 1>irreversible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total Parkinson's disease so people </v>

2831
02:34:45.601 --> 02:34:47.320
<v Speaker 1>would take it and they were frozen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was it.</v>

2832
02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:52.680
<v Speaker 1>So MPTP I think it was called so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it destroyed the same area of </v>

2833
02:34:52.811 --> 02:34:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the brain that the Parkinson's destroys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it did it right away.</v>

2834
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:57.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2835
02:34:58.110 --> 02:35:00.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>designer drugs,</v>

2836
02:35:00.011 --> 02:35:00.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2837
02:35:02.220 --> 02:35:07.220
<v Speaker 1>A little caution is in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we might approach the issue of </v>

2838
02:35:07.220 --> 02:35:10.080
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogen use in a mature manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2839
02:35:10.081 --> 02:35:12.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a topic for an entirely other </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

2840
02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even necessarily sure that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be approached that way,</v>

2841
02:35:15.901 --> 02:35:20.901
<v Speaker 1>although I would say at minimum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>determining what it is that you're up to</v>

2842
02:35:23.121 --> 02:35:25.430
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a good thing.</v>

2843
02:35:25.490 --> 02:35:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it exactly that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>serving?</v>

2844
02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:31.220
<v Speaker 1>They're not party drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not for fun,</v>

2845
02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they are,</v>

2846
02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:38.770
<v Speaker 1>that's not what they're for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe they could be used by </v>

2847
02:35:38.841 --> 02:35:42.260
<v Speaker 1>people who are carefully orienting </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves towards the good.</v>

2848
02:35:42.290 --> 02:35:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Although I wouldn't say that that should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be read as a recommendation.</v>

2849
02:35:48.390 --> 02:35:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2850
02:35:50.850 --> 02:35:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
