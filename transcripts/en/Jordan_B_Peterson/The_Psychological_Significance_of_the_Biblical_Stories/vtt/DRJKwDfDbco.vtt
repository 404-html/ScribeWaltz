1
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the last time I was here,</v>

2
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 1>many of you were as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got halfway through the story of </v>

3
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.301
<v Speaker 1>Jacob and I've been digging underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story sporadically since then to try</v>

4
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:36.531
<v Speaker 1>to find out what other themes are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed and I've got some things that </v>

5
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>I think are really interesting to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

6
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll get right into it.</v>

7
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to review a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

8
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about Jacob and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>re update his biography a little bit so </v>

9
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>that we can place ourselves in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper context before we go on.</v>

10
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>So his mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rebecca gave birth to twins and the </v>

11
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>twins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in her womb,</v>

12
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>we're struggling for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were struggling.</v>

13
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 1>And of course the story is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were struggling for dominance the older </v>

14
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>or the younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the older.</v>

15
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:16.431
<v Speaker 1>Really because Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob means you surper and Rebecca had </v>

16
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>what would you call a vision from God </v>
<v Speaker 1>that said that Jacob would supplant </v>

18
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Esau.</v>

19
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>And so even before her twins were born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in a state of competition.</v>

20
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's a recapitulation of the motif</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hostile brothers,</v>

21
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

22
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:41.031
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common mythological motif and we </v>

23
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:44.600
<v Speaker 1>already saw that really well developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the story of Cain and Abel and Cain </v>

24
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>and Abel were essentially the first two </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

25
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>the first two natural born human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were instantly locked in the </v>

26
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.781
<v Speaker 1>state of enmity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is symbolic of first the enmity </v>

27
00:01:56.781 --> 00:02:01.671
<v Speaker 1>that exists within people's psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the part of them you might say </v>

28
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>that saving at the light and the part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that's aiming at the darkness.</v>

29
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>portraying it.</v>

30
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's a way that sort of rife </v>
<v Speaker 1>with symbolism,</v>

31
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.080
<v Speaker 1>but my experience of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you get to know them </v>

32
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>seriously or when they're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious issues,</v>

33
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:25.911
<v Speaker 1>is that there is quite clearly a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that's striving to do well in the </v>

34
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>world or even to do good.</v>

35
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>And another part that's deeply cynical </v>
<v Speaker 1>and embittered that it says to hell with</v>

36
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:37.251
<v Speaker 1>it and is self destructive and lashes </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and really aims at making things </v>

37
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:43.161
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to be a natural part </v>

38
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>of the human psyche and that's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflected in the,</v>

39
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.400
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those ideas are not easily </v>

40
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>castaway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're associated with the rise of self</v>

41
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>consciousness right in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the story of the garden of Eden.</v>

42
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's right because I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that our selfconsciousness </v>

43
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>produces that division within us because</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than any other creature,</v>

44
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>we're intensely aware of our finitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>and suffering.</v>

45
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And that tends to turn us at least to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree against being itself.</v>

46
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a bunch of protesters in </v>

47
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.961
<v Speaker 1>the US last week scream at the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about trump?</v>

48
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

49
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I thought it was an extraordinarily</v>

50
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic display,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

51
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 1>but despite that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something symbolically </v>

52
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 1>appropriate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also,</v>

53
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a movie I really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadly enough called Fubar.</v>

54
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you have seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

55
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that movie I take it.</v>

56
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the people I grew up with.</v>

57
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.830
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

59
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

60
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>So the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main actor in Fubar,</v>

61
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>who's quite bright but completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncivilized,</v>

62
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.800
<v Speaker 1>gets testicular cancer and there's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>great scene where he gets far too drunk </v>

63
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>and he's stumbling around the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

65
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually comatose state.</v>

66
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:16.891
<v Speaker 1>And of course he's not very thrilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>with what's happened to him and he's </v>

67
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>shaking his fist at the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pouring rain and he's cursing God </v>

68
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

69
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of understand is </v>

70
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.971
<v Speaker 1>positioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that Kinda reminded me of these </v>

71
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>people who were yelling at the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.160
<v Speaker 1>they were basically they are at </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatizing the idea of in rate they </v>

73
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.831
<v Speaker 1>were enraged at while you could say God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course most of them wouldn't say </v>

74
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:40.231
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but would they were the ones yelling at </v>

75
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:40.231
<v Speaker 1>the damn sky.</v>

76
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:40.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>so you gotta you gotta look at what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing rather than what they say.</v>

78
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:48.331
<v Speaker 1>And they were outraged that being was </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed such that trump could have </v>

79
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>arisen as president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so well.</v>

80
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:53.250
<v Speaker 1>So this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Speaker 1>that we can be easily turned against </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and work for its destruction is a </v>

82
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really common,</v>

83
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>common common theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never goes away.</v>

84
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>You see it echoed in stories like with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new marvel series for example,</v>

85
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you see the enmity between thor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Loki.</v>

86
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a good example of the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or between Batman and the joker,</v>

87
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>there's superman and Lex luthor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These.</v>

88
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>There's these pairs of a hero against </v>
<v Speaker 1>villain that's a really dramatic and </v>

89
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 1>easily what everyone can understand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic,</v>

90
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:32.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a basic plot and the reason it's a </v>

91
00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 1>basic plot is because it's true of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle within our spirits,</v>

92
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>our own individual spirits.</v>

93
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It's true within families because </v>
<v Speaker 1>sibling rivalry can be unbelievably </v>

94
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.211
<v Speaker 1>brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true between human beings who are </v>

95
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.031
<v Speaker 1>strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true between groups of people like </v>

96
00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>it's true at every level of analysis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then in some sense it's.</v>

97
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.410
<v Speaker 1>It's architecturally true at least with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to deep religious symbolism </v>

98
00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>because you see that echoed in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories as well,</v>

99
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:04.181
<v Speaker 1>so I think the clearest representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is probably Christ in St and that's the </v>

100
00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:08.471
<v Speaker 1>closest to a pure archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there is in the old Egyptian </v>

101
00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:13.271
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Osiris and seth or horus and </v>

102
00:06:13.271 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>seth and seth is a precursor to Satan </v>
<v Speaker 1>etymologically,</v>

103
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:21.671
<v Speaker 1>so it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common motif and so that's what </v>

104
00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>happens again in Rebecca's womb is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>

105
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 1>this idea has played out right away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the two,</v>

106
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>the two twins are actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it there they have a</v>

107
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.730
<v Speaker 1>superordinate destiny because one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them is destined to become the father of</v>

108
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:44.351
<v Speaker 1>Israel and of course that's a pinnacle </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment in the Old Testament obviously </v>

109
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>and arguably a pinnacle moment in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

110
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Now the degree to which the stories in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Old Testament actually constitute </v>

111
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>what we would consider empirical history</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a matter of debate,</v>

112
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because as I mentioned,</v>

113
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I think before in this lecture series </v>
<v Speaker 1>know there are.</v>

114
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>There are forms of fiction that are met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A true,</v>

115
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 1>which means that they're not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a specific individual.</v>

116
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:19.871
<v Speaker 1>Although I generally think they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on the life of specific </v>

117
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:19.871
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the simplest theory,</v>

118
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 1>but who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

119
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.650
<v Speaker 1>But there are more real than reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself because they abstract out the </v>

120
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 1>most relevant elements of reality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>present them to you.</v>

121
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you watch fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't want.</v>

122
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>You want your fiction boiled down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

123
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.710
<v Speaker 1>You want to boil down to the essence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes good fiction and that </v>

124
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>essence is something that's truer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>than plain old truth.</v>

125
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 1>If it's handled well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

126
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:53.381
<v Speaker 1>if you watch a shakespeare play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half a lifetime of events can go by in a</v>

127
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:58.571
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare play and it covers a wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>range of scenes and so on and and so </v>

128
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:05.471
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cut and edited and compressed all </v>

129
00:08:05.471 --> 00:08:06.070
<v Speaker 1>at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of that blasts you with with</v>

130
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.230
<v Speaker 1>a kind of emotional and ethical force </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just the mirror videotaping of </v>

131
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:17.531
<v Speaker 1>someone's daily life wouldn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even come close to </v>

132
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:21.521
<v Speaker 1>approximating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then this motif of the hostile </v>

133
00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

134
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.420
<v Speaker 1>that's a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep archetipal truth.</v>

135
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.110
<v Speaker 1>And God says to Rachel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two nations are in thy womb,</v>

136
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 1>and two manner of people shall be </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated from the bowels and one people</v>

137
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 1>shall be stronger than the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the elder shall serve the younger.</v>

138
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.520
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a inversion there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

139
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:48.521
<v Speaker 1>Because as we've discussed historically </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking in traditionally speaking,</v>

140
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:55.661
<v Speaker 1>it's the elder son that to whom the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate blessings flow.</v>

141
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>There's some truth in that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even more.</v>

142
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.970
<v Speaker 1>What would you say more empirically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq tends to decrease as the number of </v>

143
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 1>children in the family increase the </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>

144
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>The oldest is the smartest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

145
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.140
<v Speaker 1>it isn't clear why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be that they get more </v>

146
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.140
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who knows?</v>

147
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 1>So those of you who are younger can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>very unhappy about that fact.</v>

148
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Now Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

149
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>so there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another plot line here too,</v>

150
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:34.581
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a Abraham and and Rebecca </v>
<v Speaker 1>are at odds at.</v>

151
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:43.641
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaac and Rebecca are at odds about the </v>

152
00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:43.641
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

153
00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an eatable twist to it too,</v>

154
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:48.210
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

155
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Isaac is allied with Esau who turns out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the hunter type.</v>

156
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So he's your basic rough and tumble </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

157
00:09:55.501 --> 00:10:00.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's kind of a wild looking guy </v>

158
00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 1>called Harry and he likes to be outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lives in tents,</v>

159
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 1>he likes to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a man's man.</v>

160
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:06.770
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Jacob dwells intense,</v>

161
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't go outside much.</v>

162
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:10.830
<v Speaker 1>He's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe he's more introverted,</v>

163
00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:15.831
<v Speaker 1>but he's certainly the sort of kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent say who hangs around home and</v>

164
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.860
<v Speaker 1>there's some intimation that he's as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

165
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.870
<v Speaker 1>He's clearly as mother's favorite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the advantages and I suppose </v>

166
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 1>disadvantaged that go along with that.</v>

167
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.440
<v Speaker 1>And Isaac and Rebecca don't see eye to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eye about who should have predominance </v>

168
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:36.621
<v Speaker 1>among the sons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Rebecca is quite complicit with </v>

169
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Jacob in inverting the social order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that happens that's </v>

170
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:48.201
<v Speaker 1>crooked is that Esau comes in from </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and he's,</v>

171
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's been out for a number of days</v>

172
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>and he's ravenous and he's kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive guy,</v>

173
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:57.540
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really seem to think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm very much.</v>

174
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.840
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob was cooking some lentil stew </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Esau wants some of it and Jacob </v>

175
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>refuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then says that he'll trade his,</v>

176
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.560
<v Speaker 1>his birthright for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

177
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Esau agrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bad deal,</v>

178
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad deal.</v>

179
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.540
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that Esau actually </v>

180
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.361
<v Speaker 1>deserves what's coming to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although at minimum you'd have to think </v>

181
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 1>of them both as being equally culpable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nasty trick.</v>

182
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>And so that's Jacob's first trick.</v>

183
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.060
<v Speaker 1>And then the second trick is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>later and Isaac is old and blind and you</v>

184
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.360
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to death and it's time for him to </v>

185
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.641
<v Speaker 1>bestow a blessing on his sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very important event </v>

186
00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:56.331
<v Speaker 1>apparently among these ancient people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Esau again is out hunting and Rachel</v>

187
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>dress dresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob in a hairy puts a goat skin on his</v>

188
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:08.461
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's Kinda hairy like Esol and </v>

189
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:08.461
<v Speaker 1>dresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Minnesota was closed so he smells like</v>

190
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:13.351
<v Speaker 1>Esau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Isaac Tells Esau to go out and hunt </v>

191
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>him up some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some venison I think it is.</v>

192
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>And which is a favorite of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Rebecca has Jacob Cook up a couple </v>

193
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.031
<v Speaker 1>of goat kids and serve that to Isaac and</v>
<v Speaker 1>play the role of Esl.</v>

194
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 1>And so he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty damn nasty.</v>

195
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Really all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.360
<v Speaker 1>to play a trick like that both on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother and on your blind father and in </v>

197
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 1>collusion with your mother.</v>

198
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not the sort of thing that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to promote lot of familial </v>

199
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.771
<v Speaker 1>harmony and so especially because you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>already screwed them over in a big way.</v>

200
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:55.501
<v Speaker 1>Once you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd think you'd think that would be </v>

201
00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 1>sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

202
00:12:56.111 --> 00:13:01.111
<v Speaker 1>he's successful and ESL loses his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father's blessing and so that Jacob ends</v>

203
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>up really in the position of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>

204
00:13:03.611 --> 00:13:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's quite interesting because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

205
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.650
<v Speaker 1>God tells Rachel that Jacob is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the dominant twin and you'd think </v>

206
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.511
<v Speaker 1>again with God's blessing or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>the prophecy that Jacob would end up </v>

207
00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:20.101
<v Speaker 1>being in a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly not presented that way </v>

208
00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:23.941
<v Speaker 1>to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also quite interesting given </v>

209
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:23.941
<v Speaker 1>that he's the eventual founder of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>

210
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:26.860
<v Speaker 1>And it's another indication of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realism of these old stories.</v>

211
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:27.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

212
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Speaker 1>it's quite amazing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been quite amazing to me how</v>

213
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.420
<v Speaker 1>unprinted fight these stories have </v>
<v Speaker 1>remained.</v>

214
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'd think that if you're even </v>

215
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.241
<v Speaker 1>the least bit cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you had the kind of </v>

216
00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Marxist religion is the opiate of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masses kind of viewpoint,</v>

217
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a credible viewpoint,</v>

218
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's wrong,</v>

219
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

220
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a shallow interpretation </v>

221
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.870
<v Speaker 1>and a part of the reason I think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shallow interpretation is because the </v>

222
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.800
<v Speaker 1>stories would be a lot prettier if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the case.</v>

223
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.890
<v Speaker 1>These characters wouldn't have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>

224
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.460
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral ambiguity about them.</v>

225
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to feed people a </v>

226
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.661
<v Speaker 1>fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then if you want it to be like a </v>

227
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:13.661
<v Speaker 1>harlequin novel or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

228
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:15.520
<v Speaker 1>or our greeting card or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

229
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it to be a story that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of betrayal and deceit and murder </v>

230
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 1>and mayhem and genocide and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just doesn't seem all that.</v>

231
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.880
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calming I guess would be the right </v>

232
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

233
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Jacob gets away with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Esau is not happy and,</v>

234
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.660
<v Speaker 1>and Jacob is quite convinced that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>might kill them.</v>

235
00:14:37.661 --> 00:14:42.661
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was a reasonable fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Esau was a tough guy and he was </v>

236
00:14:42.661 --> 00:14:46.111
<v Speaker 1>used to being outside and he knew how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt and he knew how to kill and he </v>

237
00:14:46.111 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 1>actually wasn't very happy about getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously screwed over by his,</v>

238
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay at home brother twice.</v>

239
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.470
<v Speaker 1>And so Jacob runs off and goes to visit </v>
<v Speaker 1>his uncle and on the way.</v>

240
00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 1>And this is a very interesting part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this story.</v>

241
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:05.170
<v Speaker 1>He stops and to sleep and he takes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone for a pillow and then he has this </v>

242
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:08.390
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a dream,</v>

243
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.020
<v Speaker 1>but the context makes it look like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision of a ladder reaching up to heaven</v>

244
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 1>and with angels moving up and down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladder,</v>

245
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:19.820
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

246
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 1>And there's some representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

247
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I showed you some of them the last time </v>
<v Speaker 1>we met,</v>

248
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:29.801
<v Speaker 1>but I'll read it to you first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lighted upon a certain place and </v>

249
00:15:29.801 --> 00:15:33.911
<v Speaker 1>tarried there all night because the sun </v>
<v Speaker 1>was set and he took of the stones of </v>

250
00:15:33.911 --> 00:15:35.870
<v Speaker 1>that place and put them for his pillows </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lay down in that place to sleep.</v>

251
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 1>And he dreamed and beheld a ladder set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on the earth,</v>

252
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:44.890
<v Speaker 1>and the top of it reached to heaven and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behold the angels of God ascending and </v>

253
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.001
<v Speaker 1>descending on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And behold the lord stood above it and </v>

254
00:15:49.001 --> 00:15:49.001
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the Lord God of Abraham,</v>

255
00:15:49.001 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 1>thy father and the god of Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the land.</v>

256
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.220
<v Speaker 1>We're on the Elias to the I will give it</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nti seed.</v>

257
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.640
<v Speaker 1>And I see job as the dust of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now schultes spread abroad to the </v>

258
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.160
<v Speaker 1>west and to the east and to the north </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the south.</v>

259
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 1>So that lays out the canonical </v>
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>

260
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:08.891
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now there's a center with the </v>

261
00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:08.891
<v Speaker 1>canonical directions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the thing that you see,</v>

262
00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:13.540
<v Speaker 1>that little symbol you see on maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing that symbolically </v>

263
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.950
<v Speaker 1>placed upon the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a center has been established with </v>

264
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.580
<v Speaker 1>radiating well with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what?</v>

265
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 1>With with directional lines radiating </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

266
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:27.731
<v Speaker 1>So it establishes as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a place and in the seed shall all the</v>

267
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 1>families of the earth be blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty good news for Jacob.</v>

268
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:36.851
<v Speaker 1>And it's not self evident why God is </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewarding him for running away after </v>

269
00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:38.900
<v Speaker 1>screwing over his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that seems to be what happens.</v>

270
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.960
<v Speaker 1>And so here's a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>

271
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:46.961
<v Speaker 1>classic representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one on the right is William Blake </v>

272
00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:49.310
<v Speaker 1>has one I particularly like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:54.350
<v Speaker 1>on Blake assimilates God with the sun </v>
<v Speaker 1>when with light,</v>

274
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:59.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite a common mythological </v>

275
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.540
<v Speaker 1>idea that God is associated with light </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the day</v>

276
00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.170
<v Speaker 1>behold I am with thee and will keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all places,</v>

277
00:17:10.171 --> 00:17:15.171
<v Speaker 1>whether thou go list and we'll bring the</v>
<v Speaker 1>again into this land for I will not </v>

278
00:17:15.171 --> 00:17:18.561
<v Speaker 1>leave thee until I have done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I have spoken to the of and Jacob </v>

279
00:17:18.561 --> 00:17:19.140
<v Speaker 1>awaked out of his sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

280
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.870
<v Speaker 1>surely the Lord is in this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I knew what not.</v>

281
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.470
<v Speaker 1>And he was afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the right response.</v>

282
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:27.960
<v Speaker 1>And said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dreadful is this place?</v>

283
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.380
<v Speaker 1>It is none other than the house of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the gate of heaven.</v>

284
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:37.100
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob rose up early in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and took the stone that he had put for </v>

285
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.071
<v Speaker 1>his pillows and set it up for a pillar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And poured oil on the top of it and </v>

286
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:44.170
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a more important thing than you </v>

287
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.011
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what will go into that a little bit </v>

288
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:46.380
<v Speaker 1>more deeply because up to this point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story,</v>

289
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.120
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything really.</v>

290
00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:53.450
<v Speaker 1>There isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really emerged to mark a sacred </v>

291
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:53.450
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

292
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no cathedral,</v>

293
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:55.770
<v Speaker 1>there's no church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like that.</v>

294
00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:01.070
<v Speaker 1>But here's this idea that emerges that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can mark the center of something </v>

295
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:05.850
<v Speaker 1>that and that's important and you mark </v>
<v Speaker 1>it with a stone and a stone is a good </v>

296
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:10.011
<v Speaker 1>way to mark things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are important because the stone is </v>

297
00:18:10.011 --> 00:18:10.011
<v Speaker 1>permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

298
00:18:10.011 --> 00:18:13.820
<v Speaker 1>And we mark things with stones now like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we marked graves with stones for </v>

299
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.061
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we want to make a memory and to </v>

300
00:18:17.061 --> 00:18:17.340
<v Speaker 1>carve something into stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to carve a stone.</v>

301
00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:22.341
<v Speaker 1>And then to carve something into stone </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to make a memory and to use stone is </v>

302
00:18:22.341 --> 00:18:23.490
<v Speaker 1>to make a memory because stone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent.</v>

303
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 1>And to set it upright as to indicate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

304
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens in pours oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the top of it,</v>

305
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:36.021
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of offering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he called the name of that place </v>

306
00:18:36.021 --> 00:18:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Bethel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the name of the city was called </v>

307
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] at the first and Jacob vowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vow saying,</v>

308
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:42.150
<v Speaker 1>if God will be with me and will keep me </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this way,</v>

309
00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Speaker 1>that I go and will give me bread to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Raymond to put on</v>

310
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.800
<v Speaker 1>than a 10th of what I earn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will give him.</v>

311
00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I missed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting too,</v>

312
00:18:58.671 --> 00:19:01.220
<v Speaker 1>because now there's a transformation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice,</v>

313
00:19:01.221 --> 00:19:03.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because until that point,</v>

314
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.380
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices have had been pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>concretized.</v>

315
00:19:06.381 --> 00:19:08.840
<v Speaker 1>It was the burning of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas here,</v>

316
00:19:08.841 --> 00:19:11.480
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden it's the offering of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

317
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.290
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of productive labor per se,</v>

318
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.320
<v Speaker 1>like a tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This tie is a form of sacrifice.</v>

319
00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an abstraction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of sacrifice,</v>

320
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.080
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important that the idea of </v>

321
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.660
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice gets abstracted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

322
00:19:26.661 --> 00:19:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Because it should be abstracted to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where it's,</v>

323
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.720
<v Speaker 1>it's used the way that we use it today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

324
00:19:32.721 --> 00:19:37.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make sacrifices to get ahead and </v>

325
00:19:37.721 --> 00:19:40.121
<v Speaker 1>everyone understands what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the sacrifices are generally some </v>

326
00:19:40.401 --> 00:19:44.360
<v Speaker 1>combination of psychological end and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and practical.</v>

327
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.660
<v Speaker 1>So we're not acting them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're precisely,</v>

328
00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:51.050
<v Speaker 1>we're not dramatizing the Mer </v>
<v Speaker 1>ritualizing and we actually act them out</v>

329
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.080
<v Speaker 1>in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the covenant that we make with the </v>

330
00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.361
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we do that well unless we're </v>

331
00:19:58.361 --> 00:20:01.091
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily impulsive and aimless in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our lives and have really no conception </v>

332
00:20:01.091 --> 00:20:04.820
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever of the future and are likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sacrifice the future for the present,</v>

333
00:20:04.821 --> 00:20:06.950
<v Speaker 1>which is what Esau does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

334
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Then we make sacrifices and you gotta </v>
<v Speaker 1>think like the idea of making sacrifices</v>

335
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:19.270
<v Speaker 1>to make the future better is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily difficult lesson to </v>

336
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.270
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took people,</v>

337
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.490
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how long to learn that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.200
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea.</v>

339
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that animals do </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

340
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees don't store leftover meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.010
<v Speaker 1>they just needed to wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

342
00:20:32.011 --> 00:20:36.860
<v Speaker 1>a wolf can eat about 30 pounds of meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one city and that's where the idea of</v>

343
00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.230
<v Speaker 1>wolfing it down comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not hiding it,</v>

344
00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:40.580
<v Speaker 1>saving it for later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:45.581
<v Speaker 1>they can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can't sacrifice the present for </v>

346
00:20:45.581 --> 00:20:47.120
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a big deal.</v>

347
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:47.730
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

348
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.490
<v Speaker 1>this happens.</v>

349
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Now I want to tell you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the idea of the pillar because </v>

350
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.321
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unbelievably deep idea and it </v>

351
00:20:58.321 --> 00:21:03.151
<v Speaker 2>orients us in ways that we still don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still orienting us in ways that we </v>

352
00:21:03.151 --> 00:21:05.440
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

353
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:09.490
<v Speaker 2>it's actually the mechanism by which </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're oriented or,</v>

354
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>and if it's lacking then we become </v>
<v Speaker 2>disoriented.</v>

355
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.460
<v Speaker 2>And so I'll show you some pictures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe them first.</v>

356
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>

357
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a walled city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let,</v>

358
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:24.691
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you that you could think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that as an archetypal human </v>

359
00:21:24.691 --> 00:21:28.291
<v Speaker 2>habitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a reflection of something </v>

360
00:21:28.291 --> 00:21:30.991
<v Speaker 2>like a fire in the middle of the plane </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the forest or the jungle for that </v>

361
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:33.370
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it's kind of hard to get a fire</v>

362
00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:38.371
<v Speaker 2>going there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine a fire ringed around with logs </v>

363
00:21:38.371 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps ringed around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>dwellings,</v>

364
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:44.911
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fires in the center and the fire </v>

365
00:21:44.911 --> 00:21:45.610
<v Speaker 2>defines the center and then as you move </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the fire,</v>

366
00:21:45.611 --> 00:21:47.260
<v Speaker 2>you move out into the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

367
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 2>So the fire is light and communion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>safety.</v>

368
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.270
<v Speaker 2>And as you move away from the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you move out into the darkness.</v>

369
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:57.580
<v Speaker 2>And what's terrifying out beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perimeter.</v>

370
00:21:57.581 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 2>So what's beyond the perimeter is </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying.</v>

371
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.350
<v Speaker 2>You can feel that if you go camping </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere that's wild,</v>

372
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 2>you know you're pretty damn happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if the wolves are howling,</v>

373
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:10.380
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty damn happy to be sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the fire because you can see there </v>

374
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.120
<v Speaker 2>the fire keeps the animals away and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know if you do wander into the bush,</v>

375
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:20.370
<v Speaker 2>into the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're on alert and you know your </v>

376
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.341
<v Speaker 2>Predator detection systems are on alert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you could think about the </v>

377
00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:26.680
<v Speaker 2>classical human habitation as two </v>
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>

378
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.860
<v Speaker 2>One where your Predator detection system</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't on alert and another where your </v>

379
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Predator tech detection system is alert </v>
<v Speaker 2>on alert.</v>

380
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And you can think about that roughly as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the distinction between unexplored </v>

381
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.080
<v Speaker 2>territory and unexplored territory.</v>

382
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.490
<v Speaker 2>And really the founding of a place is </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely.</v>

383
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot of this I got from reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually Eliana.</v>

384
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.700
<v Speaker 2>The founding of a place is precisely the</v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of a explored center set </v>

385
00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:59.971
<v Speaker 2>against the unexplored periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what's interesting about </v>

386
00:22:59.971 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can kind of think about that with</v>

387
00:23:01.061 --> 00:23:02.500
<v Speaker 2>regards to the walled city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

388
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Everything in the wall is cosmos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything outside the wall is chaos and</v>

389
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also extends to the conceptual </v>

390
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 2>realm because imagine that you're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>master of a field of study,</v>

391
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.820
<v Speaker 2>and so that's an interesting metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the field is that a geographical</v>

392
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:22.690
<v Speaker 2>metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

393
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:28.050
<v Speaker 2>And if in the center of the field are </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things that everyone knows really </v>

394
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.701
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the axioms that everyone abides by in </v>

395
00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:36.841
<v Speaker 2>the field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then as you move towards the </v>

396
00:23:36.841 --> 00:23:36.841
<v Speaker 2>fringes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to work towards the unknown,</v>

397
00:23:36.841 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 2>towards the frontier of the discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you become expert,</v>

398
00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 2>you move from the center to the frontier</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then you're on the border.</v>

399
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.880
<v Speaker 2>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>

400
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.140
<v Speaker 2>when you're a scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a competence call,</v>

401
00:23:49.141 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 2>you're on the border between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexplored or the explored an unexplored</v>

402
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 2>and you're trying to further that </v>
<v Speaker 2>border.</v>

403
00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 2>So even if you're just doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractly,</v>

404
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:03.490
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflection of the fact that every human </v>

405
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.650
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concrete or abstract,</v>

406
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:11.651
<v Speaker 2>it makes no difference recapitulates the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmos chaos dichotomy or the order </v>

407
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:16.870
<v Speaker 2>chaos dichotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why endow isn't.</v>

408
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.890
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the union of chaos.</v>

409
00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:23.810
<v Speaker 2>And order that constitutes being itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that you stand on the border between</v>

410
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.750
<v Speaker 2>chaos and order because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper place to be,</v>

411
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.900
<v Speaker 2>to orderly too much in the explored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not learning anything too much </v>

412
00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:37.361
<v Speaker 2>out there where the predators lurk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're frozen with terror and </v>

413
00:24:37.361 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 2>neither of those positions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>desirable.</v>

414
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.200
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you know.</v>

415
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:45.860
<v Speaker 2>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a concrete reality obviously</v>

416
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:49.610
<v Speaker 2>as well as a psychological reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were reasons for those walls,</v>

417
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

418
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.380
<v Speaker 2>Because inside the walls were all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like us.</v>

419
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.830
<v Speaker 2>And so that begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean for people to be like </v>

420
00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:00.700
<v Speaker 2>us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then outside the wall of the rows,</v>

421
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:05.710
<v Speaker 2>all of those people because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst forms of predators because </v>

422
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.920
<v Speaker 2>people are actually the worst forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators who aren't like us.</v>

423
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.930
<v Speaker 2>And the wall is there to draw a </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction between like us and not like</v>

424
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

425
00:25:16.461 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 2>and that was a matter of life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell that because I mean look at</v>

426
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:23.210
<v Speaker 2>those walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to build those by hand.</v>

427
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.390
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do see walled cities that have three</v>

428
00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:31.391
<v Speaker 2>rings of walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these people were terrified but not </v>

429
00:25:31.391 --> 00:25:33.680
<v Speaker 2>so terrified as the people who built </v>
<v Speaker 2>three walls,</v>

430
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.860
<v Speaker 2>they were really terrified and they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>their reasons.</v>

431
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.460
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now there's an idea that's,</v>

432
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 2>that's reflected in the Jacob's ladder </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

433
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:55.300
<v Speaker 2>that the center where you put the pillar</v>
<v Speaker 2>is also the place where heaven and earth</v>

434
00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 2>touch.</v>

435
00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.560
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a complicated idea I think that </v>

436
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to look at these stories from</v>

437
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:09.461
<v Speaker 2>a psychological perspective and so then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that that's a symbolic </v>

438
00:26:09.461 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 2>place where the lowest and the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>come together.</v>

439
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.320
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a place where earthly being </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretches up to the highest possible </v>

440
00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 2>ethical abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the center because one of the</v>

441
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:27.080
<v Speaker 2>things that defines us say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to them,</v>

442
00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.160
<v Speaker 2>is that we're all united within a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain ethic.</v>

443
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:37.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes us the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a complicated line of reasoning </v>

444
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.580
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll go back to it after I show you </v>

445
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:42.950
<v Speaker 2>some more pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

446
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the first idea is that the center</v>

447
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.010
<v Speaker 2>is the place where the lowest and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest touch simultaneously.</v>

448
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:55.250
<v Speaker 2>And so you could say that in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>it specifies the aim of a group of </v>

449
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.250
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

450
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.050
<v Speaker 2>That's another way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know if you get together with people</v>

451
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:03.051
<v Speaker 2>to make a group even at work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you group yourself around a project and </v>

452
00:27:03.051 --> 00:27:05.850
<v Speaker 2>that unites you and the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we all have the same name.</v>

453
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:09.960
<v Speaker 2>You're all pointing to the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that makes you the same in some ways</v>

454
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 2>because if you're after the same thing I</v>
<v Speaker 2>am,</v>

455
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.780
<v Speaker 2>then the same things are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>important to you that are important to </v>

456
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.361
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same things are going to be </v>

457
00:27:20.361 --> 00:27:20.361
<v Speaker 2>negative to you that are negative to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because our emotions work out that way.</v>

458
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.390
<v Speaker 2>And that means I can instantly predict </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how you're going to behave.</v>

459
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.410
<v Speaker 2>And so our aim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically our ethical amy,</v>

460
00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:29.220
<v Speaker 2>it's because we're aiming at something </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

461
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 2>At least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're aiming at something better.</v>

462
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.910
<v Speaker 2>So our ethical aim that unites our </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptions and that's what aligns our </v>

463
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:37.910
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>

464
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:42.470
<v Speaker 2>And so that sort of begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to build a community </v>

465
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.370
<v Speaker 2>around what aim should the community </v>
<v Speaker 2>congregate?</v>

466
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea here is that the center of </v>

467
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 2>the community is the pillar that Unites </v>
<v Speaker 2>Heaven and earth.</v>

468
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:51.810
<v Speaker 2>So it unites the lowest with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest.</v>

469
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:57.050
<v Speaker 2>So there was some intimation of the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's the highest that unites the </v>

470
00:27:57.091 --> 00:27:58.800
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

471
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.360
<v Speaker 2>And so keep that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very old idea as well.</v>

472
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea of the Axis Mundi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the center pole that Unites </v>

473
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Heaven and earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an unbelievably old idea.</v>

474
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Tens of thousands of years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might even stretch back to whatever </v>

475
00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.880
<v Speaker 2>our archaic memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>memories,</v>

476
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you would describe them,</v>

477
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:24.981
<v Speaker 2>archetipal memories of are excessively </v>
<v Speaker 2>old ancestry and trees when the tree </v>

478
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:30.951
<v Speaker 2>itself was in fact the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and that it was ringed by snakes </v>

479
00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:31.920
<v Speaker 2>and chaos.</v>

480
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.790
<v Speaker 2>And so while we have no idea how old </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas are,</v>

481
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:39.540
<v Speaker 2>but they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very old and evolution is a conservative</v>

482
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:42.060
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once it builds a gadget,</v>

483
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 2>then it builds new things on top of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gadgets,</v>

484
00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:47.090
<v Speaker 2>like a medieval town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

485
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 2>The center of the town is really old and</v>
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>

486
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.220
<v Speaker 2>newer areas of the town get built around</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

487
00:28:53.221 --> 00:28:56.400
<v Speaker 2>but the center is still really old and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're like.</v>

488
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

489
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.010
<v Speaker 2>our platforms like our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our basic physiological structure.</v>

490
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:07.030
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this skeletal body is some tens of </v>

491
00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.610
<v Speaker 2>millions of years old or older than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

492
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.940
<v Speaker 2>If you think about vertebrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much older than that and that's all</v>

493
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:16.941
<v Speaker 2>conserved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything's built on top of </v>

494
00:29:16.941 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

495
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:22.881
<v Speaker 2>so there's a kind of a classic town and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the idea I showed you this,</v>

496
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:28.521
<v Speaker 2>this Scandinavian world tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same idea unites heaven and earth and </v>

497
00:29:28.521 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 2>around the roots of that tree are snakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that eat this tree constantly.</v>

498
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.320
<v Speaker 2>So that's the idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stability,</v>

499
00:29:34.321 --> 00:29:37.710
<v Speaker 2>but there's constant transformation </v>
<v Speaker 2>around that stability.</v>

500
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time the snakes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing and the roots,</v>

501
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.470
<v Speaker 2>there's streams that are nourishing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of,</v>

502
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:49.590
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of an echo of the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>life depends on death and renewal </v>

503
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.230
<v Speaker 2>constantly because your cells are dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And being renewed constantly,</v>

504
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:55.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they are just proliferating,</v>

505
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:58.910
<v Speaker 2>then you have cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're just dying then you dye it.</v>

506
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to get the balance between </v>
<v Speaker 2>death and life.</v>

507
00:30:01.301 --> 00:30:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that you can actually live,</v>

508
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.580
<v Speaker 2>which is also a very strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

509
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And that tree is something that reaches </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the bottom layers of being maybe </v>

510
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 2>the microcosm all the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>macrocosm.</v>

511
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.100
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

512
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 2>So then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

513
00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:22.711
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a Jacob and his is pillar.</v>

514
00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:25.840
<v Speaker 2>He's got this idea that you can mark the</v>
<v Speaker 2>center with this stone.</v>

515
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Like it sort of symbolizes what he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>laying on when he dreamt,</v>

516
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:32.200
<v Speaker 2>but now he's got this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put something erect and it marks the</v>

517
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:36.430
<v Speaker 2>center and it symbolizes his vision of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest good.</v>

518
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the promise that's been made to him.</v>

519
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.120
<v Speaker 2>And then this is an Egyptian obelisk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pyramid on top of it that's in </v>

520
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:51.211
<v Speaker 2>Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was taken from Luxor and put in </v>

521
00:30:51.211 --> 00:30:53.461
<v Speaker 2>Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a much more sophisticated </v>

522
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.920
<v Speaker 2>instance of the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

523
00:30:57.921 --> 00:31:02.921
<v Speaker 2>And there was a stone age culture is </v>
<v Speaker 2>across Eurasia that put up these huge </v>

524
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:04.270
<v Speaker 2>obelisks everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These huge,</v>

525
00:31:04.271 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 2>like the stonehenge is a good example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

526
00:31:06.251 --> 00:31:11.251
<v Speaker 2>although it's very sophisticated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are also markers of places we </v>

527
00:31:11.251 --> 00:31:12.460
<v Speaker 2>don't know exactly what their function </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

528
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:17.290
<v Speaker 2>but they're very much akin to this some </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent marker of place.</v>

529
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.060
<v Speaker 2>There's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's in St Peter's and I really </v>

530
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.391
<v Speaker 2>liked this one because you can see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>echoes of Jacob's vision for the </v>

531
00:31:29.561 --> 00:31:31.330
<v Speaker 2>establishment of a territory there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

532
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.620
<v Speaker 2>You've got the obelisk in the middle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you've got the directions radiating</v>

533
00:31:35.621 --> 00:31:38.780
<v Speaker 2>from the center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course St Peters.</v>

534
00:31:38.781 --> 00:31:43.781
<v Speaker 2>This is the St Peter's Basilica in Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an absolutely unbelievable </v>

535
00:31:43.781 --> 00:31:45.670
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just jaw dropping.</v>

536
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.390
<v Speaker 2>And so there's the cathedral at the back</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

537
00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:52.540
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this circle of pillars </v>
<v Speaker 2>that surrounds it.</v>

538
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.340
<v Speaker 2>You can just see them a little bit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

539
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.930
<v Speaker 2>on the middle left there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That goes all the way around that entire</v>

540
00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Speaker 2>enclosure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

541
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very large number of people can gather </v>

542
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:05.940
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

543
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.980
<v Speaker 2>So that pillar marks the center and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the center of Catholicism,</v>

544
00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:10.810
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that represents,</v>

545
00:32:10.811 --> 00:32:13.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The symbolic center of Catholicism.</v>

546
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Although you could make the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cathedral is the center,</v>

547
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:19.300
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very close together and it's.</v>

548
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.880
<v Speaker 2>It's half a dozen of one in six of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

549
00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:26.140
<v Speaker 2>And then here's another representation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the same idea,</v>

550
00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:31.141
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that this is why people don't like </v>

551
00:32:31.141 --> 00:32:33.301
<v Speaker 2>the flag to be burned because </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative people see the flag as the </v>

552
00:32:33.301 --> 00:32:38.281
<v Speaker 2>sacred thing that binds people together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they're not happy when that </v>

553
00:32:38.281 --> 00:32:43.141
<v Speaker 2>sacred thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's destroyed in the name of </v>

554
00:32:43.141 --> 00:32:46.691
<v Speaker 2>protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the people who burned flags </v>

555
00:32:46.691 --> 00:32:48.641
<v Speaker 2>thank well there are times to dramatize </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the center has been </v>

556
00:32:48.641 --> 00:32:52.640
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and you can demonstrate that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it to the torch,</v>

557
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.850
<v Speaker 2>you know as a representation that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this,</v>

558
00:32:56.050 --> 00:33:01.050
<v Speaker 2>that the corrupt center now has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>burned and transformed.</v>

559
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.640
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is they're both right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both right all the time because </v>

560
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.480
<v Speaker 2>the center is absolutely necessary and </v>
<v Speaker 2>is sacred and is almost always also </v>

561
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.341
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and in need of reparation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also an archetypal idea and,</v>

562
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's a useful thing to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

563
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.370
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for young people in particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think that while the world's going to</v>

564
00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:26.300
<v Speaker 2>hell in a hand basket and it's the fault</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the last generation,</v>

565
00:33:26.301 --> 00:33:31.301
<v Speaker 2>they've left us this terrible mess and </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave feeling pretty betrayed about </v>

566
00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:31.301
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

567
00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Now we have to clean it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

568
00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

569
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:35.210
<v Speaker 2>people have been thinking that for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>35,000</v>

570
00:33:35.211 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not new.</v>

571
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.500
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason it's not new,</v>

572
00:33:38.501 --> 00:33:40.220
<v Speaker 2>it's because it's always true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

573
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:44.960
<v Speaker 2>what you're handed is a sacred center </v>
<v Speaker 2>with flaws always,</v>

574
00:33:44.961 --> 00:33:49.700
<v Speaker 2>always as partly because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation of the dead right in the dead.</v>

575
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Can't see and they can't communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're not in touch with the </v>

576
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.580
<v Speaker 2>present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what they've bequeath to you,</v>

577
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.460
<v Speaker 2>apart from the fact that it might </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually be corrupt,</v>

578
00:33:58.461 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 2>which is a slightly different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is at least blind in dead.</v>

579
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.450
<v Speaker 2>And so what the hell can you expect from</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's blind in dead?</v>

580
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:10.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're lucky if it just doesn't stomp </v>

581
00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:10.870
<v Speaker 2>you out of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

582
00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:10.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

583
00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:15.311
<v Speaker 2>a lovely photograph obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the establishment of a new </v>

584
00:34:15.311 --> 00:34:19.061
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the center can be a cathedral to </v>

585
00:34:19.061 --> 00:34:23.210
<v Speaker 2>and often is of course in classic </v>
<v Speaker 2>counts,</v>

586
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:28.390
<v Speaker 2>European towns in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's not only European towns </v>

587
00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:32.711
<v Speaker 2>that are like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a center that's made out of </v>

588
00:34:32.711 --> 00:34:32.711
<v Speaker 2>stone.</v>

589
00:34:32.711 --> 00:34:36.070
<v Speaker 2>So that would be the cathedral and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got the highest tower on top of the </v>

590
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:39.821
<v Speaker 2>tower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's often across and that's the </v>

591
00:34:39.821 --> 00:34:42.221
<v Speaker 2>symbolic center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people are are drawn together around </v>

592
00:34:42.221 --> 00:34:46.331
<v Speaker 2>whatever the cross represents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that the cross obviously represents </v>

593
00:34:46.331 --> 00:34:47.690
<v Speaker 2>a center because it's an x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

594
00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:52.691
<v Speaker 2>X marks the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the center of the Cross is the </v>

595
00:34:52.691 --> 00:34:55.691
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the cathedral is often in a </v>

596
00:34:55.691 --> 00:34:58.330
<v Speaker 2>cross shape which also marks the center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the cathedral there's a dome</v>

597
00:34:58.521 --> 00:35:03.521
<v Speaker 2>often in that's the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's that ladder that reaches from</v>

598
00:35:03.591 --> 00:35:08.591
<v Speaker 2>Earth to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a recapitulation of the same </v>

599
00:35:08.591 --> 00:35:08.591
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

600
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:14.020
<v Speaker 2>and people are drawn to that center and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the center is the symbol of what unites </v>

601
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:19.481
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what unites them is the faith that </v>

602
00:35:19.481 --> 00:35:21.920
<v Speaker 2>the cathedral is the embodiment of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

603
00:35:21.921 --> 00:35:23.780
<v Speaker 2>well what does the faith mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

604
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:27.350
<v Speaker 2>we're approaching this psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it means is that we,</v>

605
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:32.770
<v Speaker 2>everyone who's a member of that group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepts the transcendent ideal of the </v>

606
00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:32.770
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

607
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're the member of a group,</v>

608
00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:37.560
<v Speaker 2>you accept the transcendent ideal of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

609
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means to be a member of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

610
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.960
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in a work team and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all working on a project,</v>

611
00:35:42.961 --> 00:35:47.961
<v Speaker 2>what you've essentially done is decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to make the goal </v>

612
00:35:47.961 --> 00:35:49.350
<v Speaker 2>unquestionable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

613
00:35:49.351 --> 00:35:51.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean you might argue about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>details,</v>

614
00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:52.910
<v Speaker 2>but if you're tasked with something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

615
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:58.010
<v Speaker 2>here's a job for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 people organize yourself around the </v>

616
00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.951
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can argue about how you're going to </v>

617
00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:01.200
<v Speaker 2>do the job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't argue about the job.</v>

618
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Then the group falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's an act of faith in some </v>

619
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.791
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason that the act of faith is </v>

620
00:36:10.791 --> 00:36:14.181
<v Speaker 2>necessary is because it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to specify without error </v>

621
00:36:14.181 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 2>what that central aim should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Given that there's any number of aims,</v>

622
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:17.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

623
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult thing to figure out.</v>

624
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:23.640
<v Speaker 2>And this is something we're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit tonight is like what should</v>

625
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:27.120
<v Speaker 2>the aim be around which a group would </v>
<v Speaker 2>congregate?</v>

626
00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:33.420
<v Speaker 2>So especially if it's a large group and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a large group that has to stay </v>

627
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.701
<v Speaker 2>together across very large swaths of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and the group is an incredibly </v>

628
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 2>diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

629
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:43.851
<v Speaker 2>what possible kind of ideal could unite </v>
<v Speaker 2>a large group of diverse people across a</v>

630
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:46.830
<v Speaker 2>very large stretch of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really,</v>

631
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:51.831
<v Speaker 2>really hard question and I think part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that question has been answered </v>

632
00:36:51.831 --> 00:36:55.851
<v Speaker 2>is it's been answered symbolically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the images because it's so damn </v>

633
00:36:55.851 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 2>complicated that it's almost impossible </v>
<v Speaker 2>to articulate so.</v>

634
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.520
<v Speaker 2>But obviously you need to have a center </v>
<v Speaker 2>around which everyone can unite because </v>

635
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 2>if you don't then everyone is at odds </v>
<v Speaker 2>with one another.</v>

636
00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Like if I don't know what you're up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't know what he's up to.</v>

637
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 2>We have no were just strangers and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know that our ethics match at all.</v>

638
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Then the probability that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to exist harmoniously decreases </v>

639
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.530
<v Speaker 2>rapidly to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's obviously just no good.</v>

640
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.830
<v Speaker 2>That's a state of total chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can't have that.</v>

641
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:30.831
<v Speaker 2>It's not possible to exist without a </v>
<v Speaker 2>central ideal.</v>

642
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not possible and it's deeper than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

643
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:37.140
<v Speaker 2>It's deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly because it's.</v>

644
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to get this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the sort of thing that I was </v>

645
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:46.020
<v Speaker 2>arguing with Sam Harris about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

646
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 2>your category system is a product of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your aims.</v>

647
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:54.300
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you have a set of facts at hand,</v>

648
00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:57.930
<v Speaker 2>the facts don't tell you how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>categorize the facts because there's too</v>

649
00:37:57.931 --> 00:38:02.931
<v Speaker 2>damn many facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a trillion fact and there's no </v>

650
00:38:02.931 --> 00:38:07.521
<v Speaker 2>way without imposing some a priority </v>
<v Speaker 2>order on them of determining how it is </v>

651
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:09.600
<v Speaker 2>that you should order them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how do you order them?</v>

652
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's easy.</v>

653
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.340
<v Speaker 2>You decide what you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

654
00:38:14.341 --> 00:38:15.600
<v Speaker 2>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

655
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not answering that question at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

656
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize those facts,</v>

657
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:25.380
<v Speaker 2>you need it aim and then the aim </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly organizes the facts into those</v>

658
00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:30.381
<v Speaker 2>things relevant to the ame tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say those things that get in the </v>

659
00:38:30.381 --> 00:38:34.461
<v Speaker 2>way and a very large number of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't have to pay attention to </v>

660
00:38:34.461 --> 00:38:34.860
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

661
00:38:34.861 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 2>It excludes vert like if you're working </v>
<v Speaker 2>on an engineering problem,</v>

662
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:43.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to worry about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing medicine in your </v>

663
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

664
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:49.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of like if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on a particular,</v>

665
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.620
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>

666
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any job,</v>

667
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:03.511
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any set of skills implies that you're </v>

668
00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:06.541
<v Speaker 2>good at a small set of things and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>not good at an incredibly large number </v>

669
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:10.681
<v Speaker 2>of other skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It simplifies things and so you can use </v>

670
00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:14.671
<v Speaker 2>your aim as the basis of a category </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure and so you also have to keep </v>

671
00:39:15.011 --> 00:39:20.011
<v Speaker 2>that in mind because what it means is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell that what it means </v>

672
00:39:20.011 --> 00:39:23.791
<v Speaker 2>is that your category system itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what structures your </v>

673
00:39:23.791 --> 00:39:26.680
<v Speaker 2>perceptions is actually dependent on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethics of your aim.</v>

674
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.440
<v Speaker 2>It's directly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a moral thing.</v>

675
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:34.590
<v Speaker 2>It's directly dependent on your aim and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a stunning idea if it happens to </v>

676
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:39.991
<v Speaker 2>be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not how people think about </v>

677
00:39:39.991 --> 00:39:39.991
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't think that way.</v>

678
00:39:39.991 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 2>We think that we think deterministically</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

679
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:47.910
<v Speaker 2>or that we think empirically or that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think rationally and none of that </v>

680
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.910
<v Speaker 2>appears to be the case.</v>

681
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:52.890
<v Speaker 2>What we do is we pause it a valid aim </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we organize the world around </v>

682
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:56.710
<v Speaker 2>the aim and there's plenty of evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that in in psychological studies of</v>

683
00:39:56.711 --> 00:39:57.610
<v Speaker 2>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

684
00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.900
<v Speaker 2>That that does look like how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual systems work.</v>

685
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Mostly they ignore because the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>too complicated.</v>

686
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:10.410
<v Speaker 2>They focus on a small set of phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 2>deemed relevant to whatever the aim is,</v>

687
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.120
<v Speaker 2>and then of course the aim is </v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic.</v>

688
00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's complex because the aim I have has </v>

689
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:21.271
<v Speaker 2>to be an aim that some of you at share </v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least don't object to because </v>

690
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:23.650
<v Speaker 2>otherwise I'm not going to get anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my damn aim.</v>

691
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.410
<v Speaker 2>It has to actually be implementable in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

692
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.280
<v Speaker 2>It has to be sustainable across at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>some amount of time.</v>

693
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.390
<v Speaker 2>It can't kill me like it's really hedged</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this aim.</v>

694
00:40:34.391 --> 00:40:36.430
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't any old thing.</v>

695
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.890
<v Speaker 2>There's hardly any things that it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

696
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.260
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jacob's aim,</v>

697
00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:46.261
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in undermining Esau almost gets him </v>

698
00:40:46.261 --> 00:40:49.390
<v Speaker 2>killed and you can understand why that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing you think,</v>

699
00:40:49.391 --> 00:40:49.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

700
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 2>that was a nasty bit of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can understand [inaudible] rage.</v>

701
00:40:53.471 --> 00:40:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It's even though we're separated from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people in these stories by what,</v>

702
00:40:57.821 --> 00:40:58.870
<v Speaker 2>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

703
00:40:58.871 --> 00:41:00.610
<v Speaker 2>3000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

704
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:05.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in immediately why everyone feels the </v>

705
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:07.180
<v Speaker 2>way they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least once you understand the context</v>

706
00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:10.270
<v Speaker 2>of the story that none of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mysterious in the least.</v>

707
00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:16.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's the church and the church is </v>

708
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.660
<v Speaker 2>underneath the cross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

709
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:22.480
<v Speaker 2>So that St Peter's Basilica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's the cross on the globe,</v>

710
00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:26.830
<v Speaker 2>on top of the basilica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the cross on the,</v>

711
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obelisk as well.</v>

712
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:34.620
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where things get insanely </v>

713
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:39.161
<v Speaker 2>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the center is defined by </v>

714
00:41:39.161 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 2>whatever the cross represents.</v>

715
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Now the cross represents a crossing </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

716
00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:48.671
<v Speaker 2>Geographically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly that the cross probably </v>

717
00:41:48.671 --> 00:41:51.911
<v Speaker 2>represents the body to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the cross also represents the </v>

718
00:41:51.911 --> 00:41:55.010
<v Speaker 2>place of suffering obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And more importantly,</v>

719
00:41:55.011 --> 00:42:00.011
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it represents the place of voluntary </v>

720
00:42:00.011 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 2>suffering transcended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking psychologically,</v>

721
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:02.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Theologically.</v>

722
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what it represents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>

723
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:10.871
<v Speaker 2>so here's the idea behind putting down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the obelisk with the cross and saying </v>

724
00:42:10.871 --> 00:42:15.821
<v Speaker 2>that that's the center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing that everyone's </v>

725
00:42:15.821 --> 00:42:15.821
<v Speaker 2>aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the I,</v>

726
00:42:15.821 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 2>the idea would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

727
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:19.820
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to be a member of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group defined by this obelisk,</v>

728
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:24.821
<v Speaker 2>then what you do is accept your position</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the center of suffering voluntarily </v>

729
00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:28.760
<v Speaker 2>and therefore transcended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea.</v>

730
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.180
<v Speaker 2>And that is one hell of an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is,</v>

731
00:42:32.181 --> 00:42:37.181
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a killer idea because it's </v>

732
00:42:37.181 --> 00:42:39.971
<v Speaker 2>actually a signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really clear signal of </v>

733
00:42:39.971 --> 00:42:39.971
<v Speaker 2>psychological health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

734
00:42:39.971 --> 00:42:44.711
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things you do if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a clinical psychologist and </v>

735
00:42:44.711 --> 00:42:47.500
<v Speaker 2>someone is paralyzed by fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what you do is you break their fears </v>

736
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.851
<v Speaker 2>down into relatively manageable bits and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have them voluntarily confront </v>

737
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.540
<v Speaker 2>their fears.</v>

738
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.150
<v Speaker 2>And it might also be things that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusted by,</v>

739
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.250
<v Speaker 2>say if they have obsessive compulsive </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

740
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.740
<v Speaker 2>but it produces very strong negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>

741
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:05.741
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have them voluntarily </v>

742
00:43:05.741 --> 00:43:08.381
<v Speaker 2>confront whatever it is that produces </v>
<v Speaker 2>that overwhelming negative emotion and </v>

743
00:43:08.381 --> 00:43:10.700
<v Speaker 2>that makes them stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens.</v>

744
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:15.910
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make them less afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes them more courageous and </v>

745
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 2>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is not the same thing.</v>

746
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 2>It's seriously not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't decrease the fear.</v>

747
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:25.510
<v Speaker 2>It increases the courage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a mind boggling idea and </v>

748
00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 2>it's deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

749
00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:30.440
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about these archetipal ideas</v>

750
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:34.040
<v Speaker 2>is that maybe it's partly because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperlink nature of the Bible.</v>

751
00:43:34.041 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

752
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:38.360
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is that no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep you dig into them,</v>

753
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.530
<v Speaker 2>you'll never get to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

754
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.780
<v Speaker 2>you hit a bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

755
00:43:41.781 --> 00:43:43.970
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so unbelievably profound.</v>

756
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.220
<v Speaker 2>And then if you excavate a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath that,</v>

757
00:43:46.221 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 2>you find something else that's even more</v>
<v Speaker 2>profound and you think,</v>

758
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:50.360
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's got to be the bottom.</v>

759
00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:53.180
<v Speaker 2>And then you dig under that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's no bottom.</v>

760
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:55.940
<v Speaker 2>You can just keep digging down while as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I can tell,</v>

761
00:43:55.941 --> 00:44:00.941
<v Speaker 2>you can keep digging down layer after </v>
<v Speaker 2>layer and we'll talk a little bit about </v>

762
00:44:00.941 --> 00:44:04.871
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little more about what the cross </v>

763
00:44:04.871 --> 00:44:07.210
<v Speaker 2>signifies as the center because you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people were trying to figure out is</v>

764
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.060
<v Speaker 2>what is it that we need to unite under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

765
00:44:11.061 --> 00:44:14.510
<v Speaker 2>What's the proper thing to unite under?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give you another example,</v>

766
00:44:14.511 --> 00:44:18.530
<v Speaker 2>so in the Mesopotamian societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emperor,</v>

767
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:23.240
<v Speaker 2>you know who was more or less than an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute monarch,</v>

768
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:28.330
<v Speaker 2>he lived inside what was essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 2>walled city and the god of the </v>

769
00:44:28.911 --> 00:44:33.911
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamians was Martin and Martin was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the figure who had eyes all the way </v>

770
00:44:34.261 --> 00:44:35.990
<v Speaker 2>around his head and he spoke magic </v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

771
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.040
<v Speaker 2>So he's very attentive and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate,</v>

772
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 2>and it was Martin who went out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronted the goddess of chaos,</v>

773
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:47.541
<v Speaker 2>the dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cut her into pieces and made up the </v>

774
00:44:47.541 --> 00:44:47.541
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

775
00:44:47.541 --> 00:44:48.450
<v Speaker 2>so you can kind of understand what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

776
00:44:48.451 --> 00:44:53.451
<v Speaker 2>So Marta goes beyond the frontier into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the place of predatory chaos and </v>

777
00:44:55.501 --> 00:45:00.501
<v Speaker 2>encounters the thing that's terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then make something productive out </v>

778
00:45:00.501 --> 00:45:04.911
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a hero myth and Martech is </v>

779
00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:08.151
<v Speaker 2>elected to the position of preeminent </v>
<v Speaker 2>God by all the other Mesopotamian gods </v>

780
00:45:08.151 --> 00:45:12.381
<v Speaker 2>because he manages that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Martech idea emerges up the holy </v>

781
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:18.830
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy and hits the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pinnacle so that and God only knows how </v>

782
00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:22.641
<v Speaker 2>long that took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be the amalgamation of many </v>

783
00:45:22.641 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Speaker 2>tribes and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the what,</v>

784
00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:29.980
<v Speaker 2>the distillation of all the tribal myths</v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce this emergent story of what </v>

785
00:45:30.721 --> 00:45:35.721
<v Speaker 2>constitutes top God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the job of the emperor was to </v>

786
00:45:35.721 --> 00:45:35.721
<v Speaker 2>act out Martik.</v>

787
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:40.910
<v Speaker 2>That's what gave him sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the reason that he was the center </v>

788
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:44.631
<v Speaker 2>around which people organize themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't because he was when he was being </v>

789
00:45:44.631 --> 00:45:46.110
<v Speaker 2>a proper emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't because there was something super</v>

790
00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:51.111
<v Speaker 2>special about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the power didn't exactly reside in </v>

791
00:45:51.111 --> 00:45:54.561
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a really useful thing to </v>

792
00:45:54.561 --> 00:45:54.561
<v Speaker 2>separate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

793
00:45:54.561 --> 00:45:55.260
<v Speaker 2>You want the power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's kind of Nice to have a</v>

794
00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:00.890
<v Speaker 2>symbolic monarch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the symbolic power separated </v>

795
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:01.470
<v Speaker 2>from the personality power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

796
00:46:01.471 --> 00:46:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Because otherwise they get conflated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened in Rome.</v>

797
00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:09.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can see attending to happen now </v>

798
00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.561
<v Speaker 2>and then in theu ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s like with the Kennedy dynasties and </v>

799
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:15.051
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea was the emperor had </v>

800
00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:18.921
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty as long as he was acting out</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marta properly and going out into the </v>

801
00:46:18.921 --> 00:46:21.690
<v Speaker 2>chaos and cutting it into pieces and </v>
<v Speaker 2>making order.</v>

802
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:26.750
<v Speaker 2>That was his jobs they used to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>about side the city on the New Year's </v>

803
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:30.621
<v Speaker 2>festival and strip him of all his </v>
<v Speaker 2>emperor garments and humiliate them and </v>

804
00:46:30.961 --> 00:46:35.961
<v Speaker 2>then force him to to confess all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that year he hadn't been a good </v>

805
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:42.951
<v Speaker 2>martik so he wasn't a good ruler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was supposed to clue him in </v>

806
00:46:42.951 --> 00:46:43.650
<v Speaker 2>and way come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

807
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:49.040
<v Speaker 2>And then they would ritually reenact the</v>
<v Speaker 2>battle of Marduk against Pi about the </v>

808
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:54.570
<v Speaker 2>chaos monster using statues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if that all went well,</v>

809
00:46:54.571 --> 00:46:59.571
<v Speaker 2>then the emperor would go back in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city would be renewed for another </v>

810
00:46:59.571 --> 00:47:03.800
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we still have echoes of that in our </v>

811
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:03.800
<v Speaker 2>New Year's celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

812
00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.460
<v Speaker 2>It's the same idea that's echoed down </v>
<v Speaker 2>all those all those centuries,</v>

813
00:47:05.461 --> 00:47:09.330
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it says such a staggeringly brilliant</v>

814
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:09.990
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

815
00:47:09.991 --> 00:47:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Because so part of the idea is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that sovereign,</v>

816
00:47:13.771 --> 00:47:15.630
<v Speaker 2>so that's the pillar at the center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

817
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:19.380
<v Speaker 2>that everyone gathers around his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

818
00:47:19.381 --> 00:47:24.381
<v Speaker 2>the thing that courageously goes out </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the unknown and make something </v>

819
00:47:24.381 --> 00:47:25.440
<v Speaker 2>useful out of it for the community.</v>

820
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart.</v>

821
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 2>It's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is another example of a center.</v>

822
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the flag,</v>

823
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:41.791
<v Speaker 2>this is the Union Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's made up of a bunch of </v>

824
00:47:41.791 --> 00:47:41.791
<v Speaker 2>crosses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

825
00:47:41.791 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 2>And so the first cross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the English cross,</v>

826
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 2>that's the flag of St George.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the flag of England.</v>

827
00:47:46.541 --> 00:47:48.130
<v Speaker 2>And say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does St George Do?</v>

828
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Slays the Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

829
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

830
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:57.421
<v Speaker 2>So St George,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patron saint of England goes out and </v>

831
00:47:57.421 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 2>slays the dragon and freeze the virgin </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the grip of the Dragon.</v>

832
00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

833
00:47:59.591 --> 00:48:04.591
<v Speaker 2>So that's the center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second cross is called a,</v>

834
00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.720
<v Speaker 2>a Saltier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's another crucifix.</v>

835
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's the cross on which St Andrew was</v>
<v Speaker 2>crucified.</v>

836
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same idea.</v>

837
00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:17.821
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the center is the center of suffering </v>

838
00:48:17.821 --> 00:48:19.210
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily undertaken because St Andrew</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a martyr.</v>

839
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 2>And then St Patrick is the third cross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did St Patrick do in Ireland?</v>

840
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Chased out all the snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

841
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:29.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

842
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:34.920
<v Speaker 2>And so the flag of Great Britain is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of all of these three </v>

843
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 2>crosses that defines the center and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the flag is.</v>

844
00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:42.250
<v Speaker 2>So that symbolizes all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

845
00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:44.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely mind boggling.</v>

846
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:47.980
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's more about St Patrick too,</v>

847
00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:50.980
<v Speaker 2>so he banishes this snakes after a 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>day fast.</v>

848
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:55.981
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an illusion to the 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years that Moses spends in the desert </v>

849
00:48:55.981 --> 00:49:00.481
<v Speaker 2>and also the 40 days that Christ fasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the New Testament and his walking </v>

850
00:49:00.481 --> 00:49:02.800
<v Speaker 2>stick when he plants it grows into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>

851
00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:07.060
<v Speaker 2>So that echos all of the ideas about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>center that we just described.</v>

852
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:10.810
<v Speaker 2>And he also speaks with the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>Irish ancestors,</v>

853
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:15.811
<v Speaker 2>which if you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a characteristic of the shamanic </v>

854
00:49:15.811 --> 00:49:18.850
<v Speaker 2>rituals where we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the typical shamonic ritual,</v>

855
00:49:18.851 --> 00:49:23.851
<v Speaker 2>which seems to be elicited by </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic use.</v>

856
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:29.190
<v Speaker 2>The Sharman dissolve down past their </v>
<v Speaker 2>bones and then they go up into heaven </v>

857
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:34.830
<v Speaker 2>and speak with the ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they're introduced into the </v>

858
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:38.161
<v Speaker 2>heavenly kingdom and then the flesh is </v>
<v Speaker 2>put back on their bones and they come </v>

859
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:43.120
<v Speaker 2>back and tell everybody what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a repeatable experience,</v>

860
00:49:43.121 --> 00:49:48.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shamanic tradition is unbelievably </v>

861
00:49:48.121 --> 00:49:49.600
<v Speaker 2>widespread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all over Europe,</v>

862
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:54.660
<v Speaker 2>ancient Europe and Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps as far down as South </v>

863
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:54.660
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

864
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.681
<v Speaker 2>It's highly conserved and it's out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that tradition in all likelihood that </v>

865
00:49:58.681 --> 00:50:03.361
<v Speaker 2>are religious ideation and merged so and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see echoes of that here so,</v>

866
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:11.870
<v Speaker 2>so back to the story of Jacob and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>ladder so that I can come again to my </v>

867
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:16.441
<v Speaker 2>father's house in peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then shall the Lord be my God and this </v>

868
00:50:16.441 --> 00:50:19.621
<v Speaker 2>stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've said for a pillar shall be </v>

869
00:50:19.621 --> 00:50:19.621
<v Speaker 2>God's house and of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thou shalt give me.</v>

870
00:50:19.621 --> 00:50:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I will surely give the 10th on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>

871
00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 2>That's also an echo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

872
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:29.371
<v Speaker 2>of the obligation of those who climb the</v>
<v Speaker 2>power hierarchy hierarchy to attend to </v>

873
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:35.291
<v Speaker 2>those who are at the bottom right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you think about the tithing </v>

874
00:50:35.291 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 2>as a form of wealth distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what it is,</v>

875
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:44.130
<v Speaker 2>the part of the ethic that defines the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper moral endeavor that's related to </v>

876
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:49.241
<v Speaker 2>that center is not to advance yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the expense of the entire community.</v>

877
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.080
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're fortunate enough so that you </v>

878
00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.711
<v Speaker 2>can rise in authority and power and </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence within the confines of a </v>

879
00:50:59.711 --> 00:51:04.571
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have a obligation to maintain </v>

880
00:51:04.571 --> 00:51:09.101
<v Speaker 2>the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain and further the structure of </v>

881
00:51:09.101 --> 00:51:09.590
<v Speaker 2>the community within which you rose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's obvious,</v>

882
00:51:09.591 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if people didn't do that,</v>

883
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:14.030
<v Speaker 2>after a couple of generations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing would fall apart.</v>

884
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:15.260
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

885
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.510
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

886
00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not reasonable to destroy the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're winning.</v>

887
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.900
<v Speaker 2>It's reasonable to strengthen the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're winning.</v>

888
00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:29.380
<v Speaker 2>And so that's another thing because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>also describes the ethic that should </v>

889
00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.480
<v Speaker 2>allow you to be an active member of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community around which,</v>

890
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:36.110
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gathers around that center.</v>

891
00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:37.250
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

892
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.150
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things I've learned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero mythology that I really,</v>

893
00:51:41.151 --> 00:51:46.151
<v Speaker 2>really liked his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see this pretty clearly in the </v>

894
00:51:46.151 --> 00:51:49.301
<v Speaker 2>figure of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because two things are conjoined in </v>

895
00:51:49.301 --> 00:51:52.220
<v Speaker 2>in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Christ is also the here.</v>

896
00:51:52.221 --> 00:51:57.221
<v Speaker 2>There's two kinds of heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say there's the hero that goes out into </v>

897
00:51:57.221 --> 00:51:59.621
<v Speaker 2>chaos and confronts the dragon of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and gathers the treasure as a </v>

898
00:52:00.201 --> 00:52:02.210
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then shares it with the community.</v>

899
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:07.630
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other form of hero is the hero who </v>

900
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:10.751
<v Speaker 2>stands up against the corrupt state and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rattles the foundation of the state,</v>

901
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.640
<v Speaker 2>has it collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then reconstructs it,</v>

902
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

903
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:18.940
<v Speaker 2>So because the two great dangers to </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are an protected exposure </v>

904
00:52:19.521 --> 00:52:23.420
<v Speaker 2>to the catastrophes of the natural world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and subjugation to tyranny,</v>

905
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two major dangers.</v>

906
00:52:25.761 --> 00:52:30.761
<v Speaker 2>And so hero is the ultimate hero is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who reconstructs the structure of</v>

907
00:52:32.451 --> 00:52:37.451
<v Speaker 2>the state by using the information that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he gathered by going out into the </v>

908
00:52:37.451 --> 00:52:39.740
<v Speaker 2>unknown that unites them both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means,</v>

909
00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.600
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the rub as far as I can tell.</v>

910
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:49.750
<v Speaker 2>So a structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a center has to risks associated with </v>

911
00:52:50.061 --> 00:52:55.061
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is that it will degenerate into </v>

912
00:52:55.061 --> 00:52:57.191
<v Speaker 2>chaos and the other is that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>rigidified into tyranny and it'll </v>

913
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:02.680
<v Speaker 2>degenerate into chaos even if it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stays doing what it's doing,</v>

914
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.230
<v Speaker 2>so if it just does exactly what it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and it doesn't change,</v>

915
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:11.410
<v Speaker 2>it will degenerate because things change</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it doesn't change to keep up,</v>

916
00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:16.810
<v Speaker 2>then it gets farther and farther away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the environment and it'll </v>

917
00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:20.111
<v Speaker 2>precipitously collapse and so and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it just changes willy nilly so that </v>

918
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.840
<v Speaker 2>nobody can establish a stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>centralize,</v>

919
00:53:23.841 --> 00:53:28.410
<v Speaker 2>a game that it into chaos immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one can get along.</v>

920
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:34.040
<v Speaker 2>So there's a rule for being longing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the community and the rule has to be </v>

921
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:39.830
<v Speaker 2>that you have to act in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustains and that sustains the community</v>

922
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:45.531
<v Speaker 2>and increases its competence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental moral obligation </v>

923
00:53:45.531 --> 00:53:47.970
<v Speaker 2>for belonging while an obviously so </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

924
00:53:47.971 --> 00:53:52.971
<v Speaker 2>because why would you belong to a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you walk into a club House </v>

925
00:53:52.971 --> 00:53:54.750
<v Speaker 2>that was on fire?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's just not smart,</v>

926
00:53:54.751 --> 00:53:57.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to be part of the game,</v>

927
00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:00.480
<v Speaker 2>if you've decided that being part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>game is worthwhile,</v>

928
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:05.630
<v Speaker 2>you've also taken on the moral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've also decided even if you didn't </v>

929
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:11.271
<v Speaker 2>notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to work to support that </v>

930
00:54:11.271 --> 00:54:11.370
<v Speaker 2>game because by deciding to play that </v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

931
00:54:11.371 --> 00:54:14.700
<v Speaker 2>you said that it's valuable and if it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable,</v>

932
00:54:14.701 --> 00:54:18.990
<v Speaker 2>then obviously you should work to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustain and expand it because that's the</v>

933
00:54:18.991 --> 00:54:23.991
<v Speaker 2>definition of having a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's valuable and so that's </v>

934
00:54:24.091 --> 00:54:29.091
<v Speaker 2>the criteria for membership in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>community and that's partly why.</v>

935
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000
<v Speaker 2>If you regard the cross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say as the symbol of voluntary </v>

936
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.120
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two suffering,</v>

937
00:54:36.121 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 2>excepted voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

938
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:44.060
<v Speaker 2>which is means that there's another </v>
<v Speaker 2>element of that too that's worth </v>

939
00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:44.130
<v Speaker 2>thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

940
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:49.160
<v Speaker 2>the reason that cain gets so out of hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because he's suffering and he won't </v>

941
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 2>accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He certainly won't accept responsibility</v>

942
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:56.031
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's angry and bitter about it and no </v>

943
00:54:56.031 --> 00:54:56.031
<v Speaker 2>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

944
00:54:56.031 --> 00:54:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have to be realistic about </v>
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of things there.</v>

945
00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Your guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of you people are going to suffer at</v>

946
00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:04.200
<v Speaker 2>some point in your life to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're angry and bitter about it.</v>

947
00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:09.201
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just absolutely no doubt about </v>

948
00:55:09.201 --> 00:55:09.201
<v Speaker 2>that and you're even going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

949
00:55:09.201 --> 00:55:11.040
<v Speaker 2>it's no bloody wonder that I'm angry and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter about it.</v>

950
00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would be and things are so god </v>
<v Speaker 2>awful that there's no excuse for them to</v>

951
00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 2>even exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a powerful argument.</v>

952
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Although I think it's ultimately self </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating.</v>

953
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what the story of Cain </v>

954
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:30.201
<v Speaker 2>and Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what the story of Cain </v>

955
00:55:30.201 --> 00:55:30.600
<v Speaker 2>and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say?</v>

956
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.630
<v Speaker 2>That's the moral of the story of Cain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Abel essentially.</v>

957
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:41.510
<v Speaker 2>So what that means instead is that even </v>
<v Speaker 2>under those conditions of relatively </v>

958
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:45.111
<v Speaker 2>intense suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to accept it voluntarily </v>

959
00:55:45.111 --> 00:55:47.931
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise it turns you against </v>
<v Speaker 2>being and then you start to act in this </v>

960
00:55:47.931 --> 00:55:50.400
<v Speaker 2>terrible manner that makes everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

961
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.070
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradiction in that if,</v>

962
00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:55.950
<v Speaker 2>if the reason you're complaining is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are bad,</v>

963
00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:00.510
<v Speaker 2>then it isn't reasonable for you to act </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a manner that makes them worse.</v>

964
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

965
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 2>even if it's no wonder that people do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

966
00:56:04.441 --> 00:56:07.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's degenerating game and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

967
00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:13.280
<v Speaker 2>so the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the idea of the cross and the </v>

968
00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 2>suffering that it represents is that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could accept that voluntarily,</v>

969
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:22.910
<v Speaker 2>regardless of its intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you won't become embittered and </v>

970
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:28.621
<v Speaker 2>resentful and vengeful to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you pose a danger to the stability</v>

971
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:30.840
<v Speaker 2>of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

972
00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 2>or to your own stability for that matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

973
00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:35.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be your own stability,</v>

974
00:56:35.261 --> 00:56:40.261
<v Speaker 2>the stability of your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stability of the community and the </v>

975
00:56:40.261 --> 00:56:40.390
<v Speaker 2>stability of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be all of that.</v>

976
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:43.120
<v Speaker 2>And increasingly I think it is all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

977
00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

978
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now Jacob,</v>

979
00:56:51.581 --> 00:56:53.170
<v Speaker 2>we get the second part of Jacob's story.</v>

980
00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:03.060
<v Speaker 2>He goes to meet his uncle laband and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>meets Rachel there again by a well.</v>

981
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.330
<v Speaker 2>He falls in love and goes to live with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon.</v>

982
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:10.090
<v Speaker 2>There are two daughters there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leah,</v>

983
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:15.600
<v Speaker 2>as well as Rachel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leah is not a particularly attractive </v>

984
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't exactly clear why,</v>

985
00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:22.441
<v Speaker 2>but the story makes it quite clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's definitely the least desirable of </v>

986
00:57:22.441 --> 00:57:26.470
<v Speaker 2>the two daughters and the story makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference to her eyes and it isn't clear</v>

987
00:57:26.471 --> 00:57:31.471
<v Speaker 2>if there's something wrong with her </v>
<v Speaker 2>physiologically or if there's something </v>

988
00:57:31.471 --> 00:57:34.051
<v Speaker 2>wrong with her attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not obvious but doesn't really </v>

989
00:57:34.051 --> 00:57:37.051
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is she's the older daughter </v>

990
00:57:37.051 --> 00:57:39.220
<v Speaker 2>but she's the less desirable one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jacob stays a month,</v>

991
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.690
<v Speaker 2>which is the limit of hospitality in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time,</v>

992
00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:48.900
<v Speaker 2>if you stayed for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were welcomed but you had to work </v>

993
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:48.900
<v Speaker 2>for your keep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think after about three days,</v>

994
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:53.761
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems rather reasonable and so he </v>

995
00:57:53.761 --> 00:57:57.370
<v Speaker 2>stays a month and then he has a chat </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Le and he says he's.</v>

996
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.980
<v Speaker 2>He's fallen in love with Rachel by this </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and he says,</v>

997
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll stay with you and work for seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

998
00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:09.151
<v Speaker 2>And then all we had Rachel and Liban </v>
<v Speaker 2>says that's fine deal,</v>

999
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:14.520
<v Speaker 2>and then the seven years passes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a wedding ceremony.</v>

1000
00:58:14.751 --> 00:58:17.440
<v Speaker 2>It's quite a long thing and the bride is</v>
<v Speaker 2>veiled and</v>

1001
00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:27.220
<v Speaker 2>the bride goes into the tent with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Jacob and if I remember the story </v>

1002
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:31.881
<v Speaker 2>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked at it for a month or </v>

1003
00:58:31.881 --> 00:58:34.041
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rachel is outside the tent speaking,</v>

1004
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:40.730
<v Speaker 2>but Leah is inside the tent and so Jacob</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks he's getting married to Rachel,</v>

1005
00:58:41.491 --> 00:58:44.670
<v Speaker 2>but he's actually getting married to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Leah and this is,</v>

1006
00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:49.810
<v Speaker 2>it's an inversion a because he's in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dark like Isaac was when he fooled </v>

1007
00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:54.201
<v Speaker 2>Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now it's jacobs turned to be in the </v>

1008
00:58:54.201 --> 00:58:56.901
<v Speaker 2>dark and he gets betrayed by his uncle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his bride to be Rachel and her </v>

1009
00:58:58.111 --> 00:59:03.111
<v Speaker 2>sister in a manner that's broadly </v>
<v Speaker 2>parallel to the trick that he pulled on </v>

1010
00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Esol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a Karma notion there </v>

1011
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.450
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'd like,</v>

1012
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1013
00:59:08.851 --> 00:59:13.380
<v Speaker 2>you might think of Karma as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstitious idea,</v>

1014
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:18.780
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are ways of interpreting it </v>

1015
00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:20.820
<v Speaker 2>that might make it the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's what it is.</v>

1016
00:59:20.821 --> 00:59:25.310
<v Speaker 2>It's no bad deed goes unpunished at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1017
00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:34.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you've done something bad to </v>

1018
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:36.501
<v Speaker 2>someone and therefore there's part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you that feels quite guilty about that </v>

1019
00:59:36.501 --> 00:59:40.910
<v Speaker 2>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that part is looking for punishment </v>

1020
00:59:41.161 --> 00:59:43.680
<v Speaker 2>to set the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1021
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.510
<v Speaker 2>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

1022
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:49.890
<v Speaker 2>but things are yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're a psychopath.</v>

1023
00:59:49.891 --> 00:59:54.891
<v Speaker 2>That's how things work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're interested in that kind of </v>

1024
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:57.621
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should read Dostoyevsky's crime and </v>

1025
00:59:57.621 --> 00:59:57.720
<v Speaker 2>punishment because it's the definitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>study of that sort of phenomena.</v>

1026
00:59:58.170 --> 00:59:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in that book,</v>

1027
00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.760
<v Speaker 2>the main protagonists risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all cough gets away with murder,</v>

1028
01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:07.790
<v Speaker 2>like he does it successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one suspects him and he drives </v>

1029
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:12.231
<v Speaker 2>himself so crazy with guilt that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically falls into the hands of the </v>

1030
01:00:12.631 --> 01:00:17.631
<v Speaker 2>police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He drives himself into the hands of the </v>

1031
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:17.631
<v Speaker 2>police because he can't tolerate what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1032
01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.050
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

1033
01:00:19.051 --> 01:00:20.820
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>

1034
01:00:20.821 --> 01:00:25.821
<v Speaker 2>the point is here Jacob falls prey to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same sort of crookedness that he </v>

1035
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:33.440
<v Speaker 2>used to ratchet himself up the ladder </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that happens far more often in life </v>

1036
01:00:34.321 --> 01:00:35.280
<v Speaker 2>than people think.</v>

1037
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:38.170
<v Speaker 2>And it's really not like he can complain</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it right now.</v>

1038
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:40.110
<v Speaker 2>If he has any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he does.</v>

1039
01:00:40.111 --> 01:00:44.040
<v Speaker 2>He brings Leah out to see Lebaron and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1040
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.580
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's with this sister?</v>

1041
01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:52.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Lebaron basically says to him in our</v>

1042
01:00:52.711 --> 01:00:57.711
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the custom to marry the eldest </v>

1043
01:00:57.711 --> 01:00:59.100
<v Speaker 2>daughter first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly right.</v>

1044
01:00:59.101 --> 01:00:59.730
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1045
01:00:59.731 --> 01:01:00.780
<v Speaker 2>it would bring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1046
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:05.890
<v Speaker 2>he's rationalizing obviously because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just screwed over Jacob in a major </v>

1047
01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:09.390
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little late to take it back.</v>

1048
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:14.860
<v Speaker 2>The marriage has been consummated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ceremony has been complete and all </v>

1049
01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.551
<v Speaker 2>hell would break out if there was any </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt to sever the relationships.</v>

1050
01:01:19.671 --> 01:01:24.671
<v Speaker 2>So that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Leah's married and Jacob has the </v>

1051
01:01:26.011 --> 01:01:28.230
<v Speaker 2>wrong wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>

1052
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.560
<v Speaker 2>so this is Jacob area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see on the left,</v>

1053
01:01:31.561 --> 01:01:36.090
<v Speaker 2>he's got the little flowery hat and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing to Leah and he's saying like,</v>

1054
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.710
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up here?</v>

1055
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.600
<v Speaker 2>And loved the band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The band is coupled goat and he's not </v>

1056
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.930
<v Speaker 2>really all that sad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1057
01:01:48.931 --> 01:01:51.400
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine that he's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1058
01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.640
<v Speaker 2>so okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he asked to work another seven </v>

1059
01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:58.640
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1060
01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:03.310
<v Speaker 2>any gains Rachel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because God is a tricky character,</v>

1061
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.520
<v Speaker 2>there was another twist in this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rachel turns out not to be very good at </v>

1062
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:14.410
<v Speaker 2>having children or Rachel and Jacob </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out not to be very good in having</v>

1063
01:02:14.411 --> 01:02:15.820
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Leah,</v>

1064
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:21.750
<v Speaker 2>she's really good at having kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she provides Jacob with Reuben,</v>

1065
01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:25.290
<v Speaker 2>simeon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Levi,</v>

1066
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Levi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe and Judah,</v>

1067
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:31.110
<v Speaker 2>and the names of those meanings of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>names are there.</v>

1068
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Reuben means see a son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simeon means hearing that.</v>

1069
01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the Lord heard my </v>
<v Speaker 2>prayer.</v>

1070
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what that was a Levi </v>
<v Speaker 2>means joined.</v>

1071
01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Judah means praise to yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yahuah,</v>

1072
01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:46.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's Judah from WHO's tried Christ </v>

1073
01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:50.481
<v Speaker 2>arises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judah is essentially promoted to the </v>

1074
01:02:50.481 --> 01:02:50.520
<v Speaker 2>status of first born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Later in the story.</v>

1075
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:55.670
<v Speaker 2>This is important because Ruben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simeon and Levy all do something </v>

1076
01:02:56.281 --> 01:02:59.100
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Judah gets,</v>

1077
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:04.790
<v Speaker 2>gets promoted to firstborn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly why in the logic of </v>

1078
01:03:05.491 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 2>the narrative that it's from the tribe </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Judah that Christ arises.</v>

1079
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now while this is going on,</v>

1080
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Rachel is like suicidally desperate for </v>
<v Speaker 2>children's.</v>

1081
01:03:17.341 --> 01:03:21.360
<v Speaker 2>She's jealous of her older sister who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather ill favored as we pointed out,</v>

1082
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:26.361
<v Speaker 2>but who seems to be damn good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing sons and she's really not </v>

1083
01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:32.061
<v Speaker 2>happy with Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she chose him out and Jacob </v>

1084
01:03:32.061 --> 01:03:32.190
<v Speaker 2>basically says like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want me to do about it?</v>

1085
01:03:32.191 --> 01:03:35.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a reasonable response,</v>

1086
01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:38.880
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in her desperation,</v>

1087
01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:42.270
<v Speaker 2>she gives Jacob Bella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's her maid servant.</v>

1088
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.340
<v Speaker 2>We've seen that sort of thing happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1089
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:50.450
<v Speaker 2>And to bill up produces two children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan and NAF telly.</v>

1090
01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm the reason I'm detaining out all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these sons.</v>

1091
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:59.420
<v Speaker 2>It's important because Jacob is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>founder of Israel and his sons are the </v>

1092
01:03:59.761 --> 01:04:04.560
<v Speaker 2>founder of the 12 tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a pivotal moment in the story,</v>

1093
01:04:04.561 --> 01:04:05.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because he's the,</v>

1094
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:11.030
<v Speaker 2>he's the fundamental patriarch of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those who wrestle with God because as</v>

1095
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.620
<v Speaker 2>we'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the name Israel means.</v>

1096
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.590
<v Speaker 2>He gets the name Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see why in a while.</v>

1097
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.600
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's in the,</v>

1098
01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:23.620
<v Speaker 2>you need to know these genealogies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this situation because they play an </v>

1099
01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 2>important role in everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens afterwards.</v>

1100
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:30.690
<v Speaker 2>So Nafta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee is the second,</v>

1101
01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:36.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and her name or his name means with </v>

1102
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 2>great wrestling's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've wrestled with my sister,</v>

1103
01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:37.860
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contended with her,</v>

1104
01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:42.960
<v Speaker 2>and have prevailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that gives you some indication of the</v>

1105
01:04:42.961 --> 01:04:47.700
<v Speaker 2>tension in the household.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Leah is now past bearing children.</v>

1106
01:04:47.701 --> 01:04:52.701
<v Speaker 2>She gives Jake Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her maid servant to Silpada to keep up </v>

1107
01:04:52.701 --> 01:04:54.360
<v Speaker 2>with her sister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

1108
01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:59.780
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now Zilpah bears to children for Jacob.</v>

1109
01:05:00.601 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 2>So he's piling up the kids left right </v>
<v Speaker 2>and center here.</v>

1110
01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of them is named Gad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good fortune and the other is named </v>

1111
01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Asher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy or blessed.</v>

1112
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:14.520
<v Speaker 2>So there's more rivalry going on between</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sisters.</v>

1113
01:05:14.521 --> 01:05:16.710
<v Speaker 2>This is quite an interesting little </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

1114
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.650
<v Speaker 2>So Ruben,</v>

1115
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>who's Leah's daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out and looks for mandrakes.</v>

1116
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Now mandrakes have aphrodisiac </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties,</v>

1117
01:05:25.561 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 1>so that's a little odd to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1118
01:05:29.081 --> 01:05:34.081
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Rachel is Rachel wants the mandrakes</v>

1119
01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>because she's still interested in having</v>
<v Speaker 1>some children.</v>

1120
01:05:38.381 --> 01:05:43.381
<v Speaker 1>And so she bargains with Leah to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>her a night with Jacob in exchange for </v>

1121
01:05:43.381 --> 01:05:48.181
<v Speaker 1>the mandrakes and sons emerge as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

1122
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Rachel find the gifts.</v>

1123
01:05:52.661 --> 01:05:57.661
<v Speaker 1>Birth Joseph and Joseph plays a key role</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last story in Genesis,</v>

1124
01:06:00.011 --> 01:06:02.980
<v Speaker 1>which I hope we'll get to in the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture.</v>

1125
01:06:02.981 --> 01:06:06.370
<v Speaker 1>And then we can close off genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan anyways,</v>

1126
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:12.150
<v Speaker 1>so now Jacob isn't really very happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the whole arrangement because he.</v>

1127
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.490
<v Speaker 1>He's been there 14 years and he's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>two wives.</v>

1128
01:06:15.491 --> 01:06:16.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not too bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

1129
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got he the bargain wasn't exactly </v>

1130
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:21.840
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really trust law,</v>

1131
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Bannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no reason for him to do so.</v>

1132
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Lebanon was poor before Jacob came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob turns out to be a very useful </v>

1133
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.480
<v Speaker 1>person to have around and so he tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>labounty he wants to leave and go back </v>

1134
01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.090
<v Speaker 1>to his home country and that he'll take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the speckled and spotted cattle,</v>

1135
01:06:40.091 --> 01:06:43.720
<v Speaker 1>the brown sheep and the spotted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>speckled goats from the flock,</v>

1136
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:46.120
<v Speaker 1>and they're in the minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the idea.</v>

1137
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 1>And so la ban or lab and takes all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals out of his flock.</v>

1138
01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:56.220
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an idea that the speckled </v>

1139
01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:56.470
<v Speaker 1>goats and the brown sheep would breed </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

1140
01:06:56.530 --> 01:07:01.530
<v Speaker 1>So if you have two male goat and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>female goat and they're both speckled,</v>

1141
01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:04.180
<v Speaker 1>they'll have speckled kits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the theory.</v>

1142
01:07:04.181 --> 01:07:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And the same with brown sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what [inaudible] does is he takes</v>

1143
01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 1>all the speckled animals out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flocks,</v>

1144
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.470
<v Speaker 1>gives them to his son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go three days away with them so</v>

1145
01:07:14.471 --> 01:07:17.710
<v Speaker 1>that Jacob is left with the flock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with no,</v>

1146
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.270
<v Speaker 1>with none of these animals.</v>

1147
01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Now the idea was that all the newborns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be his.</v>

1148
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>And so what Liban is basically done is </v>
<v Speaker 1>set it up so that in principle I'm,</v>

1149
01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Jacob is going to get nothing for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1150
01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:34.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's another time when Jacob </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences betrayal,</v>

1151
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:40.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost as if God isn't done with </v>

1152
01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.320
<v Speaker 1>reminding him of the magnitude of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he did in the past,</v>

1153
01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:44.350
<v Speaker 1>that that's the moral of the story in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

1154
01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird little twist in the </v>

1155
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.511
<v Speaker 1>story here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what Jacob does is some sympathetic </v>

1156
01:07:51.511 --> 01:07:52.570
<v Speaker 1>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when the animals are rotting,</v>

1157
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:55.360
<v Speaker 1>he puts speckled objects in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1158
01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>speckled branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth,</v>

1159
01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess to remind them about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to be producing,</v>

1160
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.320
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it works.</v>

1161
01:08:02.321 --> 01:08:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And so all these animals that live band </v>
<v Speaker 1>left are,</v>

1162
01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.370
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1163
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:10.080
<v Speaker 1>producing spotted animals like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

1164
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I guess God's changed his mind and let </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob off the hook slightly here.</v>

1165
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1166
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Sooni was very wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much cattle maid servants,</v>

1167
01:08:20.861 --> 01:08:21.470
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>servants,</v>

1168
01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Campbell's analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laband son,</v>

1169
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.510
<v Speaker 2>sons become jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And laband is outraged.</v>

1170
01:08:26.511 --> 01:08:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1171
01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's some competition there</v>
<v Speaker 2>between Jacob and the sons,</v>

1172
01:08:30.021 --> 01:08:35.021
<v Speaker 2>which is hardly surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the band played this trick to strip </v>

1173
01:08:35.021 --> 01:08:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Jacob of all his property and instead he</v>
<v Speaker 2>got far more than he was going to get to</v>

1174
01:08:37.491 --> 01:08:42.491
<v Speaker 2>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine that spit a bit </v>

1175
01:08:42.491 --> 01:08:44.650
<v Speaker 2>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jacob thinks he better get out of </v>

1176
01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:45.890
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we tell Rachel and Leah and said unto</v>

1177
01:08:45.891 --> 01:08:50.891
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see your father's countenance that </v>

1178
01:08:50.891 --> 01:08:53.021
<v Speaker 2>it's not toward me as before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the god of my father has been with </v>

1179
01:08:53.021 --> 01:08:53.660
<v Speaker 2>me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all my power,</v>

1180
01:08:53.661 --> 01:08:58.661
<v Speaker 2>I've served your father and your father </v>
<v Speaker 2>is deceived me and changed my wages 10 </v>

1181
01:08:58.661 --> 01:09:02.561
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But God so far has suffered him not to </v>

1182
01:09:02.561 --> 01:09:05.381
<v Speaker 2>hurt me if he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thus the speckled shall be thy wages </v>

1183
01:09:05.381 --> 01:09:06.800
<v Speaker 2>than all the cattle bore speckled.</v>

1184
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:12.010
<v Speaker 2>And if he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thus the ring straight shall be thy </v>

1185
01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:12.020
<v Speaker 2>higher than all the cattle board ring </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>

1186
01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:17.260
<v Speaker 2>thus God has taken away the cattle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your father and given them to me and </v>

1187
01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:21.170
<v Speaker 2>they decided to sneak away and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>unhappy with the inheritance.</v>

1188
01:09:21.171 --> 01:09:23.930
<v Speaker 2>That lack of inheritance from labatt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as they sneak away,</v>

1189
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Rachel steals the idols that her father </v>
<v Speaker 2>has in his house and it's not exactly </v>

1190
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:34.541
<v Speaker 2>obvious why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of contention about why </v>

1191
01:09:34.541 --> 01:09:37.451
<v Speaker 2>she's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them is to punish him to bring </v>

1192
01:09:37.451 --> 01:09:38.480
<v Speaker 2>with her the images of her ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1193
01:09:38.481 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 2>maybe she's loaned some moving away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>home just out of spite to show them that</v>

1194
01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:47.861
<v Speaker 2>the idols were actually powerless for </v>
<v Speaker 2>protection to stop her father from </v>

1195
01:09:47.861 --> 01:09:52.751
<v Speaker 2>dividing the root of their escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That last one is the strangest one </v>

1196
01:09:52.751 --> 01:09:56.201
<v Speaker 2>because the idea would be that the ban </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have used some sort of ritual with</v>

1197
01:09:57.321 --> 01:10:02.321
<v Speaker 2>the idols that would help them infer </v>
<v Speaker 2>their escape route and men could chase </v>

1198
01:10:02.321 --> 01:10:02.321
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1199
01:10:02.321 --> 01:10:06.310
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the range of speculation about </v>

1200
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.310
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1201
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:09.910
<v Speaker 2>It sounds to me mostly like a little act</v>
<v Speaker 2>of revenge maybe with a bit of </v>

1202
01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:14.600
<v Speaker 2>loneliness mixed in Lebaron pursues </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1203
01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:18.650
<v Speaker 2>but God comes into dream to tell him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave Jacob unharmed.</v>

1204
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Lavonne catches up with them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproaches Jacob saying that he would </v>

1205
01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.731
<v Speaker 2>have thrown a great party if he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have known that they were going to </v>

1206
01:10:27.731 --> 01:10:27.731
<v Speaker 2>leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1207
01:10:27.731 --> 01:10:32.640
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want them to sneak away in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and eat a can't tell from the </v>

1208
01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.050
<v Speaker 2>story whether that's true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1209
01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:36.890
<v Speaker 2>these people were pretty rough and </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulsive I would say.</v>

1210
01:10:36.891 --> 01:10:41.891
<v Speaker 2>And maybe there was a 50 percent chance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a slaughter and a 50 percent chance </v>

1211
01:10:41.891 --> 01:10:42.380
<v Speaker 2>of a party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows.</v>

1212
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I've been to parties like that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So laband complains that his gods are </v>

1213
01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:51.530
<v Speaker 2>gone and Jacob says that whoever has </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1214
01:10:51.531 --> 01:10:56.531
<v Speaker 2>he will have them killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Rachel who's really quite a sneaky </v>

1215
01:10:56.531 --> 01:11:00.701
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all things consider basically claims </v>

1216
01:11:00.701 --> 01:11:04.331
<v Speaker 2>that she's having her period and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the carpet with all the idols</v>

1217
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:10.511
<v Speaker 2>underneath and she can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they search everywhere and can't </v>

1218
01:11:10.511 --> 01:11:13.481
<v Speaker 2>find them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like laughing away behind her </v>

1219
01:11:13.481 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 2>hand about that sneaky little maneuver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1220
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:15.750
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't die.</v>

1221
01:11:15.751 --> 01:11:20.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's probably a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the laband,</v>

1222
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.650
<v Speaker 1>she checks everything out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checks the camp out,</v>

1223
01:11:22.651 --> 01:11:25.290
<v Speaker 1>and he can't find anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they reconcile.</v>

1224
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:29.990
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the first reconciliation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Jacob engages in.</v>

1225
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.930
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like</v>

1226
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:32.480
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1227
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:39.420
<v Speaker 1>what would you say the Karmic debt has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been paid.</v>

1228
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:44.480
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so he got punished for his </v>

1229
01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.580
<v Speaker 1>wrongdoing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's learned his lesson perhaps.</v>

1230
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:50.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1231
01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.740
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough as far as he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

1232
01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got away good enough and they make </v>

1233
01:11:57.770 --> 01:12:00.051
<v Speaker 1>peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the next thing that happens as </v>

1234
01:12:02.091 --> 01:12:06.020
<v Speaker 1>they're traveling is that Jacob was left</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone and there wrestled a man,</v>

1235
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:08.990
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angel God.</v>

1236
01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go with angel with him until the </v>

1237
01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:20.211
<v Speaker 1>breaking of the day or God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he saw that he prevailed not </v>

1238
01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:23.631
<v Speaker 1>against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He touched the hollow of his thigh in </v>

1239
01:12:23.631 --> 01:12:23.631
<v Speaker 1>the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>joint.</v>

1240
01:12:23.631 --> 01:12:26.070
<v Speaker 1>As he wrestled with him and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me go for the day breaks.</v>

1241
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.460
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not let you go unless you bless </v>

1242
01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:31.460
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Angel said unto him,</v>

1243
01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.240
<v Speaker 1>what is the name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob said,</v>

1244
01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Jacob,</v>

1245
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:50.240
<v Speaker 1>and the Angel said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thy name shall no more be called Jacob </v>

1246
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:50.240
<v Speaker 1>supplanter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1247
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.181
<v Speaker 1>The overthrow thrower with that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intonation of or implication of </v>

1248
01:12:55.681 --> 01:13:00.681
<v Speaker 1>crookedness but Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means he who wrestles or strive </v>

1249
01:13:00.681 --> 01:13:04.831
<v Speaker 1>successfully with God for as a prince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hast thou power with God and with men </v>

1250
01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:07.710
<v Speaker 1>and have prevailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's quite a story.</v>

1251
01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know exactly what to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1252
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:14.280
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously a symbolic level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>

1253
01:13:14.281 --> 01:13:19.281
<v Speaker 1>which is that that is what human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>do in some senses they they wrestle.</v>

1254
01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:25.010
<v Speaker 1>I would say they wrestle with the divine</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with the concept of the divine for </v>

1255
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:26.220
<v Speaker 1>that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1256
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:30.950
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they prevail?</v>

1257
01:13:30.951 --> 01:13:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Like it's of odd thing that Jacob </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually seems to win this battle,</v>

1258
01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:40.481
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least he wins it enough so that </v>

1259
01:13:40.481 --> 01:13:42.050
<v Speaker 1>whoever he's wrestling this divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that he's wrestling is willing to</v>

1260
01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:47.051
<v Speaker 1>bestow a blessing on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe that's a testament to his </v>

1261
01:13:47.051 --> 01:13:47.180
<v Speaker 1>courage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

1262
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's an indication that he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid for his sin sufficiently so that he</v>

1263
01:13:52.791 --> 01:13:55.470
<v Speaker 1>sort of back on the moral high ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1264
01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:01.300
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's really telling that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of the name from Jacob </v>

1265
01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Israel and what Israel means is he who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestles with God or who struggles with </v>

1266
01:14:06.831 --> 01:14:11.831
<v Speaker 1>God and perhaps successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also so interesting that </v>

1267
01:14:11.831 --> 01:14:12.820
<v Speaker 1>actually emerges victorious.</v>

1268
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.940
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't necessarily think that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be a possibility,</v>

1269
01:14:15.941 --> 01:14:20.941
<v Speaker 2>especially given you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God's rather hot headed nature in the </v>

1270
01:14:20.941 --> 01:14:24.811
<v Speaker 2>Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to mess with him too </v>

1271
01:14:24.811 --> 01:14:24.811
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1272
01:14:24.811 --> 01:14:28.500
<v Speaker 2>But Jacob does it successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even more importantly is the idea </v>

1273
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:31.330
<v Speaker 2>that whatever Israel constitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be the say,</v>

1274
01:14:31.331 --> 01:14:36.331
<v Speaker 2>the land that Jacob found is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>composed of those who wrestle with God.</v>

1275
01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an amazing idea because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it also seems to me to shed some light </v>

1276
01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:47.050
<v Speaker 2>on perhaps what was meant by belief in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those days.</v>

1277
01:14:47.051 --> 01:14:52.051
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've often thought of rep of </v>

1278
01:14:52.051 --> 01:14:52.051
<v Speaker 2>marriage as a wrestling match,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1279
01:14:52.051 --> 01:14:53.290
<v Speaker 2>If you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person that you marry,</v>

1280
01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:56.020
<v Speaker 2>someone you contend with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly.</v>

1281
01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:59.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not tranquil.</v>

1282
01:14:59.141 --> 01:15:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1283
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:03.720
<v Speaker 2>you might have noticed that some of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1284
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:09.810
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is if you have something </v>

1285
01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:11.641
<v Speaker 2>to contend against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that strengthens you and that's </v>

1286
01:15:11.831 --> 01:15:14.590
<v Speaker 2>actually better than having nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contend against.</v>

1287
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And so Jacob is the person who's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthened by the necessity of this </v>

1288
01:15:20.711 --> 01:15:25.711
<v Speaker 2>contending and that seems to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper relationship with God or the </v>

1289
01:15:25.711 --> 01:15:28.630
<v Speaker 2>angel is that contending the battling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1290
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Rather than some sort of kind of loose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weak statement of belief.</v>

1291
01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:41.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to denigrate that to any </v>

1292
01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:43.291
<v Speaker 2>great degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem like the right </v>

1293
01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:43.291
<v Speaker 2>motive conceptualization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1294
01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:47.461
<v Speaker 2>Because human beings aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't like that were were contentious </v>

1295
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:51.760
<v Speaker 2>creatures and that's actually seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be something that meets with God's favor</v>

1296
01:15:51.761 --> 01:15:54.940
<v Speaker 2>in this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So especially given that that's actually</v>

1297
01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:59.941
<v Speaker 2>what he names the while the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom of the chosen people is the idea</v>

1298
01:16:00.151 --> 01:16:03.760
<v Speaker 2>is that that's composed of those who </v>
<v Speaker 2>contend with God.</v>

1299
01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.720
<v Speaker 2>So that's a hell of an idea that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1300
01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:10.700
<v Speaker 2>And Jacob ask</v>

1301
01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.560
<v Speaker 2>him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me I pray thee thy name.</v>

1302
01:16:14.561 --> 01:16:16.480
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're force it though.</v>

1303
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Dos Ask after by name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no that's not happening,</v>

1304
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:24.810
<v Speaker 2>and he blessed him there and Jacob </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the place of the name of the </v>

1305
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:27.961
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peniel for I or Peniel for I have seen </v>

1306
01:16:27.961 --> 01:16:30.580
<v Speaker 2>God face to face in my life is preserved</v>
<v Speaker 2>and passed over denial.</v>

1307
01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:32.980
<v Speaker 2>The Sun rose upon him and he halted upon</v>
<v Speaker 2>his thigh.</v>

1308
01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Now Jacob does walk away injured from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this right?</v>

1309
01:16:38.831 --> 01:16:43.510
<v Speaker 2>So he has a permanent limp after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's also an indication of just</v>

1310
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:45.820
<v Speaker 2>how dangerous that contention actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1311
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Like he gets blast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wins,</v>

1312
01:16:47.591 --> 01:16:52.540
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't get away Scot free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now.</v>

1313
01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:57.810
<v Speaker 2>So Jacob goes back to East Esau and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified even though it's been 14 </v>

1314
01:16:58.031 --> 01:17:00.130
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks maybe his heart headed brother</v>

1315
01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:05.131
<v Speaker 2>hasn't calmed down yet and he has good </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason to think that I would say so.</v>

1316
01:17:08.061 --> 01:17:09.560
<v Speaker 2>He sends messengers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Esau,</v>

1317
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 2>who then sets</v>

1318
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:15.250
<v Speaker 1>out with 400 men and so Jacob is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy with this whole idea and he </v>

1319
01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:18.920
<v Speaker 1>breaks his people into two bands so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe half of them can not be killed.</v>

1320
01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.520
<v Speaker 1>And then he takes from his large flocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of animals and a bunch of </v>

1321
01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:26.720
<v Speaker 1>servants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He sends them out to me that you saw</v>

1322
01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.790
<v Speaker 1>basically to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1323
01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a jerk and sorry about the whole </v>

1324
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.860
<v Speaker 1>birthright thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's some animals and you know,</v>

1325
01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:40.880
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe that's the beginnings of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an apology.</v>

1326
01:17:40.881 --> 01:17:42.830
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1327
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:46.550
<v Speaker 1>but he's not very convinced that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going to work.</v>

1328
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:52.300
<v Speaker 1>But Esau who actually turns out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps have matured in the interim,</v>

1329
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:54.530
<v Speaker 1>perhaps that's one way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1330
01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:59.030
<v Speaker 1>meets Jacob and says that just seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>him is enough.</v>

1331
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:04.300
<v Speaker 1>But Jacob insists that he takes the gift</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Esl accepts and which is probably a </v>

1332
01:18:05.571 --> 01:18:10.571
<v Speaker 1>wise thing because even if Esau is 95 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent convinced that just seeing his </v>

1333
01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:16.451
<v Speaker 1>brother is enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably five percent of them </v>

1334
01:18:16.451 --> 01:18:16.451
<v Speaker 1>that's still really not all that happy.</v>

1335
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1336
01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.640
<v Speaker 1>when you say that you forgive someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there might be a part of you </v>

1337
01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:27.791
<v Speaker 1>that really doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really needs something else before </v>

1338
01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:27.791
<v Speaker 1>you can actually say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1339
01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:29.030
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1340
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:34.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to fool yourself </v>

1341
01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:36.011
<v Speaker 1>about that because that five percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hasn't been completely convinced </v>

1342
01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:40.481
<v Speaker 1>will find its voice at some point and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe undermine the whole </v>

1343
01:18:40.481 --> 01:18:44.500
<v Speaker 1>reconciliation process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to think that you're </v>

1344
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.050
<v Speaker 1>any better than you are any nicer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

1345
01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:48.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Esau is smart.</v>

1346
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I think so while Jacob smart to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no like thanks a lot,</v>

1347
01:18:52.101 --> 01:18:57.101
<v Speaker 1>but take the damn goats and Jacob and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Esau is smart enough to accept that and </v>

1348
01:19:00.051 --> 01:19:05.051
<v Speaker 1>he might do that maybe to you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to please Jacob.</v>

1349
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:10.320
<v Speaker 1>But also I think so that there really is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of establishing peace </v>

1350
01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.800
<v Speaker 1>because hypothetically the gift that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being offered is of sufficient magnitude</v>

1351
01:19:14.801 --> 01:19:18.970
<v Speaker 1>to erase the debt of the loss of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>birthright at something like that.</v>

1352
01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1353
01:19:19.391 --> 01:19:19.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1354
01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.930
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the payment of the real debt.</v>

1355
01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:29.340
<v Speaker 1>And Esau said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Mina style by all this drove which </v>

1356
01:19:30.191 --> 01:19:35.191
<v Speaker 1>I met and Jacob said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are to find grace in the sight of </v>

1357
01:19:35.191 --> 01:19:35.890
<v Speaker 1>my Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Esau says,</v>

1358
01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I have enough brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep Thou,</v>

1359
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:40.060
<v Speaker 1>keep that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thou hast unto myself.</v>

1360
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:50.180
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is interesting statement,</v>

1361
01:19:50.181 --> 01:19:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1362
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I pray you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If if I have now found grace in thy </v>

1363
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:58.741
<v Speaker 1>sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the president at my hand for </v>

1364
01:19:58.741 --> 01:20:02.471
<v Speaker 1>therefore I have seen my face as though </v>
<v Speaker 1>I had seen the face of God and now it </v>

1365
01:20:02.471 --> 01:20:04.670
<v Speaker 1>was pleased with me and so that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

1366
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.880
<v Speaker 1>He's taking the honorable judgment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother because it is honorable </v>

1367
01:20:10.201 --> 01:20:15.201
<v Speaker 1>because Esau did get betrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he has a right to be standing in </v>

1368
01:20:15.201 --> 01:20:19.491
<v Speaker 1>judgment and he equates that judgment </v>
<v Speaker 1>with with what would you say,</v>

1369
01:20:21.001 --> 01:20:26.001
<v Speaker 1>with the highest virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's appropriate judgment and so he </v>

1370
01:20:26.001 --> 01:20:30.261
<v Speaker 1>wants to make complete amends to Esau as</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Esau as a representative of the </v>

1371
01:20:31.261 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 1>divine element of justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1372
01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's convincing to Esl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a thing to say,</v>

1373
01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I need to be reconciled to you </v>

1374
01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:44.860
<v Speaker 1>because that would simultaneously </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconciled with God.</v>

1375
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:47.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is between us,</v>

1376
01:20:47.871 --> 01:20:52.871
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a higher principle at stake </v>

1377
01:20:52.871 --> 01:20:53.030
<v Speaker 1>that's vital and I think that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case with betrayal.</v>

1378
01:20:53.031 --> 01:20:55.910
<v Speaker 1>That's very frequently the case because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you betray someone,</v>

1379
01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:59.180
<v Speaker 1>you really have violated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've deeply violated.</v>

1380
01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:03.200
<v Speaker 1>What can only be called a sacred trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the right terminology for that.</v>

1381
01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pray the blessing that is brought to </v>

1382
01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.820
<v Speaker 1>the because God has dealt graciously </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me and because I have enough and he</v>

1383
01:21:10.821 --> 01:21:14.600
<v Speaker 1>urged him and he took it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1384
01:21:14.601 --> 01:21:17.900
<v Speaker 1>the story seems to be something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1385
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Jacob was kind of an arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crooked,</v>

1386
01:21:22.881 --> 01:21:27.881
<v Speaker 1>deceitful character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe over impressed with his own </v>

1387
01:21:27.881 --> 01:21:28.910
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was pretty amusing to pull</v>

1388
01:21:29.530 --> 01:21:32.990
<v Speaker 1>a fast trick or two on his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he ran off,</v>

1389
01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:38.020
<v Speaker 1>which is not all that brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he got wall up a lot and </v>

1390
01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.790
<v Speaker 1>perhaps learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he came back,</v>

1391
01:21:40.791 --> 01:21:42.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a different person.</v>

1392
01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:47.650
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a reasonable story.</v>

1393
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.920
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1394
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.610
<v Speaker 1>he has to repent completely of</v>

1395
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:59.200
<v Speaker 1>about what he did before he can rectify </v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation properly.</v>

1396
01:21:59.201 --> 01:22:04.201
<v Speaker 1>And he's willing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting idea too </v>

1397
01:22:04.201 --> 01:22:04.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1398
01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.410
<v Speaker 1>it's the early reflection of the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is,</v>

1399
01:22:08.710 --> 01:22:12.910
<v Speaker 1>if you do something wrong in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a that you can learn from it,</v>

1400
01:22:13.090 --> 01:22:18.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that you're actually capable of </v>

1401
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:18.090
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

1402
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:20.050
<v Speaker 1>that you can set the balance right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the present.</v>

1403
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Those are very optimistic ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1404
01:22:22.451 --> 01:22:24.220
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1405
01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.470
<v Speaker 1>once you've committed some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>

1406
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:28.390
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no hope for you,</v>

1407
01:22:28.391 --> 01:22:33.391
<v Speaker 1>but that's pretty rough because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability that you've done unethical </v>

1408
01:22:33.391 --> 01:22:35.710
<v Speaker 1>things at some point in your life is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent.</v>

1409
01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And so if there was no way of setting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the balance right after that,</v>

1410
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.990
<v Speaker 1>then everybody would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1411
01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:50.590
<v Speaker 1>so then the story gets rough again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob settles in.</v>

1412
01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:55.591
<v Speaker 1>Sholom sholom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diana has daughter goes looking around </v>

1413
01:22:55.591 --> 01:22:56.740
<v Speaker 1>for France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Czech,</v>

1414
01:22:56.741 --> 01:22:58.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm the son of Hamor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lays with her.</v>

1415
01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:04.490
<v Speaker 1>And then once her for his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually has the order reversed </v>

1416
01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:04.490
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That turns out to be a problem.</v>

1417
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Jacob hears of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fathers talk and so they make an </v>

1418
01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.670
<v Speaker 1>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The agreement is,</v>

1419
01:23:12.671 --> 01:23:17.671
<v Speaker 1>is that if all of hammers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men including hammer and his son are </v>

1420
01:23:17.671 --> 01:23:20.230
<v Speaker 1>circumcised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the proper offering,</v>

1421
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I guess that brings them into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>familial fold and indicates that they're</v>

1422
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:28.760
<v Speaker 1>willing to make a sacrifice to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially after you know,</v>

1423
01:23:28.890 --> 01:23:33.470
<v Speaker 1>check and put the cart before the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the man of Hammer,</v>

1424
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:35.410
<v Speaker 1>circumcised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they agree to do so.</v>

1425
01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:40.620
<v Speaker 1>That turns out to be a big mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so while they're laying around the next </v>

1426
01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.340
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering Madley from the circumcision,</v>

1427
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:48.510
<v Speaker 1>simeon and Levi come in and they sneak </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and kill all of them and take their </v>

1428
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:50.770
<v Speaker 1>wealth and their women and children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's rough.</v>

1429
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 1>It's rough.</v>

1430
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you guys noticed that a so,</v>

1431
01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:02.410
<v Speaker 1>so their honor societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1432
01:24:02.730 --> 01:24:07.730
<v Speaker 1>There's still lots of honor societies in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and so they don't take kindly </v>

1433
01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:08.950
<v Speaker 1>to what happened to their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their sister,</v>

1434
01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:14.370
<v Speaker 1>although they don't kill her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now it turns out that,</v>

1435
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:16.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>

1436
01:24:16.831 --> 01:24:19.360
<v Speaker 1>as it came to pass on the third day when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were sore,</v>

1437
01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:22.000
<v Speaker 1>the two of the sons of Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simeon and Levi,</v>

1438
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Diana's brother and took each man his </v>
<v Speaker 1>sword and came upon the city boldly and </v>

1439
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:29.110
<v Speaker 1>slew all the males and they slew hammer </v>
<v Speaker 1>and check them.</v>

1440
01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:34.111
<v Speaker 1>His son with the edge of the sword and </v>
<v Speaker 1>took dine out of Shechem's house and </v>

1441
01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:37.981
<v Speaker 1>went out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain </v>

1442
01:24:37.981 --> 01:24:38.860
<v Speaker 1>and spoiled the city because they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>defiled their sister.</v>

1443
01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:45.140
<v Speaker 1>It took the sheep and the oxen and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assets and that which was in the city </v>

1444
01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:48.361
<v Speaker 1>and that was which was in the field and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all their wealth and all their little </v>

1445
01:24:48.361 --> 01:24:51.070
<v Speaker 1>ones and their wives took vacate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>captive and spoiled everything else that</v>

1446
01:24:51.071 --> 01:24:56.071
<v Speaker 1>was in the House and Jacob actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out not to be very happy about </v>

1447
01:24:56.071 --> 01:25:00.031
<v Speaker 1>that because he'd met with hammer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they hammered out a deal and that and </v>

1448
01:25:00.491 --> 01:25:02.920
<v Speaker 1>that's where they were living and so he </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured,</v>

1449
01:25:02.970 --> 01:25:05.860
<v Speaker 1>well that he was making the best of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad lot,</v>

1450
01:25:05.861 --> 01:25:10.861
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his sons went behind his back and </v>

1451
01:25:10.861 --> 01:25:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Jacob says to Simeon and Levi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have troubled me to make me,</v>

1452
01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:16.630
<v Speaker 1>to make me stink among the inhabitants </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the land,</v>

1453
01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:20.350
<v Speaker 1>among the Canaanites and the parasites </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I being few in number.</v>

1454
01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:25.680
<v Speaker 1>They shall gather themselves now </v>
<v Speaker 1>together against me and slay me and I </v>

1455
01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.940
<v Speaker 1>shall be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my house and they said,</v>

1456
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:30.850
<v Speaker 1>should he deal with our sister as with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>harlot?</v>

1457
01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:38.570
<v Speaker 1>And God said Unto Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where we get back to the </v>

1458
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:39.010
<v Speaker 1>idea of the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God says to Jacob,</v>

1459
01:25:39.011 --> 01:25:40.210
<v Speaker 1>arise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to Bethel.</v>

1460
01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:44.080
<v Speaker 1>And dwell there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Bethel was where Jacob had originally</v>

1461
01:25:44.081 --> 01:25:46.660
<v Speaker 1>put that pillar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it's back.</v>

1462
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:47.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1463
01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:49.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a real hero's journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1464
01:25:49.751 --> 01:25:54.751
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the place that he has a set </v>

1465
01:25:54.751 --> 01:25:55.720
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes out and has these adventures and</v>

1466
01:25:55.810 --> 01:26:00.580
<v Speaker 1>and undergoes a moral transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconciles and then he comes back to the</v>

1467
01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:05.581
<v Speaker 1>same place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right as a transformed person that's a </v>

1468
01:26:05.581 --> 01:26:06.110
<v Speaker 1>full hero's cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arise,</v>

1469
01:26:06.111 --> 01:26:08.650
<v Speaker 1>go to Bethel and dwell there and make an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour there.</v>

1470
01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:12.740
<v Speaker 1>An Altar unto God that appeared to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Windale fled is from the face of Esau.</v>

1471
01:26:12.741 --> 01:26:17.741
<v Speaker 1>Die Brother and Jacob said to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>household and to all that were with </v>

1472
01:26:17.741 --> 01:26:19.280
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put away the strange gods that are among</v>

1473
01:26:19.281 --> 01:26:24.281
<v Speaker 1>you and be clean and change your </v>
<v Speaker 1>garments and let us arise and go up to </v>

1474
01:26:24.861 --> 01:26:29.861
<v Speaker 1>Bethel and I will make an altar unto God</v>
<v Speaker 1>who answered me in the day of my </v>

1475
01:26:29.861 --> 01:26:34.241
<v Speaker 1>distress and was with me in the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>which I went and they gave unto Jacob </v>

1476
01:26:34.881 --> 01:26:39.881
<v Speaker 1>all the strange gods which were in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and all their earrings which were </v>

1477
01:26:39.881 --> 01:26:39.881
<v Speaker 1>in their ears.</v>

1478
01:26:39.881 --> 01:26:42.020
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob had them under the oak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was by a checkup.</v>

1479
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And they journeyed and the terror of God</v>
<v Speaker 1>was upon the cities that were round </v>

1480
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:51.431
<v Speaker 1>roundabout them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they did not pursue after the sons </v>

1481
01:26:51.431 --> 01:26:53.831
<v Speaker 1>of Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Jacob came to laws which is in the </v>

1482
01:26:53.831 --> 01:26:56.861
<v Speaker 1>land of Canaan that is Bethel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the place where he put up the </v>

1483
01:26:56.861 --> 01:27:00.551
<v Speaker 1>pillar to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and all the people that were there </v>

1484
01:27:00.551 --> 01:27:03.131
<v Speaker 1>with him and he built there an altar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the place l Bethel because their </v>

1485
01:27:03.201 --> 01:27:07.700
<v Speaker 1>God appeared to him when he fled from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of his brother and God appeared</v>

1486
01:27:07.701 --> 01:27:09.940
<v Speaker 1>to Jacob again when he came out of pet </v>
<v Speaker 1>dander,</v>

1487
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Ram and blessed him and God sent unto </v>
<v Speaker 1>him [inaudible].</v>

1488
01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.270
<v Speaker 1>My name is Jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thy name shall not be called anymore.</v>

1489
01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Jacob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he remembered means usurper,</v>

1490
01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.050
<v Speaker 1>but Israel shall be thy name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He who wrestles with God</v>

1491
01:27:25.730 --> 01:27:27.990
<v Speaker 1>had he called his name Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God said to him,</v>

1492
01:27:27.991 --> 01:27:32.991
<v Speaker 1>I am God Almighty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be fruitful and multiply a nation and a </v>

1493
01:27:32.991 --> 01:27:35.160
<v Speaker 1>company of Nations shall be of the Kings</v>
<v Speaker 1>shall come out of my loins.</v>

1494
01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:40.700
<v Speaker 1>And the land which I gave Abraham and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaac to the I will give it and device </v>

1495
01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:44.451
<v Speaker 1>seed after the will I give the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God went up from him in the place </v>

1496
01:27:44.451 --> 01:27:45.980
<v Speaker 1>where he talked with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God says,</v>

1497
01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Jacob setup a pillar in the place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he talked with them a pillar of stone </v>

1498
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:53.700
<v Speaker 1>and he poured a drink offering their on </v>
<v Speaker 1>any poured oil they're on.</v>

1499
01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:57.600
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob called the name of the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where God spake with him Bethel.</v>

1500
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:09.440
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's returned to the central place which</v>

1501
01:28:09.441 --> 01:28:14.441
<v Speaker 1>had been given to him as his territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rachel dies in Labor in the process,</v>

1502
01:28:17.031 --> 01:28:20.720
<v Speaker 1>giving birth to an only son of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorrow,</v>

1503
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:24.110
<v Speaker 1>whose name was then changed to Benjamin </v>
<v Speaker 1>son of the right hand.</v>

1504
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Now Ruben.</v>

1505
01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 1>So Simeon and Levi have already done </v>
<v Speaker 1>something unforgivable.</v>

1506
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruben Reuben's term,</v>

1507
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.950
<v Speaker 1>he sleeps with Bill [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's Jacob Israel's concubine.</v>

1508
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:43.460
<v Speaker 1>So he's the third of the sons to make an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unforgivable error.</v>

1509
01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And Jacob Slash Israel gets wind of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Robin is no longer.</v>

1510
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.680
<v Speaker 1>He would have been the premier son given</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the two older sons were put out of </v>

1511
01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.340
<v Speaker 1>the running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to speak,</v>

1512
01:28:55.341 --> 01:28:58.400
<v Speaker 1>because of their disobedience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>

1513
01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:02.860
<v Speaker 1>vengeful cruelty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then rubin can't keep his.</v>

1514
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:05.100
<v Speaker 1>What do they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1515
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:07.820
<v Speaker 1>you get the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems to be something that's still quite</v>

1517
01:29:11.191 --> 01:29:16.191
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we have the story that basically</v>

1518
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>ends with the establishment of the 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes of Israel.</v>

1519
01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:25.350
<v Speaker 1>From Leah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Reuben,</v>

1520
01:29:25.351 --> 01:29:26.250
<v Speaker 1>simeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Levi,</v>

1521
01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Judah is a car and Zebulon from zillow </v>
<v Speaker 1>powders,</v>

1522
01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Gad Asher from Bella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Dan and Naphtali and from </v>

1523
01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:38.661
<v Speaker 1>Rachel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Joseph who figures </v>

1524
01:29:38.661 --> 01:29:39.390
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily importantly in the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>story that we're going to cover,</v>

1525
01:29:39.391 --> 01:29:43.710
<v Speaker 1>which hopefully we'll wrap up genesis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Benjamin,</v>

1526
01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:48.950
<v Speaker 1>and so now Israel itself is established </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then we turn to actually going to</v>

1527
01:29:55.761 --> 01:29:58.430
<v Speaker 1>end this early tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's quite bloody miracle.</v>

1528
01:29:59.030 --> 01:30:04.030
<v Speaker 1>So this story then turns to Joseph and</v>

1529
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:11.770
<v Speaker 1>the story begins essentially now Israel </v>
<v Speaker 1>loved Joseph more than all his children </v>

1530
01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:15.881
<v Speaker 1>because he was the son of his old age </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he made him a coat of many colors </v>

1531
01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:21.340
<v Speaker 1>and so that seems to me to indicate no </v>
<v Speaker 1>coats in dreams very often seems to be </v>

1532
01:30:22.281 --> 01:30:24.350
<v Speaker 1>particularly true of women's dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1533
01:30:24.370 --> 01:30:26.270
<v Speaker 1>that's been my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my clinical observation.</v>

1534
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Clothing footwear in particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolizes a role and that makes sense,</v>

1535
01:30:33.801 --> 01:30:35.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you dress for the role.</v>

1536
01:30:35.210 --> 01:30:38.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big a mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so then you might say,</v>

1537
01:30:38.511 --> 01:30:41.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does a coat of many colors indicate</v>

1538
01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:46.190
<v Speaker 1>and know if you think of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplicity there,</v>

1539
01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.550
<v Speaker 1>it's something like the mastery of </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple domains,</v>

1540
01:30:49.551 --> 01:30:54.551
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or or maybe something like plural </v>

1541
01:30:54.551 --> 01:30:56.441
<v Speaker 1>potentiality and so Jacob is is Israel's</v>
<v Speaker 1>are Joseph is Israel's favorite and </v>

1542
01:30:58.970 --> 01:31:03.970
<v Speaker 1>because he sees in this access </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility and he basically tells his </v>

1543
01:31:04.071 --> 01:31:08.390
<v Speaker 1>other sons that Jacob is going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head son,</v>

1544
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:10.310
<v Speaker 1>which they are not happy with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1545
01:31:10.311 --> 01:31:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Because he's just this young punk </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally these clearly his father's</v>

1546
01:31:14.301 --> 01:31:18.440
<v Speaker 1>favorite and he gets this coat that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of indicative of this higher status</v>

1547
01:31:18.650 --> 01:31:23.650
<v Speaker 1>and so Israel inadvertently sets up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of sibling rivalry in </v>

1548
01:31:26.571 --> 01:31:28.640
<v Speaker 1>the household again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that</v>

1549
01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:35.010
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understructure of the last story in </v>

1550
01:31:35.561 --> 01:31:40.561
<v Speaker 1>genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in the last of this lecture </v>

1551
01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:44.791
<v Speaker 1>series for 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll cover the story of Joseph and his </v>

1552
01:31:46.211 --> 01:31:49.330
<v Speaker 1>coat of many colors and what happens as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of his,</v>

1553
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:53.110
<v Speaker 1>of the favoritism shown to him by his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

1554
01:31:53.530 --> 01:31:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and we'll track what happens as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

1555
01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:02.080
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to stop there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm finished.</v>

1556
01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:02.770
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1557
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:07.690
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>

1558
01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Pearson.</v>

1559
01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an idea I've been wrestling with</v>

1560
01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.060
<v Speaker 2>for quite some time now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1561
01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:20.700
<v Speaker 2>this idea of a lot of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources of wisdom that we've received </v>

1562
01:32:21.450 --> 01:32:26.450
<v Speaker 2>throughout human history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either through text experiences or </v>

1563
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:31.120
<v Speaker 2>scriptures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to always come from people going </v>

1564
01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.441
<v Speaker 2>into isolation and then coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've had a hard time trying to figure</v>

1565
01:32:35.921 --> 01:32:39.850
<v Speaker 2>out from a scientific point of view or </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary point of view,</v>

1566
01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:45.630
<v Speaker 2>what would it compel an organism to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that is centered around it's </v>

1567
01:32:46.421 --> 01:32:51.421
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's behavior centered around surviving </v>

1568
01:32:51.421 --> 01:32:51.880
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for humans as social groups,</v>

1569
01:32:51.881 --> 01:32:56.020
<v Speaker 2>as well as reproducing to want to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into isolation.</v>

1570
01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:01.500
<v Speaker 2>And then not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obtaining some level of information </v>

1571
01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 2>that actually helps the group in coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1572
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:06.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1573
01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:12.020
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this neuroscientist </v>

1574
01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.070
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologist named El Conan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Goldberg,</v>

1575
01:33:15.150 --> 01:33:20.150
<v Speaker 1>and Goldberg was a student of Alexander </v>
<v Speaker 1>Luria and Alexander Luria was a Russian </v>

1576
01:33:20.150 --> 01:33:24.771
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the foremost neuropsychologist </v>

1577
01:33:24.771 --> 01:33:28.510
<v Speaker 1>of the mid to late 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had students soaked in vinegar </v>

1578
01:33:29.521 --> 01:33:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Dova who discovered the orienting </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex.</v>

1579
01:33:33.031 --> 01:33:34.770
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the orienting reflex is the,</v>

1580
01:33:34.771 --> 01:33:37.200
<v Speaker 1>reflects that orients you win something </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous,</v>

1581
01:33:37.201 --> 01:33:41.100
<v Speaker 1>interferes with your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Directed behavior is a major discovery,</v>

1582
01:33:41.190 --> 01:33:46.190
<v Speaker 1>like one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the four or five most important </v>

1583
01:33:46.190 --> 01:33:46.860
<v Speaker 1>discoveries that have ever been made in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1584
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:48.780
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychology,</v>

1585
01:33:48.781 --> 01:33:53.420
<v Speaker 1>I would say certainly in neuroscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lauria was a big deal and he,</v>

1586
01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:58.520
<v Speaker 1>he was the first person who really </v>
<v Speaker 1>established the functional role of the </v>

1587
01:33:58.520 --> 01:33:58.920
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal Cortex as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1588
01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:03.870
<v Speaker 1>and had it very nice overall view of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain functioned.</v>

1589
01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:06.300
<v Speaker 1>His book was written in 1980 and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

1590
01:34:06.630 --> 01:34:08.970
<v Speaker 1>there's still lots in it that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>

1591
01:34:08.971 --> 01:34:11.790
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty strange for a science </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's advanced that quickly.</v>

1592
01:34:12.210 --> 01:34:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Goldberg came from a great pedigree,</v>

1593
01:34:16.230 --> 01:34:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I believe Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his teacher was Pavlov,</v>

1594
01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:23.790
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1595
01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.150
<v Speaker 4>Goldberg,</v>

1596
01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:35.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear some of you may have heard the </v>

1597
01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:38.271
<v Speaker 1>idea that the left hemisphere is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic than the right hemisphere is </v>

1598
01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:44.841
<v Speaker 1>that left hemisphere is specialized for </v>
<v Speaker 1>language and the right hemisphere </v>

1599
01:34:44.841 --> 01:34:47.430
<v Speaker 1>specialized for nonverbal imagistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

1600
01:34:47.730 --> 01:34:52.730
<v Speaker 1>The left hemisphere has a pretty well </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized microstructure and the right </v>

1601
01:34:52.951 --> 01:34:57.951
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere is more diffuse as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's true in lefthanded males in </v>

1602
01:34:59.691 --> 01:35:04.691
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the circuitry can be switched around </v>

1603
01:35:04.691 --> 01:35:04.691
<v Speaker 1>a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay.</v>

1604
01:35:04.691 --> 01:35:07.070
<v Speaker 1>The modules are basically the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they can be moved a little bit,</v>

1605
01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:11.180
<v Speaker 1>but Goldberg thought that it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>language versus non language,</v>

1606
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:16.480
<v Speaker 1>it's routine versus novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the left hemisphere and there's a</v>

1607
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:22.510
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologist physician named Rama </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shaundra who's done some very </v>

1608
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:25.850
<v Speaker 1>interesting work that's pertinent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1609
01:35:25.851 --> 01:35:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll tell you a story about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

1610
01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Goldberg believed that the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere say you have very old systems</v>

1611
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:41.290
<v Speaker 1>underneath boast both cortical </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemispheres that do things like respond </v>

1612
01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:44.720
<v Speaker 1>to anomaly to the thing that doesn't fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Predator in the distance.</v>

1613
01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Some of that's extraordinarily fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be like a snake reflects </v>

1614
01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:54.071
<v Speaker 1>that can move you away from a snake in </v>
<v Speaker 1>less time than it takes the snake to </v>

1615
01:35:54.071 --> 01:35:54.140
<v Speaker 1>bite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really a reflex.</v>

1616
01:35:54.141 --> 01:35:56.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even hit your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really super fast.</v>

1617
01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.540
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a defensive crouch </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1618
01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.110
<v Speaker 1>that's instantiated higher up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system,</v>

1619
01:36:03.111 --> 01:36:08.111
<v Speaker 1>but that's still remarkably fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's fear as an emotion and </v>

1620
01:36:08.111 --> 01:36:12.770
<v Speaker 1>and the orientation of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the cognitive </v>

1621
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:14.420
<v Speaker 1>processing and that all streams out </v>
<v Speaker 1>across a time span,</v>

1622
01:36:14.421 --> 01:36:19.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that time span is half a </v>

1623
01:36:19.421 --> 01:36:19.421
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1624
01:36:19.421 --> 01:36:19.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's really a long time if </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is attacking you.</v>

1625
01:36:19.761 --> 01:36:23.390
<v Speaker 1>So you got those initial responses are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite primitive,</v>

1626
01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.270
<v Speaker 1>but they're extraordinarily fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

1627
01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:31.271
<v Speaker 1>So there's subcortical structures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>orient you towards novelty and prepare </v>

1628
01:36:31.271 --> 01:36:34.580
<v Speaker 1>you for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for freezing or for attending.</v>

1629
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:38.510
<v Speaker 1>And the right hemisphere seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated by those systems.</v>

1630
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.980
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that something threatens</v>

1631
01:36:42.981 --> 01:36:44.540
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Orient towards it.</v>

1632
01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.960
<v Speaker 1>The right hemisphere produces a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>images about what it might be.</v>

1633
01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:51.170
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that's what happens when a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child is afraid of the dark,</v>

1634
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:53.810
<v Speaker 1>the child's on the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of the dark,</v>

1635
01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:56.330
<v Speaker 1>they're crouched because they're frozen </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a prey animal.</v>

1636
01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:00.080
<v Speaker 1>And their right hemisphere is producing </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters to inhabit the,</v>

1637
01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:05.620
<v Speaker 1>the darkness that are the child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses about what might be out </v>

1638
01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.860
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1639
01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what you want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1640
01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:14.800
<v Speaker 1>You want to know what's out there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you want to know what to do about </v>

1641
01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:16.280
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you two kids' dreams that are</v>

1642
01:37:16.281 --> 01:37:20.930
<v Speaker 1>sort of relevant to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when my daughter was about three,</v>

1643
01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:26.140
<v Speaker 1>she came into the bedroom that my wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had and she was crying,</v>

1644
01:37:26.871 --> 01:37:31.871
<v Speaker 1>she'd had a nightmare and she said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>she saw stream and there was garbage all</v>

1645
01:37:32.751 --> 01:37:35.450
<v Speaker 1>over the street and she didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1646
01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And so I sat her down and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1647
01:37:37.071 --> 01:37:40.190
<v Speaker 1>so imagine the stream with the garbage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

1648
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:45.191
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine that you're taking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage out and throwing it in the </v>

1649
01:37:45.191 --> 01:37:47.561
<v Speaker 1>garbage bin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she and I got her to like </v>

1650
01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:49.790
<v Speaker 1>visualize that because that kind of puts</v>
<v Speaker 1>her back in the semi dream state.</v>

1651
01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 1>And then she cleaned up the mess and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then she could go off to sleep.</v>

1652
01:37:53.210 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Now you could tell the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about the dream isn't</v>

1653
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.980
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true because it's not real </v>

1654
01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:03.240
<v Speaker 2>like other day time things are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like it's not real.</v>

1655
01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a dream like a dream is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not the same kind of real.</v>

1656
01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:13.220
<v Speaker 2>And so what I did with her was to </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate to her practically that if she </v>

1657
01:38:14.581 --> 01:38:17.550
<v Speaker 2>saw something anomalous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that was out of place,</v>

1658
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:19.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that was a mess,</v>

1659
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:22.470
<v Speaker 2>that it was within her capacity to set </v>
<v Speaker 2>it right.</v>

1660
01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1661
01:38:24.151 --> 01:38:29.151
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now your right hemisphere tells you </v>

1662
01:38:29.151 --> 01:38:30.960
<v Speaker 2>what monster's might inhabit the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the darkness.</v>

1663
01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Now what you have to do is figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two things you have to figure </v>

1664
01:38:36.650 --> 01:38:38.430
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is what to do about a given monster.</v>

1665
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:44.750
<v Speaker 2>And the other is to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about is to figure out what to do </v>

1666
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:45.150
<v Speaker 2>about the class of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters,</v>

1667
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:48.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole different thing.</v>

1668
01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:53.180
<v Speaker 2>That's something that only human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>are capable of that level of </v>

1669
01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:53.180
<v Speaker 2>abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1670
01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:57.270
<v Speaker 2>And so what you might do about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular monster is hide or go out and</v>

1671
01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:00.630
<v Speaker 2>get rid of it if it was just an actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>

1672
01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:05.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't help because there's </v>

1673
01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:05.660
<v Speaker 2>all the other potential predators that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are still there.</v>

1674
01:39:05.730 --> 01:39:09.500
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe you can go hunt them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't help either because you</v>

1675
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:11.700
<v Speaker 2>can't hunt them all down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not our,</v>

1676
01:39:11.701 --> 01:39:15.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not very likely anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead what you have to do is figure</v>

1677
01:39:15.271 --> 01:39:20.271
<v Speaker 2>out how to configure yourself so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the best possible position to </v>

1678
01:39:20.271 --> 01:39:22.200
<v Speaker 2>fight off the monsters when they come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your best bet.</v>

1679
01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:27.760
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now people are trying to figure this </v>

1680
01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.661
<v Speaker 2>out forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to figure out what's the </v>

1681
01:39:29.661 --> 01:39:32.160
<v Speaker 2>answer to the problem of the class of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all possible monsters.</v>

1682
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Part of that sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are routines.</v>

1683
01:39:36.001 --> 01:39:40.800
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Hinduism with the goddess Kelly,</v>

1684
01:39:40.801 --> 01:39:43.920
<v Speaker 2>you make offerings to Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's this devouring goddess,</v>

1685
01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:46.980
<v Speaker 2>and then she turns into her benevolent </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterpart.</v>

1686
01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:51.240
<v Speaker 2>And so sacrifice is actually one way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can tame the monsters.</v>

1687
01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:56.700
<v Speaker 2>If you think about the monster has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of all negative future </v>

1688
01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:58.500
<v Speaker 2>potentialities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make the proper sacrifices.</v>

1689
01:39:58.501 --> 01:40:03.501
<v Speaker 2>Those monsters stay at bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's heroism as an </v>

1690
01:40:03.501 --> 01:40:06.801
<v Speaker 2>alternative to which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means the act of confrontation of </v>

1691
01:40:06.801 --> 01:40:11.541
<v Speaker 2>the class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all possible monsters and the </v>

1692
01:40:11.541 --> 01:40:11.850
<v Speaker 2>building of yourself up into this sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of courageous person that can do that.</v>

1693
01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:17.420
<v Speaker 2>It took a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation to transform those images,</v>

1694
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:23.750
<v Speaker 2>say of the monsters in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it,</v>

1695
01:40:24.210 --> 01:40:27.530
<v Speaker 2>or to solve the problem of the class of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those monsters.</v>

1696
01:40:27.531 --> 01:40:32.531
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now I'll tell you another child </v>

1697
01:40:32.531 --> 01:40:34.131
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of you have probably heard this </v>

1698
01:40:34.131 --> 01:40:37.131
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's such a great dream that it's </v>

1699
01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:37.131
<v Speaker 2>worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worth telling.</v>

1700
01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:43.730
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that my sister in law's house once </v>

1701
01:40:43.730 --> 01:40:46.050
<v Speaker 2>and her son was running around is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>four very precocious,</v>

1702
01:40:46.051 --> 01:40:47.550
<v Speaker 2>very verbal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very intelligent,</v>

1703
01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:51.180
<v Speaker 2>running around with a night hat on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his sword.</v>

1704
01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:55.210
<v Speaker 2>So he's engaged in this pretty intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>play world.</v>

1705
01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.600
<v Speaker 2>And when he goes to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he puts the night hat on his pillow and </v>

1706
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.691
<v Speaker 2>the sword bias pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time he's having night </v>

1707
01:41:03.691 --> 01:41:08.041
<v Speaker 2>terrors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's waking up and it had been for a </v>

1708
01:41:08.041 --> 01:41:08.041
<v Speaker 2>number of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nate waking up,</v>

1709
01:41:08.041 --> 01:41:10.450
<v Speaker 2>screaming and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't know why.</v>

1710
01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:16.460
<v Speaker 2>There's some things that aren't going so</v>
<v Speaker 2>well in the household and the parents </v>

1711
01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:17.920
<v Speaker 2>get divorced shortly afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1712
01:41:17.921 --> 01:41:18.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1713
01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:21.250
<v Speaker 2>that's what's going on underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1714
01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:26.820
<v Speaker 2>And he's also going to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kindergarten and so he's about to go </v>

1715
01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:27.400
<v Speaker 2>into the world and so he's coping with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1716
01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:28.600
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1717
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:33.990
<v Speaker 2>So I'm watching them zoom around as this</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and thinking that's pretty cool.</v>

1718
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:39.990
<v Speaker 2>And that night he woke up and had a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was screaming and so we're all </v>

1719
01:41:40.301 --> 01:41:43.420
<v Speaker 2>at breakfast the next morning and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1720
01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.290
<v Speaker 2>did you dream anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he got really intense.</v>

1721
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:48.790
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1722
01:41:48.791 --> 01:41:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I had a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1723
01:41:50.921 --> 01:41:51.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the dream?</v>

1724
01:41:51.821 --> 01:41:52.690
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1725
01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:58.080
<v Speaker 2>I was out on this field and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>like dwarfs came up to me.</v>

1726
01:41:59.411 --> 01:42:03.040
<v Speaker 2>They're only about as high as my knees </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't have any arms.</v>

1727
01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:08.550
<v Speaker 2>They have powerful legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were covered with Harry </v>

1728
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:11.770
<v Speaker 2>feathers in Greece and there was cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>carved into the top of their head.</v>

1729
01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:17.040
<v Speaker 2>And they had beaks and whenever he moved</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere they would jump out and with </v>

1730
01:42:17.111 --> 01:42:18.400
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with their beaks.</v>

1731
01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:23.110
<v Speaker 2>And there were lots of them and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just said nothing at breakfast.</v>

1732
01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:27.760
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was right into this story.</v>

1733
01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.350
<v Speaker 2>And so we're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1734
01:42:29.351 --> 01:42:34.351
<v Speaker 2>well that accounts for all the screaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so.</v>

1735
01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:35.870
<v Speaker 2>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1736
01:42:35.871 --> 01:42:40.871
<v Speaker 2>And then in the background there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon and every time the dragon puffed </v>

1737
01:42:40.871 --> 01:42:45.070
<v Speaker 2>out smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would turn into these dwarves.</v>

1738
01:42:45.730 --> 01:42:46.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1739
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:48.310
<v Speaker 2>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you already got a problem there.</v>

1740
01:42:48.311 --> 01:42:53.311
<v Speaker 2>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got beat things that are biting you </v>

1741
01:42:53.311 --> 01:42:53.830
<v Speaker 2>and you can kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's fine.</v>

1742
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:57.400
<v Speaker 2>But then there's the dragon just puffing</v>
<v Speaker 2>out new ones.</v>

1743
01:42:57.401 --> 01:42:59.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a Hydra problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1744
01:42:59.141 --> 01:43:01.180
<v Speaker 2>The old hydro is the serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cut off one head,</v>

1745
01:43:01.181 --> 01:43:03.460
<v Speaker 2>seven more grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good thing.</v>

1746
01:43:03.461 --> 01:43:08.461
<v Speaker 2>And it's such a cool dream because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really portrayed this class of all </v>

1747
01:43:08.531 --> 01:43:13.531
<v Speaker 2>possible monsters problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got the specific monsters and </v>

1748
01:43:13.531 --> 01:43:14.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to get rid of them.</v>

1749
01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.150
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is is that there's a,</v>

1750
01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:22.550
<v Speaker 2>there's something in the background </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just generating monsters like </v>

1751
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I said to him,</v>

1752
01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.660
<v Speaker 2>what do you think you could do about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1753
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:28.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a loaded question,</v>

1754
01:43:28.571 --> 01:43:33.571
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like leading the witness in a </v>

1755
01:43:33.571 --> 01:43:35.461
<v Speaker 2>trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to ask a question like </v>

1756
01:43:35.461 --> 01:43:36.280
<v Speaker 2>that because it implies that it implies </v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer.</v>

1757
01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:41.490
<v Speaker 2>What could you do about that is not any </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than saying you could do </v>

1758
01:43:41.490 --> 01:43:43.180
<v Speaker 2>something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1759
01:43:43.181 --> 01:43:44.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1760
01:43:44.590 --> 01:43:48.610
<v Speaker 2>I hinted at that as a possibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his eyes lit up.</v>

1761
01:43:48.670 --> 01:43:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Now you remember he's already running </v>
<v Speaker 2>around as at night.</v>

1762
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we kind of already knew what to do </v>

1763
01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:56.690
<v Speaker 2>because he had the whole sword in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hat and with that,</v>

1764
01:43:56.691 --> 01:43:58.610
<v Speaker 2>you know that you can go after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon.</v>

1765
01:43:58.611 --> 01:44:03.611
<v Speaker 2>He kinda got that and he said I'd get my</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad and then I jump up on top of the </v>

1766
01:44:05.331 --> 01:44:10.331
<v Speaker 2>dragon and I poke out both of its eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my sword and then it go right down </v>

1767
01:44:10.331 --> 01:44:14.900
<v Speaker 2>its throat to the firebox where the fire</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out and I carve out a piece of the</v>

1768
01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:15.650
<v Speaker 2>firebox.</v>

1769
01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:19.910
<v Speaker 2>And then I'd use that as a shield and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought yes,</v>

1770
01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:23.720
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1771
01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Man is so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1772
01:44:26.601 --> 01:44:30.080
<v Speaker 2>because he got the thing instantly he </v>
<v Speaker 2>knew that he knew.</v>

1773
01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:31.790
<v Speaker 2>So imagine first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought,</v>

1774
01:44:31.791 --> 01:44:36.791
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go to the heart of the </v>

1775
01:44:36.791 --> 01:44:36.791
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1776
01:44:36.791 --> 01:44:36.791
<v Speaker 2>And really to the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to the dragon,</v>

1777
01:44:36.791 --> 01:44:41.770
<v Speaker 2>but right down the damn things gullet </v>
<v Speaker 2>right to the place where the fire was </v>

1778
01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:46.061
<v Speaker 2>actually being was actually being </v>
<v Speaker 2>created because there was there you </v>

1779
01:44:46.061 --> 01:44:49.460
<v Speaker 2>could find the shield and that he'd take</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing that was fireproof and make a</v>

1780
01:44:49.461 --> 01:44:53.690
<v Speaker 2>shield out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was just get bloody perfect.</v>

1781
01:44:53.691 --> 01:44:55.340
<v Speaker 2>It was so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

1782
01:44:55.341 --> 01:44:58.700
<v Speaker 2>well how could a kid come up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a bunch of answers.</v>

1783
01:44:58.701 --> 01:45:01.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is we know snake fear is innate.</v>

1784
01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:03.720
<v Speaker 2>We knew that now there's been recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>research data that,</v>

1785
01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:04.360
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1786
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:06.590
<v Speaker 2>that has demonstrated that okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1787
01:45:06.970 --> 01:45:11.970
<v Speaker 2>And we've been preyed on and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators for a very long period of </v>

1788
01:45:11.970 --> 01:45:12.230
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that,</v>

1789
01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:17.650
<v Speaker 2>and I found something else interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the brain out out about the brain </v>

1790
01:45:17.650 --> 01:45:22.151
<v Speaker 2>recently too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Book I was reading by Ray Kurtzweil </v>

1791
01:45:22.151 --> 01:45:22.280
<v Speaker 2>called how to build a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it was called.</v>

1792
01:45:22.281 --> 01:45:26.810
<v Speaker 2>It was quite a good book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was in that book or it was</v>

1793
01:45:26.811 --> 01:45:29.090
<v Speaker 2>in the neuroscience paper I was reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter,</v>

1794
01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:33.950
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of those two places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know that scanning technology has</v>

1795
01:45:33.951 --> 01:45:36.500
<v Speaker 2>got more and more high resolution over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last few years.</v>

1796
01:45:36.501 --> 01:45:41.501
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just gets more and more high </v>

1797
01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:42.701
<v Speaker 2>resolution all the time and so people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are now able to look at the micro </v>

1798
01:45:42.701 --> 01:45:45.110
<v Speaker 2>structures of the brain in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't been possible before.</v>

1799
01:45:45.111 --> 01:45:50.111
<v Speaker 2>And so the old idea with the cortex </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically was the cortex was full of a </v>

1800
01:45:50.111 --> 01:45:54.581
<v Speaker 2>bunch of neurons and then when one </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuron and another fired at the same </v>

1801
01:45:54.581 --> 01:45:56.170
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would wire together and that's kind</v>

1802
01:45:56.171 --> 01:45:58.250
<v Speaker 2>of how your brain learns to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections.</v>

1803
01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:01.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit more complicated than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that will do.</v>

1804
01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:06.340
<v Speaker 2>And then it was found that it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite that simple because what your </v>

1805
01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:10.670
<v Speaker 2>cortex is made out of are these columns </v>
<v Speaker 2>of neurons that are duplicated,</v>

1806
01:46:10.671 --> 01:46:13.130
<v Speaker 2>sorta like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a centipedes legs,</v>

1807
01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:16.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very simple genetic code data,</v>

1808
01:46:16.110 --> 01:46:21.110
<v Speaker 2>another leg set of legs to ascend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pete is sort of like that with your </v>

1809
01:46:21.110 --> 01:46:24.581
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's made out of all these columns and </v>

1810
01:46:24.581 --> 01:46:25.070
<v Speaker 2>the columns are basically already quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>wired up.</v>

1811
01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:28.160
<v Speaker 2>And then as you learn the columns wired </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1812
01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's some preexisting structure </v>

1813
01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:33.580
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's more preexistent structure.</v>

1814
01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Then that was thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1815
01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:40.560
<v Speaker 2>it's basically that there are already </v>
<v Speaker 2>tracked that link columns together that </v>

1816
01:46:41.721 --> 01:46:44.690
<v Speaker 2>are in different parts of the brain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the columns,</v>

1817
01:46:45.170 --> 01:46:50.170
<v Speaker 2>the columns themselves can send out </v>
<v Speaker 2>invites to these highways which are </v>

1818
01:46:51.001 --> 01:46:56.001
<v Speaker 2>already there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the super highway is there and </v>

1819
01:46:56.001 --> 01:46:57.870
<v Speaker 2>then it can generate connections to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>columns at the end of the super highway.</v>

1820
01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:02.870
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of cortical structure </v>

1821
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:04.410
<v Speaker 2>already in place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's plasticity around that.</v>

1822
01:47:04.411 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And when I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1823
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:07.140
<v Speaker 2>well that's part of the source of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypes.</v>

1824
01:47:07.141 --> 01:47:12.141
<v Speaker 2>There's already an archetypal structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that as well as the subcortical </v>

1825
01:47:12.141 --> 01:47:15.771
<v Speaker 2>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could say that like the kid </v>

1826
01:47:15.771 --> 01:47:18.831
<v Speaker 2>already had within him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only the capacity to represent not </v>

1827
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:24.411
<v Speaker 2>only the monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the class of all possible monsters </v>

1828
01:47:24.411 --> 01:47:24.900
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that the problem wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>

1829
01:47:24.930 --> 01:47:27.960
<v Speaker 2>The problem was that monsters could </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually be generated,</v>

1830
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:33.350
<v Speaker 2>which is way worse problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the answer to that isn't to </v>

1831
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:36.471
<v Speaker 2>kill an individual monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer to that is go to the source </v>

1832
01:47:36.471 --> 01:47:39.861
<v Speaker 2>of the monstrous itself and defeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's absolutely staggering and you </v>

1833
01:47:40.231 --> 01:47:45.231
<v Speaker 2>could imagine that it would take a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of meditative effort </v>

1834
01:47:45.231 --> 01:47:49.040
<v Speaker 2>for people to have come up with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution over a very long period of </v>

1835
01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:49.040
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1836
01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:53.360
<v Speaker 2>So now the point of the representation </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to formulate a picture of what it is </v>

1837
01:47:55.441 --> 01:48:00.441
<v Speaker 2>that's the threat so that you can then </v>
<v Speaker 2>formulate a general purpose solution.</v>

1838
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this image of Kelly which</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really like because Kelly is sort of </v>

1839
01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:07.860
<v Speaker 2>the goddess of the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1840
01:48:07.861 --> 01:48:09.570
<v Speaker 2>and destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Kelly is.</v>

1841
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:15.950
<v Speaker 2>She has a headdress of fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her hair is on fire and she has a </v>

1842
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:19.671
<v Speaker 2>headdress of skulls and she has hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut off all around her neck and she has </v>

1843
01:48:19.671 --> 01:48:24.021
<v Speaker 2>a belt that's often snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's sometimes she sometimes eating </v>

1844
01:48:24.021 --> 01:48:28.431
<v Speaker 2>the intestines of this guy that she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just given birth to and that she's </v>

1845
01:48:28.431 --> 01:48:31.560
<v Speaker 2>sitting on and she has eight legs like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spider and she's in a web of fire and so</v>

1846
01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:36.740
<v Speaker 2>she's a monster in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents everything that might terrify</v>

1847
01:48:37.201 --> 01:48:39.270
<v Speaker 2>and devour you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question is,</v>

1848
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:44.390
<v Speaker 2>so you come up with that representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has an image to represent the class of </v>

1849
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:48.621
<v Speaker 2>all terrifying things and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to generate a solution in the face of </v>

1850
01:48:48.621 --> 01:48:48.750
<v Speaker 2>that class.</v>

1851
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:53.870
<v Speaker 2>And sacrifice is one of the solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that heroic encounter is another one</v>

1852
01:48:53.971 --> 01:48:57.180
<v Speaker 2>of the solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the one that he catalyzed.</v>

1853
01:48:57.210 --> 01:48:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd been read lots of books.</v>

1854
01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:01.950
<v Speaker 2>He'd watched lots of Disney movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1855
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:05.730
<v Speaker 2>and he'd seen the heroic pattern </v>
<v Speaker 2>portrayed many,</v>

1856
01:49:05.731 --> 01:49:10.731
<v Speaker 2>many places and his little brain was </v>
<v Speaker 2>working like mad to extract out the </v>

1857
01:49:10.861 --> 01:49:14.730
<v Speaker 2>essence of that and who embody it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I asked them that question,</v>

1858
01:49:14.731 --> 01:49:19.731
<v Speaker 2>it just went snap and all those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>lined up and his night terrors went </v>

1859
01:49:19.731 --> 01:49:21.330
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

1860
01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:24.540
<v Speaker 2>And I followed up with his mum because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really quite remarkable,</v>

1861
01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:27.040
<v Speaker 2>the whole set of occurrences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1862
01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:32.080
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't have night terrors that </v>
<v Speaker 2>night even though he'd been having the </v>

1863
01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.090
<v Speaker 2>nightly and that was the end of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he solved his problem.</v>

1864
01:49:33.250 --> 01:49:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Like he needed to be the courageous </v>
<v Speaker 2>night that went after the dragon.</v>

1865
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And so that is what people need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think when we go into solitude,</v>

1866
01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:52.080
<v Speaker 2>we shut off the external stimulation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we let the dreaming part of our mind </v>

1867
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:57.390
<v Speaker 2>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's this nonverbal pattern </v>

1868
01:49:57.390 --> 01:50:00.220
<v Speaker 2>detector that thinks in images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1869
01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:05.970
<v Speaker 2>it's the thing that mediates between </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we don't understand and what we do </v>

1870
01:50:05.970 --> 01:50:06.760
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you understand it completely,</v>

1871
01:50:06.761 --> 01:50:10.120
<v Speaker 2>you can say it and you can act it out if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand it.</v>

1872
01:50:10.121 --> 01:50:12.620
<v Speaker 2>You represented in images and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1873
01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:15.100
<v Speaker 2>it's the emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fear,</v>

1874
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:17.410
<v Speaker 2>withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paralysis.</v>

1875
01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 2>And then that manifests itself in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>image of what that might be.</v>

1876
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:26.760
<v Speaker 2>And that image is the basis for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story and it's the basis for further </v>

1877
01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:30.451
<v Speaker 2>development of the idea and to go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation is to let those images emerge </v>

1878
01:50:30.851 --> 01:50:33.880
<v Speaker 2>and to dream a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that moves you,</v>

1879
01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:37.730
<v Speaker 2>that moves you ahead into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to use your</v>

1880
01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:42.980
<v Speaker 1>which they used before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough just to map out the </v>

1881
01:50:43.051 --> 01:50:48.051
<v Speaker 1>danger that is imminent in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the potential dangers that you </v>

1882
01:50:48.051 --> 01:50:49.260
<v Speaker 1>could come up with an abstract form.</v>

1883
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well remember what happens when God </v>

1884
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:57.110
<v Speaker 2>throws Adam and Eve out of out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>paradise,</v>

1885
01:50:57.410 --> 01:50:59.480
<v Speaker 2>they become aware that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>

1886
01:50:59.481 --> 01:51:02.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The future becomes a problem because you</v>

1887
01:51:02.871 --> 01:51:05.780
<v Speaker 2>could say the future is the place of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential monsters.</v>

1888
01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so just the monster that you have </v>

1889
01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:11.440
<v Speaker 2>right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1890
01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:11.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you get rid of that,</v>

1891
01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.350
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't solve your problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it?</v>

1892
01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:16.340
<v Speaker 2>The problem is how do you exist in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>world full of monsters?</v>

1893
01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:19.910
<v Speaker 2>And part of that answer is why you </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a monster yourself.</v>

1894
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:24.680
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an incomplete answer because if</v>

1895
01:51:24.681 --> 01:51:27.560
<v Speaker 2>you're just a monster then you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>as bad as the monsters,</v>

1896
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:32.890
<v Speaker 2>so you have to transfer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a monstrous enough to </v>

1897
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:33.950
<v Speaker 2>contend with the monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have to be civilized enough</v>

1898
01:51:33.951 --> 01:51:38.951
<v Speaker 2>so that you're not a monster yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's more or less equivalent to </v>

1899
01:51:38.951 --> 01:51:40.460
<v Speaker 2>the union inter integration of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shadow.</v>

1900
01:51:41.150 --> 01:51:43.050
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1901
01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:49.430
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1902
01:51:51.930 --> 01:51:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson.</v>

1903
01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I've been wanting to ask you this for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile now since I started watching your</v>

1904
01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:02.060
<v Speaker 1>lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After I started reading and Nietzsche's </v>

1905
01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:05.630
<v Speaker 1>beyond good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came upon a paragraph in his chapter </v>

1906
01:52:06.361 --> 01:52:11.361
<v Speaker 1>on scholars that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bothered me and it's actually </v>

1907
01:52:11.361 --> 01:52:11.361
<v Speaker 1>bothers me to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1908
01:52:11.361 --> 01:52:13.230
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talked about this kind of person,</v>

1909
01:52:13.231 --> 01:52:16.740
<v Speaker 1>like they were just a mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they stretched,</v>

1910
01:52:16.741 --> 01:52:21.741
<v Speaker 1>he said every part of their skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically to allow every new piece of </v>

1911
01:52:21.741 --> 01:52:25.791
<v Speaker 1>information that they took on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all they ever were was just an </v>

1912
01:52:25.791 --> 01:52:30.141
<v Speaker 1>instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just a mirror on reflecting </v>

1913
01:52:30.141 --> 01:52:31.260
<v Speaker 1>what they had learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never actually having generated anything</v>

1914
01:52:31.261 --> 01:52:34.050
<v Speaker 1>on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's bothered me because I feel like</v>

1915
01:52:34.051 --> 01:52:36.230
<v Speaker 1>in a way it sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1916
01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:41.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impacted my identity a lot because </v>

1917
01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:43.731
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you supposed to create </v>

1918
01:52:43.731 --> 01:52:43.731
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1919
01:52:43.731 --> 01:52:43.731
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1920
01:52:43.731 --> 01:52:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's okay that,</v>

1921
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:45.920
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1922
01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:49.430
<v Speaker 1>nature is often clashed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialists right?</v>

1923
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:51.890
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the tenants of </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential,</v>

1924
01:52:51.891 --> 01:52:56.891
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two real tenants of </v>

1925
01:52:56.891 --> 01:52:56.891
<v Speaker 1>existentialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more,</v>

1926
01:52:56.891 --> 01:53:00.320
<v Speaker 1>but obviously we're oversimplifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one is that life is a problem.</v>

1927
01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:03.050
<v Speaker 1>It isn't because there's something wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

1928
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:08.910
<v Speaker 1>it's that life is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's often contrasted with the </v>

1929
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Friday and view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you have a problem,</v>

1930
01:53:10.701 --> 01:53:13.730
<v Speaker 1>it's because something went wrong during</v>
<v Speaker 1>your development.</v>

1931
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:15.290
<v Speaker 1>The existentialist said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1932
01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:18.350
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like life is a problem.</v>

1933
01:53:18.351 --> 01:53:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that</v>

1934
01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:34.570
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scholarship is in some sense to solve </v>

1935
01:53:35.151 --> 01:53:38.630
<v Speaker 1>that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for Nisha,</v>

1936
01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.210
<v Speaker 1>like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all truths are bloody truth to me.</v>

1937
01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:46.780
<v Speaker 1>And what he meant by that was that if an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea didn't incarnate itself in you and </v>

1938
01:53:47.781 --> 01:53:50.240
<v Speaker 1>transform your perceptions and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>

1939
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:52.550
<v Speaker 1>then you were merely possessed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1940
01:53:52.551 --> 01:53:54.980
<v Speaker 1>You're merely a spokesperson for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1941
01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say that the idea possessed</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1942
01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:00.980
<v Speaker 1>You're a puppet for the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not you,</v>

1943
01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:06.640
<v Speaker 1>it's the idea is in you and it has you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't taken the idea and </v>

1944
01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:08.570
<v Speaker 1>incorporated with you and made it part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>

1945
01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:12.080
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a romanticism that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with that,</v>

1946
01:54:12.081 --> 01:54:13.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the passionate scholar.</v>

1947
01:54:13.761 --> 01:54:16.370
<v Speaker 1>The person for whom ideas are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely,</v>

1948
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:23.430
<v Speaker 1>they're not merely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call abstracted </v>

1949
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:26.940
<v Speaker 1>representations that can be tossed about</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if they're commodities.</v>

1950
01:54:28.150 --> 01:54:29.020
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1951
01:54:29.190 --> 01:54:31.330
<v Speaker 1>they're more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more like personalities.</v>

1952
01:54:31.331 --> 01:54:33.280
<v Speaker 1>That might be another way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1953
01:54:33.730 --> 01:54:37.130
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1954
01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:41.650
<v Speaker 1>if those ideas are compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't like.</v>

1955
01:54:41.651 --> 01:54:45.610
<v Speaker 1>One thing I learned along time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is probably relevant.</v>

1956
01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I know when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked to argue and I like to win </v>

1957
01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:51.360
<v Speaker 1>arguments or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1958
01:54:51.450 --> 01:54:56.450
<v Speaker 1>or lose them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I liked winning them a lot </v>

1959
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:58.501
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't really mind so much what </v>

1960
01:54:58.501 --> 01:54:59.080
<v Speaker 1>the content of the argument was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1961
01:54:59.090 --> 01:55:04.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could engage in it like a sparring </v>

1962
01:55:04.090 --> 01:55:05.170
<v Speaker 1>match and it was in some sense to </v>
<v Speaker 1>establish dominance,</v>

1963
01:55:05.171 --> 01:55:06.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To establish intellectual dominance.</v>

1964
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I quit doing that when I was in my mid </v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties because I thought that that was</v>

1965
01:55:12.971 --> 01:55:15.160
<v Speaker 1>too shallow and approach to the ideas.</v>

1966
01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:20.500
<v Speaker 1>They're not commodities of that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>

1967
01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:24.010
<v Speaker 1>they have tendrils that reached down </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the living.</v>

1968
01:55:24.011 --> 01:55:26.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so niches,</v>

1969
01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:29.230
<v Speaker 1>criticism of scholars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did this a lot,</v>

1970
01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:32.380
<v Speaker 1>was that they were bloodless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1971
01:55:32.381 --> 01:55:37.381
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were full of performative </v>

1972
01:55:37.381 --> 01:55:37.381
<v Speaker 1>contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about,</v>

1973
01:55:37.381 --> 01:55:42.060
<v Speaker 1>they'd say one thing and do another </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their intellect was completely </v>

1974
01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:42.940
<v Speaker 1>dissociated from their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their actions.</v>

1975
01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.700
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1976
01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:49.820
<v Speaker 1>he thought that was a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a good </v>

1977
01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.690
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is a bad idea.</v>

1978
01:55:51.691 --> 01:55:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I also think it makes for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily boring lecturer,</v>

1979
01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can tell if you're listening</v>

1980
01:55:57.151 --> 01:56:02.151
<v Speaker 1>to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the ideas that you're hearing </v>

1981
01:56:02.151 --> 01:56:03.510
<v Speaker 1>are merely being passed through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person as if they're being memorized,</v>

1982
01:56:03.511 --> 01:56:08.511
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether they're part of the dynamic </v>

1983
01:56:08.511 --> 01:56:10.650
<v Speaker 1>core of the person and if they're part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dynamic core of the person,</v>

1984
01:56:10.651 --> 01:56:15.651
<v Speaker 1>then they're almost always engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 1>gripping and so he wasn't a fan of </v>

1985
01:56:15.651 --> 01:56:19.020
<v Speaker 1>bloodless scholars and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct because one of the things that I</v>

1986
01:56:19.021 --> 01:56:19.500
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1987
01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:26.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good idea to have ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>possess you unless you know what the </v>

1988
01:56:26.531 --> 01:56:31.531
<v Speaker 1>ideas are up to and lots of people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by ideas rather than </v>

1989
01:56:31.631 --> 01:56:32.530
<v Speaker 1>possessing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

1990
01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:36.250
<v Speaker 1>What that means is they haven't taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas and integrated them into their</v>

1991
01:56:36.251 --> 01:56:38.260
<v Speaker 1>own being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't.</v>

1992
01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:43.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like an incarnation in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have an incarnated the ideas in </v>

1993
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:48.300
<v Speaker 1>embodied form and so they're incomplete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1994
01:56:48.490 --> 01:56:53.490
<v Speaker 1>nature also in thus spake Zarathustra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When zero booster comes down the </v>

1995
01:56:53.490 --> 01:56:57.451
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sees a bunch of people gathered </v>

1996
01:56:57.451 --> 01:56:59.881
<v Speaker 1>around a famous individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe a scholar but doesn't </v>

1997
01:56:59.881 --> 01:57:01.590
<v Speaker 1>really matter and when zero theaster </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes and looks at the person,</v>

1998
01:57:01.591 --> 01:57:06.591
<v Speaker 1>only sees his little tiny midget with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic ear and so he's a hyper </v>

1999
01:57:06.591 --> 01:57:07.180
<v Speaker 1>specialist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2000
01:57:07.450 --> 01:57:12.450
<v Speaker 1>And so he has a pretty impressive ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's only this big and that was </v>

2001
01:57:12.450 --> 01:57:12.730
<v Speaker 1>niches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>

2002
01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:17.200
<v Speaker 1>stick commentary on the danger of hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialization and also on the danger of</v>

2003
01:57:17.201 --> 01:57:22.030
<v Speaker 1>adulation for hyper specialization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he thought about it as a kind of</v>

2004
01:57:22.031 --> 01:57:25.150
<v Speaker 1>deformity now nature was a pretty harsh </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

2005
01:57:25.151 --> 01:57:30.151
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did address the issue of the </v>

2006
01:57:30.731 --> 01:57:35.731
<v Speaker 1>relationship between intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and an action because for </v>

2007
01:57:35.731 --> 01:57:39.430
<v Speaker 1>nature those things are not to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated in some sense.</v>

2008
01:57:40.090 --> 01:57:42.430
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe,</v>

2009
01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it bothered you.</v>

2010
01:57:46.450 --> 01:57:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Like it's hard to say why it bothered </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2011
01:57:47.921 --> 01:57:52.240
<v Speaker 1>It might have bothered you because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of undermine the idea of scholar.</v>

2012
01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:57.480
<v Speaker 1>But the other possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't an accusation because </v>

2013
01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:57.480
<v Speaker 1>obviously I don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2014
01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:59.350
<v Speaker 1>but it might also be that it struck a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chord,</v>

2015
01:57:59.351 --> 01:58:04.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that maybe you were doubtful or </v>

2016
01:58:04.351 --> 01:58:07.501
<v Speaker 1>questioning how tightly associated your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual endeavor was with your </v>

2017
01:58:11.591 --> 01:58:16.180
<v Speaker 1>actual character and your practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another possibility.</v>

2018
01:58:16.181 --> 01:58:21.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good thing to think </v>

2019
01:58:21.181 --> 01:58:21.640
<v Speaker 1>about because generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that integration is very much lacking.</v>

2020
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:27.030
<v Speaker 1>People are a lot smarter and fluid with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ideas that they are ethical and </v>

2021
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:30.670
<v Speaker 1>consistent and characterized by </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity.</v>

2022
01:58:31.150 --> 01:58:31.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2023
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:43.760
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2024
01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:48.780
<v Speaker 5>so last week you talked about how you </v>
<v Speaker 5>hated people asking you if you believe </v>

2025
01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:50.140
<v Speaker 5>in God or do you believe miracles are </v>
<v Speaker 5>you disliked those questions,</v>

2026
01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:52.870
<v Speaker 5>leds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you also talked about how,</v>

2027
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:58.000
<v Speaker 5>and I want to put words in your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think he said something about the </v>

2028
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.571
<v Speaker 5>idea of an empirical evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious experiences or spiritual </v>

2029
01:59:00.571 --> 01:59:04.531
<v Speaker 5>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I wonder how those two ideas can a </v>

2030
01:59:04.531 --> 01:59:08.280
<v Speaker 5>spiritual existence or can a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience exists without God or how did</v>

2031
01:59:08.281 --> 01:59:09.440
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had trouble reading.</v>

2032
01:59:09.630 --> 01:59:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2033
01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:13.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>

2034
01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could.</v>

2035
01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:18.420
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept as proof.</v>

2036
01:59:18.421 --> 01:59:21.270
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's where things get </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricky,</v>

2037
01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have to demonstrate the existence</v>

2038
01:59:24.331 --> 01:59:29.331
<v Speaker 1>of God objectively than subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences of the transcendent are </v>

2039
01:59:29.331 --> 01:59:30.540
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2040
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:35.870
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a perfectly reasonable </v>

2041
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:38.751
<v Speaker 1>standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your initial presupposition is the </v>

2042
01:59:38.751 --> 01:59:41.931
<v Speaker 1>only thing that has actual existence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things that can be demonstrated </v>

2043
01:59:41.931 --> 01:59:43.230
<v Speaker 1>objectively and I'm not putting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

2044
01:59:43.231 --> 01:59:47.880
<v Speaker 1>like that's a powerful methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our technology is basically dependent on</v>

2045
01:59:48.090 --> 01:59:53.090
<v Speaker 1>the acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least a partial acceptance of those </v>

2046
01:59:53.090 --> 01:59:56.001
<v Speaker 1>axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that it's difficult for</v>

2047
01:59:56.221 --> 02:00:01.221
<v Speaker 1>me to deny the existence of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of thinking that seemed to </v>

2048
02:00:02.101 --> 02:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>exist cross culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the existence of the representation</v>

2049
02:00:06.271 --> 02:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>of the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

2050
02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Especially given that I can see an </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary rationale for the emergence</v>

2051
02:00:12.661 --> 02:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>of these representations.</v>

2052
02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:19.880
<v Speaker 1>So and then there's also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>indisputable fact that religious </v>

2053
02:00:20.371 --> 02:00:25.371
<v Speaker 1>experiences are accessible to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a number of different avenues.</v>

2054
02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Now and one of the things I mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I discussed this before as well,</v>

2055
02:00:31.111 --> 02:00:36.111
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well those are no different than </v>

2056
02:00:36.111 --> 02:00:39.020
<v Speaker 1>experiences of psychopathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are different because the </v>

2057
02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>experiences of psychopathology damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2058
02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the evidence is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent experiences actually help </v>

2059
02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless you can,</v>

2060
02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>unless you're willing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2061
02:00:48.721 --> 02:00:53.721
<v Speaker 1>there are some forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathological experience that </v>

2062
02:00:53.721 --> 02:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>actually facilitate health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a possibility,</v>

2063
02:00:55.261 --> 02:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're.</v>

2064
02:00:56.730 --> 02:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>You're pushing your hypo yearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

2065
02:00:59.011 --> 02:00:59.670
<v Speaker 1>At that point.</v>

2066
02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:02.760
<v Speaker 5>Would it hurt to define what a religious</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience is in this case?</v>

2067
02:01:02.761 --> 02:01:04.920
<v Speaker 5>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I feel like the semantics,</v>

2068
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:06.720
<v Speaker 5>like I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure if what you're saying about</v>

2069
02:01:06.721 --> 02:01:09.270
<v Speaker 5>a religious experience is what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding.</v>

2070
02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally a religious experiences,</v>

2071
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>something like an experience of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the renewal of the world.</v>

2072
02:01:17.001 --> 02:01:22.001
<v Speaker 1>That might be one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it so that everything sort of leaps </v>

2073
02:01:22.001 --> 02:01:25.871
<v Speaker 1>forward as crystal clean and perfect as </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had been viewing it from behind a</v>

2074
02:01:26.541 --> 02:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>mask before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another would be a sense of the Union of</v>

2075
02:01:31.191 --> 02:01:36.191
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're a singular being and </v>

2076
02:01:36.191 --> 02:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>you're isolated and in religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

2077
02:01:36.681 --> 02:01:41.681
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a book written recently by a </v>

2078
02:01:41.681 --> 02:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my stroke of,</v>

2079
02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My stroke of insight.</v>

2080
02:01:47.451 --> 02:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2081
02:01:48.201 --> 02:01:51.650
<v Speaker 1>And I believe she had a left hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke,</v>

2082
02:01:51.651 --> 02:01:56.651
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was sufficiently well developed </v>

2083
02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists to understand what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening as she had the stroke and,</v>

2084
02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>and she had intense religious experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of that and she </v>

2085
02:02:08.661 --> 02:02:13.661
<v Speaker 1>experienced it as a dissolution of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ego into this state of union with </v>

2086
02:02:13.661 --> 02:02:17.000
<v Speaker 1>everything and this transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of law and,</v>

2087
02:02:17.210 --> 02:02:18.320
<v Speaker 1>and the open.</v>

2088
02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the rest of it.</v>

2089
02:02:20.241 --> 02:02:25.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are other elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious experience that are quite </v>

2090
02:02:25.241 --> 02:02:25.241
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the opening of the heavens,</v>

2091
02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The communion with the ancestors,</v>

2092
02:02:28.011 --> 02:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reduction of the body to a skeleton,</v>

2093
02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:35.350
<v Speaker 1>that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movement up into heaven there.</v>

2094
02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:39.170
<v Speaker 1>These are well documented phenomena and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of them are associated,</v>

2095
02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>well a fair number of them are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with psychedelic use,</v>

2096
02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the only avenue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences like that.</v>

2097
02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>And epilepsy can produce experiences </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that too.</v>

2098
02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>And people usually report near death </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

2099
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2100
02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:57.820
<v Speaker 1>people usually report that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences have life altering </v>

2101
02:02:57.820 --> 02:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2102
02:02:58.850 --> 02:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>that in and of itself only proves that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are capable of having subjective </v>

2103
02:03:03.861 --> 02:03:05.540
<v Speaker 1>religious experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2104
02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't definitively prove that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's anything outside of that.</v>

2105
02:03:10.610 --> 02:03:12.470
<v Speaker 1>So Young Carl Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2106
02:03:12.471 --> 02:03:14.870
<v Speaker 1>most of the time he didn't talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2107
02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>he talked about the God image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same thing because you </v>

2108
02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:24.020
<v Speaker 1>could have a god image that was even </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily instantiated without that</v>

2109
02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:29.021
<v Speaker 1>necessarily being related to any </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent being beyond the image.</v>

2110
02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows,</v>

2111
02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:34.920
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2112
02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it depends on what you're </v>

2113
02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:41.330
<v Speaker 1>willing to accept as proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the proof,</v>

2114
02:03:41.530 --> 02:03:46.530
<v Speaker 1>the is beyond question that people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have life changing religious </v>

2115
02:03:46.791 --> 02:03:50.420
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example of that is that the best</v>

2116
02:03:50.421 --> 02:03:52.760
<v Speaker 1>treatment for alcoholism is religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversion.</v>

2117
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:58.390
<v Speaker 1>It's well documented in the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I studied alcoholism for a long </v>

2118
02:03:58.390 --> 02:04:01.601
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the cures that sticks is </v>

2119
02:04:01.601 --> 02:04:05.681
<v Speaker 1>religious conversion and the 12 step </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs essentially attempt to </v>

2120
02:04:05.681 --> 02:04:09.161
<v Speaker 1>instantiate religious conversion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to document their success </v>

2121
02:04:09.161 --> 02:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>because they succeed for the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick with it.</v>

2122
02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:14.840
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a very good measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2123
02:04:14.841 --> 02:04:18.680
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of self evident that they work</v>

2124
02:04:18.681 --> 02:04:23.681
<v Speaker 1>for the people who stick with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not cynical about about alcoholics </v>

2125
02:04:23.681 --> 02:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>anonymous or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have good data on,</v>

2126
02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:29.900
<v Speaker 1>on outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is good data showing that </v>

2127
02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:32.480
<v Speaker 1>religious transformation is a good cure </v>
<v Speaker 1>for alcoholism.</v>

2128
02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an interesting phenomena to </v>

2129
02:04:38.110 --> 02:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2130
02:04:42.090 --> 02:04:43.910
<v Speaker 2>it's too complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably can't.</v>

2131
02:04:47.050 --> 02:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try.</v>

2132
02:04:47.711 --> 02:04:52.711
<v Speaker 2>I'll try this for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's how I think religious </v>

2133
02:04:52.711 --> 02:04:55.321
<v Speaker 2>conversion might work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine you've got the left </v>

2134
02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:57.490
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere and it's the place where your</v>
<v Speaker 2>habitual interpretations reside.</v>

2135
02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:01.270
<v Speaker 2>So I can give you a quick example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2136
02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:05.660
<v Speaker 2>So this Guy Ramachandran who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a neurophysiologist,</v>

2137
02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:08.620
<v Speaker 2>I think that's his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his field of study.</v>

2138
02:05:09.070 --> 02:05:12.910
<v Speaker 2>I think he's at Ucla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He studied people who had neglect.</v>

2139
02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Neglect is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bizarre phenomena.</v>

2140
02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:19.360
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a stroke that damages </v>
<v Speaker 2>your right parietal lobe,</v>

2141
02:05:19.810 --> 02:05:23.830
<v Speaker 2>you'll lose the left part of your being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just your body.</v>

2142
02:05:23.831 --> 02:05:25.270
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like.</v>

2143
02:05:25.330 --> 02:05:30.330
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a right parietal stroke and </v>

2144
02:05:30.330 --> 02:05:32.140
<v Speaker 2>you look at a clock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only see you only,</v>

2145
02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:37.170
<v Speaker 2>only half the clock exists for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you only see half the </v>

2146
02:05:37.170 --> 02:05:37.540
<v Speaker 2>clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weirder than that.</v>

2147
02:05:37.541 --> 02:05:40.750
<v Speaker 2>It's that there's only the right side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the clock.</v>

2148
02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:44.230
<v Speaker 2>There's only the right side of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only the right side of my body.</v>

2149
02:05:44.530 --> 02:05:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that this exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so sometimes people with right </v>

2150
02:05:49.530 --> 02:05:53.281
<v Speaker 2>parietal damage will wake up after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stroke and grabbed their left arm and </v>

2151
02:05:53.281 --> 02:05:57.841
<v Speaker 2>throw it out of bed and or their leg and</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it out of bed because it's not </v>

2152
02:05:57.841 --> 02:05:58.540
<v Speaker 2>theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course they fall out of bed,</v>

2153
02:05:58.541 --> 02:06:03.541
<v Speaker 2>which is quite a shock to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so they'll only eat half the food</v>

2154
02:06:03.821 --> 02:06:08.821
<v Speaker 2>on the plate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can really understand this for </v>

2155
02:06:08.821 --> 02:06:08.821
<v Speaker 2>Norman logically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2156
02:06:08.821 --> 02:06:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Because we can't imagine what that must </v>
<v Speaker 2>be like.</v>

2157
02:06:10.001 --> 02:06:15.001
<v Speaker 2>I think it must be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how you know there's things </v>

2158
02:06:15.001 --> 02:06:16.330
<v Speaker 2>behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't not see them.</v>

2159
02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:21.660
<v Speaker 2>They're just not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's black or anything or </v>

2160
02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:22.060
<v Speaker 2>there's a space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not there.</v>

2161
02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:27.480
<v Speaker 2>And so I think what happens is the not </v>
<v Speaker 2>there extends to three quarters of the </v>

2162
02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:28.960
<v Speaker 2>field instead of half the field.</v>

2163
02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:31.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

2164
02:06:31.091 --> 02:06:36.091
<v Speaker 2>So now the funny thing about people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>neglect is that if you tell them,</v>

2165
02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:38.080
<v Speaker 2>if you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

2166
02:06:38.110 --> 02:06:43.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that you're not moving your </v>

2167
02:06:43.110 --> 02:06:43.110
<v Speaker 2>left foot today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>

2168
02:06:43.110 --> 02:06:47.041
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's arthritic and I can't move it and </v>

2169
02:06:47.041 --> 02:06:47.041
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what are you?</v>

2170
02:06:47.041 --> 02:06:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Just try to move it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So No,</v>

2171
02:06:47.291 --> 02:06:52.291
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr already told you it's in too much </v>

2172
02:06:52.291 --> 02:06:52.291
<v Speaker 2>pain to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was working fine this morning.</v>

2173
02:06:52.291 --> 02:06:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Now it can be months after the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accident.</v>

2174
02:06:53.951 --> 02:06:58.951
<v Speaker 2>So it's a denial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people thought actually that that </v>

2175
02:06:58.951 --> 02:07:02.311
<v Speaker 2>was trauma induced denial for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time before they figured it out was </v>

2176
02:07:02.311 --> 02:07:03.220
<v Speaker 2>actually a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurophysiological damage.</v>

2177
02:07:03.550 --> 02:07:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Now Ramachandra and found that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrigated the contralateral ear,</v>

2178
02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:14.740
<v Speaker 2>say now if you pour cold water in </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's ear,</v>

2179
02:07:15.010 --> 02:07:18.250
<v Speaker 2>it upsets their vestibular system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their eyes will move back and forth like</v>

2180
02:07:18.251 --> 02:07:18.640
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2181
02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:23.660
<v Speaker 2>You can try that at a party if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anyways,</v>

2182
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Ramachandra was testing vestibular </v>
<v Speaker 2>function on these patients and the </v>

2183
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:31.510
<v Speaker 2>irrigated the right ear with cold water </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they woke up.</v>

2184
02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe what happened was that that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>shocking.</v>

2185
02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:40.740
<v Speaker 2>So imagine the networks in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere were degraded but not </v>

2186
02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:44.821
<v Speaker 2>completely gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they needed a really high threshold </v>

2187
02:07:44.821 --> 02:07:46.540
<v Speaker 2>of activation to snap into function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example of that.</v>

2188
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:49.630
<v Speaker 2>If you have Parkinson's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine you're frozen there,</v>

2189
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:51.550
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I throw a ball at you.</v>

2190
02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:56.580
<v Speaker 2>You'll go like this and catch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't throw it back so you can.</v>

2191
02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:02.580
<v Speaker 2>The stimulus is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's enough to push you past </v>

2192
02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:02.920
<v Speaker 2>threshold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do it voluntarily.</v>

2193
02:08:03.010 --> 02:08:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Now if you have Parkinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right to the nth degree,</v>

2194
02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:11.340
<v Speaker 2>you won't even be able to catch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a stage where you could </v>

2195
02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:11.340
<v Speaker 2>still do that.</v>

2196
02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:14.050
<v Speaker 2>There's a great case study where this </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandpa was in a wheelchair,</v>

2197
02:08:14.051 --> 02:08:17.980
<v Speaker 2>he had Parkinson's and his young </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandson was playing out on the dock and</v>

2198
02:08:17.981 --> 02:08:21.490
<v Speaker 2>fell in the water and started to drown </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he got out of his wheelchair,</v>

2199
02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:24.340
<v Speaker 2>went into the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rescued him,</v>

2200
02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:29.520
<v Speaker 2>brought him onto the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat back down in his wheelchair and was </v>

2201
02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:30.010
<v Speaker 2>paralyzed again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was enough.</v>

2202
02:08:30.011 --> 02:08:32.440
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine there was enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>network left.</v>

2203
02:08:32.441 --> 02:08:37.441
<v Speaker 2>So if the emotional tension became high </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough that the degraded circuits could </v>

2204
02:08:37.781 --> 02:08:40.030
<v Speaker 2>still function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

2205
02:08:40.031 --> 02:08:42.570
<v Speaker 2>so back to Ramachandran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you irrigate the year.</v>

2206
02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:46.170
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden the right hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections flashed,</v>

2207
02:08:46.190 --> 02:08:49.540
<v Speaker 2>the remainders managed to connect and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person goes,</v>

2208
02:08:49.630 --> 02:08:51.400
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a terrible stroke.</v>

2209
02:08:51.401 --> 02:08:54.100
<v Speaker 2>I've lost the left side of my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're crying.</v>

2210
02:08:54.101 --> 02:08:57.730
<v Speaker 2>They're like completely catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really overwhelmed by it.</v>

2211
02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:03.060
<v Speaker 2>And then 20 minutes later the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects wear off and they snap back in </v>

2212
02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:05.320
<v Speaker 2>and now they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've lost her left side again.</v>

2213
02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:10.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what seems to happen is that the </v>

2214
02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:14.380
<v Speaker 2>right hemisphere is collecting anomalous</v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

2215
02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:19.710
<v Speaker 2>That's what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it does when you're </v>

2216
02:09:19.710 --> 02:09:19.710
<v Speaker 2>dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2217
02:09:19.710 --> 02:09:19.710
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2218
02:09:19.710 --> 02:09:23.970
<v Speaker 2>it's representing that anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 2>information in image form and sort of </v>

2219
02:09:23.970 --> 02:09:28.621
<v Speaker 2>slowly passing it to the left hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't overwhelm it and maybe if </v>

2220
02:09:28.621 --> 02:09:33.421
<v Speaker 2>it gets overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wake up and you're afraid and you </v>

2221
02:09:33.421 --> 02:09:33.640
<v Speaker 2>tell someone about the dream that helps </v>
<v Speaker 2>you figure out what it was,</v>

2222
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:38.910
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that the right hemisphere is always </v>

2223
02:09:38.910 --> 02:09:40.630
<v Speaker 2>trying to tap the left hemisphere into </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation.</v>

2224
02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now imagine that that can happen a </v>

2225
02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:49.561
<v Speaker 2>little bit or a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you're just ignoring a little </v>

2226
02:09:49.561 --> 02:09:53.911
<v Speaker 2>bit of anomalous information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have some mildly frightening </v>

2227
02:09:53.911 --> 02:09:58.021
<v Speaker 2>dreams or maybe you've just stacked up a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of things that you're </v>

2228
02:09:58.021 --> 02:10:01.381
<v Speaker 2>ignoring and there's some major league </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters that you haven't contended </v>

2229
02:10:01.381 --> 02:10:03.940
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's situations where the right</v>

2230
02:10:03.941 --> 02:10:08.941
<v Speaker 2>hemisphere is stored up enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>counter enough of a counter hypothesis,</v>

2231
02:10:10.150 --> 02:10:13.480
<v Speaker 2>let's say about how the world works out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make making sense.</v>

2232
02:10:13.481 --> 02:10:18.481
<v Speaker 2>Out of all those things that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignored that one day it just goes snap </v>

2233
02:10:18.481 --> 02:10:23.340
<v Speaker 2>and you're a new personality and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new personality isn't addicted.</v>

2234
02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's something like it's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2235
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2236
02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:42.090
<v Speaker 6>Joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good Morning Citizen Peters.</v>

2237
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:49.900
<v Speaker 6>I've prepared a real doozy for you here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a good thing you've got extra time </v>

2238
02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:54.471
<v Speaker 6>to handle this one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd even say it's rehearsed a little </v>

2239
02:10:54.471 --> 02:10:54.840
<v Speaker 6>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's going to be ultra ineffective,</v>

2240
02:10:54.841 --> 02:10:59.841
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now I understand that a lecture on the </v>

2241
02:11:01.411 --> 02:11:06.411
<v Speaker 6>psychological significance of anything </v>
<v Speaker 6>really is going to induce notably wander</v>

2242
02:11:06.601 --> 02:11:11.601
<v Speaker 6>off into an anthropocentric worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but as a practitioner of the hard </v>

2243
02:11:14.131 --> 02:11:17.670
<v Speaker 6>sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to dig a little bit deeper,</v>

2244
02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:22.970
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I sought out I guess a religious </v>

2245
02:11:22.970 --> 02:11:26.001
<v Speaker 6>interpretation of both creative freedom </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I guess the very nature of time </v>

2246
02:11:30.911 --> 02:11:35.911
<v Speaker 6>itself and I found it obviously that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>why I'm here.</v>

2247
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:39.970
<v Speaker 6>And if you think you have an </v>
<v Speaker 6>anthropocentric worldview,</v>

2248
02:11:39.971 --> 02:11:43.140
<v Speaker 6>it's nothing compared to Joseph Cardinal</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ratzinger's.</v>

2249
02:11:45.670 --> 02:11:49.900
<v Speaker 6>Now I like to think that this microphone</v>
<v Speaker 6>here,</v>

2250
02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:52.990
<v Speaker 6>the one that you keep muting out on me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2251
02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:58.320
<v Speaker 6>this microphone is an object which </v>
<v Speaker 6>exists outside of our individual </v>

2252
02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:02.731
<v Speaker 6>perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's just the way I like to look at </v>

2253
02:12:02.731 --> 02:12:02.731
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2254
02:12:02.731 --> 02:12:02.731
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2255
02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:07.890
<v Speaker 6>But then I think about the concept.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and</v>

2256
02:12:08.231 --> 02:12:11.860
<v Speaker 6>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean when you're talking about art,</v>

2257
02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:16.950
<v Speaker 6>the appreciation of art,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there has to be some sort of subjective </v>

2258
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:20.221
<v Speaker 6>element integrated into them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there also must be a limit as well.</v>

2259
02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:26.280
<v Speaker 6>I mean certain works of art.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We appreciate as absolute masterpieces,</v>

2260
02:12:27.191 --> 02:12:32.191
<v Speaker 6>like Michelangelo's Pieta for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you bring up frequently because it </v>

2261
02:12:32.381 --> 02:12:37.381
<v Speaker 6>really is that good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there's other things which are just </v>

2262
02:12:37.381 --> 02:12:39.250
<v Speaker 6>by comparison to like vandalism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2263
02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:41.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2264
02:12:42.010 --> 02:12:47.010
<v Speaker 6>now there's always a temptation to </v>
<v Speaker 6>invoke the principle of a non </v>

2265
02:12:48.041 --> 02:12:52.600
<v Speaker 6>overlapping magisterial.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that seems like sort of a Capo,</v>

2266
02:12:52.630 --> 02:12:54.220
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I formulated,</v>

2267
02:12:54.221 --> 02:12:57.100
<v Speaker 6>I guess for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for standards of measure,</v>

2268
02:12:57.101 --> 02:13:02.101
<v Speaker 6>which helped me separate what's the </v>
<v Speaker 6>difference between art and mediocrity?</v>

2269
02:13:02.410 --> 02:13:04.870
<v Speaker 6>And here's the four.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Number One,</v>

2270
02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:07.780
<v Speaker 6>education,</v>
<v Speaker 6>number two,</v>

2271
02:13:08.530 --> 02:13:10.480
<v Speaker 6>time commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to put in the time.</v>

2272
02:13:10.481 --> 02:13:15.481
<v Speaker 6>If you're an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's probably going to become your full </v>

2273
02:13:15.481 --> 02:13:16.330
<v Speaker 6>time occupation is that you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>that passionate about it.</v>

2274
02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:21.900
<v Speaker 6>Number three,</v>
<v Speaker 6>public display art isn't something that </v>

2275
02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:23.710
<v Speaker 6>you own for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You hide it in your basement,</v>

2276
02:13:23.711 --> 02:13:28.711
<v Speaker 6>then it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Art is something that you have to </v>

2277
02:13:28.711 --> 02:13:28.711
<v Speaker 6>express,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2278
02:13:28.711 --> 02:13:29.950
<v Speaker 6>something which you've got to share,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and number four,</v>

2279
02:13:29.951 --> 02:13:34.951
<v Speaker 6>and I think this is the most one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>efficacy of vision.</v>

2280
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:42.470
<v Speaker 6>If you're an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've got to have a vision and we talk </v>

2281
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:43.500
<v Speaker 6>about the dream state here a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You go into the dream state,</v>

2282
02:13:43.501 --> 02:13:48.501
<v Speaker 6>you have inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not enough to just have the </v>

2283
02:13:48.501 --> 02:13:49.110
<v Speaker 6>inspiration because that's totally </v>
<v Speaker 6>subjective for you.</v>

2284
02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:54.710
<v Speaker 6>The Art,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the art part of it is having the </v>

2285
02:13:54.710 --> 02:13:58.280
<v Speaker 6>techniques and the skill and the intent </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I guess the capacity to turn that </v>

2286
02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:02.451
<v Speaker 6>into something real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know that you can then express or </v>

2287
02:14:02.451 --> 02:14:04.230
<v Speaker 6>share.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So can you read Cardinal Ratzinger,</v>

2288
02:14:04.231 --> 02:14:09.231
<v Speaker 6>his explanation for the nature of time </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then address the concept of beauty </v>

2289
02:14:09.231 --> 02:14:14.061
<v Speaker 6>in the eye of the beholder with specific</v>
<v Speaker 6>reference to the body positivity </v>

2290
02:14:14.671 --> 02:14:15.120
<v Speaker 6>movement.</v>

2291
02:14:15.590 --> 02:14:20.590
<v Speaker 4>How speech?</v>

2292
02:14:57.310 --> 02:14:58.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I can.</v>

2293
02:15:09.210 --> 02:15:10.080
<v Speaker 4>I think that's</v>

2294
02:15:12.450 --> 02:15:12.780
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2295
02:15:15.210 --> 02:15:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I think that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tangled together so many things and </v>

2296
02:15:20.210 --> 02:15:24.340
<v Speaker 1>this is also a tangle of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that that's a criticism that I can't</v>

2297
02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:29.820
<v Speaker 1>pull them all together with sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidity not to bore the audience to </v>

2298
02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:31.850
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna,</v>

2299
02:15:31.870 --> 02:15:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2300
02:15:32.710 --> 02:15:37.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to rate Dr Peterson.</v>

2301
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:44.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm fascinated by the idea of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what faith means.</v>

2302
02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:47.810
<v Speaker 5>Jacob listens to a voice and believes </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2303
02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:54.340
<v Speaker 5>He probably heard other voices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why did he believe this one?</v>

2304
02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:59.330
<v Speaker 5>Why what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There must have been an a priori sort of</v>

2305
02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:04.360
<v Speaker 5>functional necessity for him to believe </v>
<v Speaker 5>the voice that told him one thing or </v>

2306
02:16:06.381 --> 02:16:11.381
<v Speaker 5>another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that that's a string that </v>

2307
02:16:11.381 --> 02:16:14.171
<v Speaker 5>runs through the Bible and then through </v>
<v Speaker 5>the new testament we are expected as </v>

2308
02:16:14.171 --> 02:16:15.160
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I confess I'm a Christian.</v>

2309
02:16:15.170 --> 02:16:20.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm I act like I believe God is real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And and so there is this a call of faith</v>

2310
02:16:22.071 --> 02:16:27.071
<v Speaker 5>and also the in every hero story we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we see now there is always a moment in </v>

2311
02:16:28.101 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 5>that story where the hero</v>

2312
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:34.420
<v Speaker 1>must believe something beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that is before then,</v>

2313
02:16:34.421 --> 02:16:36.190
<v Speaker 1>which is to say they must take a leap of</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith.</v>

2314
02:16:36.191 --> 02:16:41.191
<v Speaker 1>So I'm wondering if you could just kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of unpack that experience of faith in </v>

2315
02:16:41.191 --> 02:16:44.650
<v Speaker 1>the understanding of how a human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the choice to believe one thing or</v>

2316
02:16:44.651 --> 02:16:45.730
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2317
02:16:45.731 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2318
02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:52.630
<v Speaker 1>is this still on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this still working?</v>

2319
02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2320
02:16:54.311 --> 02:16:55.480
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2321
02:16:56.020 --> 02:17:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't precisely know the answer that </v>

2322
02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:02.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a very peculiar thing because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>think many things,</v>

2323
02:17:02.711 --> 02:17:07.711
<v Speaker 1>or you could say many voices appear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our minds because when Nisha took </v>

2324
02:17:08.231 --> 02:17:10.300
<v Speaker 1>descartes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am a part.</v>

2325
02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:10.900
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2326
02:17:10.901 --> 02:17:13.930
<v Speaker 1>it isn't so obvious that there's an eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2327
02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:18.640
<v Speaker 1>that it's a unity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a unity transparent unto itself,</v>

2328
02:17:18.641 --> 02:17:23.641
<v Speaker 1>which of course the psychoanalysts </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked up in a big way and then he </v>

2329
02:17:23.641 --> 02:17:26.140
<v Speaker 1>wasn't sure that it was the eye who </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought in some causal manner.</v>

2330
02:17:26.141 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2331
02:17:26.651 --> 02:17:28.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more like thoughts.</v>

2332
02:17:28.510 --> 02:17:33.510
<v Speaker 1>It's something like thoughts appear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenal field and maybe you </v>

2333
02:17:33.510 --> 02:17:34.570
<v Speaker 1>choose between them or maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 1>possess you.</v>

2334
02:17:34.571 --> 02:17:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Like there's lots of other ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

2335
02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:41.700
<v Speaker 1>It isn't exactly obvious to me why we </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose to take one pathway rather than </v>

2336
02:17:41.981 --> 02:17:46.981
<v Speaker 1>another when so many of them could offer</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to us.</v>

2337
02:17:47.261 --> 02:17:52.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people tend to talk about that as </v>

2338
02:17:52.261 --> 02:17:52.390
<v Speaker 1>something like conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2339
02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:54.530
<v Speaker 1>And now maybe it's that</v>

2340
02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:05.880
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta have something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an endless regress because </v>

2341
02:18:06.251 --> 02:18:10.570
<v Speaker 1>you can always ask why the why any </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption became primary,</v>

2342
02:18:10.930 --> 02:18:15.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'll put that aside for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to have something to do </v>

2343
02:18:15.930 --> 02:18:19.981
<v Speaker 1>with your aims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're more likely to </v>

2344
02:18:20.770 --> 02:18:25.770
<v Speaker 1>listen to a voice that is in keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your most fundamental aims and then</v>

2345
02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:29.410
<v Speaker 1>the question is where do your most </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental aims come from?</v>

2346
02:18:29.411 --> 02:18:31.490
<v Speaker 1>And from what I've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine,</v>

2347
02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:35.410
<v Speaker 1>and I'll speak psychologically again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that to begin with,</v>

2348
02:18:35.411 --> 02:18:38.560
<v Speaker 1>you're a concatenation of rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive,</v>

2349
02:18:38.561 --> 02:18:41.170
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One's tired,</v>

2350
02:18:41.171 --> 02:18:44.530
<v Speaker 1>one's upset ones laughing one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that in babies,</v>

2351
02:18:44.531 --> 02:18:49.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cycle through those states very </v>

2352
02:18:49.531 --> 02:18:51.241
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a infantile unity above all </v>

2353
02:18:51.241 --> 02:18:52.570
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have control.</v>

2354
02:18:52.630 --> 02:18:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the developing individual </v>

2355
02:18:57.630 --> 02:18:58.300
<v Speaker 1>has to figure out how to integrate those</v>

2356
02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:03.090
<v Speaker 1>primitive subpersonalities into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>unified personality.</v>

2357
02:19:04.110 --> 02:19:09.110
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they integrate the unified personality </v>

2358
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:11.961
<v Speaker 1>into a social unity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's partly individual integration,</v>

2359
02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:19.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's fed by social forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even when you watch an infant </v>

2360
02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:22.410
<v Speaker 1>breastfeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's established a relationship with its</v>

2361
02:19:22.411 --> 02:19:25.830
<v Speaker 1>mother and there's a reciprocity that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already at play there,</v>

2362
02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:31.400
<v Speaker 1>so then that underlying multiplicity </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to form itself into a unity and </v>

2363
02:19:32.451 --> 02:19:37.451
<v Speaker 1>then the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that something like </v>

2364
02:19:37.451 --> 02:19:40.870
<v Speaker 1>that's something like the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual out of out of the titans.</v>

2365
02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:43.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a reasonable way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

2366
02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:47.300
<v Speaker 1>like a sovereign out of the titans at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

2367
02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.200
<v Speaker 1>but then there's another division which </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to parallel a parallel that </v>

2368
02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:57.790
<v Speaker 1>the Cain and Abel Division is that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration can be oriented towards </v>

2369
02:19:57.790 --> 02:20:02.401
<v Speaker 1>something that's positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be oriented towards </v>

2370
02:20:02.401 --> 02:20:04.931
<v Speaker 1>something that's negative and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>split of the world into good and evil.</v>

2371
02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:08.150
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it looks like you're navigating</v>

2372
02:20:08.151 --> 02:20:13.151
<v Speaker 1>between those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can only account for that with </v>

2373
02:20:13.151 --> 02:20:13.151
<v Speaker 1>something like choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think the free choice,</v>

2374
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:18.550
<v Speaker 1>even though I don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm unwilling to deny the existence of </v>

2375
02:20:18.831 --> 02:20:23.831
<v Speaker 1>free choice merely because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it because it looks to me </v>

2376
02:20:23.831 --> 02:20:26.960
<v Speaker 1>like that's how people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the expect to be treated.</v>

2377
02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:32.140
<v Speaker 1>And that societies who that structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in accordance with the idea </v>

2378
02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:36.250
<v Speaker 1>that people have free choice actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>work now that doesn't prove that there's</v>

2379
02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:41.260
<v Speaker 1>free choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people have been arguing about that </v>

2380
02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:41.260
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2381
02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are two possible means of </v>

2382
02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:47.771
<v Speaker 1>integration and that I think what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is feeding one or the other </v>

2383
02:20:47.771 --> 02:20:52.540
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you probably choose which </v>

2384
02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:53.930
<v Speaker 1>one to feed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an.</v>

2385
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:56.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how it feels that way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me as well.</v>

2386
02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Like when I look at my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2387
02:20:59.750 --> 02:21:02.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're really aggravated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2388
02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:04.400
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're aggravated with your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2389
02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:05.590
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

2390
02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:07.640
<v Speaker 1>or your child or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2391
02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:12.880
<v Speaker 1>and you're feeling kind of nasty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even know that you're in the </v>

2392
02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:14.480
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And an idea comes into your head.</v>

2393
02:21:14.481 --> 02:21:17.450
<v Speaker 1>You can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say that and you know,</v>

2394
02:21:17.451 --> 02:21:19.520
<v Speaker 1>you could say it and you know what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do,</v>

2395
02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:24.830
<v Speaker 1>but then you pause and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that make it better or worse?</v>

2396
02:21:24.831 --> 02:21:28.280
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you go to hell with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is quite the thing to say.</v>

2397
02:21:28.281 --> 02:21:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I've got a little story about that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute and then you say it,</v>

2398
02:21:32.930 --> 02:21:36.740
<v Speaker 1>but you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knew that you took the low road,</v>

2399
02:21:36.770 --> 02:21:38.480
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know it,</v>

2400
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:43.510
<v Speaker 1>and then you're guilty about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive and that makes the fight way </v>

2401
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:46.511
<v Speaker 1>works because then there's no damn way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to admit that you actually </v>

2402
02:21:46.511 --> 02:21:48.320
<v Speaker 1>did that and so things do go to hell and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

2403
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:50.540
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an ugly little idea.</v>

2404
02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:52.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2405
02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:57.940
<v Speaker 1>that's relevant to the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're playing around with </v>

2406
02:21:58.041 --> 02:22:03.041
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm using cocaine because it's very </v>

2407
02:22:03.041 --> 02:22:07.541
<v Speaker 1>addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very interesting chemical </v>

2408
02:22:07.541 --> 02:22:07.980
<v Speaker 1>because it's a dopaminergic agonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what?</v>

2409
02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:11.750
<v Speaker 1>What dopamine does is two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel like what you're doing</v>

2410
02:22:11.751 --> 02:22:15.530
<v Speaker 1>is worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also imagine that there's a bunch</v>

2411
02:22:15.531 --> 02:22:20.531
<v Speaker 1>of neurocircuits that are active and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they get a hit of dopamine or you </v>

2412
02:22:20.531 --> 02:22:23.210
<v Speaker 1>do in those neurocircuits get a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit more powerful.</v>

2413
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

2414
02:22:24.860 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 1>it has a rewarding</v>

2415
02:22:26.610 --> 02:22:31.610
<v Speaker 2>property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that it makes you feel like </v>

2416
02:22:31.610 --> 02:22:32.690
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is important and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a reinforcing property which is,</v>

2417
02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:37.700
<v Speaker 2>it makes neurocircuits grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now what that means is that whatever </v>

2418
02:22:39.511 --> 02:22:42.090
<v Speaker 2>you were doing just before you took </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>

2419
02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.330
<v Speaker 2>grows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

2420
02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:47.640
<v Speaker 2>So now imagine there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things that you do just before</v>

2421
02:22:47.641 --> 02:22:51.710
<v Speaker 2>you take cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a string of decisions and it</v>

2422
02:22:52.050 --> 02:22:55.860
<v Speaker 2>one decision point is the same for all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those different occurrences.</v>

2423
02:22:55.861 --> 02:22:59.670
<v Speaker 2>And that decision point is because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you're in trouble and that decision</v>

2424
02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:03.300
<v Speaker 2>point is well to hell with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2425
02:23:03.301 --> 02:23:08.040
<v Speaker 2>So then you think that each of the 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>times that you take cocaine,</v>

2426
02:23:08.041 --> 02:23:13.041
<v Speaker 2>even though you do it different places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one thought is there all the </v>

2427
02:23:13.041 --> 02:23:16.860
<v Speaker 2>time and that thing grows because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing it and it grows and it grows</v>

2428
02:23:16.861 --> 02:23:17.550
<v Speaker 2>and it grows.</v>

2429
02:23:17.730 --> 02:23:19.270
<v Speaker 2>And so now that's in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2430
02:23:19.300 --> 02:23:24.300
<v Speaker 2>that's part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the thing that says to hell </v>

2431
02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:24.300
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2432
02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:28.851
<v Speaker 2>so now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe that's not such a good thing </v>

2433
02:23:28.851 --> 02:23:30.120
<v Speaker 2>to grow inside your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you,</v>

2434
02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:35.360
<v Speaker 2>you're addicted and they take you to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine treatment center and after a </v>

2435
02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:37.140
<v Speaker 2>week you're no longer physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physiologically addicted.</v>

2436
02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:42.460
<v Speaker 2>You're not craving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a problem as long as </v>

2437
02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:45.771
<v Speaker 2>you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they take you back to your </v>

2438
02:23:45.771 --> 02:23:45.930
<v Speaker 2>normal environment and you see like </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>

2439
02:23:45.931 --> 02:23:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friend,</v>

2440
02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:50.760
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as you see him up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing comes in,</v>

2441
02:23:50.761 --> 02:23:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're back on your back,</v>

2442
02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:59.300
<v Speaker 2>on the trail with a track and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're in where you will end up </v>

2443
02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:03.711
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you reinforce that particular </v>

2444
02:24:03.711 --> 02:24:07.011
<v Speaker 2>perspective long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's akin in a sense to the </v>

2445
02:24:07.011 --> 02:24:08.160
<v Speaker 2>decision making process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2446
02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:10.620
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take the low road,</v>

2447
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:16.190
<v Speaker 2>then that winds and it gets a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger because everything that wins </v>

2448
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:20.550
<v Speaker 2>neurologically gets a little stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Darwinian competition.</v>

2449
02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:25.880
<v Speaker 2>So one rule is don't practice what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to become because you really </v>

2450
02:24:25.891 --> 02:24:27.690
<v Speaker 2>do become that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It builds,</v>

2451
02:24:27.810 --> 02:24:30.540
<v Speaker 2>it builds itself right into your neural </v>
<v Speaker 2>architecture.</v>

2452
02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:33.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the terrifying things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about addiction,</v>

2453
02:24:33.001 --> 02:24:33.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you think,</v>

2454
02:24:33.691 --> 02:24:35.190
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of psychological.</v>

2455
02:24:35.191 --> 02:24:36.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2456
02:24:36.181 --> 02:24:39.090
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also kind of neurophysiological and</v>

2457
02:24:39.091 --> 02:24:44.091
<v Speaker 2>you build a one eyed cocaine monster in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head if you hit yourself enough </v>

2458
02:24:44.091 --> 02:24:49.071
<v Speaker 2>with something that reinforcing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

2459
02:24:52.610 --> 02:24:55.480
<v Speaker 4>Thanks.</v>

2460
02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Last question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

2461
02:24:57.870 --> 02:25:02.870
<v Speaker 7>Hallelujah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just a really simple question then </v>

2462
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:06.860
<v Speaker 7>take that long suffering when it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the things though is noticing </v>

2463
02:25:09.301 --> 02:25:13.830
<v Speaker 7>from the stories of Jacob and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>these biblical narratives is you do have</v>

2464
02:25:13.831 --> 02:25:18.831
<v Speaker 7>this all powerful God who is able to </v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of essentially be the hidden </v>

2465
02:25:18.831 --> 02:25:23.241
<v Speaker 7>protagonist in the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then the funny thing is that he's </v>

2466
02:25:23.241 --> 02:25:25.690
<v Speaker 7>kind of revealing some of his qualities </v>
<v Speaker 7>throughout the course of the story.</v>

2467
02:25:25.691 --> 02:25:27.890
<v Speaker 7>So you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2468
02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:33.660
<v Speaker 7>the weird paradox of the fact that God's</v>
<v Speaker 7>somehow alive as Jacob Israel to win the</v>

2469
02:25:34.631 --> 02:25:37.000
<v Speaker 7>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He does that with Abraham to.</v>

2470
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:40.030
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So my question is relating to penn steps</v>

2471
02:25:40.031 --> 02:25:45.031
<v Speaker 7>thing about the rats that you told like </v>
<v Speaker 7>three or four times and the number of </v>

2472
02:25:45.031 --> 02:25:45.580
<v Speaker 7>occasions I saw one of your more recent </v>
<v Speaker 7>videos.</v>

2473
02:25:45.581 --> 02:25:48.820
<v Speaker 7>You've talked about it where the bigger </v>
<v Speaker 7>rat lets the smaller Rhett when,</v>

2474
02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:51.640
<v Speaker 7>because then the other smaller rat won't</v>
<v Speaker 7>engage in the game.</v>

2475
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:54.160
<v Speaker 7>So the question is twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For me.</v>

2476
02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:58.180
<v Speaker 7>One is God allowing humanity to when </v>
<v Speaker 7>periodically.</v>

2477
02:25:58.330 --> 02:26:02.740
<v Speaker 7>So that's to allow us to actually engage</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the dialogue through these stories.</v>

2478
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:07.950
<v Speaker 7>And two,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is it a much more primitive version of </v>

2479
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:09.850
<v Speaker 7>the virtue of humility,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which you wouldn't normally characterize</v>

2480
02:26:09.851 --> 02:26:12.910
<v Speaker 7>of an of an of an omnipotent deity?</v>

2481
02:26:13.330 --> 02:26:13.770
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2482
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are excellent questions that I </v>

2483
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:22.551
<v Speaker 1>really liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second one in particular that that </v>

2484
02:26:22.551 --> 02:26:25.760
<v Speaker 1>God's decision to allow human victory </v>
<v Speaker 1>from time to time is actually a </v>

2485
02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:29.760
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of something approximating</v>
<v Speaker 1>humility or at least mercy.</v>

2486
02:26:30.090 --> 02:26:32.340
<v Speaker 1>But humility is an interesting take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2487
02:26:32.470 --> 02:26:37.470
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's also connected to Paul's image of </v>

2488
02:26:37.470 --> 02:26:40.891
<v Speaker 7>how Christ handed them hands himself </v>
<v Speaker 7>over and allows himself to be defeated </v>

2489
02:26:40.891 --> 02:26:44.440
<v Speaker 7>by men and therefore a conquers sin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is man's enemy.</v>

2490
02:26:44.470 --> 02:26:49.470
<v Speaker 7>It's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the same paradox where God enters </v>

2491
02:26:49.470 --> 02:26:52.210
<v Speaker 7>into that dynamic with people and loses </v>
<v Speaker 7>and willingly loses.</v>

2492
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's okay.</v>

2493
02:26:56.131 --> 02:26:59.730
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I would say is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really interesting analogy.</v>

2494
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2495
02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated enough questions so </v>

2496
02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:10.581
<v Speaker 1>that I can't go be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I can go beyond the </v>

2497
02:27:10.581 --> 02:27:14.121
<v Speaker 1>question actually because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated that I don't think I can </v>

2498
02:27:14.121 --> 02:27:14.340
<v Speaker 1>formulate it any better than you already</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

2499
02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Like it's an interesting string of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

2500
02:27:16.891 --> 02:27:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to play with it a while to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

2501
02:27:20.070 --> 02:27:25.070
<v Speaker 1>She had an interesting light on why God </v>
<v Speaker 1>is amenable to negotiation in the Old </v>

2502
02:27:26.431 --> 02:27:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really a strange.</v>

2503
02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:29.880
<v Speaker 1>As you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really a strange thing.</v>

2504
02:27:29.881 --> 02:27:34.881
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is omnipotent God who </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously can do whatever he wants and </v>

2505
02:27:34.881 --> 02:27:39.471
<v Speaker 1>yet he allow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can be bargained with and then that </v>

2506
02:27:39.471 --> 02:27:41.430
<v Speaker 1>also opens up the question of why like </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hypothesis as well.</v>

2507
02:27:41.431 --> 02:27:43.550
<v Speaker 1>If you don't let the little rat win now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

2508
02:27:43.551 --> 02:27:46.940
<v Speaker 1>then they get dejected and quit playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>

2509
02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2510
02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:51.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good observation if </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't get to win now and then you</v>

2511
02:27:51.661 --> 02:27:53.700
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda what happens to cane.</v>

2512
02:27:54.300 --> 02:27:55.170
<v Speaker 1>God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2513
02:27:55.171 --> 02:27:57.660
<v Speaker 1>you're not playing a straight game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're not winning.</v>

2514
02:27:58.020 --> 02:27:58.380
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

2515
02:28:01.710 --> 02:28:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2516
02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:11.220
<v Speaker 1>There's an intimation in the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>testament and I think it's more </v>

2517
02:28:11.220 --> 02:28:14.041
<v Speaker 1>developed in the New Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not that the straighter the game </v>

2518
02:28:14.041 --> 02:28:15.280
<v Speaker 1>you play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to win.</v>

2519
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:21.630
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe part of the reason that God</v>
<v Speaker 1>lets Abraham Bargain and and even Jacob </v>

2520
02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:26.000
<v Speaker 1>is because they've started to play very </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight games.</v>

2521
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:31.750
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you do when in you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling with God if you play a </v>

2522
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.750
<v Speaker 1>straight gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2523
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that's.</v>

2524
02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that's true is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's actually why we would </v>

2525
02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:41.030
<v Speaker 1>define it as a street gate now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we could speak psychologically.</v>

2526
02:28:41.031 --> 02:28:46.031
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what we've come to </v>

2527
02:28:46.031 --> 02:28:48.371
<v Speaker 1>recognize as a straight game is the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the broadest number of </v>

2528
02:28:48.591 --> 02:28:53.591
<v Speaker 1>situations across the widest range of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time spans is most likely to produce a </v>

2529
02:28:54.231 --> 02:28:55.830
<v Speaker 1>positive outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2530
02:28:55.860 --> 02:29:00.860
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the grounds for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of ethics that it's really </v>

2531
02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:00.860
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>

2532
02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:02.700
<v Speaker 7>Not to Belabor it too much because there</v>
<v Speaker 7>was,</v>

2533
02:29:02.730 --> 02:29:07.730
<v Speaker 7>there was an interesting insight from </v>
<v Speaker 7>Chesterton's demand who was Thursday </v>

2534
02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:11.360
<v Speaker 7>where God sets himself up as the </v>
<v Speaker 7>benevolent antagonist so as to </v>

2535
02:29:11.820 --> 02:29:12.400
<v Speaker 7>accelerate</v>

2536
02:29:12.580 --> 02:29:14.800
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2537
02:29:14.801 --> 02:29:19.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a really interesting </v>

2538
02:29:19.801 --> 02:29:19.801
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2539
02:29:19.801 --> 02:29:20.020
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is hints,</v>

2540
02:29:20.021 --> 02:29:25.021
<v Speaker 1>I would say throughout the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that the reason that God </v>

2541
02:29:25.270 --> 02:29:30.270
<v Speaker 1>tolerates Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say is because without an </v>

2542
02:29:30.270 --> 02:29:32.410
<v Speaker 1>adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're soft and that's,</v>

2543
02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tied in with the notion that life</v>

2544
02:29:34.841 --> 02:29:37.310
<v Speaker 1>is something like a moral struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2545
02:29:37.311 --> 02:29:40.480
<v Speaker 1>that that's the fundamental essence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a moral struggle.</v>

2546
02:29:40.990 --> 02:29:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Now I think that that's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logically a reasonable observation.</v>

2547
02:29:46.121 --> 02:29:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's maybe other people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience it that way,</v>

2548
02:29:48.731 --> 02:29:53.050
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me like within my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that that's accurate.</v>

2549
02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know what Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that says about the </v>

2550
02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:01.081
<v Speaker 1>fundamental nature of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a vision at one point that I </v>

2551
02:30:01.081 --> 02:30:05.350
<v Speaker 1>was in a ring with Satan actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

2552
02:30:05.710 --> 02:30:10.710
<v Speaker 1>and it was like a Roman coliseum and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was rather upset to find myself there,</v>

2553
02:30:15.071 --> 02:30:20.071
<v Speaker 1>but I won and I asked God afterwards why</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would do such a thing and his answer </v>

2554
02:30:22.181 --> 02:30:24.790
<v Speaker 1>was he knew I could win.</v>

2555
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:26.740
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2556
02:30:26.741 --> 02:30:28.810
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to make of that.</v>

2557
02:30:28.811 --> 02:30:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what to make of that.</v>

2558
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:36.030
<v Speaker 1>But the idea was that if you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to encourage someone rather than protect</v>

2559
02:30:38.261 --> 02:30:43.261
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those are really different </v>

2560
02:30:43.261 --> 02:30:43.261
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2561
02:30:43.261 --> 02:30:43.261
<v Speaker 1>To protect someone isn't to make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

2562
02:30:43.261 --> 02:30:43.900
<v Speaker 1>to encourage them is to make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>

2563
02:30:44.350 --> 02:30:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Then you set them a series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>

2564
02:30:48.700 --> 02:30:50.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2565
02:30:50.861 --> 02:30:55.861
<v Speaker 1>At the point where they may win and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could make a case that that's </v>

2566
02:30:55.861 --> 02:30:58.060
<v Speaker 1>what you do if you really care for </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

2567
02:30:58.390 --> 02:31:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Now I know that that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that that interpretation </v>

2568
02:31:03.390 --> 02:31:06.811
<v Speaker 1>is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something mean you </v>

2569
02:31:06.811 --> 02:31:11.761
<v Speaker 1>definitely with your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're wrestling with </v>

2570
02:31:11.761 --> 02:31:11.761
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say when you're playing with them,</v>

2571
02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:17.040
<v Speaker 1>you use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push them to the limit of their </v>

2572
02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:21.060
<v Speaker 1>ability because otherwise they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend their current abilities.</v>

2573
02:31:22.050 --> 02:31:22.680
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2574
02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:30.620
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

2575
02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:44.380
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see some of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps most of you in December and I </v>

2576
02:31:44.571 --> 02:31:47.330
<v Speaker 1>think we'll finish off genesis at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

2577
02:31:47.870 --> 02:31:50.900
<v Speaker 1>And then in the new year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not till the spring,</v>

2578
02:31:51.530 --> 02:31:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with exodus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm really looking forward to </v>

2579
02:31:56.530 --> 02:31:59.810
<v Speaker 1>because I really liked the exodus story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing story and unbelievably </v>

2580
02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:00.350
<v Speaker 1>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not well.</v>

2581
02:32:00.351 --> 02:32:03.680
<v Speaker 1>The ones we've covered so far have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good as well,</v>

2582
02:32:03.681 --> 02:32:07.400
<v Speaker 1>but so thank you all for coming and will</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps see you in about a month.</v>
