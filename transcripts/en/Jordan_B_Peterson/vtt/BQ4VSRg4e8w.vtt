1
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>This one is particularly complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because with piaget,</v>

2
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.003
<v Speaker 1>you enter a whole new domain of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of axiomatic thinking that's the right </v>

3
00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:22.240
<v Speaker 1>way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

4
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:24.010
<v Speaker 1>each of these people that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing,</v>

5
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:24.844
<v Speaker 1>each of these theories comes out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of the world from a </v>

6
00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:30.100
<v Speaker 1>different perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really fundamentally different.</v>

7
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>It's different way deep down at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of fundamental assumptions.</v>

8
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget is who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>who's probably the world's most famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental psychologist,</v>

10
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 1>but although he didn't consider himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>a developmental psychologist,</v>

11
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>he considered himself a genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>epistemologist.</v>

12
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>And what that meant was that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in pissed homology,</v>

13
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:53.740
<v Speaker 1>which is how knowledge structures work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and genetic means formulation of.</v>

14
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:54.574
<v Speaker 1>And so he was interested in how children</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate their knowledge structures in </v>

15
00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.033
<v Speaker 1>he was a constructivist because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that human beings construct </v>

17
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.073
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't only construct the </v>

18
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>representations of the world and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper than that.</v>

19
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.320
<v Speaker 1>It's more like the construct the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

20
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.363
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends to some degree on what you </v>

21
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:15.430
<v Speaker 1>think of as the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's,</v>

22
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.443
<v Speaker 1>so there's a reality definition issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nested at the bottom of this and </v>

23
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:20.224
<v Speaker 1>it's very complex one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to have to walk you </v>

24
00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>through it piece by piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

25
00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:26.950
<v Speaker 1>piaget was a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

26
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.640
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a paper I believe on molluscs </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was 10 and had it published in a</v>

27
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:31.474
<v Speaker 1>scientific journal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was offered the curatorship of a </v>

28
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:34.384
<v Speaker 1>museum as a consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his parents had to write the museum </v>

29
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.923
<v Speaker 1>directors and tell them that he couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>curate the museum because he was only </v>

30
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:41.734
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that gives you some idea about </v>

31
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:45.100
<v Speaker 1>piaget and he's published many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

32
00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:48.400
<v Speaker 1>many books and many of them haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>translated into English yet.</v>

33
00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 1>And so he was quite the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was quite the,</v>

34
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large intelligence creature and he </v>

35
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>studied all sorts of things.</v>

36
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.063
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to tell you a little bit </v>

37
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:01.204
<v Speaker 1>about constructivism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to start you with a quote </v>

38
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>from Piaget and to its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done some books,</v>

39
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.084
<v Speaker 1>some of his books I found quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward and some of them very </v>

40
00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:09.724
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's often because of the </v>

41
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.823
<v Speaker 1>quality of the translation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens to be a relatively </v>

42
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:16.270
<v Speaker 1>difficult section.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's translated that well,</v>

43
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go through it.</v>

44
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:18.814
<v Speaker 1>I'll explain it to you a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget said the common postulate </v>

45
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.750
<v Speaker 1>that's assumption of various traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>epistemologies,</v>

46
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.973
<v Speaker 1>theories of valid knowledge is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge itself is a fact and not a </v>

47
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:32.344
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if our various forms of </v>

48
00:02:34.241 --> 00:02:38.290
<v Speaker 1>knowledge are always incomplete and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>various sciences still imperfect,</v>

49
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 1>that which is acquired is still acquired</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can therefore be studied statically,</v>

50
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>hence the absolute position of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

51
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.963
<v Speaker 1>What is knowledge or how are the various</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of knowledge possible under the </v>

52
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>converging influence of a series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors?</v>

53
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.193
<v Speaker 1>We're tending more and more today to </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard knowledge as a process more than </v>

54
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:56.524
<v Speaker 1>a state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any being or object that science is to </v>

55
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.304
<v Speaker 1>hold fast dissolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again in the current of </v>

56
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.214
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the last analysis of this </v>

57
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>development and of it alone that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to state it is a fact.</v>

58
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>What we can and should then seek is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law of this process.</v>

59
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.113
<v Speaker 1>Quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are well aware on the other hand of </v>

60
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>the fine book by Kuhn on scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutions.</v>

61
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Now there is an awful lot of information</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that paragraph,</v>

62
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>so we'll unpack it a little bit before </v>
<v Speaker 1>we go on.</v>

63
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.023
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way of looking at science is that </v>

64
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a collection of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.393
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what piaget is stating to begin </v>

66
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

67
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.883
<v Speaker 1>And that was that we assume that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts that science has gathered are </v>

68
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>facts and static,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you observe them across time,</v>

69
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:40.774
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that scientific facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to shift and transform because </v>

70
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>scientific theories that are applicable </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one century,</v>

71
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:47.314
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn out to be less applicable than the </v>

72
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:49.744
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's been a lot of argument and </v>

73
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>discussion about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

74
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.213
<v Speaker 1>because the fact that facts change seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to indicate that they're not so self </v>

75
00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.604
<v Speaker 1>evidently fact and there are people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps coon would be among them who </v>

76
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:08.671
<v Speaker 1>believed that science consisted of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition of paradigms.</v>

77
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:10.564
<v Speaker 1>So those are sets of axioms within which</v>
<v Speaker 1>something operates and the paradigms he </v>

78
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:15.424
<v Speaker 1>considered them often incommensurate you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't move from one to another </v>

79
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>because the axioms were different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no necessarily no what,</v>

80
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:22.744
<v Speaker 1>what might you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no necessary means of </v>

81
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 1>communication between them but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

82
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Piaget knew of Thomas Kuhn's work.</v>

83
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the scientist structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific revolutions,</v>

84
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:32.734
<v Speaker 1>which was published in 1962 it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classic text in the philosophy of </v>

85
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

86
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>and what piaget assumed more was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

87
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I would say more like a classic view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science where,</v>

88
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.493
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Newton came up with Newtonian </v>

89
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:48.334
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a set of propositions upon </v>

90
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>which Newtonian physics was based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when Einstein transformed those</v>

91
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>propositions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was that Newtonian physics</v>

92
00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:01.951
<v Speaker 1>became a subset of Einsteinian physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that piaget looked at the</v>

93
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 1>development of factual ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part,</v>

94
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.484
<v Speaker 1>was that you'd come up with a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that were facts and then that </v>

95
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:11.460
<v Speaker 1>would be superseded by a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory within that,</v>

96
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 1>within which that original theory would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be nested.</v>

97
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And so that what happens that each </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory in some sense,</v>

98
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.513
<v Speaker 1>although it transforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes more complete as the </v>

99
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>scientific progression continues.</v>

100
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.643
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kuhn didn't precisely believe that </v>

101
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>although exactly what Kuhn meant by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigm shift,</v>

102
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 1>because Kuhn originated that term isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>

103
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:31.534
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't seem to actually believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that science had this capacity to </v>

104
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.493
<v Speaker 1>present a series of facts and then alter</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underlying presuppositions and then </v>

105
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>to nest that within a broader series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>

106
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:42.604
<v Speaker 1>Like you would assume if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the relationship between </v>

107
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.333
<v Speaker 1>Newton and Einstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So newtonian physics is a subset of </v>

108
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Einsteinian physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that's kind of how Piaget thought</v>

109
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>about how human beings develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

110
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>He believed that we came up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>let's say you want it to chop down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

112
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>That might be a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

113
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>you could use a a dull ax made of bronze</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

114
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>well that would chop down the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a lot of work.</v>

115
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:07.934
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you replace that with a </v>

116
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>sharp steel ax that's designed like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wedge so that you can really hack down a</v>

117
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 1>tree with it.</v>

118
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you replace it with a saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

119
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not like the bronze ax could chop </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the tree,</v>

120
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>but the steel ax can do a better job in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this saw can do even a better job.</v>

121
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.523
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that Piaget thought about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transformation of human knowledge </v>

122
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>structures from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from infancy onward essentially was that</v>

123
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.743
<v Speaker 1>infants would produce a representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world that was sort of low </v>

124
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>resolution but quite tool like it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>work in the world.</v>

125
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.703
<v Speaker 1>But then as they progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of those tools would become </v>

126
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>refined and sometimes transformed </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

127
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>So some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you imagine that a child would</v>

128
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:48.854
<v Speaker 1>use in a sense a low resolution picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>of something and then they would </v>

129
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>increase its resolution as they filled </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the details.</v>

130
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.203
<v Speaker 1>That would be a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Piagetian notion of </v>

131
00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.084
<v Speaker 1>assimilation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're using the same basic theory but </v>

132
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:01.574
<v Speaker 1>filling in the details and then now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd have to switch to another </v>

133
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>picture entirely.</v>

134
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>And that would be more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>accommodation.</v>

135
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.753
<v Speaker 1>That's where you'd have to transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>your internal structures completely in </v>

136
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>order to properly represent an act </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the world.</v>

137
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the basic difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between accommodation and assimilation.</v>

138
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.593
<v Speaker 1>So assimilation is like micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>alterations in accommodation is </v>

139
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>transformation of the knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure itself.</v>

140
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.193
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what Kuhn pointed out was that </v>

141
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.673
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a set of facts and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there'd be an anomaly arise of some </v>

142
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>sorts of like at the end of the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

143
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.040
<v Speaker 1>the only remaining and normally was at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least one of the remaining anomalies was</v>

144
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

145
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 1>no matter which direction you shine a </v>
<v Speaker 1>light beam in and no matter how fast the</v>

146
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 1>platform on which you're standing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving,</v>

147
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 1>the light beam has exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>velocity,</v>

148
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 1>which seems impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

149
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:49.994
<v Speaker 1>if the earth is moving this way around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun and you shine a light off the </v>

150
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:53.384
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd expect the speed of light to be </v>

151
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 1>the speed of light plus the speed of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

152
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.913
<v Speaker 1>And then if you shown it the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you'd expect the speed of light to </v>

153
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>be the speed of light minus the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed.</v>

154
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:03.404
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what happens no matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>how fast the platform on which the </v>

155
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 1>person shining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lightest standing,</v>

156
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>the speed of light is always the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>two every observer.</v>

157
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people kind of thought of that is,</v>

158
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the only anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was one of them thought of that</v>

159
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.694
<v Speaker 1>is the only anomaly left in physics at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the 19th century and it </v>

160
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>turned out that was a bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long?</v>

161
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>There was some other ones as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that light tends to behave</v>

162
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 1>as a wave and a particle more or less at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>

163
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:28.184
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't seem possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a couple of things left over </v>

164
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 1>in Newtonian physics that Newtonian </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics couldn't explain,</v>

165
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 1>but by the end of the 19th century there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were famous scientists saying,</v>

166
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:37.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we got this all wrapped up.</v>

167
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.323
<v Speaker 1>There's really nothing left to discover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then along came quantum mechanics </v>

168
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:41.894
<v Speaker 1>and Einsteinian relativity and bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world was like really </v>

169
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:46.034
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And quantum mechanics is much more </v>

170
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive theory of the world then </v>
<v Speaker 1>Newtonian physics,</v>

171
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:55.190
<v Speaker 1>all of the electronics you use wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work if quantum physics wasn't correct.</v>

172
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.423
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that little tiny anomaly blew </v>

173
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.803
<v Speaker 1>into something that knocked the slats </v>
<v Speaker 1>out underneath from underneath the </v>

174
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 1>entire axiomatic structure of Newtonian </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>

175
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 1>It showed it was wrong at its </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental level,</v>

176
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 1>even though it turned out to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subset,</v>

177
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>a correct subset of something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>much broader.</v>

178
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>And so you can kind of think of that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what kids are doing.</v>

179
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:14.934
<v Speaker 1>As they progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they develop a theory that accounts for </v>

180
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 1>a certain set of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say facts,</v>

181
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a place it gets tricky.</v>

182
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And then they modify those and make them</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more refined.</v>

183
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 1>But now and then they have to undergo </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a transformation,</v>

184
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:27.204
<v Speaker 1>not be a stage transition in piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adyen thought that that's the stage </v>

185
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:31.644
<v Speaker 1>transition idea and that would be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense to Kuhnian scientific </v>

186
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:35.574
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what Piaget is trying to state here </v>

187
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:38.900
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

188
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 1>because there's this weird problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

189
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 1>which is that they tend to transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

190
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.713
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you go take a biology course </v>

191
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 1>right now in 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everything you read,</v>

192
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.423
<v Speaker 1>you learned are very much of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned will turn out to have been </v>

193
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.124
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of weird because it </v>

194
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:56.070
<v Speaker 1>isn't wrong right now and you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

195
00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:56.904
<v Speaker 1>how can it be wrong in 20 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's a really complicated </v>

196
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to solve that,</v>

197
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to think about facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>like tools instead of them as,</v>

198
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 1>as thinking about them as our objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent realities.</v>

199
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Because a bad tool can still work as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool,</v>

200
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>whereas a bad fact just kills your stone</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

201
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And so payers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

202
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.423
<v Speaker 1>in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be a completely </v>

203
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary phenomena.</v>

204
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.553
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

205
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

206
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.373
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

207
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.250
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no reason for that.</v>

208
00:10:57.251 --> 00:11:00.190
<v Speaker 1>That's just sheer spite as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>

209
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

210
00:11:04.091 --> 00:11:06.110
<v Speaker 1>so here's one of Piaget's propositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

211
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.020
<v Speaker 1>and it is that because facts flux in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense across time,</v>

212
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.263
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't change across time to call it a </v>

213
00:11:15.011 --> 00:11:15.844
<v Speaker 1>real fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what Piaget is trying to point </v>

214
00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:19.810
<v Speaker 1>out in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it introductory paragraph,</v>

215
00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:20.644
<v Speaker 1>is that the one thing that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>change is the manner in which people </v>

216
00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:24.970
<v Speaker 1>generate facts rather than the facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

217
00:11:24.971 --> 00:11:28.480
<v Speaker 1>So the ultimate fact is a fact about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way people generate fact.</v>

218
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.930
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget's theory and part is a,</v>

219
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.900
<v Speaker 1>is a theory about how knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquired and transformed.</v>

220
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.123
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not that not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a study of the knowledge </v>

221
00:11:37.871 --> 00:11:40.180
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a study of the process by which the</v>

222
00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:41.014
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is generated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he believed that that process was </v>

223
00:11:42.761 --> 00:11:45.250
<v Speaker 1>unchanging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least with regards to human beings.</v>

224
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.083
<v Speaker 1>And so you could think of the Piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic epistemological mystery as </v>

225
00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that people form and transform</v>

226
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of his conclusions about that is</v>

227
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:59.710
<v Speaker 1>that there's a standard process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the reason that I'm telling you</v>

228
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 1>about piaget right now is because as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I can tell,</v>

229
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:03.334
<v Speaker 1>the standard [inaudible] description of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which knowledge is </v>

230
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:06.994
<v Speaker 1>acquired and transformed is the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's represented in the </v>

231
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 1>mythology of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monic transformation,</v>

232
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:14.690
<v Speaker 1>which is that there's a state of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's disrupted,</v>

233
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 1>disrupted by something chaotic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a disintegration period.</v>

234
00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's the space between the stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitions for,</v>

235
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.563
<v Speaker 1>for children in which time they're often</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset because their little theory about </v>

236
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 1>the world isn't learning isn't working </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

237
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.533
<v Speaker 1>And then in that chaotic period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they adjust themselves to new anomalies </v>

238
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:32.794
<v Speaker 1>and anomalies are what occur when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>act in the world and what you want to </v>

239
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>happen doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

240
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Because that means there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with your knowledge structure.</v>

241
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 1>If you act and then something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to happen.</v>

242
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Something's wrong with the way you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>representing the world.</v>

243
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say something's wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

244
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>

245
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:50.194
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can modify the world as well as </v>

246
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 1>modifying their belief structures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do that a lot.</v>

247
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.773
<v Speaker 1>But so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the PPF git and stage transition as far </v>

248
00:12:58.991 --> 00:12:59.824
<v Speaker 1>as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a micro case of the broader idea of </v>

249
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.033
<v Speaker 1>the existence of an orderly state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dissolution into a chaotic state </v>

250
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 1>because something unexpected has </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred.</v>

251
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 1>And then it's re transformation into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more integrated state.</v>

252
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Now Piaget would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

253
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:14.763
<v Speaker 1>the initial state and the chaotic state </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the final state aren't the ultimate </v>

254
00:13:17.591 --> 00:13:18.424
<v Speaker 1>realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate reality is the process of </v>

255
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 1>moving through those stages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how people acquire knowledge.</v>

256
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that's the central element</v>

257
00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 1>of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's a,</v>

258
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.983
<v Speaker 1>that's another re representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero myth that because the hero is the </v>

259
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:35.580
<v Speaker 1>person who notes anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>note something that's changed.</v>

260
00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:38.410
<v Speaker 1>It's outside of explored territory in </v>
<v Speaker 1>counters.</v>

261
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 1>It defeats it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

262
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.520
<v Speaker 1>or get something of value from it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then recasts it into the world,</v>

263
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:47.920
<v Speaker 1>shares it with the community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>restructures the world.</v>

264
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the central story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

265
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not the central story of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

266
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:52.924
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's close enough for our purposes at </v>

267
00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

268
00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:57.910
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what piaget is about.</v>

269
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.320
<v Speaker 1>How to human beings encounter the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

270
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.420
<v Speaker 1>and what happens when they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing about the world for piaget</v>

271
00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:08.980
<v Speaker 1>is it's also a complicated place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly the set of,</v>

272
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.173
<v Speaker 1>it's not the set of all objective facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that remain to be discovered because </v>

273
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>piaget is a constructivist and he's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a pragmatist than he is.</v>

274
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Precisely a scientific realist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a complicated thing.</v>

275
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated thing.</v>

276
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if any of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is completely irrelevant,</v>

277
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if any of you listened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>my argument with Sam Harris,</v>

278
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:30.154
<v Speaker 1>but Sam Harris is a scientific realist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was trying to make at least in </v>

279
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:35.740
<v Speaker 1>part a p is Yeti and point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was having none of that,</v>

280
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

281
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but piaget makes the point and so,</v>

282
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let him speak in some sense</v>

283
00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:44.990
<v Speaker 1>as we proceed through this and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

284
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.320
<v Speaker 1>well you'll see why he does what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

285
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.723
<v Speaker 1>So if all knowledge is always in a state</v>
<v Speaker 1>of development and proceeding from one </v>

286
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 1>state</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a more complete and efficient one,</v>

287
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that implies a hierarchy of states,</v>

288
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:00.434
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you move from one knowledge </v>

289
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:01.784
<v Speaker 1>structure to the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes the previous one and is </v>

290
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:04.940
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

291
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's better because it covers more </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

292
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 1>That's how you know it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does the same thing.</v>

293
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 1>The old tool does plus some additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

294
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.033
<v Speaker 1>So it's a definition of better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing to have a definition </v>

295
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:16.274
<v Speaker 1>of better and worse if all knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 1>always in a state of development and </v>

296
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:22.340
<v Speaker 1>consists in proceeding from one state to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more complete deficient one.</v>

297
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.413
<v Speaker 1>Evidently it is a question of knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this development and analyzing it with </v>

298
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:27.194
<v Speaker 1>the greatest possible accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something I happen to agree </v>

299
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:30.704
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's partly because I read Piaget </v>

300
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:32.654
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think I understand what he meant </v>

301
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:34.634
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's quite the thinker and so I'm going </v>

302
00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 1>to see if I can pull you in a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this because it's,</v>

303
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.701
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

304
00:15:40.701 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>it's exceedingly complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

305
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 1>and most of the time when people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about piaget,</v>

306
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 1>they just talk about his surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments.</v>

307
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.920
<v Speaker 1>They don't talk about what he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually up to.</v>

308
00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:48.754
<v Speaker 1>And what he was up to was while he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how people </v>

309
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>represent the world and learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not only,</v>

310
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:55.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 1>this is another thing people don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about piaget,</v>

312
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:03.041
<v Speaker 1>is that he was trying to reconcile the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chasm between science and values.</v>

313
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what drove him through his entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual life.</v>

314
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.450
<v Speaker 1>He was attempting to bridge the gap </v>
<v Speaker 1>between science and religion.</v>

315
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.880
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was explicit.</v>

316
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:13.100
<v Speaker 1>He knew that that's why he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything he did.</v>

317
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 1>And so the thing that's so cool about </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget,</v>

318
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.573
<v Speaker 1>I think is that he actually started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide what you might think about as a </v>

319
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 1>rational basis for morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly rational.</v>

320
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing because it's rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational belief,</v>

321
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.183
<v Speaker 1>like scientific realism has a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of presuppositions at its core and </v>

322
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:35.060
<v Speaker 1>piaget doesn't use those presuppositions</v>
<v Speaker 1>to solve the problem.</v>

323
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.163
<v Speaker 1>The problem is so deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the gap between what is and what </v>

324
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 1>ought to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the David Hume's problem.</v>

325
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:42.284
<v Speaker 1>You can't derive an ought from an is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you know a bunch of things </v>

326
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give you an unerring guide to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to do about those things.</v>

327
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.933
<v Speaker 1>There's a gap there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Harris and people like him say that </v>

328
00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:55.610
<v Speaker 1>gap is illusory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most philosophers,</v>

329
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.890
<v Speaker 1>including David Hume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including piaget,</v>

330
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.210
<v Speaker 1>these are heavy duty people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including heidegger would,</v>

331
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.020
<v Speaker 1>would disagree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that,</v>

332
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:05.660
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that gap is nonexistent.</v>

333
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

334
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 1>and Harris believes that you can nest </v>
<v Speaker 1>values within science.</v>

335
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:10.604
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the proposition that he </v>

336
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 1>continually puts forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most of the so called new atheists.</v>

337
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 1>But it's a hell of a lot more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do than you think that's for sure.</v>

338
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

339
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 1>so how is Piaget proporting to manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

340
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing he does is he,</v>

341
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:27.403
<v Speaker 1>for piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really important that you have a </v>

342
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:30.920
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that's very</v>

343
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 1>cool about his thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about him as an early</v>

344
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:38.450
<v Speaker 1>exponent of embodied cognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's not exactly a Cartesian,</v>

345
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.373
<v Speaker 1>a follower of descartes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really believe that you have </v>

346
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:43.820
<v Speaker 1>a spirit or say a rational mind that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

347
00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:44.654
<v Speaker 1>separate from your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has an implicit presupposition of </v>

348
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:48.310
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

349
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical claims.</v>

350
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.773
<v Speaker 1>Piaget really sticks you in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that Piaget claims </v>

351
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:55.614
<v Speaker 1>is that your abstract knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually determined by the structure of </v>

352
00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 1>your body and that it unfolds from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body up into abstraction.</v>

353
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:05.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens as infants </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform into adults.</v>

354
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.350
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all their knowledge is embodied.</v>

355
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.210
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that it's not.</v>

356
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.793
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of different kinds of </v>

357
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:14.370
<v Speaker 1>memory like the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most</v>

358
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.500
<v Speaker 1>fundamental distinction you might think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of is between procedural representation,</v>

359
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.190
<v Speaker 1>procedural memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and representational memory.</v>

360
00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:24.024
<v Speaker 1>So when you remember your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little movie that runs in your </v>

361
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:26.604
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe the facts that you can recite </v>

362
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>about your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's episodic memory,</v>

363
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.840
<v Speaker 1>that's representational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but procedural memories,</v>

364
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 1>different procedural memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you walk,</v>

365
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how you walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you ride a bike.</v>

366
00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It's how you play the piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how you type.</v>

367
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's automatic,</v>

368
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:43.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built into your nervous system.</v>

369
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:44.274
<v Speaker 1>It's built into the nerves that </v>
<v Speaker 1>innervate your musculature and they're </v>

370
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 1>completely separate memory systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one can represent the other,</v>

371
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:51.834
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The representational system can </v>

372
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>represent the output of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what you happen.</v>

373
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.073
<v Speaker 1>What happens when someone tells a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when you tell a story about your </v>

374
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:01.284
<v Speaker 1>own life.</v>

375
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.720
<v Speaker 1>But the contents of procedural memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

376
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.633
<v Speaker 1>proceed the contents of representational</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory and they're shaped in different </v>

377
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

378
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.333
<v Speaker 1>part of the wisdom that's encoded in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body is there because of things </v>

379
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:14.904
<v Speaker 1>you've practiced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also there because you've </v>

380
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 1>practiced things in his social </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

381
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.283
<v Speaker 1>And so while you practice those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect of the social environment </v>

382
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:22.974
<v Speaker 1>shaped the way you learned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's encoded right in your </v>

383
00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 1>neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not representational,</v>

384
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.523
<v Speaker 1>it's encoded in the way you do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's encoded in the way you smile when </v>

385
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you look at someone or frown or when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

386
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's all implicit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not under your conscious control.</v>

387
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:37.944
<v Speaker 1>It's not even in that system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget figured this out and so </v>

388
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:41.664
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he said was that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start as an infant by building your </v>

389
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:47.370
<v Speaker 1>procedural memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not your representational memory.</v>

390
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 1>That's partly perhaps why you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember your infancy.</v>

391
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't actually don't have that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of representational memory there.</v>

392
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.370
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn to act,</v>

393
00:19:56.371 --> 00:19:57.204
<v Speaker 1>you build your body so that it can move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do that partly by experimenting </v>

394
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:01.404
<v Speaker 1>with your own body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also do that by experimenting </v>

395
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:03.984
<v Speaker 1>with your body in a context that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped from the beginning by the </v>

396
00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 1>presence of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

397
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you know a child learns how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeed.</v>

398
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.440
<v Speaker 1>It's mouth is pretty wired up right at </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth.</v>

399
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.303
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rest of its body isn't wired up </v>

400
00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:18.330
<v Speaker 1>very much at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but its mouth is and you might think,</v>

401
00:20:18.331 --> 00:20:19.164
<v Speaker 1>well that's just a reflex that piaget </v>
<v Speaker 1>would agree with that it's a builtin is </v>

402
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 1>something built in that that a baby can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do right at birth.</v>

403
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.880
<v Speaker 1>But even in the act of breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby has to learn how to modify that</v>

404
00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:33.690
<v Speaker 1>reflex so that it gets along with its </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

405
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So even at the very beginning with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

406
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you might think the most primordial </v>
<v Speaker 1>acts,</v>

407
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a sociological and influence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a mutual dynamic going on that's</v>

408
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:44.490
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important.</v>

409
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense for piaget,</v>

410
00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:48.334
<v Speaker 1>the structure of society is implicitly </v>
<v Speaker 1>built into the structure of the </v>

411
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:55.300
<v Speaker 1>procedural memory system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you might think</v>

412
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:58.150
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Piaget makes much of this because he</v>

413
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.090
<v Speaker 1>looks at the relationship between play </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dreams and imitation.</v>

414
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.193
<v Speaker 1>So he's kind of a quasi psychoanalyst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that means is that </v>

415
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:06.820
<v Speaker 1>coded in your behavior,</v>

416
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>coded in your behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

417
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.860
<v Speaker 1>is this is the social structure in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you emerged.</v>

418
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's coded in a way that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually understand.</v>

419
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.910
<v Speaker 1>You just know how to act and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can figure out how you're acting and you</v>

420
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:27.250
<v Speaker 1>can extract out of that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social rules.</v>

421
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:28.630
<v Speaker 1>But you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

422
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.640
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

423
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.620
<v Speaker 1>It meant that the rules were built into </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

424
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Here's the way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a wolf pack,</v>

425
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Wolfpack knows how to operate together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows how to hunt,</v>

426
00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.093
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And each wolf knows where every other </v>

427
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 1>wolf is in the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know.</v>

428
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:45.160
<v Speaker 1>They know that they don't have rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

429
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.290
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have laws.</v>

430
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 1>What they have is behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>regularities,</v>

431
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:53.590
<v Speaker 1>patterned behavioral regularities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are like a morality.</v>

432
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.551
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

433
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:56.020
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what they are.</v>

434
00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.640
<v Speaker 1>A dominance hierarchy of animals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't representational,</v>

435
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't have language.</v>

436
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.763
<v Speaker 1>At least they don't have language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dominance hierarchy is a kind of </v>

437
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of,</v>

438
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:07.983
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of setting up individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior within a social context to </v>

439
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:14.760
<v Speaker 1>maximize cooperation and minimize </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition and so on.</v>

440
00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.460
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget would say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Speaker 1>the origin of [inaudible] and Frans de </v>
<v Speaker 1>Waal,</v>

442
00:22:18.701 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 1>who's a great primatologist by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frenz F,</v>

443
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:21.401
<v Speaker 1>R,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

444
00:22:21.401 --> 00:22:22.031
<v Speaker 1>n,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s,</v>

445
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:22.930
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d,W ,</v>

446
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.940
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>l,</v>

447
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 1>he's written a lot of books about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of morality and chimpanzees in</v>

448
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:29.260
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

449
00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:30.094
<v Speaker 1>he follows the same line of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that the morality emerges out of </v>

450
00:22:32.711 --> 00:22:33.544
<v Speaker 1>the interaction between the chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's bounded by the necessity that </v>

451
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 1>the actions take certain forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

452
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 1>if the chimpanzees act in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>each of them kills everyone else,</v>

453
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's the end of it.</v>

454
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.753
<v Speaker 1>It's the end of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not a very functional </v>

455
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:48.440
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

456
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.120
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't produce survival of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

457
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:54.130
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't produce flourishing of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

458
00:22:54.131 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Certainly it produces extinction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and the death of the group.</v>

459
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 1>So as far as dwell would be concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>from an evolutionary perspective,</v>

460
00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:04.870
<v Speaker 1>that sort of mode of interacting is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead end.</v>

461
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.890
<v Speaker 1>And so one of Piaget's claims implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>claims is that,</v>

462
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.990
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant about piaget is that,</v>

463
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interactions between people,</v>

464
00:23:17.231 --> 00:23:18.064
<v Speaker 1>the social interactions between people </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily emerge within a kind of </v>

465
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:25.330
<v Speaker 1>bounded space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this space is the space of the game.</v>

466
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.040
<v Speaker 1>So we're always playing games always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a game,</v>

467
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:30.874
<v Speaker 1>you might think about a game as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>microcosm of the world and a small </v>

468
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 1>child's game is a tiny fraction of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>microcosm of the world.</v>

469
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.253
<v Speaker 1>But then you get up into adult games and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think about those maybe as </v>

470
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:43.780
<v Speaker 1>multiplayer online games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one good representation.</v>

471
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 1>But even more sophisticated things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a lawyer,</v>

472
00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:49.190
<v Speaker 1>say or like working at Mcdonald's or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things.</v>

473
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.203
<v Speaker 1>Those are also forms of game and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that P and people negotiate the </v>

474
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:58.160
<v Speaker 1>rules and that game is nested inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>sets of broader games.</v>

475
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 1>And so for Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game,</v>

476
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.623
<v Speaker 1>the chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the games that children play kind of </v>

477
00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:06.760
<v Speaker 1>transform inexhaustibly and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

478
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.160
<v Speaker 1>and what incrementally into the games </v>
<v Speaker 1>that adults play.</v>

479
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.253
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a game that's playable as an adult </v>

480
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.000
<v Speaker 1>is a functional game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an acceptable game.</v>

481
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:17.834
<v Speaker 1>And one of Piaget's claims is that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only do people start playing games </v>

482
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:22.694
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously in a sense and implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they start to play games more </v>

483
00:24:26.391 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 1>consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually,</v>

484
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.810
<v Speaker 1>they actually represent the games to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>

485
00:24:29.811 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 1>at least in their actions.</v>

486
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Then they start to learn the explicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of the game,</v>

487
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:36.320
<v Speaker 1>but only later after they know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play it.</v>

488
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 1>And then at the highest stage of moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

489
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:43.610
<v Speaker 1>they start to realize that not only are </v>
<v Speaker 1>they players of games and followers of a</v>

490
00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:46.820
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also producers of rules.</v>

491
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.013
<v Speaker 1>So it start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start out not being able to play a </v>

492
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:51.920
<v Speaker 1>game at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can play a game with yourself.</v>

493
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Then you can play a game with a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

494
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Then you can play rule governed games </v>
<v Speaker 1>with lots of people and then you realize</v>

495
00:24:58.161 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 1>that you make the rules and you can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>new games.</v>

496
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's the highest level of moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>development according to piaget.</v>

497
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brilliant.</v>

498
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:06.770
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bloody brilliant.</v>

499
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.663
<v Speaker 1>He's the first person that I ever really</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered who was able to put the </v>

500
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 1>notion of an emergent morality on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

501
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadly commensurate with the scientific</v>

502
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:17.420
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

503
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 1>But you have to understand that in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>

504
00:25:19.821 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 1>he had to sacrifice a little bit of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>notions of scientific realism.</v>

505
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's what basic sigma </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructivist.</v>

506
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.343
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we're going back to </v>

507
00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:30.380
<v Speaker 1>constructivism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says at the beginning,</v>

508
00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:32.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of knowledge,</v>

509
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:34.580
<v Speaker 1>just not unfold itself as a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance,</v>

510
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.630
<v Speaker 1>but forms of development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we said there's not only do knowledge</v>

511
00:25:38.631 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 1>structures change across time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're embedded in the social world,</v>

512
00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:43.064
<v Speaker 1>but the manner in which they change </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time actually has a bit of a </v>

513
00:25:45.261 --> 00:25:46.094
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be the Piagetian </v>

514
00:25:47.211 --> 00:25:49.280
<v Speaker 1>stages of development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know,</v>

515
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:50.114
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have debated ever since piaget </v>

516
00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:53.110
<v Speaker 1>proposed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

517
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.780
<v Speaker 1>if those developmental stages are fixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and necessary,</v>

518
00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.360
<v Speaker 1>and if he identified them properly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

519
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.030
<v Speaker 1>and as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they could be sped up,</v>

520
00:26:02.031 --> 00:26:04.220
<v Speaker 1>which he always called the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

521
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.470
<v Speaker 1>could you speed up these stages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development?</v>

522
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.190
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of argument about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether those stages exist in the manner</v>

523
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:12.650
<v Speaker 1>that piaget described are and whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fixed it,</v>

524
00:26:12.651 --> 00:26:13.484
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's still the fundamental </v>

525
00:26:14.961 --> 00:26:15.794
<v Speaker 1>elements of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fundamental element of his </v>

526
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:18.480
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

527
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.130
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>

528
00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:21.964
<v Speaker 1>in suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cognitive domain has an absolute </v>

529
00:26:23.361 --> 00:26:25.130
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you were,</v>

530
00:26:25.131 --> 00:26:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you're here now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at one point you weren't.</v>

531
00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:30.200
<v Speaker 1>So there was an absolute beginning to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you as a phenomena,</v>

532
00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.770
<v Speaker 1>it's to be studied at the very stages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gnawing,</v>

533
00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.613
<v Speaker 1>known as formation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his rationalization for being a </v>

534
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:36.890
<v Speaker 1>genetic epistemologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

535
00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Someone who studies the formation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge structures across time like an</v>

536
00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:42.020
<v Speaker 1>embryologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like that,</v>

537
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:43.800
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who developmental embryologist,</v>

538
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.813
<v Speaker 1>the first name of genetic epistemology </v>
<v Speaker 1>is therefore if one can say so to take </v>

539
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 1>psychology seriously and to furnish </v>
<v Speaker 1>verifications to any question which each</v>

540
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:52.764
<v Speaker 1>epistemology necessarily raises yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing the generally unsatisfying </v>

541
00:26:56.161 --> 00:26:56.994
<v Speaker 1>speculative or implicit psychology with </v>
<v Speaker 1>controllable analysis and so basically </v>

542
00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 1>what he's saying there is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess at his stance like Freud did about</v>

543
00:27:04.951 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 1>developmental psychology.</v>

544
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.043
<v Speaker 1>Freud kind of projected backwards from </v>
<v Speaker 1>his patients into the dim mist of </v>

545
00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:10.974
<v Speaker 1>childhood and came up with like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>would a hypothetical developmental </v>

546
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:15.480
<v Speaker 1>sequence and Piaget said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

547
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:16.314
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go run experiments on </v>

548
00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often individuals,</v>

549
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes multiple individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>

550
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.630
<v Speaker 1>we're going to observe exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

551
00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 1>He watched his kids in their cribs for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

552
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:27.834
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably intently and with great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like an ethos logist which is a </v>

553
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 1>person who studies animal behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>observationally like Frans to wall.</v>

554
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.173
<v Speaker 1>He was like an ethos adjust of children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly an experimental </v>

555
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:39.744
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although also an experimental </v>

556
00:27:41.191 --> 00:27:42.024
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and he more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>established the field of developmental </v>

557
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:46.230
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

558
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:47.064
<v Speaker 1>well let's empirically analyze how </v>
<v Speaker 1>children learn and then maybe we can </v>

559
00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:53.340
<v Speaker 1>figure out how this knowledge process </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfolds and we don't have to guess about</v>

560
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:53.430
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

561
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can use controllable analysis.</v>

562
00:27:55.711 --> 00:27:56.544
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say he introduced </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific methodology even though he </v>

563
00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:00.114
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a scientific realist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he introduced scientific methodology </v>

564
00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:03.234
<v Speaker 1>into the study of child development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly into the study of </v>

565
00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 1>how knowledge structures unfold across </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

566
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.323
<v Speaker 1>So he was a philosopher as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a strange type of philosopher </v>

567
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 1>because he was interested in how </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy itself emerges in the mind of</v>

568
00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 1>the child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what piaget was up to.</v>

569
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:19.404
<v Speaker 1>And so quite quite remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had credibly wide range of </v>

570
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:26.430
<v Speaker 1>interests be fitting someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably had an Iq of like 190 I mean he</v>

571
00:28:26.431 --> 00:28:28.890
<v Speaker 1>was seriously smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way,</v>

572
00:28:28.891 --> 00:28:29.724
<v Speaker 1>way outside of the normal range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this is the sort of questions he </v>

573
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:33.960
<v Speaker 1>was trying to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

574
00:28:33.961 --> 00:28:34.794
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what you base your judgments because </v>

575
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.820
<v Speaker 1>you make judgments about things better </v>
<v Speaker 1>or worse.</v>

576
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

577
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.060
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

578
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.770
<v Speaker 1>how do you come up with that ability?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that emerge?</v>

579
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 1>And on what basis do you make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgments?</v>

580
00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a famous ruling on pornography </v>

581
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:50.394
<v Speaker 1>that I believe the Supreme Court of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States laid down and one of the </v>

582
00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:54.264
<v Speaker 1>justices wrote something that's become </v>
<v Speaker 1>infamous or famous depending on how you </v>

583
00:28:57.421 --> 00:28:57.931
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

584
00:28:57.931 --> 00:28:59.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't define pornography,</v>

585
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:01.620
<v Speaker 1>but I know it when I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

586
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.823
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a notion of the incomplete </v>

587
00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:05.634
<v Speaker 1>ability of the representational system </v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent the contents of implicit </v>

588
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:11.940
<v Speaker 1>perception or the or the procedural </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

589
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.100
<v Speaker 1>You can know that you know something but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

590
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.700
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you can describe why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean you can describe how you</v>

591
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:20.310
<v Speaker 1>know it and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you focus your eyes?</v>

592
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know how you focus your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

593
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 1>You just focus them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.370
<v Speaker 1>how do you smile like this?</v>

595
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe less ugly,</v>

596
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't describe how you do it.</v>

597
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:32.304
<v Speaker 1>You can't describe the musculature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can represent the output of the act </v>

598
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.503
<v Speaker 1>and you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't represent it and you're </v>

599
00:29:38.191 --> 00:29:42.670
<v Speaker 1>just stuffed full of skills like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is another example of the way that</v>

600
00:29:42.671 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 1>you're way more complicated than your </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of you.</v>

601
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:46.763
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things people often ask is </v>

602
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 1>how can we use the rat has a model of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person cause like,</v>

603
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rats,</v>

604
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 1>not much of a person depending of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the person.</v>

605
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.730
<v Speaker 1>But the real answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

606
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.390
<v Speaker 1>compared to what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like compared to your understanding of a</v>

607
00:30:01.391 --> 00:30:04.300
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rat is an excellent model of a person.</v>

608
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as good a model of a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a person is.</v>

609
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 1>But compared to imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's in comparatively better.</v>

610
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because we share like,</v>

611
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>98% of our genes or some damn thing with</v>

612
00:30:18.881 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 1>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

613
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.703
<v Speaker 1>it's really up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we share 90% of our genes with </v>

614
00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 1>yeast for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

615
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:26.970
<v Speaker 1>And so we're a lot more rat lake than </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeast.</v>

616
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.813
<v Speaker 1>Like so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think with chimps it's over 99% </v>

617
00:30:30.941 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a bad model.</v>

618
00:30:32.651 --> 00:30:33.484
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it always depends on what you </v>

619
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:36.760
<v Speaker 1>compare it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

620
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:39.040
<v Speaker 1>when you hear animal rights activists </v>
<v Speaker 1>say things like,</v>

621
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:39.874
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can replace that with computer </v>

622
00:30:40.691 --> 00:30:41.830
<v Speaker 1>simulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

623
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't because you can't simulate what</v>

624
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't know or at least not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

625
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's a silly idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

626
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.193
<v Speaker 1>even though they have a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so great to torture animals to </v>

627
00:30:52.061 --> 00:30:55.000
<v Speaker 1>death and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what are his norms?</v>

628
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

629
00:30:56.351 --> 00:31:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Where do norms for behavior come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have norms when they're violated,</v>

630
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:02.170
<v Speaker 1>it annoys you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you know what your norms</v>

631
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:03.004
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do kind of get a sense of what </v>

632
00:31:04.391 --> 00:31:07.210
<v Speaker 1>they are when they get violated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really upset me.</v>

633
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

634
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know.</v>

635
00:31:09.461 --> 00:31:10.294
<v Speaker 1>You might have to think about that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like six months while you got so upset </v>

636
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:15.370
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can notice that you got upset.</v>

637
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you do have </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations and norms,</v>

638
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:20.350
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't know where they came from.</v>

639
00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously in part they came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your intrinsic structure,</v>

640
00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:24.694
<v Speaker 1>but also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a consequence of your </v>

641
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 1>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even more importantly,</v>

642
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:30.700
<v Speaker 1>there are consequence of your learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a social environment.</v>

643
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.713
<v Speaker 1>So all of those phenomena which exceed </v>
<v Speaker 1>your comprehension determine the nature </v>

644
00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:36.844
<v Speaker 1>of your norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often you only detect them when </v>

645
00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:39.034
<v Speaker 1>they're violated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because why bother paying attention </v>

646
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:43.420
<v Speaker 1>to something that works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't.</v>

647
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.480
<v Speaker 1>No one does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take it for granted.</v>

648
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.910
<v Speaker 1>It's almost the definition of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

649
00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

650
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you think I'm driving my car to school </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think you're in a car,</v>

651
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:55.024
<v Speaker 1>but you're very naughty in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in a thing that gets you from </v>

652
00:31:56.861 --> 00:32:01.150
<v Speaker 1>home to school and you can pretend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so annoying.</v>

653
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.550
<v Speaker 1>You can pretend that.</v>

654
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.530
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

655
00:32:21.531 --> 00:32:22.940
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

656
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:23.953
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a weird example is this is </v>

657
00:32:25.251 --> 00:32:28.970
<v Speaker 1>this object with objective qualities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you call a car,</v>

658
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.043
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't exactly how you actually </v>

659
00:32:31.431 --> 00:32:34.130
<v Speaker 1>perceive or act towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is,</v>

660
00:32:34.131 --> 00:32:36.530
<v Speaker 1>is that as long as it's doing what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do,</v>

661
00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 1>which means that its function is intact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what it is,</v>

662
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can use a really low resolution</v>

663
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 1>representation of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The car is just what gets you from point</v>

664
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 1>a to point B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

665
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:50.540
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the damn thing at all,</v>

666
00:32:50.541 --> 00:32:52.970
<v Speaker 1>it's completely invisible to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't.</v>

667
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.800
<v Speaker 1>When it quits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as it quits,</v>

668
00:32:54.801 --> 00:32:57.140
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like bang car.</v>

669
00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand this thing at all.</v>

670
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Now what do I do?</v>

671
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you panic a little bit,</v>

672
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

673
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you know about your car?</v>

674
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

675
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And worse than that,</v>

676
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:09.014
<v Speaker 1>now the car is become the intersection </v>
<v Speaker 1>between you and whoever's going to fix </v>

677
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:13.754
<v Speaker 1>your card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that introduces a whole bunch of </v>

678
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 1>human elements into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like are they going to figure out what's</v>

679
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:19.200
<v Speaker 1>wrong with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they going to rip you off?</v>

680
00:33:19.201 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Is your car ever going to work again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to get to work?</v>

681
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:23.054
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of a sudden that thing that you </v>

682
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:27.980
<v Speaker 1>were in that was a car turns into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>

683
00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably complicated thing.</v>

684
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your initial representation of it.</v>

685
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:39.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's really low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one bit and then bang,</v>

686
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 1>it breaks down and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity,</v>

687
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:44.930
<v Speaker 1>complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity everywhere.</v>

688
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.930
<v Speaker 1>And that complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the world's made out.</v>

689
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:48.763
<v Speaker 1>If you remember we talked about William </v>
<v Speaker 1>James in that crazy nitrous oxide </v>

690
00:33:52.191 --> 00:33:56.840
<v Speaker 1>induced pseudo tippy poetry that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing in the 1890s when he was talking</v>

691
00:33:56.841 --> 00:33:57.674
<v Speaker 1>about chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that chaos that he was talking </v>

692
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:02.120
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of which order emerges,</v>

693
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.750
<v Speaker 1>that's the same thing as that complexity</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hovering in the background.</v>

694
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And children have to operate in a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually that complex.</v>

695
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:11.360
<v Speaker 1>But they're not smart enough and neither</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you.</v>

696
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.373
<v Speaker 1>So they build partial representations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of work and the parents </v>

697
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:18.640
<v Speaker 1>scaffold them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way children manage this,</v>

698
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.450
<v Speaker 1>like children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know anything but stay.</v>

699
00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:22.280
<v Speaker 1>They're still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's up with that?</v>

700
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.593
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it is the child is laying out </v>

701
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:26.533
<v Speaker 1>one of its procedures in the world in </v>
<v Speaker 1>accordance with its understanding and </v>

702
00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:31.700
<v Speaker 1>something goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does the child do?</v>

703
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Cries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

704
00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.420
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it defaults.</v>

705
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:37.300
<v Speaker 1>It defaults to this distress cry.</v>

706
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.133
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is the adults move in </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their superior skills and their </v>

707
00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.313
<v Speaker 1>enhanced understanding and they mediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the partial knowledge of the </v>

708
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:49.130
<v Speaker 1>child and the actual complex world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And without the child.</v>

709
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.220
<v Speaker 1>That's why if you take your child to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mall and just leave,</v>

710
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:53.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take very long for them to </v>

711
00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:55.490
<v Speaker 1>get really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

712
00:34:55.491 --> 00:34:57.080
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really upset,</v>

713
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:58.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the child,</v>

714
00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.670
<v Speaker 1>some of them almost instantaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

715
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.550
<v Speaker 1>one day I was in the Boston airport with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter,</v>

716
00:35:04.551 --> 00:35:06.860
<v Speaker 1>she was about three and three and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

717
00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:07.694
<v Speaker 1>And my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was about two and we were there to </v>

718
00:35:09.351 --> 00:35:10.910
<v Speaker 1>pick someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just packed.</v>

719
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.860
<v Speaker 1>And so I had them by the hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my daughter a bunch,</v>

721
00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:16.004
<v Speaker 1>if she ever got separated from me in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd just to sit down immediately </v>

722
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.230
<v Speaker 1>wherever she was or as close there by </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

723
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I would find her don't move well.</v>

724
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Somehow I got separated from them and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>look behind them and they weren't there.</v>

725
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:30.044
<v Speaker 1>And I found out later she followed </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else who looked like me from </v>

726
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:34.460
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>

727
00:35:34.461 --> 00:35:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I found her in about three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

728
00:35:36.411 --> 00:35:39.190
<v Speaker 1>which is a long time man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're three years old at an airport,</v>

729
00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.790
<v Speaker 1>she was sitting there like paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

730
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:42.923
<v Speaker 1>butter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her brother was with her and he didn't </v>

731
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:46.650
<v Speaker 1>care at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason he didn't care is because</v>

732
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:48.720
<v Speaker 1>as far as he was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was an adult.</v>

733
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.280
<v Speaker 1>But as far as she was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was an abandoned kid in an airport.</v>

734
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very hard on her.</v>

735
00:35:55.051 --> 00:35:56.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:35:56.611 --> 00:35:57.444
<v Speaker 1>she was protected from the complexity by</v>
<v Speaker 1>her primordial representations in my </v>

737
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Speaker 1>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as my presence disappeared,</v>

738
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:06.900
<v Speaker 1>the complexity came flooding back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just overwhelmed her.</v>

739
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's chaos and uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd cry and the cry says,</v>

740
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.230
<v Speaker 1>help I motive by league,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm drowning,</v>

741
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm drowning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.593
<v Speaker 1>intervene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how kids in part can get </v>

743
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:20.320
<v Speaker 1>along in the world with their incomplete</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge representation.</v>

744
00:36:20.321 --> 00:36:23.460
<v Speaker 1>So always also how you get along in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world because you're,</v>

745
00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:24.294
<v Speaker 1>it's incomplete beyond belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got all these other people </v>

746
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 1>around you in the whole damn society </v>
<v Speaker 1>filling in the gaps.</v>

747
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.610
<v Speaker 1>And so you walk around like you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing,</v>

748
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:33.530
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

749
00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 1>you just hardly know it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

750
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:38.040
<v Speaker 1>if you can fit into that system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

751
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 1>you've got it on your side and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>use it to fill the gaps.</v>

752
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.443
<v Speaker 1>That's also partly why people are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with maintaining their social </v>

753
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the real identity.</v>

754
00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about some surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

755
00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:49.434
<v Speaker 1>but you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have set up a set of </v>

756
00:36:53.011 --> 00:36:56.940
<v Speaker 1>expectations and desires about how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want the world to unfold,</v>

757
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.133
<v Speaker 1>and you do that within a social context </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as long as your desires and the </v>

758
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.090
<v Speaker 1>actions of the community match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you're at home,</v>

759
00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they match,</v>

760
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.650
<v Speaker 1>you stay emotionally regulated.</v>

761
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 1>You like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can stay calm in here.</v>

762
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:17.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like your desires are being played </v>
<v Speaker 1>out by everyone else because one of your</v>

763
00:37:17.551 --> 00:37:18.384
<v Speaker 1>desires is that none of these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>primates starts brandishing a knife for </v>

764
00:37:21.121 --> 00:37:24.150
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even twitching or any of that sort of</v>

765
00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:26.340
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want any of that.</v>

766
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:27.743
<v Speaker 1>And if it starts happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you get wary very quickly and </v>

767
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe you look and maybe you won't and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll freeze.</v>

768
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll get the hell out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll get aggressive,</v>

769
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.150
<v Speaker 1>but that match has to maintain itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>intact.</v>

770
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Or your entire nervous system gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>dysregulated.</v>

771
00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:44.520
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that as soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>as that matches disrupted,</v>

772
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:48.120
<v Speaker 1>the underlying complexity and chaos of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world reveals itself.</v>

773
00:37:48.121 --> 00:37:53.040
<v Speaker 1>And so does your inadequacy and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body defaults into Predator mode.</v>

774
00:37:53.041 --> 00:37:53.874
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that you don't know </v>

775
00:37:55.261 --> 00:37:56.094
<v Speaker 1>anything and that everything is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated becomes very evident to you </v>

776
00:37:58.681 --> 00:37:59.514
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

777
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:00.533
<v Speaker 1>And people hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing that can happen to </v>

778
00:38:03.631 --> 00:38:05.700
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom falling out of their world.</v>

779
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.043
<v Speaker 1>And so that happens more when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental presumptions about things </v>

780
00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:10.434
<v Speaker 1>are are challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to solve the problem </v>

781
00:38:13.111 --> 00:38:15.510
<v Speaker 1>of what constitutes a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>

782
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.433
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know which presupposition is </v>

783
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.523
<v Speaker 1>peripheral in which one central?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell in part because the </v>

784
00:38:21.871 --> 00:38:26.700
<v Speaker 1>more upset you get about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more central it is that that thing's</v>

785
00:38:26.701 --> 00:38:28.740
<v Speaker 1>about to your entire structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

786
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.753
<v Speaker 1>And that's one way of getting into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious structure of bleed from a </v>

787
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that happens to me,</v>

788
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:35.574
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a therapist has all be talking to my </v>

789
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:38.224
<v Speaker 1>clients and they'll be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something difficult and all of a sudden </v>

790
00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:42.350
<v Speaker 1>they'll cry and they often don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

791
00:38:42.351 --> 00:38:43.660
<v Speaker 1>And so I stopped them right there.</v>

792
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like something went through your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

793
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:46.683
<v Speaker 1>something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cry indicates that you've moved </v>

794
00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:50.434
<v Speaker 1>beyond your domain of competence out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the unknown world all of a sudden </v>

795
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.330
<v Speaker 1>into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that chaos,</v>

796
00:38:55.331 --> 00:38:57.820
<v Speaker 1>what exactly happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>

797
00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:58.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're usually embarrassed that they </v>

798
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:01.660
<v Speaker 1>cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often they can remember what flitted</v>

799
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 1>through their mind and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented,</v>

800
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.593
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some encounter with the chaos </v>

801
00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:09.670
<v Speaker 1>beyond their conceptual systems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces that emotional response.</v>

802
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 1>And then we can dig into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find Out,</v>

803
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:12.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a trauma.</v>

804
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Especially if it's more than a year and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a half old.</v>

805
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And those can be a various depths and </v>
<v Speaker 1>profundity,</v>

806
00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're so bad that the person</v>

807
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:23.290
<v Speaker 1>just breaks down completely and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>never put themselves together.</v>

808
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.343
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when something's just wall up to </v>

809
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:27.520
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hit you right at the bottom of your</v>

810
00:39:27.521 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 1>axiomatic structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

811
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:30.004
<v Speaker 1>right at the trunk.</v>

812
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.510
<v Speaker 1>But when you're doing therapy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you watch how they respond to</v>

813
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.353
<v Speaker 1>emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look for those tiny eruptions of </v>

814
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:36.394
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are like holes in their </v>

815
00:39:38.111 --> 00:39:38.944
<v Speaker 1>conceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those have to be sewed up by their </v>

816
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:43.660
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You in the process of dialogue,</v>

817
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.830
<v Speaker 1>you figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

818
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.250
<v Speaker 1>there was a bit of unexplored territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that manifested itself.</v>

819
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.353
<v Speaker 1>It produced an emotional response in you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that indicates that you've reverted in </v>

820
00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:52.924
<v Speaker 1>some sense to childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the Friday and </v>

821
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.443
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have to figure out what it was </v>

822
00:39:57.401 --> 00:40:00.340
<v Speaker 1>that it's in that whole what caused that</v>
<v Speaker 1>tear.</v>

823
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.353
<v Speaker 1>And then we have to go back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate it and analyze it and study </v>

824
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:04.444
<v Speaker 1>it until we can sew it up and then and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our t and and get to the gist of it to </v>

825
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:08.794
<v Speaker 1>make it into a adaptive story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can leave it behind and it </v>

826
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:15.310
<v Speaker 1>actually produces neurological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation as you do that.</v>

827
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.143
<v Speaker 1>The memories in some sense actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved their psychophysiological </v>

828
00:40:19.121 --> 00:40:19.954
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say their location in your </v>

829
00:40:22.211 --> 00:40:23.044
<v Speaker 1>psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also note that the brain </v>

830
00:40:25.811 --> 00:40:27.970
<v Speaker 1>systems that are handling the memories </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't the same.</v>

831
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:29.583
<v Speaker 1>So they're much more limbic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're way lower and closer to the </v>

832
00:40:31.691 --> 00:40:33.940
<v Speaker 1>emotional centers when it's still raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma.</v>

833
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:34.774
<v Speaker 1>And by the time it's fully articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more represented in an articulated </v>

834
00:40:38.051 --> 00:40:39.640
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a causal story.</v>

835
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.833
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why writing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional events actually helps you </v>

836
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.160
<v Speaker 1>overcome them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

837
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:49.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's possible that writing about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that you overcome emotional events</v>

838
00:40:49.631 --> 00:40:53.200
<v Speaker 1>in general is actually the best kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy right now.</v>

839
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.093
<v Speaker 1>How do you solve a particular problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how is it that you orient yourself </v>

840
00:40:57.281 --> 00:41:01.000
<v Speaker 1>in the world so that you solve the class</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that there are problems,</v>

841
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.201
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

842
00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:04.690
<v Speaker 1>that's the ultimate story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the hero myth.</v>

843
00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge generating process that piaget</v>

844
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:11.280
<v Speaker 1>is talking about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because you have,</v>

845
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.570
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly overcoming problems in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

846
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:14.763
<v Speaker 1>And the problems are that you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to get what you want from the </v>

847
00:41:16.751 --> 00:41:19.720
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you get that mismatch mismatch.</v>

848
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.673
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got whole brain systems that are </v>

849
00:41:21.461 --> 00:41:24.460
<v Speaker 1>designed to do nothing but detect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mismatch,</v>

850
00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:25.323
<v Speaker 1>like crucial central brain structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about that a lot when we </v>

851
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 1>get into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the physiology.</v>

852
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

853
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.573
<v Speaker 1>how does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what is an individual basis </v>

854
00:41:34.551 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 1>judgments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are his norms?</v>

855
00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:36.914
<v Speaker 1>How are they validated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know if you're right about </v>

856
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:39.704
<v Speaker 1>your norms?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the interest of such norms for </v>

857
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:44.840
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of science in general?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really tough one.</v>

858
00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:45.674
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have norms and expectations as </v>

859
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:52.610
<v Speaker 1>a human being and because of that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a determining influence on the</v>

860
00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 1>manner in which you conduct science.</v>

861
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.023
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one of the problems with the </v>

862
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:00.950
<v Speaker 1>street realist view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could be having a discussion and I</v>

863
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:01.521
<v Speaker 1>could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

864
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:04.340
<v Speaker 1>you know that tile is to the right of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tile.</v>

865
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:05.503
<v Speaker 1>And then I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this brick is smaller than that </v>

866
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 1>brick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I could say,</v>

867
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roof is white,</v>

868
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 1>really quite white there and it's dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>back there.</v>

869
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And like after about 20 statements like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

870
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:18.470
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to want to slap me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that,</v>

871
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:22.010
<v Speaker 1>well those statements are perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid representations of fact,</v>

872
00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.060
<v Speaker 1>but there's an infinite number of facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of them are irrelevant.</v>

873
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

874
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.760
<v Speaker 1>The facts have to be relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

875
00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:32.594
<v Speaker 1>if you come to a lecture and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person does is tell you irrelevant </v>

876
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.140
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>

877
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.790
<v Speaker 1>You've been in lots of lectures like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

878
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.133
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you start fantasizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about something that might be more </v>

879
00:42:41.751 --> 00:42:46.751
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

880
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:51.380
<v Speaker 1>or you go to sleep because your brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot smarter than you are.</v>

881
00:42:51.381 --> 00:42:54.500
<v Speaker 1>It figures hell if all we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get exposed to here as an infant,</v>

882
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.483
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of irrelevant facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might as well have a nap until </v>

883
00:42:58.161 --> 00:43:00.860
<v Speaker 1>something important happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's true.</v>

884
00:43:00.861 --> 00:43:03.470
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is going to get big.</v>

885
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what happens next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

886
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

887
00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:08.354
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then how does the fact that the </v>

888
00:43:10.161 --> 00:43:13.000
<v Speaker 1>child children think differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

889
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.430
<v Speaker 1>effect our presumption of fact itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children live in the world,</v>

890
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:19.280
<v Speaker 1>they think differently about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet they survive.</v>

891
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.780
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

892
00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I already mentioned a partial solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

893
00:43:23.181 --> 00:43:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Adults intercede,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

894
00:43:24.321 --> 00:43:25.820
<v Speaker 1>around the edges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the borders.</v>

895
00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Children do this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May,</v>

896
00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 1>so it's called referencing.</v>

897
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do it two ways.</v>

898
00:43:30.861 --> 00:43:31.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

899
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.713
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a room with your child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe two way and most runs across the </v>

900
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:38.000
<v Speaker 1>child will orient to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it,</v>

901
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.130
<v Speaker 1>track it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much unconscious.</v>

902
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.540
<v Speaker 1>And the mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

903
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:42.403
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the child looks at the mouse </v>

904
00:43:44.061 --> 00:43:44.894
<v Speaker 1>and it looks at the mother and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason is is because the child doesn't </v>

905
00:43:47.511 --> 00:43:48.344
<v Speaker 1>know what the mouse is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then it looks at the mother to </v>

906
00:43:50.601 --> 00:43:51.434
<v Speaker 1>read from the mother's face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a projection screen of </v>

907
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:54.404
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to classify the mouse in terms of </v>

908
00:43:55.971 --> 00:43:58.490
<v Speaker 1>import.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the mother is like all calm about</v>

909
00:43:58.491 --> 00:44:00.170
<v Speaker 1>it and it gives the kid a pad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

910
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

911
00:44:00.951 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

912
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:07.460
<v Speaker 1>not to danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the most is first danger,</v>

913
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.760
<v Speaker 1>not danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way after that that it's a mouth.</v>

914
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.751
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

915
00:44:11.751 --> 00:44:12.584
<v Speaker 1>it's the most to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like these things are not so </v>

916
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:16.970
<v Speaker 1>straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not so straight forward.</v>

917
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.480
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the mother climbs up on the table,</v>

918
00:44:19.481 --> 00:44:20.314
<v Speaker 1>it has a screaming fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the child's already prepared </v>

919
00:44:22.581 --> 00:44:25.970
<v Speaker 1>because of this anomaly to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally responsive.</v>

920
00:44:25.971 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 1>The child looks at the mother's face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got terror on it.</v>

921
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 1>The most child thinks small danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big danger.</v>

922
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phobia,</v>

923
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.093
<v Speaker 1>phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all kids that won't happen to cause </v>

924
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:37.824
<v Speaker 1>some are very emotionally robust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if their child's very high in </v>

925
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:42.390
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait neuroticism,</v>

926
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.433
<v Speaker 1>the probability that they'll develop a </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent semipermanent fear of the </v>

927
00:44:47.191 --> 00:44:48.024
<v Speaker 1>mouse is extraordinarily high and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should happen because the mother </v>

928
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 1>tells you what the most is in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it say mouse?</v>

929
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:56.303
<v Speaker 1>It says safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danger and that's the first thing you </v>

930
00:44:58.261 --> 00:44:59.160
<v Speaker 1>want to know about something.</v>

931
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.570
<v Speaker 1>He said safer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it dangerous?</v>

932
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:01.703
<v Speaker 1>And that's a tricky one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A because whether something is safe or </v>

933
00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:06.420
<v Speaker 1>dangerous is not exactly no objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

934
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:07.703
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy named Jj Gibson who wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>a book called an ecological approach to </v>

935
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:11.574
<v Speaker 1>visual perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would highly recommend and his </v>

936
00:45:13.951 --> 00:45:14.784
<v Speaker 1>claim in that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real work of genius I believe is </v>

937
00:45:16.651 --> 00:45:19.290
<v Speaker 1>that when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you walk towards a cliff,</v>

938
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:23.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a cliff and infer danger,</v>

939
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:27.570
<v Speaker 1>what you see as a falling off place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you infer cliff.</v>

940
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.850
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that some of you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>vertigo.</v>

941
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:30.684
<v Speaker 1>You go up on the 26th floor out into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>balcony and it's like you don't want to </v>

942
00:45:33.271 --> 00:45:34.104
<v Speaker 1>go near the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you feel like you're going to </v>

943
00:45:35.071 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 1>throw yourself over because people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of what if,</v>

944
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:39.330
<v Speaker 1>what if I fell or what if I jumped over?</v>

945
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.163
<v Speaker 1>It's like stay away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that perception of the danger </v>

946
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 1>precedes your perception of the balcony </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the object.</v>

947
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that's how your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wired.</v>

948
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.940
<v Speaker 1>The danger's first object's second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people with blind sight,</v>

949
00:45:53.941 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 1>who I've talked about before who think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're blind,</v>

950
00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.413
<v Speaker 1>they can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they tell you that they can still </v>

951
00:45:58.861 --> 00:45:59.694
<v Speaker 1>detect fearful faces and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>detect their detection by measuring </v>

952
00:46:02.431 --> 00:46:05.290
<v Speaker 1>their skin conductance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so their eyes are mapping right onto</v>

953
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.910
<v Speaker 1>their fear and reflex systems without </v>
<v Speaker 1>any intermediary of objective perception</v>

954
00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:09.744
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking that what you see </v>

955
00:46:12.241 --> 00:46:14.760
<v Speaker 1>in the world is the objective world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then infer its meaning.</v>

956
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.360
<v Speaker 1>It could easily be exactly backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it looks like if you look at how the</v>

957
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:21.480
<v Speaker 1>brain is set up that it is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually backwards,</v>

958
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 1>or at least parallel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

959
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.510
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the danger,</v>

960
00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:25.440
<v Speaker 1>not danger.</v>

961
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Perception has to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

962
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:29.010
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fast.</v>

963
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 1>And so it proceeds the more elaborate </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive interpretations,</v>

964
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:33.803
<v Speaker 1>even the perceptions because it actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a while to see something because </v>

965
00:46:36.631 --> 00:46:38.250
<v Speaker 1>it's really complicated to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

966
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.970
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't just wait around to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damn thing before you act.</v>

967
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.953
<v Speaker 1>You just not fast enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they say if you're a pro tennis </v>

968
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:48.480
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time it takes the ball to leave your</v>

969
00:46:48.481 --> 00:46:52.080
<v Speaker 1>opponent's racket to get to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not long enough for you to plan any</v>

970
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:52.914
<v Speaker 1>motor act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're doing is you've got the </v>

971
00:46:55.441 --> 00:46:56.274
<v Speaker 1>moat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you disinhibit the motor act by looking </v>

972
00:46:57.601 --> 00:47:00.420
<v Speaker 1>at the stance of your opponent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching.</v>

973
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And by the time they hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're already prepared for the response</v>

974
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Speaker 1>because you're just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming at 120 miles an hour.</v>

975
00:47:06.721 --> 00:47:10.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's going 50 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the reflexes for it.</v>

976
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.480
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

977
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.720
<v Speaker 1>your eyes are making your body ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>without in some sense,</v>

978
00:47:15.721 --> 00:47:16.554
<v Speaker 1>without your conscious perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become conscious if you make a </v>

979
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:20.190
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

980
00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:21.024
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what consciousness is </v>

981
00:47:21.781 --> 00:47:23.100
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like detect error,</v>

982
00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:24.090
<v Speaker 1>fix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detect,</v>

983
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:24.924
<v Speaker 1>error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix.</v>

984
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.660
<v Speaker 1>That's consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not planned what you're going to do</v>

985
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:29.950
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's not that simple either.</v>

986
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Other problems that Piaget was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>address.</v>

987
00:47:33.161 --> 00:47:34.630
<v Speaker 1>While what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are numbers?</v>

988
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.560
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean for there to be space?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we mean when we,</v>

989
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we,</v>

990
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 1>how did we come up with that concept?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does speed mean?</v>

991
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.823
<v Speaker 1>How do we know an object is permanent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we know that an object stays the </v>

992
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:53.070
<v Speaker 1>same across sets of transformation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a very classic piaget,</v>

993
00:47:53.071 --> 00:47:53.904
<v Speaker 1>Eddie and problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you give a kid a ball of </v>

994
00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 1>clay and then you crush it.</v>

995
00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.513
<v Speaker 1>So it's now a cylinder is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the same thing or is it a </v>

996
00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:02.200
<v Speaker 1>different thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

997
00:48:02.201 --> 00:48:04.360
<v Speaker 1>well it's the same thing and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different thing,</v>

998
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:05.194
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>remained constant across the </v>

999
00:48:07.391 --> 00:48:08.224
<v Speaker 1>transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that piaget is </v>

1000
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:15.250
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out is what remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant across transformations.</v>

1001
00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Because you might think about that is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real fact.</v>

1002
00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Protons are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1003
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:19.953
<v Speaker 1>They remained constant across </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations and so we assume that </v>

1004
00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:25.690
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty damn real and they last </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy to know how long protons last.</v>

1005
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

1006
00:48:27.581 --> 00:48:29.560
<v Speaker 1>It's some tens of billions of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't worry,</v>

1007
00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 1>your protons are going to just sit right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and behave,</v>

1008
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they last for a very,</v>

1009
00:48:33.731 --> 00:48:34.564
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time across sets of </v>

1010
00:48:35.561 --> 00:48:37.810
<v Speaker 1>transformation so we can regard them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

1011
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.273
<v Speaker 1>He was interested in why children play </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why there are patterns in play and </v>

1012
00:48:41.861 --> 00:48:43.600
<v Speaker 1>how that's related to dreams.</v>

1013
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And he was really interested in the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we imitate other people.</v>

1014
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And this is another part of piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staggering genius in my estimation,</v>

1015
00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:51.304
<v Speaker 1>because he was one of the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental thinkers who understood </v>

1016
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:55.144
<v Speaker 1>that our capacity for learning was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much mediated by language as it was </v>

1017
00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:00.604
<v Speaker 1>mediated by our capacity to use our </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies to represent the bodies of other </v>

1018
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's mind boggling.</v>

1019
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:09.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a mind boggling idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1020
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you hear a monkey see monkey do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually not true.</v>

1021
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:16.570
<v Speaker 1>They're not very good at imitating </v>
<v Speaker 1>octopuses or Octopi.</v>

1022
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.553
<v Speaker 1>They can imitate actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you give an octopus a bottle with </v>

1023
00:49:20.621 --> 00:49:22.840
<v Speaker 1>a cork in it and there's a crab in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cork,</v>

1024
00:49:22.841 --> 00:49:25.300
<v Speaker 1>it configure it how to get out the cork </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sneak out the crab.</v>

1025
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.433
<v Speaker 1>But if you get an octopus to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>another octopus do that and learn to do </v>

1026
00:49:29.261 --> 00:49:30.094
<v Speaker 1>it faster.</v>

1027
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Those things are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly,</v>

1028
00:49:32.711 --> 00:49:34.150
<v Speaker 1>that's because they're all technically </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1029
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.230
<v Speaker 1>And so they actually have something they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do something with like our hands.</v>

1030
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.760
<v Speaker 1>There's our tentacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1031
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:43.400
<v Speaker 1>an Octopi can operate in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have tentacles and,</v>

1032
00:49:43.401 --> 00:49:44.234
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about the superhuman </v>

1033
00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:47.080
<v Speaker 1>intelligence of things like dolphins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whales.</v>

1034
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1035
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically test tubes.</v>

1036
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:51.724
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to do snout appa </v>

1037
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:54.040
<v Speaker 1>city?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1038
00:49:54.041 --> 00:49:55.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to do that.</v>

1039
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.660
<v Speaker 1>They can't manipulate the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever their intelligence is,</v>

1040
00:49:58.661 --> 00:50:00.790
<v Speaker 1>it's way different than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1041
00:50:00.791 --> 00:50:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So partly what you're doing all the time</v>

1042
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.833
<v Speaker 1>is imitating other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of you are imitating each other </v>

1043
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:09.580
<v Speaker 1>right now you can tell because look </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

1044
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:12.870
<v Speaker 1>you're all doing exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1045
00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.753
<v Speaker 1>it's mass imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really a huge part of social </v>

1046
00:50:16.661 --> 00:50:18.910
<v Speaker 1>structure is that we're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitating each other.</v>

1047
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:20.103
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that your body and her</v>
<v Speaker 1>body are very much matched </v>

1048
00:50:23.051 --> 00:50:23.884
<v Speaker 1>physiologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now you're in the same state and </v>

1049
00:50:25.511 --> 00:50:26.344
<v Speaker 1>you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he basically have same expression </v>

1050
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.473
<v Speaker 1>and as long as all you crazy primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent primates have the same </v>

1051
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:33.944
<v Speaker 1>expression on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pretty much be sure that all of </v>

1052
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you are thinking and about to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately the same thing.</v>

1053
00:50:40.491 --> 00:50:41.324
<v Speaker 1>And so you can keep that match between </v>
<v Speaker 1>your desire slash expectation and </v>

1054
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:47.780
<v Speaker 1>reality happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we have a face.</v>

1055
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It's so that other people know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell we're up to.</v>

1056
00:50:50.151 --> 00:50:52.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you're always watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's faces.</v>

1057
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Cause you want to see what they're up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1058
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:56.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you have whites around </v>
<v Speaker 1>your iris.</v>

1059
00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.673
<v Speaker 1>Gorilla's don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's because I can see exactly </v>

1060
00:51:00.111 --> 00:51:03.470
<v Speaker 1>where your eyes are pointing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're highlighted by that white.</v>

1061
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:07.670
<v Speaker 1>And I'm unbelievably good at detecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the precise direction of your gaze.</v>

1062
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And so if you stand on the corner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look up at buildings,</v>

1063
00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.093
<v Speaker 1>other people will stand beside you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look up cause they think well that guy </v>

1064
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:14.444
<v Speaker 1>would be standing there pointing his </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes into the sky unless there is </v>

1065
00:51:17.061 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 1>something of interest to a primate like </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1066
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 1>And so this classic social psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

1067
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:22.754
<v Speaker 1>you'll get people gathered round trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what the hell it is that </v>

1068
00:51:25.341 --> 00:51:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you're pointing your eyes at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1069
00:51:27.911 --> 00:51:28.744
<v Speaker 1>Cause that indicates intense interest </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in something valuable that I </v>

1070
00:51:32.001 --> 00:51:32.834
<v Speaker 1>might be able to share or partake in if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can figure out what it is that you're </v>

1071
00:51:35.031 --> 00:51:35.864
<v Speaker 1>up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so all your ancestors who didn't </v>

1072
00:51:37.341 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 1>have nicely defined eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all got killed or they didn't mate.</v>

1073
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:41.833
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you have these beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>white eyes with this like colorful iris </v>

1074
00:51:45.651 --> 00:51:46.484
<v Speaker 1>in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so that people can tell what the </v>

1075
00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:50.870
<v Speaker 1>hell you're up to and they're more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to cooperate with you,</v>

1076
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.240
<v Speaker 1>more likely to mate with you and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to kill you,</v>

1077
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:55.310
<v Speaker 1>which is probably a good thing.</v>

1078
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.410
<v Speaker 1>All things considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1079
00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the same thing that </v>

1080
00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:02.000
<v Speaker 1>someone else is looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imitating them.</v>

1081
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.553
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're looking at the same </v>

1082
00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:06.944
<v Speaker 1>thing that someone else is looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you inhabit the same value </v>

1083
00:52:09.621 --> 00:52:10.454
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your emotional responses are going </v>

1084
00:52:11.691 --> 00:52:12.524
<v Speaker 1>to be very much akin to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that when you go to a </v>

1085
00:52:15.471 --> 00:52:20.360
<v Speaker 1>movie and you watch the hero and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>embody the hero while you're doing so,</v>

1086
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:21.403
<v Speaker 1>and the emotions that you produce inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you by imitating the hero on the </v>

1087
00:52:24.591 --> 00:52:27.380
<v Speaker 1>screen enable you to figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero is going through.</v>

1088
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:28.363
<v Speaker 1>And you can learn from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a very complex form of </v>

1089
00:52:30.831 --> 00:52:31.664
<v Speaker 1>imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we do that when we tell stories or </v>

1090
00:52:33.081 --> 00:52:36.080
<v Speaker 1>we watch stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those stories are really complicated</v>

1091
00:52:36.081 --> 00:52:36.914
<v Speaker 1>because as we already outlined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there not just factual representations </v>

1092
00:52:40.341 --> 00:52:41.174
<v Speaker 1>of someone's action during a day there </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the important things </v>

1093
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:47.030
<v Speaker 1>that the person did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaningful things.</v>

1094
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:48.103
<v Speaker 1>And so when you go see a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you're doing is watching meaningful </v>

1095
00:52:50.721 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the movie's any good.</v>

1096
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.960
<v Speaker 1>And you know that because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the movie isn't meaningful,</v>

1097
00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.350
<v Speaker 1>well then you leave your board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1098
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:04.220
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that it's meaningful is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what keeps you in the seat.</v>

1099
00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.470
<v Speaker 1>And you don't necessarily know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1100
00:53:06.471 --> 00:53:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you often have no idea why it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

1101
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:12.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching Pinocchio rescue his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father from a whale.</v>

1102
00:53:12.561 --> 00:53:14.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

1103
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:14.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1104
00:53:14.981 --> 00:53:17.060
<v Speaker 1>why is that meaningful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you don't know.</v>

1105
00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:20.000
<v Speaker 1>But it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So moral concerns,</v>

1106
00:53:20.001 --> 00:53:22.670
<v Speaker 1>while we already talked about Piaget's </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern about morality,</v>

1107
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really not good.</v>

1108
00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a proposition.</v>

1109
00:53:42.371 --> 00:53:43.204
<v Speaker 1>Constructivist proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowledge does not begin in the eye by </v>

1110
00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:50.860
<v Speaker 1>by which he means they're kind of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of looking at the world.</v>

1111
00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:53.140
<v Speaker 1>There's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll start with that.</v>

1112
00:53:53.141 --> 00:53:55.270
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that all of your knowledge comes from</v>

1113
00:53:55.271 --> 00:53:57.400
<v Speaker 1>outside sense data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1114
00:53:57.401 --> 00:53:58.650
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1115
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.080
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a behavior is claiming </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that it's a,</v>

1116
00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:06.400
<v Speaker 1>it's an empiricist claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other idea is no,</v>

1117
00:54:06.401 --> 00:54:07.234
<v Speaker 1>that can't be right because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal structures that enable you to </v>

1118
00:54:09.701 --> 00:54:11.900
<v Speaker 1>look at the world and interpreted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1119
00:54:11.901 --> 00:54:15.370
<v Speaker 1>and in some of those might be implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>axiomatic,</v>

1120
00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:16.413
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that you have two eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the outward into the world </v>

1121
00:54:18.971 --> 00:54:20.620
<v Speaker 1>and that you can hear and that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch.</v>

1122
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:21.783
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fact of those senses isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on the empirical reality for </v>

1123
00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:26.680
<v Speaker 1>those senses to manifest themselves.</v>

1124
00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.030
<v Speaker 1>They're already built into you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people like Khan,</v>

1125
00:54:29.031 --> 00:54:29.864
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made the proposition that we had a </v>

1126
00:54:32.171 --> 00:54:35.380
<v Speaker 1>priori knowledge structures and that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>use them to interpret the world.</v>

1127
00:54:35.381 --> 00:54:38.200
<v Speaker 1>And so it's different than him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different than empiricism.</v>

1128
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And so what piaget is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's neither of those are,</v>

1129
00:54:42.281 --> 00:54:43.240
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1130
00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:47.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you will learn everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the world through your senses.</v>

1131
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:48.183
<v Speaker 1>And it's not as if you project </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything onto the world as </v>

1132
00:54:50.471 --> 00:54:51.304
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something in between and it's a </v>

1133
00:54:53.351 --> 00:54:55.150
<v Speaker 1>dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dynamic.</v>

1134
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:57.910
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like bootstrapping.</v>

1135
00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1136
00:54:59.411 --> 00:55:02.080
<v Speaker 1>when you're coding computer boots up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means bootstrapping,</v>

1137
00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.213
<v Speaker 1>it's off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a bunch of simple processes </v>

1138
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:06.930
<v Speaker 1>occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then out of those simple processes,</v>

1139
00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.400
<v Speaker 1>some more complex processes emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then out of those,</v>

1140
00:55:09.401 --> 00:55:13.240
<v Speaker 1>some more complex processes emerge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden your computer is there.</v>

1141
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Well that's kind of what Piaget thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to you.</v>

1142
00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:19.630
<v Speaker 1>You bootstrap yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have got a couple of reflexes</v>

1143
00:55:19.631 --> 00:55:22.210
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the sucking reflex for example.</v>

1144
00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:23.403
<v Speaker 1>And you've got some proclivities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you can sort of flip your </v>

1145
00:55:25.691 --> 00:55:26.524
<v Speaker 1>hand or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you develop that and you have </v>

1146
00:55:28.211 --> 00:55:29.170
<v Speaker 1>reflexes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1147
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:31.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you blow on a baby for example,</v>

1148
00:55:31.871 --> 00:55:34.330
<v Speaker 1>the PV will go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built into it.</v>

1149
00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1150
00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.313
<v Speaker 1>it's a startle reflex essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that startle reflex is there right </v>

1151
00:55:39.161 --> 00:55:39.581
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1152
00:55:39.581 --> 00:55:41.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole body reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1153
00:55:41.801 --> 00:55:42.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1154
00:55:42.731 --> 00:55:43.564
<v Speaker 1>if you stroke the bottom of their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their fetal sort of curl up and if you </v>

1155
00:55:45.521 --> 00:55:48.250
<v Speaker 1>put your finger in their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a newborn,</v>

1156
00:55:48.251 --> 00:55:51.250
<v Speaker 1>if you put your finger in their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can lift them right up.</v>

1157
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.040
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of well clinging ape </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1158
00:55:54.041 --> 00:55:54.874
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because chimpanzee infants cling to </v>

1159
00:55:57.521 --> 00:55:59.080
<v Speaker 1>their mother for like five years.</v>

1160
00:55:59.080 --> 00:55:59.913
<v Speaker 1>And so that reflex is still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the kid comes into the world born </v>

1161
00:56:03.401 --> 00:56:04.234
<v Speaker 1>with these simplistic low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures that enable it to get a </v>

1162
00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.290
<v Speaker 1>foothold on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then out of that,</v>

1163
00:56:11.291 --> 00:56:14.590
<v Speaker 1>the child emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so the constructivist idea is</v>

1164
00:56:14.591 --> 00:56:15.424
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it isn't like you have your heads </v>

1165
00:56:17.861 --> 00:56:21.880
<v Speaker 1>full of fully developed axiomatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures and it isn't that you get all</v>

1166
00:56:21.881 --> 00:56:22.714
<v Speaker 1>your knowledge from the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that you have a bit of structure </v>

1167
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:27.520
<v Speaker 1>there to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives you a toll hold on the world.</v>

1168
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.270
<v Speaker 1>And then you act in the world and as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>

1169
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:32.403
<v Speaker 1>you generate information and out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>information you make the structures </v>

1170
00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:40.351
<v Speaker 1>inside of you and you make the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a constructivist idea is that you</v>

1171
00:56:40.391 --> 00:56:41.224
<v Speaker 1>take whatever's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tremendous complexity and you </v>

1172
00:56:43.931 --> 00:56:46.900
<v Speaker 1>sorted into you and the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1173
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:48.063
<v Speaker 1>and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes back to that William James </v>

1174
00:56:49.751 --> 00:56:51.500
<v Speaker 1>idea about that initial chaos.</v>

1175
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's a hard conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard,</v>

1176
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:57.190
<v Speaker 1>hard concept to grasp because that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really how we think.</v>

1177
00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think that there's an objective world</v>

1178
00:56:59.471 --> 00:57:00.304
<v Speaker 1>and there's this objective world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the objective world is just there </v>

1179
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and this objective world is maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subset of that.</v>

1180
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:08.230
<v Speaker 1>But that is not the Piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>

1181
00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:12.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not a presupposition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologist in general who will talk</v>

1182
00:57:12.071 --> 00:57:13.510
<v Speaker 1>about later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1183
00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.500
<v Speaker 1>so here's one example of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how to think about this in a sense.</v>

1184
00:57:17.501 --> 00:57:18.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1185
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:19.414
<v Speaker 1>you think as Piaget said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of think that your </v>

1186
00:57:20.891 --> 00:57:24.360
<v Speaker 1>representations of the world are fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll go back to the urine,</v>

1187
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:28.030
<v Speaker 1>a longterm relationship and the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>betrays you scenario,</v>

1188
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:28.893
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've been with this person 10 </v>

1189
00:57:30.731 --> 00:57:34.210
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You assume fidelity and faithfulness and</v>

1190
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:35.740
<v Speaker 1>honesty and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1191
00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:36.670
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1192
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:37.750
<v Speaker 1>we've a shared narrative.</v>

1193
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:38.583
<v Speaker 1>You both had habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it structures your existence and </v>

1194
00:57:40.811 --> 00:57:41.644
<v Speaker 1>regulates your motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you find out that the person has </v>

1195
00:57:43.361 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 1>not only betrayed you once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but multiple times.</v>

1196
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:46.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1197
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.573
<v Speaker 1>what you thought isn't what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the weird thing you see </v>

1198
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:52.653
<v Speaker 1>because you interpreted the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously within the confines of that </v>

1199
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:58.780
<v Speaker 1>relationship and you had an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1200
00:57:58.781 --> 00:57:59.614
<v Speaker 1>obviously you had an interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was also a world that's the </v>

1201
00:58:03.221 --> 00:58:07.120
<v Speaker 1>world you thought you lived in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like those were facts.</v>

1202
00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Well all of a sudden those aren't facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not at all facts.</v>

1203
00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens that's that descent </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the underworld.</v>

1204
00:58:13.901 --> 00:58:14.734
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that past that you thought was fixed </v>

1205
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.150
<v Speaker 1>now becomes this weird mixture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy because you're wondering,</v>

1206
00:58:22.151 --> 00:58:22.780
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1207
00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:24.610
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that happened then?</v>

1208
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:28.750
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to run through all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of fantasies.</v>

1209
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are going to be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

1210
00:58:30.461 --> 00:58:31.294
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dark about what happened in the </v>

1211
00:58:32.351 --> 00:58:34.990
<v Speaker 1>state of the world and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are unconscious fantasies.</v>

1212
00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:37.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's mingled inextricably with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1213
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:39.483
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't know the facts </v>

1214
00:58:40.751 --> 00:58:41.584
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kind of suggests that maybe you </v>

1215
00:58:42.821 --> 00:58:43.654
<v Speaker 1>never did know them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty strange thing because </v>

1216
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:46.863
<v Speaker 1>you know you're operating as if you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got this factual representation of the </v>

1217
00:58:49.421 --> 00:58:51.820
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be appended like that.</v>

1218
00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.610
<v Speaker 1>And so that makes you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what about these facts?</v>

1219
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Like are kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of hard to get a handle on.</v>

1220
00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see this a lot in courtroom,</v>

1221
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:02.373
<v Speaker 1>in courtrooms situations because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course what the court decides is what </v>

1222
00:59:05.501 --> 00:59:06.334
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is we don't exactly know </v>

1223
00:59:09.191 --> 00:59:10.024
<v Speaker 1>because you could keep making the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of interpretation wider and </v>

1224
00:59:13.361 --> 00:59:14.194
<v Speaker 1>wider.</v>

1225
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.333
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you bring your partner to court </v>

1226
00:59:17.291 --> 00:59:18.950
<v Speaker 1>because they've betrayed you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

1227
00:59:18.951 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 1>And you're trying to get a divorce </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement predicated on that.</v>

1228
00:59:21.441 --> 00:59:22.274
<v Speaker 1>But then they tell a bunch of stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how you were just as miserable as </v>

1229
00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:28.160
<v Speaker 1>you could possibly be and that anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>with any sense would've betrayed you and</v>

1230
00:59:28.161 --> 00:59:29.990
<v Speaker 1>never told you about it because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1231
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.750
<v Speaker 1>that's just what a normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensible person would do.</v>

1232
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.430
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1233
00:59:34.431 --> 00:59:37.030
<v Speaker 1>where you actually be trade?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you were,</v>

1234
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was it that betrayed you?</v>

1235
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:39.374
<v Speaker 1>Was it your partner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it you or was it your bloody mother </v>

1236
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:44.630
<v Speaker 1>or your father who taught you to act </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way or who didn't teach you?</v>

1237
00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hell of a thing.</v>

1238
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can just keep altering the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretive context and within it,</v>

1239
00:59:50.901 --> 00:59:52.820
<v Speaker 1>the facts shift around and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

1240
00:59:52.821 --> 00:59:53.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not facts.</v>

1241
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1242
00:59:55.971 --> 00:59:57.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say that,</v>

1243
00:59:57.261 --> 00:59:58.094
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more complicated than that by a </v>

1244
00:59:59.571 --> 01:00:01.460
<v Speaker 1>large margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

1245
01:00:01.461 --> 01:00:02.294
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget's notion is essentially that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is how I interpreted this is </v>

1246
01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my thinking in some sense,</v>

1247
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'm offering it to you as a scheme </v>
<v Speaker 1>for helping you understand piaget.</v>

1248
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jerome Bruner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous,</v>

1249
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>famous cognitive psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1250
01:00:20.331 --> 01:00:21.164
<v Speaker 1>we seem to have no other way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing live time set except in the </v>

1251
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>form of a narrative and a narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I could tell,</v>

1252
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:29.414
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the same thing as one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget's knowledge representations as </v>

1253
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:35.024
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a representation of you and </v>

1254
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:37.874
<v Speaker 1>there's a representation of the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's behaviors that you use to </v>

1255
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:44.690
<v Speaker 1>transform one into the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when piaget talks about,</v>

1256
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.060
<v Speaker 1>so this is kind of where the mind meets </v>
<v Speaker 1>the body,</v>

1257
01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>that that's how it looks to me.</v>

1258
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have a conception of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have something you're aiming at,</v>

1259
01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:55.460
<v Speaker 1>you want to have happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are both representations,</v>

1260
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>but when you act in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those aren't representations anymore.</v>

1261
01:00:59.000 --> 01:00:59.833
<v Speaker 1>Those are actually actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so mine transforms into body when </v>

1262
01:01:02.931 --> 01:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>you act out your notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1263
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of how the mind is linked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body as far as I can tell.</v>

1264
01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:09.134
<v Speaker 1>And so what Piaget says is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors are built before the </v>

1265
01:01:12.951 --> 01:01:13.784
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to take a look at </v>

1266
01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

1267
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>here's Piaget's notion of assimilation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and accommodation,</v>

1268
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:25.003
<v Speaker 1>whereas other animals cannot alter </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves except by changing their </v>

1269
01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:29.540
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's through Darwinian means,</v>

1270
01:01:29.541 --> 01:01:30.374
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is a bear is a kind of </v>

1271
01:01:31.941 --> 01:01:32.774
<v Speaker 1>solution to a set of problems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the problems that the bears </v>

1272
01:01:35.211 --> 01:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>environment presents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the bear is just a bear.</v>

1273
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.353
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like bears were 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and the only way the bear can </v>

1274
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>solve a new problem basically is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>generating new random bears,</v>

1275
01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>which is what it does when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduces.</v>

1276
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.713
<v Speaker 1>And hoping that one of those more random</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears is a better fit for whatever </v>

1277
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>random change might occur in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

1278
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole Darwinian issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1279
01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>You can't predict which way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment's going to go.</v>

1280
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:58.543
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you take your </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and you vary it and you throw </v>

1281
01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>those out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some animals do that expensively,</v>

1282
01:02:05.571 --> 01:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>so they have infants that they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>program to that specific environment.</v>

1283
01:02:09.621 --> 01:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>But it takes a lot of investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some creatures do that cheaply,</v>

1284
01:02:13.701 --> 01:02:14.534
<v Speaker 1>like mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't care for their </v>

1285
01:02:15.621 --> 01:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a million of them.</v>

1286
01:02:16.881 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>So like who cares if 999,998 die?</v>

1287
01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>There's still twice as many of you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>their work.</v>

1288
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>So those are two different reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies and you could think about all</v>

1289
01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>those mosquito offspring as new mosquito</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas in embodied form.</v>

1290
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:33.563
<v Speaker 1>And most of them are bad ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the environment just wipes them </v>

1291
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:36.204
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Piaget is point is we do the same </v>

1292
01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:38.514
<v Speaker 1>thing with our cognitive structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that's so </v>

1293
01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:40.914
<v Speaker 1>interesting about people in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've internalized the Darwinian </v>

1294
01:02:44.401 --> 01:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you think about the future,</v>

1295
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.083
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is generating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplicity of potential environments </v>

1296
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.433
<v Speaker 1>and then you're generating a sequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>avatars of yourself to live in those </v>

1297
01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:56.334
<v Speaker 1>fictional futures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you watch what happens as that </v>

1298
01:02:58.771 --> 01:03:02.010
<v Speaker 1>avatar lives in each of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those fictional futures.</v>

1299
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.950
<v Speaker 1>And if the avatar fails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't act that out.</v>

1300
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's bloody brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>

1301
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:09.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what our brain does.</v>

1302
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like it hypothesizes potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>futures.</v>

1303
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>It runs simulations and it kills them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can be really painful,</v>

1304
01:03:15.961 --> 01:03:17.850
<v Speaker 1>but it beats the hell out of dying </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1305
01:03:17.851 --> 01:03:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe sometimes you won't think so </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it really can be painful,</v>

1306
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:22.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1307
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.770
<v Speaker 1>it's something that as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only human beings can really do,</v>

1308
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:26.663
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We invent possible futures and invent </v>

1309
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:32.130
<v Speaker 1>possible future selves and kill them off</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our imagination.</v>

1310
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:34.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're doing in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

1311
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what an argument is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1312
01:03:35.941 --> 01:03:37.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an Avatar,</v>

1313
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.870
<v Speaker 1>a representational avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1314
01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:40.763
<v Speaker 1>it's based on certain axioms and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate it and you articulate yours </v>

1315
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.560
<v Speaker 1>and we'll have them have a fight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whichever one survives,</v>

1316
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:49.740
<v Speaker 1>we'll accept as true and we'll move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and act that out.</v>

1317
01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.590
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments can be pretty damn intense,</v>

1318
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.453
<v Speaker 1>but hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not as intense as acting out a </v>

1319
01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:58.170
<v Speaker 1>stupid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

1320
01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.213
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better to have some conflict and reach </v>

1321
01:04:00.631 --> 01:04:05.160
<v Speaker 1>resolution in an abstract sense than to </v>
<v Speaker 1>embody your stupidity and die.</v>

1322
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1323
01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a trade off between anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an annihilation or pain,</v>

1324
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:28.740
<v Speaker 1>whereas other animals cannot alter </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

1325
01:04:28.741 --> 01:04:29.574
<v Speaker 1>except by changing their species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man can transform himself by </v>

1326
01:04:31.621 --> 01:04:32.454
<v Speaker 1>transforming the world and constructor </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself by constructing structures and </v>

1327
01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>the structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona,</v>

1328
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>they're not eternally predestined either</v>
<v Speaker 1>from within or from without.</v>

1329
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Also piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1330
01:04:42.751 --> 01:04:43.350
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1331
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:44.183
<v Speaker 1>while he's a constructivist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believes that there's something that </v>

1332
01:04:45.961 --> 01:04:48.660
<v Speaker 1>your biology brings to the table and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1333
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:49.703
<v Speaker 1>and sets up the parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say within which you can play </v>

1334
01:04:51.631 --> 01:04:52.464
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But within those parameters there's a </v>

1335
01:04:53.761 --> 01:04:56.070
<v Speaker 1>very wide range of games that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

1336
01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not a biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>determinism,</v>

1337
01:04:58.591 --> 01:04:59.424
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a biological framing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about it like a chess </v>

1338
01:05:01.411 --> 01:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1339
01:05:02.611 --> 01:05:03.444
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's assume that the rules of chess or </v>

1340
01:05:05.251 --> 01:05:07.740
<v Speaker 1>biologically determined just for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sake of argument,</v>

1341
01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you can still play a near infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of chess games.</v>

1342
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:11.940
<v Speaker 1>And so it's the same with you.</v>

1343
01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:12.773
<v Speaker 1>You come into the world with a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>built in axioms that sort of your body </v>

1344
01:05:15.691 --> 01:05:16.524
<v Speaker 1>and your nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can play a very large number of </v>

1345
01:05:18.911 --> 01:05:19.744
<v Speaker 1>games within that set of frames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very </v>

1346
01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:23.314
<v Speaker 1>interesting about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's very mysterious to me </v>

1347
01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>is this is a game that I played before </v>
<v Speaker 1>with students.</v>

1348
01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to play it with you if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't mind.</v>

1349
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna play a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're ready?</v>

1350
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You move first.</v>

1351
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1352
01:05:36.191 --> 01:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1353
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:38.171
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1354
01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:39.004
<v Speaker 1>that's so interesting because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically made the presupposition that </v>

1355
01:05:41.651 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>you could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're completely free.</v>

1356
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:44.943
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

1357
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>You throw up your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you don't know what to do.</v>

1358
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm so free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like free to do what?</v>

1359
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not freedom.</v>

1360
01:05:51.521 --> 01:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just nothing.</v>

1361
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.251
<v Speaker 1>But if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1362
01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to do instead is when I</v>

1363
01:05:55.991 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>move my arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1364
01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna move your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1365
01:05:58.061 --> 01:05:59.140
<v Speaker 1>So let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1366
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:02.170
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to go like that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to good.</v>

1367
01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:05.470
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll go like that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have little dance.</v>

1368
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:06.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1369
01:06:06.831 --> 01:06:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And so you can play a game like God with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1370
01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:11.440
<v Speaker 1>with a kid instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they like that.</v>

1371
01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:14.350
<v Speaker 1>They've got that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've got to,</v>

1372
01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I've got some pictures of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you that in a bit.</v>

1373
01:06:16.331 --> 01:06:18.820
<v Speaker 1>But even a newborn baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stick out your tongue,</v>

1374
01:06:18.821 --> 01:06:21.850
<v Speaker 1>they can stick their tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold back and that you think about that.</v>

1375
01:06:21.851 --> 01:06:24.640
<v Speaker 1>That's just absolutely mind boggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can do that and,</v>

1376
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.713
<v Speaker 1>and they really can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really do seem to be able to do </v>

1377
01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 1>that right at the moment of birth.</v>

1378
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:31.690
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear babies have no theory of mind.</v>

1379
01:06:31.691 --> 01:06:34.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like ah yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1380
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.350
<v Speaker 1>they can imitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty bloody amazing man.</v>

1381
01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Like you haven't seen robots that can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that yet.</v>

1382
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Although there are robots now that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can teach by moving their,</v>

1383
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:45.063
<v Speaker 1>their arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move their arms and then they'll do </v>

1384
01:06:47.231 --> 01:06:48.064
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can actually program them by </v>

1385
01:06:49.361 --> 01:06:51.460
<v Speaker 1>moving them and then they'll just repeat</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1386
01:06:51.461 --> 01:06:53.530
<v Speaker 1>And so they're getting damn close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitation.</v>

1387
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:56.320
<v Speaker 1>They're really getting close and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>look the hell out man,</v>

1388
01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:57.613
<v Speaker 1>because they're going to be imitating </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other as well as us and they're </v>

1389
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:02.740
<v Speaker 1>going to do it so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just won't be able to believe it.</v>

1390
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:03.993
<v Speaker 1>So that's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The organism adapts itself by third </v>

1391
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:08.944
<v Speaker 1>materially constructing new forums to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit themselves into those of the </v>

1392
01:07:11.141 --> 01:07:11.974
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas intelligence extends this </v>

1393
01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>creation by constructing mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures which can be applied to those</v>

1394
01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:16.840
<v Speaker 1>of the environment.</v>

1395
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the Darwinian idea that I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned.</v>

1396
01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:19.863
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that are building the </v>

1397
01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:21.034
<v Speaker 1>autonomous cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they don't think they're building </v>

1398
01:07:22.301 --> 01:07:23.134
<v Speaker 1>autonomous cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know perfectly well what they're </v>

1399
01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:25.984
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're building fleets of mutually </v>

1400
01:07:27.671 --> 01:07:29.860
<v Speaker 1>intercommunicating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous robots.</v>

1401
01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.293
<v Speaker 1>And each of them you to be able to teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other because their nervous system </v>

1402
01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>will be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when there's 10 million of them,</v>

1403
01:07:35.291 --> 01:07:36.124
<v Speaker 1>when one of them learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all 10 million of them will learn it at </v>

1404
01:07:37.961 --> 01:07:38.794
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not going to have to be very </v>

1405
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:41.890
<v Speaker 1>bright before they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1406
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.020
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause us,</v>

1407
01:07:44.021 --> 01:07:44.854
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll learn something you have to </v>

1408
01:07:45.671 --> 01:07:47.920
<v Speaker 1>imitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like God that's hard.</v>

1409
01:07:47.921 --> 01:07:48.754
<v Speaker 1>Or I have to explain it to you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to understand it and then you have </v>

1410
01:07:50.771 --> 01:07:51.604
<v Speaker 1>to act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not connected wirelessly with the </v>

1411
01:07:53.561 --> 01:07:55.900
<v Speaker 1>same platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but robots.</v>

1412
01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:56.913
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

1413
01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And so once those things get a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit smart,</v>

1414
01:07:59.111 --> 01:08:01.510
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to stop at a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit smart for very long.</v>

1415
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.230
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be unbelievably smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>like overnight.</v>

1416
01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're imitating the hell out of us</v>

1417
01:08:08.021 --> 01:08:08.854
<v Speaker 1>right now too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're teaching them how to </v>

1418
01:08:09.731 --> 01:08:14.140
<v Speaker 1>understand us every second of every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The net is learning what we're like.</v>

1419
01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:16.340
<v Speaker 1>It's watching us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's communicating with us,</v>

1420
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:17.323
<v Speaker 1>it's imitating us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to know it already knows </v>

1421
01:08:19.431 --> 01:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>in some ways more about us than we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about ourselves.</v>

1422
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:22.873
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of reports already of </v>

1423
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:25.094
<v Speaker 1>people getting pregnancy ads or ads for </v>
<v Speaker 1>infants sometimes before they know </v>

1424
01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:31.334
<v Speaker 1>they're pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often before they've told their </v>

1425
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:35.450
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that that happens is the net</v>

1426
01:08:35.451 --> 01:08:36.284
<v Speaker 1>is watching what they're looking at and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inferring with its artificial </v>

1427
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:39.614
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you're pregnant and that's </v>

1428
01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:41.924
<v Speaker 1>just tilting you a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to interest in things that you </v>

1429
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:45.570
<v Speaker 1>might not otherwise be interested in.</v>

1430
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:47.970
<v Speaker 1>The net tracks that then it tells you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're,</v>

1431
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:48.913
<v Speaker 1>what you're after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does that by offering an </v>

1432
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>advertisement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's reading your unconscious mind so</v>

1433
01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.900
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what's happening.</v>

1434
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1435
01:08:58.851 --> 01:09:03.170
<v Speaker 1>so what's the motive for development?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disequilibrium.</v>

1436
01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a Piagetian term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a life is suffering idea.</v>

1437
01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:10.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why learn something cause you're wrong.</v>

1438
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Who cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you suffer.</v>

1439
01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 1>You care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1440
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:16.430
<v Speaker 1>if you run out a little scheme in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

1441
01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.040
<v Speaker 1>little action pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get what you want.</v>

1442
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.960
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're two years old,</v>

1443
01:09:20.961 --> 01:09:23.990
<v Speaker 1>you burst into tears and cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

1444
01:09:23.991 --> 01:09:24.824
<v Speaker 1>It's because you don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know where you are and you </v>

1445
01:09:26.181 --> 01:09:27.320
<v Speaker 1>don't know where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

1446
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like time for some negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

1447
01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:30.603
<v Speaker 1>It indicates that you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's terrible in some sense </v>

1448
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:33.974
<v Speaker 1>because it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost always means that to learn </v>

1449
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 1>requires pain.</v>

1450
01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly because</v>

1451
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:44.450
<v Speaker 1>people are curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1452
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:48.650
<v Speaker 1>and to go out and be curious and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn new things can be very exciting.</v>

1453
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And so what it seems to be is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1454
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:55.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a rate of learning that's too </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast and that hurts you.</v>

1455
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes you cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you get the rate just right,</v>

1456
01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:00.523
<v Speaker 1>you're just opening up enough novelty so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can benefit from the </v>

1457
01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:05.810
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that gives you a dopamine </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick.</v>

1458
01:10:05.811 --> 01:10:06.644
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can benefit from the possibilities </v>

1459
01:10:08.721 --> 01:10:12.470
<v Speaker 1>without being overwhelmed by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the unexpected element of it.</v>

1460
01:10:12.471 --> 01:10:15.290
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell when that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the coolest things as</v>

1461
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:17.230
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an,</v>

1462
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I learned this partly from piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1463
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:22.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to withstand suffering,</v>

1464
01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:24.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say your life has to have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

1465
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that that means a bunch of things.</v>

1466
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.823
<v Speaker 1>It means that part of the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome suffering is by making the </v>

1467
01:10:31.221 --> 01:10:34.430
<v Speaker 1>suffering into something meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean that metaphysically,</v>

1468
01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:36.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it technically you've made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>

1469
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:38.930
<v Speaker 1>it causes you suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn something about it.</v>

1470
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:42.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't make that mistake again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real adaptation.</v>

1471
01:10:42.111 --> 01:10:42.944
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not defense against death anxiety </v>

1472
01:10:44.901 --> 01:10:46.970
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real adaptation.</v>

1473
01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.073
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality that you learned through </v>

1474
01:10:50.991 --> 01:10:53.710
<v Speaker 1>pain is the oldest reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll say it's,</v>

1475
01:10:53.711 --> 01:10:55.970
<v Speaker 1>it's really old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as old as nervous systems.</v>

1476
01:10:55.971 --> 01:10:56.804
<v Speaker 1>And so you've adapted so that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to transform your knowledge </v>

1477
01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:06.560
<v Speaker 1>structures in a way that will minimize </v>
<v Speaker 1>your potential exposure to future pain.</v>

1478
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Add a rate you can tolerate or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>even enjoy,</v>

1479
01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.950
<v Speaker 1>and so what's happening is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually like static.</v>

1480
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:15.263
<v Speaker 1>It bores you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't like being thrown into </v>

1481
01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:19.620
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no little bit of,</v>

1482
01:11:19.621 --> 01:11:20.454
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1483
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.653
<v Speaker 1>What you want is you want to be opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>up your no old structures on the </v>

1484
01:11:23.701 --> 01:11:26.850
<v Speaker 1>periphery to transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary transformation.</v>

1485
01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:27.803
<v Speaker 1>That's voluntary exploration and letting</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things manifest a little bit of </v>

1486
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:34.230
<v Speaker 1>interest in chaos and so you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

1487
01:11:34.231 --> 01:11:35.064
<v Speaker 1>you put a little feeler out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to let die and it comes </v>

1488
01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>apart and you gather a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

1489
01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>it comes back together stronger and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that all the time.</v>

1490
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:43.464
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're smart and you're looking for </v>

1491
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.070
<v Speaker 1>new information foraging for new </v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

1492
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:48.143
<v Speaker 1>and that means you keep taking little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bits of yourself apart and </v>

1493
01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:54.360
<v Speaker 1>reconstructing them and over time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps you alive and active.</v>

1494
01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.213
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason you're alive is </v>

1495
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:58.140
<v Speaker 1>because you're dying all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1496
01:11:58.141 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 1>All the cells in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if they don't die,</v>

1497
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:02.400
<v Speaker 1>you get cancer and that that's it.</v>

1498
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.240
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

1499
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:04.403
<v Speaker 1>You're a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tight balance between death and </v>

1500
01:12:06.151 --> 01:12:08.220
<v Speaker 1>life at every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single level,</v>

1501
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:11.640
<v Speaker 1>including the cognitive level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that fun to learn something</v>

1502
01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:14.460
<v Speaker 1>because you have to kill something you </v>
<v Speaker 1>already know in order to learn it.</v>

1503
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:17.180
<v Speaker 1>That's another Yeti observation cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1504
01:12:17.181 --> 01:12:18.014
<v Speaker 1>you're always interpreting something </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a structure and if that </v>

1505
01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:22.680
<v Speaker 1>interpretation is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in a micro way,</v>

1506
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:26.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to kill that structure and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a biological structure,</v>

1507
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.150
<v Speaker 1>it actually hurts to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you can generate something new</v>

1508
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.090
<v Speaker 1>in its stead and if you get the dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1509
01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:35.940
<v Speaker 1>let the rate right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you find that exhilarating,</v>

1510
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:37.860
<v Speaker 1>not painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1511
01:12:37.861 --> 01:12:40.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's well you can tell when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

1512
01:12:40.351 --> 01:12:41.184
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell when you're doing that </v>

1513
01:12:42.811 --> 01:12:43.644
<v Speaker 1>because you're engaged in the world in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful way and what your nervous </v>

1514
01:12:46.621 --> 01:12:47.454
<v Speaker 1>system is doing is signaling to you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in a static place that's </v>

1515
01:12:51.511 --> 01:12:52.080
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

1516
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.210
<v Speaker 1>You're not in a chaotic place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's death.</v>

1517
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:55.223
<v Speaker 1>You're balanced between the static and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaotic such that the static </v>

1518
01:12:58.351 --> 01:13:02.910
<v Speaker 1>structures are transforming at exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right rate to keep you on top of the</v>

1519
01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:06.420
<v Speaker 1>environmental transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're surfing,</v>

1520
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Hawaii,</v>

1521
01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:09.084
<v Speaker 1>surfers surfing was sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why it's like can you tell </v>

1522
01:13:12.841 --> 01:13:14.130
<v Speaker 1>someone how to surf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1523
01:13:14.131 --> 01:13:14.964
<v Speaker 1>you can't because they have to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and dynamically interact with the </v>

1524
01:13:17.551 --> 01:13:20.520
<v Speaker 1>wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can stay on top of the wave and</v>

1525
01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:24.090
<v Speaker 1>that's what you have to do and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying on top of the wave properly,</v>

1526
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:27.160
<v Speaker 1>then it's exhilarating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the kind of meaning that,</v>

1527
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:28.403
<v Speaker 1>that it rejuvenates you literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you able to tolerate the </v>

1528
01:13:31.561 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 1>suffering in life and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical precisely.</v>

1529
01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:37.290
<v Speaker 1>It's because that is what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that moment.</v>

1530
01:13:37.291 --> 01:13:40.080
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're overcoming your limitations.</v>

1531
01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to,</v>

1532
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.793
<v Speaker 1>to know and to learn because you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing both of those things at the </v>

1533
01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:47.034
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

1534
01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:49.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do when you play a game </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

1535
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Your parents say it doesn't matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you win or lose,</v>

1536
01:13:52.111 --> 01:13:53.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a phd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an observation.</v>

1537
01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.640
<v Speaker 1>It's how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1538
01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.193
<v Speaker 1>Well it means that you should play the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game in a manner that increases the </v>

1539
01:14:00.571 --> 01:14:01.404
<v Speaker 1>probability that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>invited to play many games in the </v>

1540
01:14:03.451 --> 01:14:05.070
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1541
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:08.820
<v Speaker 1>So you master the skills of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you master a set of</v>

1542
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:09.654
<v Speaker 1>medis skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the skills remained constant </v>

1543
01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:16.000
<v Speaker 1>across transforming sets of games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it means to play fair.</v>

1544
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:19.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a bloody basis of morality as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as piaget was concerned.</v>

1545
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It's so damn smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1546
01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:25.780
<v Speaker 1>cause you think all interactions have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this game like quality,</v>

1547
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:26.614
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of bounded and but there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are commonalities across all the games </v>

1548
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:33.333
<v Speaker 1>and you want to extract out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonalities and you want to learn to </v>

1549
01:14:35.201 --> 01:14:36.034
<v Speaker 1>inhabit the universe that's made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the commonalities between games and </v>

1550
01:14:39.671 --> 01:14:41.290
<v Speaker 1>that's what it means to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1551
01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1552
01:14:42.731 --> 01:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>it varies to some degree from culture to</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture obviously,</v>

1553
01:14:45.371 --> 01:14:48.160
<v Speaker 1>because each culture is a game unto </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

1554
01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.500
<v Speaker 1>But there's something that transcends </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1555
01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:53.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the nature of games across game </v>
<v Speaker 1>contexts.</v>

1556
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:54.933
<v Speaker 1>And you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that because you can tell the </v>

1557
01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:59.830
<v Speaker 1>difference between a game and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that isn't the game instantly.</v>

1558
01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:01.203
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like there's only one kind </v>

1559
01:15:02.951 --> 01:15:05.710
<v Speaker 1>of game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hockey say and there's,</v>

1560
01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:10.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a world of warcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's way out of date,</v>

1561
01:15:10.961 --> 01:15:13.030
<v Speaker 1>but so am I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not surprising.</v>

1562
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:16.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that those things are very,</v>

1563
01:15:16.121 --> 01:15:17.440
<v Speaker 1>very different in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many,</v>

1564
01:15:17.441 --> 01:15:19.660
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't stop you from identifying the</v>

1565
01:15:19.661 --> 01:15:21.400
<v Speaker 1>underlying commonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1566
01:15:21.401 --> 01:15:24.310
<v Speaker 1>their games and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like stories in a sense.</v>

1567
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a Piagetian.</v>

1568
01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:30.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a Piagetian observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1569
01:15:30.161 --> 01:15:30.994
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

1570
01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:34.293
<v Speaker 1>So why do you develop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's because your previous idea </v>

1571
01:15:37.511 --> 01:15:38.860
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your previous frame,</v>

1572
01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.540
<v Speaker 1>micro frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1573
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:44.370
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fit the circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so something happens.</v>

1574
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:45.700
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go like this,</v>

1575
01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:47.470
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1576
01:15:47.471 --> 01:15:48.304
<v Speaker 1>the world isn't what you thought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with your </v>

1577
01:15:50.261 --> 01:15:51.094
<v Speaker 1>knowledge structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is partly what makes piaget a </v>

1578
01:15:52.841 --> 01:15:55.360
<v Speaker 1>pragmatist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the pragmatists,</v>

1579
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:58.180
<v Speaker 1>American School of Philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>William James and his followers,</v>

1580
01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:01.960
<v Speaker 1>they knew that we had bounded knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have infinite knowledge.</v>

1581
01:16:01.961 --> 01:16:02.741
<v Speaker 1>And so they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1582
01:16:02.741 --> 01:16:03.574
<v Speaker 1>that means we can't really be right </v>
<v Speaker 1>about anything because we're definitely </v>

1583
01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:09.550
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how is it that you can operate in</v>

1584
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:11.290
<v Speaker 1>the world given that you're always </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong?</v>

1585
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:12.423
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you set up a procedure that has rules </v>

1586
01:16:17.231 --> 01:16:20.890
<v Speaker 1>for what constitutes true within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedure itself.</v>

1587
01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:23.920
<v Speaker 1>So you play a game and at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you set up the rules.</v>

1588
01:16:23.921 --> 01:16:24.581
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1589
01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:25.780
<v Speaker 1>is this joke funny?</v>

1590
01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:28.060
<v Speaker 1>And then the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1591
01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:31.450
<v Speaker 1>do people laugh now when I tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>

1592
01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.610
<v Speaker 1>do they laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer's yes,</v>

1593
01:16:33.611 --> 01:16:35.710
<v Speaker 1>then it's funny enough you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

1594
01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you've taken a particular definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

1595
01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:41.950
<v Speaker 1>you've transformed it into a local </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>

1596
01:16:42.490 --> 01:16:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And if your behavior matches the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prediction in that local area,</v>

1597
01:16:46.931 --> 01:16:48.250
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's true enough.</v>

1598
01:16:48.251 --> 01:16:49.084
<v Speaker 1>Is it like transcendently funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you'd have to tell it to 200 </v>

1599
01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:54.730
<v Speaker 1>different groups of people to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that out.</v>

1600
01:16:54.731 --> 01:16:55.564
<v Speaker 1>But mostly it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny enough so that when I </v>

1601
01:16:57.251 --> 01:16:59.320
<v Speaker 1>predicted what would happen when I told </v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke,</v>

1602
01:16:59.321 --> 01:17:00.154
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't predict it by the way you </v>

1603
01:17:01.871 --> 01:17:04.090
<v Speaker 1>desire it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>

1604
01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause prediction has no motivation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1605
01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.620
<v Speaker 1>but desire does and we're always </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated,</v>

1606
01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always motivated.</v>

1607
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.593
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about the Ph </v>

1608
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Eddie and system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So two year olds,</v>

1609
01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.493
<v Speaker 1>they're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic and they bounced between one </v>

1610
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:24.290
<v Speaker 1>highly motivated emotional state to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

1611
01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.453
<v Speaker 1>And so the first thing that the two year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old has to do is get his or her act </v>

1612
01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:33.590
<v Speaker 1>together more or less inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1613
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two year olds still have tantrums and </v>

1614
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:40.010
<v Speaker 1>they still cry a lot and they still run </v>
<v Speaker 1>around like mad being joyful crazily,</v>

1615
01:17:40.011 --> 01:17:40.844
<v Speaker 1>which you have to train out of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away because it's nothing but </v>

1616
01:17:42.471 --> 01:17:43.304
<v Speaker 1>disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the most painful things </v>

1617
01:17:44.781 --> 01:17:45.614
<v Speaker 1>about being a parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 90% of the time you're going </v>

1618
01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:51.110
<v Speaker 1>stop having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop having fun.</v>

1619
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.153
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you turn into a teenager and </v>

1620
01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:56.900
<v Speaker 1>your parents get what they asked for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1621
01:17:56.901 --> 01:18:00.740
<v Speaker 1>but because positive emotion is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive and so chaotic,</v>

1622
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:04.100
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It manifests it within a,</v>

1623
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:05.203
<v Speaker 1>within a predictable environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're dampening down your </v>

1624
01:18:07.911 --> 01:18:08.744
<v Speaker 1>child's enthusiasm nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's but it has to be regulated because </v>

1625
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:12.733
<v Speaker 1>happiness is impulsive and chaotic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like to think that because </v>

1626
01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:16.431
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1627
01:18:16.431 --> 01:18:17.300
<v Speaker 1>we should be happy.</v>

1628
01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like Mannix or happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're maniacs.</v>

1629
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:23.240
<v Speaker 1>That's where the word comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just,</v>

1630
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:28.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two happy way too happy,</v>

1631
01:18:28.281 --> 01:18:29.114
<v Speaker 1>like someone who's way too stoned on </v>
<v Speaker 1>math or on cocaine and I mean that </v>

1632
01:18:32.811 --> 01:18:34.910
<v Speaker 1>technically because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very similar.</v>

1633
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:36.643
<v Speaker 1>They're very similar biochemical states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and and cocaine produces happiness </v>

1634
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:42.643
<v Speaker 1>pretty much in its pure form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does meth very rapidly and so it's </v>

1635
01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:47.870
<v Speaker 1>just not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1636
01:18:47.871 --> 01:18:50.330
<v Speaker 1>you lose judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He happy.</v>

1637
01:18:50.331 --> 01:18:53.600
<v Speaker 1>People do not have good judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're too happy they're here,</v>

1638
01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:55.010
<v Speaker 1>they get dopey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1639
01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like irrational stock market </v>

1640
01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.790
<v Speaker 1>bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy,</v>

1641
01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.980
<v Speaker 1>it's always going to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1642
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:03.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1643
01:19:03.651 --> 01:19:04.484
<v Speaker 1>it's not always going to go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you think when you're </v>

1644
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:07.910
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1645
01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:08.953
<v Speaker 1>the two year old has to get all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems sort of hammered </v>

1646
01:19:11.661 --> 01:19:13.430
<v Speaker 1>into one thing internally.</v>

1647
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.593
<v Speaker 1>Now in some sense from the Piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that happens within the </v>

1648
01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:19.780
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks of the child is egocentric,</v>

1649
01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:20.750
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1650
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:21.583
<v Speaker 1>and that that development takes place </v>
<v Speaker 1>internally and then it's not until the </v>

1651
01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:24.374
<v Speaker 1>child's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say about three that it can learn </v>

1652
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:26.833
<v Speaker 1>to bring it's controlled unity into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>unity with another controlled unity and </v>

1653
01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:32.204
<v Speaker 1>make a game that happens around three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that instead of </v>

1654
01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:38.870
<v Speaker 1>the child only pursuing his or her </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>

1655
01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:41.030
<v Speaker 1>although modulated by the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

1656
01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.193
<v Speaker 1>the child is able to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>another child and establish a shared </v>

1657
01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:46.850
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens when they play.</v>

1658
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:49.850
<v Speaker 1>And so obviously you play monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing.</v>

1659
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:53.060
<v Speaker 1>But when you play Peekaboo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you doing the same thing.</v>

1660
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.073
<v Speaker 1>It's like with your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually playing with object </v>

1661
01:19:55.821 --> 01:19:58.040
<v Speaker 1>permanence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad's gone,</v>

1662
01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad's here.</v>

1663
01:19:59.390 --> 01:20:00.021
<v Speaker 1>Ha Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1664
01:20:00.021 --> 01:20:01.760
<v Speaker 1>he's their dad's gone.</v>

1665
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Dad's here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad's gone.</v>

1666
01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Dad's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Kid Ben,</v>

1667
01:20:04.551 --> 01:20:05.384
<v Speaker 1>you can do that for like three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd ever get tired it because every </v>

1668
01:20:08.191 --> 01:20:10.020
<v Speaker 1>time you reappear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

1669
01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:12.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a miracle in you watch babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

1670
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Like you go like this and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you pop back out and they,</v>

1671
01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.860
<v Speaker 1>they're so happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just overjoyed.</v>

1672
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.840
<v Speaker 1>And then you take yourself away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1673
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

1674
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You reappear.</v>

1675
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:26.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a real memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1676
01:20:26.551 --> 01:20:27.384
<v Speaker 1>it's like reality is manifesting itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all its freshness moment by moment </v>

1677
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:33.773
<v Speaker 1>and they can't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are neurological conditions that </v>

1678
01:20:35.701 --> 01:20:37.440
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes,</v>

1679
01:20:37.441 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 1>and there are people who that this has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to.</v>

1680
01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:40.044
<v Speaker 1>So to get hippocampal damage and so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't move short term information into </v>

1681
01:20:43.141 --> 01:20:45.750
<v Speaker 1>longterm storage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this one guy,</v>

1682
01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:46.683
<v Speaker 1>it very interesting case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a concert pianist and he had a </v>

1683
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:53.550
<v Speaker 1>hell of a neurological injury and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could still play the piano,</v>

1684
01:20:53.551 --> 01:20:55.050
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't remember ache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't,</v>

1685
01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.420
<v Speaker 1>he had amnesia and he couldn't move </v>
<v Speaker 1>information from short term storage into</v>

1686
01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.150
<v Speaker 1>long term storage.</v>

1687
01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:01.920
<v Speaker 1>So as far as he was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1688
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:05.100
<v Speaker 1>it was always like 10 days before he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>his accident.</v>

1689
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:08.130
<v Speaker 1>He never got passed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was stuck in that moment and then,</v>

1690
01:21:08.131 --> 01:21:10.620
<v Speaker 1>but he could still play the piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by was so interesting.</v>

1691
01:21:10.621 --> 01:21:11.454
<v Speaker 1>You watch him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were films of him before he sat </v>

1692
01:21:13.141 --> 01:21:13.974
<v Speaker 1>down to play the piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd have like a seizure and then he </v>

1693
01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.420
<v Speaker 1>could play the piano procedural memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was intact.</v>

1694
01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.433
<v Speaker 1>And then at the end he kind of have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little seizure and then he'd go back to </v>

1695
01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:22.733
<v Speaker 1>being who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he had these notebooks and all he </v>

1696
01:21:25.231 --> 01:21:27.930
<v Speaker 1>did was write in them over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>

1697
01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:30.360
<v Speaker 1>It's as if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen this before.</v>

1698
01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:34.620
<v Speaker 1>It's as if I've never seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as if I've never seen this before.</v>

1699
01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:40.010
<v Speaker 1>So he's in this ecstatic state where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was novel and new and pure in</v>

1700
01:21:40.081 --> 01:21:42.510
<v Speaker 1>paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was no continuity.</v>

1701
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:44.520
<v Speaker 1>And so when his wife would come to visit</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

1702
01:21:44.521 --> 01:21:48.270
<v Speaker 1>he would just be overwhelmed to see her </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed every time.</v>

1703
01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:50.310
<v Speaker 1>And even if she just left the room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>came back in,</v>

1704
01:21:50.311 --> 01:21:52.770
<v Speaker 1>it was exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the kid.</v>

1705
01:21:52.771 --> 01:21:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like no object permanence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every time the face appears,</v>

1706
01:21:56.521 --> 01:21:58.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a staggering,</v>

1707
01:21:58.141 --> 01:22:00.450
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that in the reflexes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child.</v>

1708
01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:03.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's without object permanence.</v>

1709
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what piaget was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about with regards to object permanence.</v>

1710
01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:07.620
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cool.</v>

1711
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:11.130
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two year old's a collection of these</v>

1712
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:11.964
<v Speaker 1>sort of random motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less gets his or her act </v>

1713
01:22:14.641 --> 01:22:18.450
<v Speaker 1>together by about three if they're being</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialized properly.</v>

1714
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.673
<v Speaker 1>And that means that the parents are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing their best to make the child </v>

1715
01:22:22.591 --> 01:22:25.830
<v Speaker 1>acceptable to other children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your damn job as a parent,</v>

1716
01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:27.083
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your child is an acceptable to other </v>

1717
01:22:31.051 --> 01:22:34.230
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't play with your child and then</v>

1718
01:22:34.231 --> 01:22:35.064
<v Speaker 1>your child will be lonesome and isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and awkward and they will never recover </v>

1719
01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:41.730
<v Speaker 1>because if the kid doesn't get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right between two and four,</v>

1720
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:42.833
<v Speaker 1>it's silver.</v>

1721
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:43.913
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other kids accelerate forward that </v>

1722
01:22:45.931 --> 01:22:48.810
<v Speaker 1>kids left behind and it's not a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>life for that kid.</v>

1723
01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't learn how to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

1724
01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:51.953
<v Speaker 1>And then they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a huge literature on trying </v>

1725
01:22:54.331 --> 01:22:57.540
<v Speaker 1>to rectify antisocial children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say from the age of four on,</v>

1726
01:22:57.541 --> 01:22:59.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no you can't.</v>

1727
01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:01.163
<v Speaker 1>And you can go ahead and read three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 papers on rectification of social </v>

1728
01:23:05.411 --> 01:23:07.030
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And figure it out for yourself.</v>

1729
01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:10.060
<v Speaker 1>But I did that for about five years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a while ago,</v>

1730
01:23:10.061 --> 01:23:11.830
<v Speaker 1>but I know the literature hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>

1731
01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:14.500
<v Speaker 1>so you got to get it right between that </v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

1732
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:15.423
<v Speaker 1>You got to get the kid together enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can control themselves well </v>

1733
01:23:18.881 --> 01:23:19.714
<v Speaker 1>enough so that they can adopt a mutual </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame of reference with a peer so that </v>

1734
01:23:23.591 --> 01:23:24.424
<v Speaker 1>they can start using that to scaffold </v>
<v Speaker 1>their development further and become </v>

1735
01:23:26.981 --> 01:23:29.290
<v Speaker 1>more and more sophisticated and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions.</v>

1736
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:30.303
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acting as a proxy for the social </v>

1737
01:23:32.381 --> 01:23:33.790
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a parrot,</v>

1738
01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:38.140
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gentle proxy and informative proxy,</v>

1739
01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:41.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe even a merciful proxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a proxy nonetheless,</v>

1740
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.780
<v Speaker 1>because they're not going to be around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you forever.</v>

1741
01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:46.600
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be out there among </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who don't really care about them.</v>

1742
01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And if they don't have something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring to the table,</v>

1743
01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:49.774
<v Speaker 1>at least the ability to cooperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be lonesome and </v>

1744
01:23:52.691 --> 01:23:54.400
<v Speaker 1>isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not going to be good.</v>

1745
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

1746
01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.910
<v Speaker 1>here's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an idea.</v>

1747
01:23:57.911 --> 01:24:01.060
<v Speaker 1>So as you're moving from what is to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be,</v>

1748
01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.830
<v Speaker 1>you're in this little frame of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>

1749
01:24:02.831 --> 01:24:04.900
<v Speaker 1>this little game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little Piagetian game.</v>

1750
01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get what you want or </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict,</v>

1751
01:24:07.391 --> 01:24:11.680
<v Speaker 1>that's on the left hand side that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you happy and it validates your frame.</v>

1752
01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.610
<v Speaker 1>So if the frame keeps working across </v>
<v Speaker 1>different circumstances,</v>

1753
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you get a reward from that.</v>

1754
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.320
<v Speaker 1>The reward produces dopaminergic kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you feel good,</v>

1755
01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but the dopamine also enhances the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength of the circuitry that underlies</v>

1756
01:24:24.491 --> 01:24:27.610
<v Speaker 1>that particular representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what reinforcement is.</v>

1757
01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:31.060
<v Speaker 1>It's different than reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reward is what you feel,</v>

1758
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:31.953
<v Speaker 1>let's say roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reinforcement is the effect of the </v>

1759
01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:38.500
<v Speaker 1>dopamine bathing the neurological </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissues to make it stronger and grow.</v>

1760
01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:39.723
<v Speaker 1>And so if the neurological tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlies a sequence of actions that </v>

1761
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:43.084
<v Speaker 1>produces the desired outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a biochemical kick that </v>

1762
01:24:45.551 --> 01:24:46.384
<v Speaker 1>strengthens the nervous structures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were activated just before the good </v>

1763
01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:51.820
<v Speaker 1>thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how something,</v>

1764
01:24:51.821 --> 01:24:54.160
<v Speaker 1>you know that's valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets instantiated,</v>

1765
01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.980
<v Speaker 1>and if it fails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead you get punished.</v>

1766
01:24:57.130 --> 01:24:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

1767
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:59.583
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that starts to extinguish that </v>

1768
01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:03.064
<v Speaker 1>circuitry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know how that works </v>

1769
01:25:04.451 --> 01:25:05.284
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know exactly if those circuits </v>

1770
01:25:06.581 --> 01:25:07.414
<v Speaker 1>then start to die because they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerate across time or if what </v>

1771
01:25:10.541 --> 01:25:12.760
<v Speaker 1>happens is you build other circuits that</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibit them.</v>

1772
01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:15.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you've got this knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

1773
01:25:15.461 --> 01:25:16.294
<v Speaker 1>it's built into you and once it's there </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not really much getting rid of </v>

1774
01:25:18.851 --> 01:25:20.230
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can build another one that tells</v>

1775
01:25:20.231 --> 01:25:21.064
<v Speaker 1>it to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not sort of what happens when you're </v>

1776
01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:23.374
<v Speaker 1>addicted to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cocaine bathes the tissue that was </v>

1777
01:25:27.101 --> 01:25:27.934
<v Speaker 1>active just before you took the cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dopamine and so that gets stronger </v>

1778
01:25:30.491 --> 01:25:31.324
<v Speaker 1>and stronger and stronger and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're basically building a </v>

1779
01:25:34.151 --> 01:25:37.930
<v Speaker 1>cocaine seeking monster in your head and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all it wants.</v>

1780
01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:42.250
<v Speaker 1>And it has rationalizations and it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and it has motivations and it's</v>

1781
01:25:42.251 --> 01:25:44.620
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wants one thing.</v>

1782
01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.660
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is once you build that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1783
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:47.494
<v Speaker 1>especially if you nail it a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred times with a powerful </v>

1784
01:25:49.421 --> 01:25:50.254
<v Speaker 1>dopaminergic agonist like cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing is one vicious monster and </v>

1785
01:25:54.071 --> 01:25:57.910
<v Speaker 1>it's alive and it's in there and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get it to go away.</v>

1786
01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:01.180
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you can do is build </v>
<v Speaker 1>another structure to shut it up.</v>

1787
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:03.730
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get stressed,</v>

1788
01:26:03.731 --> 01:26:07.160
<v Speaker 1>it interferes with that new structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the old thing comes popping back up.</v>

1789
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

1790
01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.900
<v Speaker 1>And the faster acting.</v>

1791
01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1792
01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.560
<v Speaker 1>those dopaminergic agonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>star cocaine is a good example.</v>

1793
01:26:16.561 --> 01:26:19.050
<v Speaker 1>But so is math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The faster they hit you,</v>

1794
01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:22.020
<v Speaker 1>which is often why people inject them </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of starting them.</v>

1795
01:26:22.021 --> 01:26:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Say the faster that transformation from </v>
<v Speaker 1>steady state to dopaminergic bath,</v>

1796
01:26:27.001 --> 01:26:29.940
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the kick is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

1797
01:26:29.941 --> 01:26:32.970
<v Speaker 1>so speed of introduction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>substance matters,</v>

1798
01:26:32.971 --> 01:26:33.804
<v Speaker 1>which is why you drink shots instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking say wine or beer because </v>

1799
01:26:36.781 --> 01:26:40.680
<v Speaker 1>alcohol has very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar effects.</v>

1800
01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:41.963
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1801
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:51.020
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you get what you want,</v>

1802
01:26:51.021 --> 01:26:53.090
<v Speaker 1>well then you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not only do you feel good,</v>

1803
01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:56.450
<v Speaker 1>but the frame itself is validated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't get what you want,</v>

1804
01:26:56.451 --> 01:26:58.490
<v Speaker 1>well then not only do you not get what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

1805
01:26:58.491 --> 01:27:01.070
<v Speaker 1>but the frame itself starts to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart at the seams.</v>

1806
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:04.040
<v Speaker 1>And the question and parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far should the frame come apart?</v>

1807
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:07.700
<v Speaker 1>How deeply should you unlearn something </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you make a mistake.</v>

1808
01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:09.470
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

1809
01:27:09.471 --> 01:27:10.790
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard problem.</v>

1810
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.450
<v Speaker 1>And I'll show you a partial solution to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a very useful thing.</v>

1811
01:27:14.451 --> 01:27:17.120
<v Speaker 1>And this is a Piagetian idea too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1812
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to this for a minute.</v>

1813
01:27:20.031 --> 01:27:21.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1814
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to decompose something for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1815
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:26.083
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is partly to give you an </v>

1816
01:27:27.411 --> 01:27:29.250
<v Speaker 1>introduction to the way behaviors to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1817
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's also to help unpack how the P </v>
<v Speaker 1>is Yeti and notions work.</v>

1818
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:34.423
<v Speaker 1>And so from a Piagetian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high order abstractions are actually </v>

1819
01:27:37.851 --> 01:27:40.910
<v Speaker 1>made of what's common among actions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

1820
01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:42.253
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those things are unified in some </v>

1821
01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:44.324
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an abstraction isn't what's common </v>

1822
01:27:45.951 --> 01:27:49.430
<v Speaker 1>across sets of objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like what's common across sets</v>

1823
01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:52.580
<v Speaker 1>of perceptions and actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a hard thing to understand,</v>

1824
01:27:52.581 --> 01:27:54.530
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this will help you understand.</v>

1825
01:27:54.531 --> 01:27:55.364
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you want to be a good </v>

1826
01:27:56.391 --> 01:27:58.280
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kind of abstraction.</v>

1827
01:27:58.380 --> 01:27:59.540
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

1828
01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:01.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to be a good person?</v>

1829
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an empty box.</v>

1830
01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:06.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a box.</v>

1831
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:06.913
<v Speaker 1>And it says good person on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's full of things and might even </v>

1832
01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:11.990
<v Speaker 1>be full of transforming things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1833
01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:14.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say good person,</v>

1834
01:28:14.151 --> 01:28:16.190
<v Speaker 1>you kind of know when you kind of know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1835
01:28:16.191 --> 01:28:18.560
<v Speaker 1>if we started talking about details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might start to argue,</v>

1836
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:19.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's like pornography.</v>

1837
01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You know it when you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1838
01:28:21.291 --> 01:28:22.940
<v Speaker 1>so what does it mean to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>

1839
01:28:22.941 --> 01:28:25.040
<v Speaker 1>While we could decompose it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say,</v>

1840
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:27.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one way of being a good person</v>

1841
01:28:27.531 --> 01:28:28.364
<v Speaker 1>is to be a good parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you basically say that being a good </v>

1842
01:28:30.891 --> 01:28:32.900
<v Speaker 1>parent is a subset of being a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1843
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because person is bigger than parent and</v>

1844
01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:40.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'd be to be a good employer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a good sister and to be a good,</v>

1845
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:41.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

1846
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:43.460
<v Speaker 1>to be a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good partner,</v>

1847
01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.680
<v Speaker 1>sort of on the same level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

1848
01:28:45.710 --> 01:28:50.360
<v Speaker 1>So you decomposed good person into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>major functional roles,</v>

1849
01:28:50.361 --> 01:28:52.130
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're good at all of them,</v>

1850
01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:53.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1851
01:28:53.571 --> 01:28:56.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say if you're a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1852
01:28:56.181 --> 01:28:57.014
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a good job because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you starve and soda your </v>

1853
01:28:59.091 --> 01:28:59.540
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

1854
01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.670
<v Speaker 1>So at least you have to financially </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide in some manner.</v>

1855
01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a subset of being a good parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only subset.</v>

1856
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And then to be a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a good,</v>

1857
01:29:08.461 --> 01:29:09.294
<v Speaker 1>be a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have to take care of your </v>

1858
01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:11.244
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could decompose that into </v>

1859
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.590
<v Speaker 1>play with baby or complete meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

1860
01:29:16.591 --> 01:29:18.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can take care of family,</v>

1861
01:29:18.151 --> 01:29:21.360
<v Speaker 1>you can either order a meal or you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>cook one.</v>

1862
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:22.223
<v Speaker 1>It's like good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're cooking a meal and </v>

1863
01:29:25.201 --> 01:29:25.561
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1864
01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:26.394
<v Speaker 1>what do you decompose that into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you're starting to get to the </v>

1865
01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:30.090
<v Speaker 1>micro level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

1866
01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 1>because let's say you're making </v>
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli.</v>

1867
01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:33.053
<v Speaker 1>So you take the Broccoli out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fridge and you put it on the cutting </v>

1868
01:29:36.271 --> 01:29:38.040
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually action.</v>

1869
01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:38.874
<v Speaker 1>That's not abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually something you're doing </v>

1870
01:29:40.891 --> 01:29:41.550
<v Speaker 1>with your body.</v>

1871
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:44.850
<v Speaker 1>So the abstraction grounds itself out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro activity,</v>

1872
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:45.743
<v Speaker 1>actual action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the connection between the mind </v>

1873
01:29:47.521 --> 01:29:50.520
<v Speaker 1>and the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're cutting Broccoli,</v>

1874
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:52.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not abstraction.</v>

1875
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:56.640
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take apart these higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>order moral abstractions,</v>

1876
01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:57.474
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you decompose them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>action perception sequences and they're </v>

1877
01:30:00.571 --> 01:30:01.500
<v Speaker 1>embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1878
01:30:01.501 --> 01:30:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Piaget's basic claim is you build the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dam abstractions from the bottom up.</v>

1879
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:08.640
<v Speaker 1>That's his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fundamental piagetian claim.</v>

1880
01:30:08.641 --> 01:30:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's so the kid comes into the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some reflexes and starts building a</v>

1881
01:30:13.230 --> 01:30:17.130
<v Speaker 1>body of embodied knowledge out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction with other people.</v>

1882
01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:19.530
<v Speaker 1>And then they start playing games in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that abstracts.</v>

1883
01:30:19.531 --> 01:30:20.364
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they moved from the bottom of the </v>

1884
01:30:22.171 --> 01:30:23.004
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actual micro-actions up to the </v>

1885
01:30:24.601 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Speaker 1>top of the abstraction world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

1886
01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:30.540
<v Speaker 1>this is how you boost yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little bitty stories.</v>

1887
01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.590
<v Speaker 1>What little bitty stories at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut Broccoli,</v>

1888
01:30:34.890 --> 01:30:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then cut corn here,</v>

1889
01:30:37.111 --> 01:30:38.490
<v Speaker 1>set table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do dishes,</v>

1890
01:30:38.491 --> 01:30:40.230
<v Speaker 1>complete meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of your family,</v>

1891
01:30:40.231 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 1>be a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a good person.</v>

1892
01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:43.523
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the propositions that I am </v>

1893
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:49.020
<v Speaker 1>offering you in this class is that to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good person,</v>

1894
01:30:49.021 --> 01:30:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you're actually not stuck in one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

1895
01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:51.773
<v Speaker 1>To be a good person means that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that transforms these things </v>

1896
01:30:54.301 --> 01:30:55.134
<v Speaker 1>continually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what's at the top of the </v>

1897
01:30:56.881 --> 01:30:58.980
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically the hero story,</v>

1898
01:30:58.981 --> 01:31:02.420
<v Speaker 1>which is you're in a state of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an anomaly occurs,</v>

1899
01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.980
<v Speaker 1>you allow it to demolish you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you rebuild.</v>

1900
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's at the highest end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral hierarchy.</v>

1901
01:31:07.951 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's also essentially a Piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>

1902
01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:12.203
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's think about emotional </v>

1903
01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:14.664
<v Speaker 1>regulation because this is a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>schema for understanding emotional </v>

1904
01:31:17.641 --> 01:31:18.474
<v Speaker 1>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How upset should you get and how do you </v>

1905
01:31:20.791 --> 01:31:22.770
<v Speaker 1>calculate it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you make a mistake,</v>

1906
01:31:22.771 --> 01:31:24.420
<v Speaker 1>you wake up in the morning and your side</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurts,</v>

1907
01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:25.830
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1908
01:31:25.831 --> 01:31:27.750
<v Speaker 1>it's the first symptom of pancreatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

1909
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:30.060
<v Speaker 1>You're dead in six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent chance,</v>

1910
01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:32.910
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pulled a muscle.</v>

1911
01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is it?</v>

1912
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:36.181
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1913
01:31:36.181 --> 01:31:38.430
<v Speaker 1>the chances of the pancreatic cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>low,</v>

1914
01:31:38.431 --> 01:31:41.640
<v Speaker 1>but they're not zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like infinite times,</v>

1915
01:31:41.641 --> 01:31:45.030
<v Speaker 1>any proportion is a very large number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might be thinking,</v>

1916
01:31:45.031 --> 01:31:47.730
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just have a screaming fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime ever,</v>

1917
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:50.760
<v Speaker 1>any little thing happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what happens.</v>

1918
01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:52.170
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're two years old,</v>

1919
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:53.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what you do.</v>

1920
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's because you don't know.</v>

1921
01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:58.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things fell apart.</v>

1922
01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.700
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be anything.</v>

1923
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Well that's no good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1924
01:32:02.381 --> 01:32:05.260
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you're arguing with your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your partner,</v>

1925
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:06.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

1926
01:32:06.491 --> 01:32:07.324
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if they make a lousy meal or </v>

1927
01:32:08.711 --> 01:32:10.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe no meals and you're kind of sick </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

1928
01:32:10.841 --> 01:32:11.674
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you say you're a bad person and </v>

1929
01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:18.130
<v Speaker 1>what's the evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only are you a bad person,</v>

1930
01:32:18.131 --> 01:32:18.964
<v Speaker 1>but you've always been a bad person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

1931
01:32:22.391 --> 01:32:24.700
<v Speaker 1>improve in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks to me to be zero.</v>

1932
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's the person supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do punch you,</v>

1933
01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

1934
01:32:29.201 --> 01:32:31.840
<v Speaker 1>because there's no room in there for any</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

1935
01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:35.230
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're horrible</v>

1936
01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:40.210
<v Speaker 1>and you don't change and you've always </v>
<v Speaker 1>been horrible and you've never changed.</v>

1937
01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:43.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inferring from that into the future,</v>

1938
01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.490
<v Speaker 1>you're going to stay horrible and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to change.</v>

1939
01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Well at any argument can go there </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

1940
01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:51.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a really bad idea and it happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1941
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 1>And this is why people can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil discussion.</v>

1942
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:55.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't say,</v>

1943
01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:56.773
<v Speaker 2>MMM,</v>

1944
01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:01.750
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got your four year old,</v>

1945
01:33:01.770 --> 01:33:05.000
<v Speaker 1>you want them to clean up their room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's full of toys.</v>

1946
01:33:05.150 --> 01:33:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Let's say they're three and a half.</v>

1947
01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:09.980
<v Speaker 1>You look at it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1948
01:33:09.981 --> 01:33:10.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>

1949
01:33:10.641 --> 01:33:12.110
<v Speaker 1>clean this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean up your room.</v>

1950
01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:13.093
<v Speaker 1>So you shut the door and you go away and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you magically hope that when you come </v>

1951
01:33:15.261 --> 01:33:16.094
<v Speaker 1>back the room will be clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course the child has no idea in </v>

1952
01:33:18.861 --> 01:33:21.590
<v Speaker 1>all likelihood at that age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's two and a half,</v>

1953
01:33:21.591 --> 01:33:22.424
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what clean up our room </v>

1954
01:33:23.991 --> 01:33:25.520
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like way up here,</v>

1955
01:33:25.521 --> 01:33:26.354
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you told your child there's </v>

1956
01:33:28.311 --> 01:33:30.050
<v Speaker 1>mass every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a good person,</v>

1957
01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you come back in half an hour </v>

1958
01:33:32.001 --> 01:33:35.690
<v Speaker 1>and they're no better person than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were and you get upset.</v>

1959
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:37.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to say,</v>

1960
01:33:38.610 --> 01:33:39.443
<v Speaker 1>you see that teddy bear and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that kid knows how to see a teddy </v>

1961
01:33:43.221 --> 01:33:44.054
<v Speaker 1>bear and they know how to pick it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've watched him see a teddy </v>

1962
01:33:46.341 --> 01:33:47.174
<v Speaker 1>bear and pick it up and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child knows the name of the teddy </v>

1963
01:33:49.461 --> 01:33:49.880
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

1964
01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:50.713
<v Speaker 1>It's teddy bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you point to the teddy bear and </v>

1965
01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see that teddy bear?</v>

1966
01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.470
<v Speaker 1>And they go yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say that's good pat,</v>

1967
01:33:57.471 --> 01:33:58.304
<v Speaker 1>pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they get a little kick the DOPA </v>

1968
01:33:58.941 --> 01:34:01.250
<v Speaker 1>beans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's happy day for the kid and then</v>

1969
01:34:01.251 --> 01:34:03.680
<v Speaker 1>they smile at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you feel pretty good about that too.</v>

1970
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.903
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you could pick up the teddy </v>

1971
01:34:06.411 --> 01:34:07.820
<v Speaker 1>bear and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1972
01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:10.490
<v Speaker 1>And so they go over there and not every </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid by the way,</v>

1973
01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.460
<v Speaker 1>but they go over there and they pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the teddy bear and it's like,</v>

1974
01:34:13.461 --> 01:34:14.294
<v Speaker 1>it's a good day for both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say you see that little </v>

1975
01:34:16.161 --> 01:34:19.130
<v Speaker 1>space on the shelf cause you know they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what a shelf is and you know,</v>

1976
01:34:19.131 --> 01:34:21.380
<v Speaker 1>they know what is space is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

1977
01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.273
<v Speaker 1>take that teddy bear and put it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf and they go over there and they </v>

1978
01:34:24.651 --> 01:34:27.020
<v Speaker 1>put it in the shelf and then they look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at you and you're smiling.</v>

1979
01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And so the probability that they'll do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that again is now increased because bull</v>

1980
01:34:31.641 --> 01:34:32.474
<v Speaker 1>watching new smile produces a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dopaminergic kick and you've just </v>

1981
01:34:34.461 --> 01:34:35.294
<v Speaker 1>strengthened those circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would highly recommend that you do </v>

1982
01:34:37.521 --> 01:34:40.130
<v Speaker 1>that with your children and with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners.</v>

1983
01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watch them like,</v>

1984
01:34:42.450 --> 01:34:47.330
<v Speaker 1>like a sneaky person and every time they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something that you actually want them</v>

1985
01:34:47.331 --> 01:34:48.164
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd notice and you give them a little </v>

1986
01:34:49.311 --> 01:34:50.990
<v Speaker 1>pat on the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1987
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:53.390
<v Speaker 1>And then they like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

1988
01:34:53.391 --> 01:34:54.224
<v Speaker 1>But if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want them to like you </v>

1989
01:34:55.431 --> 01:34:57.860
<v Speaker 1>because you hate them and then you won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do but,</v>

1990
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.390
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't hate them.</v>

1991
01:34:59.391 --> 01:35:00.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes you do.</v>

1992
01:35:00.681 --> 01:35:02.450
<v Speaker 1>You just think about the last month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1993
01:35:02.451 --> 01:35:04.640
<v Speaker 1>there's been 20 times you absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>hated them.</v>

1994
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:08.660
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's the predominant emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not so good over time.</v>

1995
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:12.230
<v Speaker 1>So when they do something good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to screw things up,</v>

1996
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:15.830
<v Speaker 1>watch like a hawk and wait until they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something good and then punish them.</v>

1997
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:18.230
<v Speaker 1>That's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

1998
01:35:18.330 --> 01:35:21.530
<v Speaker 1>that really messes with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people do that all the time.</v>

1999
01:35:21.531 --> 01:35:25.580
<v Speaker 1>So if you really want to muck things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even do it more subtly.</v>

2000
01:35:25.581 --> 01:35:27.020
<v Speaker 1>You can wait until they do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2001
01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:27.854
<v Speaker 1>especially if they've never done it </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and they're just kind of </v>

2002
01:35:29.331 --> 01:35:31.970
<v Speaker 1>tentatively trying it and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore them.</v>

2003
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:33.223
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's even better than punishing them </v>

2004
01:35:35.601 --> 01:35:37.910
<v Speaker 1>because at least when you punish them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're paying attention.</v>

2005
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:40.730
<v Speaker 1>If you ignore them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>

2006
01:35:40.890 --> 01:35:41.723
<v Speaker 1>that's just perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also takes hardly any effort on your </v>

2007
01:35:43.431 --> 01:35:45.200
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an additional plus.</v>

2008
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:47.143
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're having a discussion with </v>

2009
01:35:48.921 --> 01:35:49.754
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like what you're doing with this </v>

2010
01:35:50.541 --> 01:35:51.291
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2011
01:35:51.291 --> 01:35:54.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're negotiating about meals.</v>

2012
01:35:54.411 --> 01:35:56.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad person.</v>

2013
01:35:56.190 --> 01:35:57.710
<v Speaker 1>That's way the hell up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2014
01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:58.693
<v Speaker 1>you blow the whole person's Schema right</v>
<v Speaker 1>out from underneath them and you might </v>

2015
01:36:01.701 --> 01:36:02.534
<v Speaker 1>as well get divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what will happen if you keep </v>

2016
01:36:04.521 --> 01:36:05.000
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

2017
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Soon you'll roll your eyes at each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

2018
01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.600
<v Speaker 1>That means you're getting divorced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

2019
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:10.190
<v Speaker 1>So if you ever watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

2020
01:36:10.191 --> 01:36:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's good empirical data on that.</v>

2021
01:36:12.081 --> 01:36:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Once you're at the eye rolling stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no going back.</v>

2022
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:20.090
<v Speaker 1>So you should intervene way before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's discussed that ai rule,</v>

2023
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:25.330
<v Speaker 1>once you've hit disease carrying rodent </v>
<v Speaker 1>status in your mate's eyes,</v>

2024
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 1>there's no common back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

2025
01:36:29.901 --> 01:36:30.734
<v Speaker 1>so what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to have a conversation with </v>

2026
01:36:32.241 --> 01:36:34.480
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a corrective conversation.</v>

2027
01:36:34.481 --> 01:36:38.690
<v Speaker 1>As you sort of take a Ph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie and attitude and the attitude is</v>

2028
01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:43.580
<v Speaker 1>go to the highest level of resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can manage.</v>

2029
01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:45.253
<v Speaker 1>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you're doing with the </v>

2030
01:36:45.831 --> 01:36:48.380
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like clean up your room,</v>

2031
01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:49.490
<v Speaker 1>be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2032
01:36:49.491 --> 01:36:51.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know any about anything about</v>

2033
01:36:51.111 --> 01:36:51.944
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do know how to pick up a teddy </v>

2034
01:36:52.611 --> 01:36:53.150
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

2035
01:36:53.150 --> 01:36:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you think cleaning up </v>
<v Speaker 1>your room is a hundred things like that.</v>

2036
01:36:57.230 --> 01:36:58.063
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to teach the child each </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those hundred things and then </v>

2037
01:37:00.321 --> 01:37:05.270
<v Speaker 1>they learn this is the scheme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They learn what's the same across all of</v>

2038
01:37:05.271 --> 01:37:07.820
<v Speaker 1>those different actions that's clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2039
01:37:08.150 --> 01:37:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Pick up the teddy bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put away the lady goes make your bed.</v>

2040
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:13.880
<v Speaker 1>What those have nothing in common </v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

2041
01:37:13.881 --> 01:37:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Like the motor outputs completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2042
01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:18.380
<v Speaker 1>But they fall under the heading of </v>
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>

2043
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:19.423
<v Speaker 1>But unless you fill the heading of clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the subordinate categories of </v>

2044
01:37:22.371 --> 01:37:25.940
<v Speaker 1>the action perception sequences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make up clean kid can't do it.</v>

2045
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:27.103
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what you're doing by </v>
<v Speaker 1>attending to your child constantly is </v>

2046
01:37:29.991 --> 01:37:30.824
<v Speaker 1>noticing where they are in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of this hierarchy and they </v>

2047
01:37:34.431 --> 01:37:36.470
<v Speaker 1>start way down here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2048
01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:38.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why you play peekaboo for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

2049
01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:41.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like they can do that and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2050
01:37:41.241 --> 01:37:42.074
<v Speaker 1>you interact with them cause you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch you do a little something and if </v>

2051
01:37:44.061 --> 01:37:45.950
<v Speaker 1>they respond you got some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2052
01:37:46.130 --> 01:37:46.963
<v Speaker 1>you're at the same level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And kids in playgrounds do that with </v>

2053
01:37:49.101 --> 01:37:51.020
<v Speaker 1>each other right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

2054
01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:51.973
<v Speaker 1>if you see two three year olds together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they're fairly sophisticated for </v>

2055
01:37:54.111 --> 01:37:56.370
<v Speaker 1>three year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they'll do is they'll start playing</v>

2056
01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:58.560
<v Speaker 1>a little primitive game with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like dog,</v>

2057
01:37:58.590 --> 01:37:59.423
<v Speaker 1>like a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what a dog does when it wants </v>

2058
01:38:00.361 --> 01:38:02.610
<v Speaker 1>to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of goes like that.</v>

2059
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:05.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's what kids do and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults do too.</v>

2060
01:38:05.971 --> 01:38:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a plague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's play invitation.</v>

2061
01:38:07.831 --> 01:38:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm ready but you're smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I'm ready.</v>

2062
01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:12.053
<v Speaker 1>It's and so you can tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a play fight and play and kids </v>

2063
01:38:15.031 --> 01:38:15.864
<v Speaker 1>can too.</v>

2064
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.823
<v Speaker 1>So it's an invitation to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're interacting with your </v>

2065
01:38:19.231 --> 01:38:20.064
<v Speaker 1>little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got that place circuit man that </v>

2066
01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:25.200
<v Speaker 1>thing's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when there from birth I think cause</v>

2067
01:38:25.201 --> 01:38:28.470
<v Speaker 1>you can play with the kid right from </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth at least something like peekaboo.</v>

2068
01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:31.230
<v Speaker 1>And so you're on the same wavelength </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

2069
01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.273
<v Speaker 1>And then you interact with them and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see if they're following what you're </v>

2070
01:38:34.261 --> 01:38:36.810
<v Speaker 1>doing is what I'm doing when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecturing more or less,</v>

2071
01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:37.644
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching you guys and seeing if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're more or less on the in the same </v>

2072
01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.400
<v Speaker 1>shared space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2073
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:48.330
<v Speaker 1>and we want the space to be expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if it's just staying the same,</v>

2074
01:38:48.331 --> 01:38:51.870
<v Speaker 1>well you might as well play whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>play on your computer.</v>

2075
01:38:52.710 --> 01:38:56.010
<v Speaker 1>It has to be expanding at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's optimal.</v>

2076
01:38:56.011 --> 01:38:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're playing with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

2077
01:38:57.781 --> 01:38:58.614
<v Speaker 1>you put them on that developmental edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're undoing and then </v>

2078
01:39:01.381 --> 01:39:03.630
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding their little skills.</v>

2079
01:39:04.050 --> 01:39:05.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>

2080
01:39:05.161 --> 01:39:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I had this memory from when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid a while back and I remembered</v>

2081
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:11.663
<v Speaker 1>I used to go over to these people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>house with my father and my mom and it </v>

2082
01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:17.790
<v Speaker 1>was way up in northern Alberta and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were Russian immigrants,</v>

2083
01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:21.180
<v Speaker 1>children of Russian immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had a farm house way,</v>

2084
01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:22.133
<v Speaker 1>way out in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way out by the way there where the </v>

2085
01:39:23.761 --> 01:39:27.060
<v Speaker 1>railroad actually ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you walk north from there,</v>

2086
01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:28.133
<v Speaker 1>you'd walk until you hit like southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe without fun running into another </v>

2087
01:39:31.861 --> 01:39:33.570
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was way the hell out in the middle of</v>

2088
01:39:33.571 --> 01:39:36.030
<v Speaker 1>nowhere and in new ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a nice house,</v>

2089
01:39:36.130 --> 01:39:37.200
<v Speaker 1>like a warm house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2090
01:39:37.201 --> 01:39:39.510
<v Speaker 1>they had three kids and they were way </v>
<v Speaker 1>older than me,</v>

2091
01:39:39.511 --> 01:39:41.490
<v Speaker 1>but it was real fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable place to go.</v>

2092
01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:45.090
<v Speaker 1>And I used to sit in the living room </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my father and his friend.</v>

2093
01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose name was nick?</v>

2094
01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:49.830
<v Speaker 1>And Nick was a really playful guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked him.</v>

2095
01:39:49.831 --> 01:39:51.870
<v Speaker 1>He was like my surrogate grandfather and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

2096
01:39:51.871 --> 01:39:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I was more than about </v>
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

2097
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.433
<v Speaker 1>I'd sit there and I tried to hit his </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot with my fist and he would be </v>

2098
01:39:58.711 --> 01:40:00.000
<v Speaker 1>talking to my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2099
01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:01.290
<v Speaker 1>And my dad would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

2100
01:40:01.291 --> 01:40:02.760
<v Speaker 1>don't bother nick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick would say,</v>

2101
01:40:02.761 --> 01:40:03.594
<v Speaker 1>well he's not really bothering me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because dad was checking it out to </v>

2102
01:40:06.181 --> 01:40:08.790
<v Speaker 1>see if I was an annoying twerp or if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a fun kid,</v>

2103
01:40:08.791 --> 01:40:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's a fine line.</v>

2104
01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:12.803
<v Speaker 1>And so I tried to hit his foot and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would move it and I had this memory </v>

2105
01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:17.610
<v Speaker 1>allow back and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2106
01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.140
<v Speaker 1>that was a good memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

2107
01:40:19.141 --> 01:40:20.490
<v Speaker 1>what is going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2108
01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And I realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he sharpened when he was sharpening</v>

2109
01:40:23.161 --> 01:40:24.300
<v Speaker 1>me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2110
01:40:24.301 --> 01:40:25.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like I was aiming at something.</v>

2111
01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You're aiming at something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're pointing your eyes at it,</v>

2112
01:40:29.161 --> 01:40:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you're pointing your whole damn soul out</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2113
01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:31.524
<v Speaker 1>You're aiming at something and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get your behaviors and your </v>

2114
01:40:33.601 --> 01:40:37.740
<v Speaker 1>conceptions in line and organized so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can attain that aim.</v>

2115
01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:39.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2116
01:40:39.931 --> 01:40:41.410
<v Speaker 1>we throw rocks at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

2117
01:40:41.490 --> 01:40:43.560
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fire arrows at things.</v>

2118
01:40:43.561 --> 01:40:46.320
<v Speaker 1>We shoot guns at things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we aim at things.</v>

2119
01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Our whole body is that platform for </v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming.</v>

2120
01:40:49.650 --> 01:40:52.020
<v Speaker 1>And I was trying to aim at his feet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd move his feet,</v>

2121
01:40:52.021 --> 01:40:52.854
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'd let me hit at what now and </v>

2122
01:40:54.071 --> 01:40:56.950
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say you're a rat.</v>

2123
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like I said,</v>

2124
01:40:58.841 --> 01:41:00.250
<v Speaker 1>a rat's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good model for a person.</v>

2125
01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're a little rat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a juvenile male,</v>

2126
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:06.610
<v Speaker 1>and you want to play because you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play and you'll work to play.</v>

2127
01:41:06.611 --> 01:41:08.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we know you want to play.</v>

2128
01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:10.170
<v Speaker 1>If we're experimental psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you'll brush,</v>

2129
01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:11.193
<v Speaker 1>but button push like mad to get access </v>
<v Speaker 1>to an arena where you can wrestle with </v>

2130
01:41:14.681 --> 01:41:15.514
<v Speaker 1>another little rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so rats wrestle just like human </v>

2131
01:41:17.921 --> 01:41:20.830
<v Speaker 1>beings and they even pin each other just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like human beings.</v>

2132
01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:21.664
<v Speaker 1>And they love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you put little rat a in with </v>

2133
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:27.220
<v Speaker 1>little rat B and little rat B is 10% </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

2134
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.150
<v Speaker 1>little rat B can stomp the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>little rat a all the time.</v>

2135
01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:32.553
<v Speaker 1>So they go out there and have a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance competition and little rat B </v>

2136
01:41:37.001 --> 01:41:39.720
<v Speaker 1>is going to win because he's bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now he's dominant rat.</v>

2137
01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.450
<v Speaker 1>So then they play and they wrestle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>little rat a loses.</v>

2138
01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:48.370
<v Speaker 1>And then next time they both know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>little rat a is the inviter because he's</v>

2139
01:41:48.371 --> 01:41:50.830
<v Speaker 1>subordinate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's the one that has to go up to the</v>

2140
01:41:50.831 --> 01:41:52.480
<v Speaker 1>big rat and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ready?</v>

2141
01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:54.220
<v Speaker 1>And the big rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll wrestle.</v>

2142
01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:55.083
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you repeatedly pair them and the big </v>

2143
01:41:58.091 --> 01:42:02.320
<v Speaker 1>rat doesn't let the little rat win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 30% of the time,</v>

2144
01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:04.840
<v Speaker 1>the little rat won't invite him to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2145
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And that was Jaak Panksepp who figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>that out.</v>

2146
01:42:07.481 --> 01:42:12.481
<v Speaker 1>And that is mind boggling because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells you like the bit,</v>

2147
01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:15.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an ethical basis for play that's</v>

2148
01:42:15.161 --> 01:42:18.040
<v Speaker 1>so deep that the damn rat and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>rats,</v>

2149
01:42:18.041 --> 01:42:20.560
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not known for their sense of fair play.</v>

2150
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:21.723
<v Speaker 1>The big red has to let the little rat </v>
<v Speaker 1>win 30% of the time or the little rat </v>

2151
01:42:24.941 --> 01:42:29.890
<v Speaker 1>will not play anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even rats know that it's so profound</v>

2152
01:42:29.891 --> 01:42:33.670
<v Speaker 1>that discovery like Panksepp discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>the play circuit in mammals.</v>

2153
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:34.623
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like discovering a whole </v>

2154
01:42:35.561 --> 01:42:37.570
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a big deal.</v>

2155
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 1>He should have gotten a Nobel prize for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2156
01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:43.090
<v Speaker 1>And to see that that's built in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of fair play,</v>

2157
01:42:43.330 --> 01:42:44.470
<v Speaker 1>that's mind boggling.</v>

2158
01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's evidence for the biological</v>

2159
01:42:46.991 --> 01:42:50.290
<v Speaker 1>instantiation of a complex morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair play.</v>

2160
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Even if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you shouldn't all the time.</v>

2161
01:42:53.890 --> 01:42:54.723
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm trying to hit nick's feet </v>

2162
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:56.913
<v Speaker 1>with my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm really paying attention and </v>

2163
01:42:58.631 --> 01:42:59.464
<v Speaker 1>he's moving it pretty well but now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I get to nail it and I'm feeling </v>

2164
01:43:01.811 --> 01:43:03.490
<v Speaker 1>pretty good about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2165
01:43:03.491 --> 01:43:04.324
<v Speaker 1>And he makes a little bit more difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time so that my aim gets better </v>

2166
01:43:07.151 --> 01:43:09.880
<v Speaker 1>and better and I'm building up my motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordination.</v>

2167
01:43:09.881 --> 01:43:10.714
<v Speaker 1>I'm building up my social skills because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hit too hard and I don't cry </v>

2168
01:43:13.361 --> 01:43:16.720
<v Speaker 1>when I Miss Because that just makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying to play with.</v>

2169
01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:17.583
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm learning really complicated </v>

2170
01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:22.000
<v Speaker 1>things about how to go about finessing </v>
<v Speaker 1>my aim.</v>

2171
01:43:22.210 --> 01:43:25.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you're doing with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and what are they aiming at?</v>

2172
01:43:25.150 --> 01:43:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Well they aim higher and higher.</v>

2173
01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:32.410
<v Speaker 1>So when my son was about two and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had him start setting the table.</v>

2174
01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:33.370
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't say,</v>

2175
01:43:33.370 --> 01:43:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you know you want to take grandma's fine</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and to go set the table.</v>

2176
01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like no you don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say you know what a fork looks like.</v>

2177
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:42.520
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah I see.</v>

2178
01:43:42.521 --> 01:43:45.130
<v Speaker 1>If you weren't at the forks are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't work.</v>

2179
01:43:45.131 --> 01:43:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Cause the drovers way up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2180
01:43:46.691 --> 01:43:48.400
<v Speaker 1>So you have to hand him a fork.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

2181
01:43:48.401 --> 01:43:49.234
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take this fork and go put it on the </v>

2182
01:43:50.501 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 1>table and he's this high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2183
01:43:52.371 --> 01:43:54.800
<v Speaker 1>so he goes over to the table and he puts</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fork up here,</v>

2184
01:43:54.801 --> 01:43:55.634
<v Speaker 1>can't even see what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He puts the fork up there and then you </v>

2185
01:43:58.341 --> 01:43:59.174
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's reasonably happy with that and you </v>

2186
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:03.590
<v Speaker 1>give them a path and then you go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>give them a really sharp,</v>

2187
01:44:03.591 --> 01:44:04.790
<v Speaker 1>not no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do that.</v>

2188
01:44:06.330 --> 01:44:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give him a spode and you say,</v>

2189
01:44:08.781 --> 01:44:11.270
<v Speaker 1>well go put the spoon beside the fork </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't say,</v>

2190
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:13.100
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stupid kid,</v>

2191
01:44:13.210 --> 01:44:14.043
<v Speaker 1>you've got to leave enough space between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fork and the spoon so the plate can </v>

2192
01:44:16.941 --> 01:44:18.530
<v Speaker 1>fit there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you know anything?</v>

2193
01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.270
<v Speaker 1>You're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2194
01:44:20.271 --> 01:44:21.770
<v Speaker 1>well that's right up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2195
01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:23.690
<v Speaker 1>You're a bad kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2196
01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:25.790
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't do that.</v>

2197
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:26.923
<v Speaker 1>You go down here and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well good micro routine adaptation </v>

2198
01:44:29.991 --> 01:44:30.824
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chum,</v>

2199
01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:34.850
<v Speaker 1>let's try it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you build that up and like</v>

2200
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:35.743
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't extend the kid passed its </v>

2201
01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:38.204
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His point or her point of exhaustion </v>

2202
01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.190
<v Speaker 1>because it's got to be a game and a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old can probably only do that for,</v>

2203
01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.310
<v Speaker 1>you can watch them and some are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>persistent than others,</v>

2204
01:44:46.311 --> 01:44:48.920
<v Speaker 1>but 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes,</v>

2205
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:50.263
<v Speaker 1>you're pushing your luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take a two year old to a </v>

2206
01:44:51.741 --> 01:44:55.550
<v Speaker 1>restaurant for about 40 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect them to sit and behave.</v>

2207
01:44:55.730 --> 01:44:57.410
<v Speaker 1>But after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2208
01:44:57.570 --> 01:44:58.160
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2209
01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.160
<v Speaker 1>they're the will exhausts them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2210
01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:01.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

2211
01:45:01.791 --> 01:45:04.370
<v Speaker 1>that's piaget and his nascent form </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

2212
01:45:04.371 --> 01:45:05.204
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you remember that diagram and you </v>

2213
01:45:06.651 --> 01:45:07.484
<v Speaker 1>think about how that would be built from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom up and how there would be a </v>

2214
01:45:10.341 --> 01:45:13.510
<v Speaker 1>stage transition every time those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are learned,</v>

2215
01:45:13.511 --> 01:45:16.250
<v Speaker 1>you kind of got the essential elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Piagetian theory.</v>

2216
01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.300
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see you Thursday.</v>
