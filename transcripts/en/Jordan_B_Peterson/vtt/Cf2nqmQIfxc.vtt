00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.143
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to recommend a book first to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone here.</v>

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>It's called explaining postmodernism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's by a gentleman named Steven Hicks,</v>

4
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>and you need to understand postmodernism</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you're up against.</v>

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>You're up against it far more than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know or think,</v>

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>and it's a much more well developed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pervasive pernicious,</v>

7
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.194
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually attractive doctrine than </v>

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.203
<v Speaker 1>has yet come to public realization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It absolutely dominates the humanities </v>

9
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>and increasingly the social sciences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universities.</v>

10
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>And what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

11
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 1>someone once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who unfortunately I can't remember.</v>

12
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:45.684
<v Speaker 1>It might've been Friedrich Nietzsche </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that everybody is the unconscious </v>

13
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>exponent of a dead philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

14
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>fortunately the postmodern philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are dead.</v>

15
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.073
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that their words </v>

16
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>aren't continually being spoken by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who,</v>

17
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>who are following in their wake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

18
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like any given person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely possessed,</v>

19
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.403
<v Speaker 1>say by the spirit of postmodernism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because often they're not educated </v>

20
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>enough to know all the details about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that has them in their grip.</v>

21
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.363
<v Speaker 1>But if you get 20 of them together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all five percent influenced by </v>

22
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>the postmodernist ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically have the spirit of the mob</v>

23
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>that's a mouthpiece for that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical doctrine.</v>

24
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.133
<v Speaker 1>And if you understand the doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you understand why things are </v>

25
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>progressing the way that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressing.</v>

26
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:30.984
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to tell you a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about the doctrine because it's not </v>

27
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:35.304
<v Speaker 1>optional to understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely crucial to understand </v>

28
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:39.174
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't underestimate the power of </v>

29
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>ideas and also the power of words of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

30
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.204
<v Speaker 1>because ideas are expressed in words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see the postmodernists </v>

31
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>completely reject the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization.</v>

32
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.183
<v Speaker 1>And I mean completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example in one </v>

33
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Derrida,</v>

34
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.503
<v Speaker 1>who's head trickster for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist movement regarded Western </v>

35
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:02.064
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the patriarchy as fellow </v>

36
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>goes centric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

37
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So follow comes from Fellas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>p h a l,</v>

38
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>l o.</v>

39
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.953
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the insistence that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see in Western culture is the </v>

40
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>consequence of a male dominated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive,</v>

41
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>a self serving society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we might say,</v>

42
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.903
<v Speaker 1>societies do tend to be self serving and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in power do tend to act in their </v>

44
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:25.314
<v Speaker 1>best interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a tendency is not an absolute and </v>

45
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that needs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be considered continually.</v>

46
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.184
<v Speaker 1>There are no shortage of flaws in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner in which we've structured our </v>

47
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>society and compared to any hypothetical</v>
<v Speaker 1>utopia,</v>

48
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:39.234
<v Speaker 1>it's an absolutely dismal rec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but compared to the rest of the world </v>

49
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>and the plight of other societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the history of mankind,</v>

50
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:46.614
<v Speaker 1>we're doing pretty damn well and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be happy to be living in the </v>

51
00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>society that we're living in.</v>

52
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 2>So the first one</v>

53
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.093
<v Speaker 1>thing that you might want to note about </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism is that it doesn't have a </v>

54
00:02:57.231 --> 00:02:58.064
<v Speaker 1>shred of gratitude and there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologically wrong with a person who </v>

55
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:02.360
<v Speaker 1>does have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

56
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.193
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they lived in what so </v>

57
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.290
<v Speaker 1>far is the best of all possible worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not great for a,</v>

58
00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you're driven by resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment is the boat the worst emotion</v>

59
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>that you can possibly experience apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>from arrogancy,</v>

60
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogance and deceit.</v>

61
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.603
<v Speaker 1>There's an evil triad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're bitter about everything </v>

62
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:22.144
<v Speaker 1>that's happening around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that you're bathed in </v>

63
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:24.874
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's something absolutely wrong </v>

64
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:26.674
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the black community in the </v>

65
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>United States is the 18th wealthiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

66
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>18th wealthiest nation on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

67
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.234
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean there isn't such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as relative poverty in relative </v>

68
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>poverty matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an important,</v>

69
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>it's an important political economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue and it's very,</v>

70
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but absolute wealth matters too,</v>

71
00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:44.804
<v Speaker 1>and and western societies have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely remarkable in their ability </v>

72
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>to generate and distribute wealth.</v>

73
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.050
<v Speaker 1>As you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by just looking around,</v>

74
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.233
<v Speaker 1>taking a brief bit of consideration for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute miracle that even a </v>

75
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.134
<v Speaker 1>building like this represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to educate yourself about </v>

76
00:03:58.691 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

77
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>so here's what the postmodernist belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't believe in the individual.</v>

78
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the logos park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western culture is fell logocentric logo</v>

79
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>is logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly the Christian word,</v>

80
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly the root word of </v>
<v Speaker 1>logic,</v>

81
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in logic.</v>

82
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.503
<v Speaker 1>They believe that logic is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process by which the patriarchal </v>

83
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>institutions of the West continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate and to justify their dominance.</v>

84
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The root word of dialogue is logos.</v>

85
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.134
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't believe that people of </v>

86
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>goodwill can come to consensus through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

87
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>through the exchange of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe that that notion is part of</v>

88
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>the philosophical substructure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>practices of the dominant culture,</v>

89
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.113
<v Speaker 1>so the reason they don't let people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't agree with speak on campuses </v>

90
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>because they don't agree with letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people speak.</v>

91
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not part of the ethos.</v>

92
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.233
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what else do they believe and not </v>

93
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:54.304
<v Speaker 1>believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe that since you don't have </v>

94
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:56.884
<v Speaker 1>an individual identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fundamental identity is group </v>

95
00:04:58.961 --> 00:04:59.794
<v Speaker 1>fostered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means that you're basically an </v>

96
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 1>exemplar of your race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence white privilege,</v>

97
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.673
<v Speaker 1>or you're an exemplar of your gender or </v>
<v Speaker 1>your sex or your ethnicity or your an </v>

98
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 1>exemplar of however you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>classified so that you,</v>

99
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.930
<v Speaker 1>you are placed in the position of victim</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the oppressor because that's the</v>

100
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.800
<v Speaker 1>game and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

101
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a postmark sleight of hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:23.164
<v Speaker 1>The old Marxist notion was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world was a battleground between the </v>

103
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:27.214
<v Speaker 1>Burj waze and the proletariat and that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>failed to have any philosophical or </v>

104
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:33.964
<v Speaker 1>ethical standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That argument after the working class </v>

105
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>actually saw its standard of living </v>
<v Speaker 1>massively elevated as a consequence of,</v>

106
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 1>of Western corporate democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Western free enterprise democracy,</v>

107
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.013
<v Speaker 1>and also be and and also as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the revelations of </v>

108
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:50.794
<v Speaker 1>everything terrible that it happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every bloody country that ever dared to </v>

109
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:55.860
<v Speaker 1>make equity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

110
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>and the Marxist communist dogma part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fundamental structure,</v>

111
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.673
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nothing but murderousness and </v>

112
00:06:01.801 --> 00:06:02.634
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>

113
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 1>And so by the 19 seventies it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>evident that that game was up.</v>

114
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.543
<v Speaker 1>No postmark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernist Marxist just barely </v>

115
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>basically pulled a sleight of hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

116
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not the poor against the rich,</v>

117
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the oppressed against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressor.</v>

118
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:16.034
<v Speaker 1>We'll just read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>divide the subpopulations in ways that </v>

119
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>make our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our bloody philosophy continue in its,</v>

120
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>in its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its movement forward.</v>

121
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's where we're at now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for the postmodernists,</v>

122
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>the world is a hobbs Z and battleground </v>
<v Speaker 1>of identity groups.</v>

123
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>They do not communicate with one another</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can't.</v>

124
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>All there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a struggle for power and if you're in</v>

125
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>the Predator group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you're an oppressor,</v>

126
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 1>then you better look out because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly welcome.</v>

127
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly welcome and neither are your</v>

128
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you're up against.</v>

129
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.503
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's time for conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop apologizing for being </v>

130
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

131
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't apologize to these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big mistake.</v>

132
00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Apology there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They read apology as a,</v>

133
00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:05.490
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an admission of guilt.</v>

134
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't apologize and you don't back </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

135
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.590
<v Speaker 1>You young people that are out there who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are university students.</v>

136
00:07:10.591 --> 00:07:12.390
<v Speaker 1>You need to take over the student </v>
<v Speaker 1>unions.</v>

137
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.313
<v Speaker 1>You need to take them back because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're absolute snake pits and they </v>

138
00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:16.230
<v Speaker 1>have been since the 19th.</v>

139
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

140
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And with regards with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

141
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:25.154
<v Speaker 1>I thought at one point that the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do would be to cut their </v>

142
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:27.674
<v Speaker 1>funding by 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them fight amongst themselves for </v>

143
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:30.704
<v Speaker 1>the remnants because it would force the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities to decide exactly what's </v>

144
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:34.304
<v Speaker 1>important and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say the humanities and much </v>

145
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:37.454
<v Speaker 1>of the social sciences have has turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a postmodern Neil Marxist </v>

146
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 1>playground for radicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scholarship is terrible.</v>

147
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Eighty percent of humanities papers </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't cited once,</v>

148
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.773
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what that means is that they </v>

149
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.054
<v Speaker 1>write papers for each other and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell them to libraries and that's how </v>

150
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 1>the publishers make their money and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one reads them,</v>

151
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:55.244
<v Speaker 1>but the publishers can print them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the libraries have to buy them </v>

152
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.303
<v Speaker 1>and they're buying them with your tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and so all of you who are sitting </v>

153
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:01.574
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our funding and postmodern radical neo </v>

154
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:05.624
<v Speaker 1>Marxist agenda that has its roots in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university and your tax money is going </v>

155
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>towards that and if you want proof of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

156
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>you just go online and look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>websites,</v>

157
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>especially of of disciplines like </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's studies,</v>

158
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>which has pathological right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>

159
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just women's studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all the ethnic studies groups.</v>

160
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.370
<v Speaker 1>It's anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sociology,</v>

161
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.233
<v Speaker 1>it's social work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of all it's education and </v>

162
00:08:29.911 --> 00:08:31.020
<v Speaker 1>noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

163
00:08:31.021 --> 00:08:34.560
<v Speaker 1>in Ontario is perhaps a part from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission,</v>

164
00:08:34.561 --> 00:08:36.570
<v Speaker 1>the most dangerous institution in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>

165
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.613
<v Speaker 1>It should,</v>

166
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.650
<v Speaker 1>it should be defunded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>

167
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.750
<v Speaker 1>They don't do the research they purport </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

168
00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:47.070
<v Speaker 1>They're not interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

169
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.030
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

170
00:08:48.031 --> 00:08:50.580
<v Speaker 1>in education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're interested in the indoctrination</v>

171
00:08:50.581 --> 00:08:51.414
<v Speaker 1>of people as young as they can fund a as</v>
<v Speaker 1>young as they can get their hands on to </v>

172
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:56.154
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we need to figure out our society </v>

173
00:08:58.261 --> 00:08:59.094
<v Speaker 1>needs to figure out how to stop shunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>public tax money to radical left wing </v>

174
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:04.074
<v Speaker 1>activists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we were doing that for radical right </v>

175
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 1>wing activists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be an absolute storm,</v>

176
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's happened incrementally since </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties and it needs to stop.</v>

177
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly what the Conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only conservatives,</v>

178
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:17.844
<v Speaker 1>but also liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true liberals in the English sense are </v>

179
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:20.874
<v Speaker 1>up against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what's happened as also as a </v>

180
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 1>consequence of this postmodern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neo Marxist intellectual invasion,</v>

181
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>is that the center keeps moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's moved way to the right now.</v>

182
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a classic liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've become a conservative.</v>

183
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>And so for all of you who are interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pursuing the conservative agenda,</v>

184
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of classic liberals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be talking to.</v>

185
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to talking to young people,</v>

186
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you finally have something to sell to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

187
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:45.084
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to sell conservatism to </v>

188
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 1>young people because they want to change</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and that's not what conservatives</v>

189
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to maintain things.</v>

190
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you've got something to sell to </v>

191
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:54.294
<v Speaker 1>young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sell them freedom of speech and </v>

192
00:09:57.001 --> 00:10:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you can tell seldom responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left is selling them,</v>

193
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can sell them responsibility.</v>

194
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you because I received </v>
<v Speaker 1>many letters of the sort that,</v>

195
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>that God was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people are absolutely starving for</v>

196
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:12.990
<v Speaker 1>someone to provide them with a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and say,</v>

197
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something worth living for it,</v>

198
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:15.594
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

199
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.453
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find meaning in life with </v>

200
00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:23.440
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But freedom.</v>

201
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Freedom is a chaotic sort of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

202
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.120
<v Speaker 1>And freedom isn't the sort of thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes people happy.</v>

203
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:30.160
<v Speaker 1>It's the sort of thing that makes people</v>
<v Speaker 1>troublesome,</v>

204
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.500
<v Speaker 1>troubled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because freedom expands your.</v>

205
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.200
<v Speaker 1>You're a series of choices and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you nervous and uncertain.</v>

206
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:40.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but responsibility is another.</v>

207
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Not to say that that's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing,</v>

208
00:10:43.421 --> 00:10:45.280
<v Speaker 1>but it it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires that you,</v>

209
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.400
<v Speaker 1>that you shoulder the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the freedom,</v>

210
00:10:48.401 --> 00:10:53.020
<v Speaker 1>but responsibility per se is what gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life meaning genuine meaning in the</v>

211
00:10:53.021 --> 00:10:56.410
<v Speaker 1>face of suffering and you and young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are really.</v>

212
00:10:56.411 --> 00:10:57.244
<v Speaker 1>They're starving for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been teaching young people for 30 </v>

213
00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:02.710
<v Speaker 1>years and mostly what I've been teaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>them about his responsibility,</v>

214
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.020
<v Speaker 1>so like your arrows to a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

215
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not perfect obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but comparatively the nerve,</v>

216
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.480
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing else like it that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>been produced and it's it.</v>

217
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It represents a tiny minority of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

218
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.870
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human policies,</v>

219
00:11:16.871 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 1>most of which are are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

220
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.733
<v Speaker 1>are run by murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antisocial psychopathic thugs and that </v>

221
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.750
<v Speaker 1>seriously and so what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative is that?</v>

222
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.140
<v Speaker 1>We've got this beacon of freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and the West that works,</v>

223
00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:35.020
<v Speaker 1>although it doesn't work perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the,</v>

224
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the responsibilities of young </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is to find out what's at the core</v>

225
00:11:38.771 --> 00:11:40.180
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great,</v>

226
00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:42.640
<v Speaker 1>great core of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paramount,</v>

227
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.690
<v Speaker 1>the paramount importance of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and the divinity of speech.</v>

228
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something to sell.</v>

229
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It's what our whole culture is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on.</v>

230
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.500
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
