00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you about an event that's</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:09.231
<v Speaker 1>going to take place in Toronto on July </v>
<v Speaker 1>18th at 7:30 PM it's going to be held at</v>

3
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>the Canada Christian College 50 Jervais </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive in Toronto.</v>

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>The event is entitled Bill See 16 one </v>
<v Speaker 1>year later,</v>

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>sex ideology and compelled speech in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada and here.</v>

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Here's the background detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill [inaudible] has incorporated gender</v>

7
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.764
<v Speaker 1>identity and expression and to Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights law and the criminal code </v>

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.083
<v Speaker 1>within a broader policy context </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that gender is </v>

9
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:40.974
<v Speaker 1>solely a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The effect is rippling through the </v>

10
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>social world affecting schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

11
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>the healthcare systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law and journalism.</v>

12
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>What implications does this have for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech?</v>

13
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.023
<v Speaker 1>What punitive measures can and does the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law imposed on those who violate its </v>

14
00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:58.704
<v Speaker 1>provisions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no scientific evidence that </v>

15
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:01.974
<v Speaker 1>supports the idea that gender and sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>and biology and sexual proclivity very </v>

16
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:07.584
<v Speaker 1>independently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that position is now instantiated </v>

17
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 1>into Canadian law.</v>

18
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>The following four panelists will </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss these issues and more.</v>

<v Speaker 1>subjected her to a disciplinary hearing </v>

21
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>for showing a video discussing bill see </v>
<v Speaker 1>16 to her students while she was serving</v>

22
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:30.174
<v Speaker 1>as a teaching assistant that produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest scandal in Canadian </v>

23
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>university history and very little </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence by the way that Wilfrid laurier</v>

24
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.961
<v Speaker 1>university learned its lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She will be speaking at this event about</v>

25
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>the tactics and effects of trans </v>

29
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:56.574
<v Speaker 1>suppression of free speech is having on </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism illustrating with the </v>

30
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:00.084
<v Speaker 1>personal experiences she and others have</v>
<v Speaker 1>had in the areas of indigenous </v>

31
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:04.374
<v Speaker 1>correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was fired as a regular contributor </v>

32
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>to a CBC radio show for incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarks made elsewhere.</v>

33

34
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:16.944
<v Speaker 1>scholar as the position taken by those </v>
<v Speaker 1>who desire to be at one with others in </v>

35
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>order not to be alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Deborah,</v>

36
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>so we'll speak as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She holds a Phd From York University and</v>

37
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>writes about the science and politics of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex and culture.</v>

38
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.430

40
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.363
<v Speaker 1>Street Journal and the La Times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She will be discussing the science of </v>

41
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:44.724
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes someone feel female or male </v>

42
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.993
<v Speaker 1>and why gender ideology which denies the</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of biology is harmful as she </v>

43
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:53.604
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The common belief nowadays is that </v>

44
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>gender is a spectrum and that sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation,</v>

45
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>gender identity and gender are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unrelated.</v>

46
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>This is not what the scientific research</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to commercial and employment disputes,</v>

49
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.533
<v Speaker 1>breaches of contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shareholder disputes and collection of </v>

50
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>accounts.</v>

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Last year he spoke to the Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Senate about the dangers of bill.</v>

52

<v Speaker 1>legal aspects of [inaudible] including </v>

53
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.034
<v Speaker 1>its legislation of compelled speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opinions of Canadian and US courts </v>

54
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.563
<v Speaker 1>regarding such speech and his experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the subterfuge and dishonesty of the </v>

55
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>proponents of the legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his words,</v>

56
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.723
<v Speaker 1>the politicking behind the scenes of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance at the Senate made it clear </v>

57
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>that the intention of the proponents was</v>
<v Speaker 1>to control speech all along.</v>

58
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.173
<v Speaker 1>Serena sing will moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serena is an ex social worker and an </v>

59
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>emerging political and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentator.</v>

60
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.923

<v Speaker 1>free speech ever held in Canada on </v>

62
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:06.100

63
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to make it at least to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attend and listen.</v>

64
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm coming back from London </v>
<v Speaker 1>that day,</v>

65
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>and if there's any delays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't be able to manage it.</v>

66
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:15.514
<v Speaker 1>But I would strongly encourage everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who can manage it to go and listen to </v>

67
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.430
<v Speaker 1>these panelists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an important discussion and uh,</v>

68
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>it should be an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting event.</v>

69
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bye Bye.</v>
