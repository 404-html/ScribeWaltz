00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:02.223
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that you guys have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>following this political and economic </v>

2
00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:07.864
<v Speaker 1>news from the Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it says here that this is off CBC in </v>

3
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:15.934
<v Speaker 1>a clear warning to Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin on Wednesday ordered massive </v>

4
00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>military exercises involving most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>military units in western Russia</v>

5
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.083
<v Speaker 1>on Thursday as part of the exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fighter jets were put on combat alert </v>

6
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.194
<v Speaker 1>and we're patrolling the border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia's defense ministry said in the </v>

7
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:32.534
<v Speaker 1>statement it didn't specify the areas </v>
<v Speaker 1>where patrol missions were being </v>

8
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:36.484
<v Speaker 1>conducted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The military also announced measures to </v>

9
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:40.054
<v Speaker 1>tightened security at the headquarters </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Russia's Black Sea Fleet on the </v>

10
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Crimean Peninsula and south eastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine.</v>

11
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.983
<v Speaker 1>There's a rumor that I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was [inaudible] gave the </v>

12
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:52.324
<v Speaker 1>Crimea to the Ukraine when he was drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The military maneuvers prompted a sharp </v>

13
00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>rebuke from us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secretary of state,</v>

14
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:01.624
<v Speaker 1>John Kerry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who warned Russia that any military </v>

15
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>intervention in Ukraine would be a grave</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

16
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did I tell you that?</v>

17
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

18
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.483
<v Speaker 1>it's for the same reason that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducting these last few lectures on </v>

19
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.420
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal logical and existential ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychotherapy and I think I mentioned</v>

20
00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 1>to you that these ideas are often not </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered anymore in personality classes,</v>

21
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.910
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's a big mistake because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that these theories have more to</v>

22
00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:40.744
<v Speaker 1>tell us about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the 20th century than </v>

23
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.920
<v Speaker 1>any other theories that I've ever come </v>
<v Speaker 1>across.</v>

24
00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's very important because</v>

25
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.393
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

26
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.263
<v Speaker 1>that terrible mass movements of the 20th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century occurred because of the nature </v>

27
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>of people's personality and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake to concentrate on.</v>

28
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a mistake not to concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors that play that massive a role in</v>

29
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>determining the destiny of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

30
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>And you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may seem to you that the Soviet Union</v>

31
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>is a long ways away since it collapsed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1989,</v>

32
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>but there's no evidence that we're done </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it yet.</v>

33
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potent was a kgb officer and the KGB was</v>

34
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:31.194
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet secret service and the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 1>secret service was one catastrophic Lee </v>

35
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:37.014
<v Speaker 1>awful organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tension that's occurring in the </v>

36
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:42.414
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine right now that looks like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might explode into civil war and </v>

37
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:46.764
<v Speaker 1>hopefully not is still a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the remnants of the pathologies that </v>

38
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>dominated the Soviet Union for for most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century.</v>

39
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.203
<v Speaker 1>It isn't clear to me that we've really </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned what we had to learn from what </v>

40
00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:09.350
<v Speaker 1>happened in Nazi Germany say and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mao's China,</v>

41
00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:13.670
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously still run by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist party or in the Soviet Union.</v>

42
00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's been a reprieve for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 35 years or so.</v>

43
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Meet you in particular,</v>

44
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>predicted what was going to happen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century.</v>

45
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you something that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote.</v>

46
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to tell you today why </v>
<v Speaker 1>the events in the 20th century happened.</v>

47
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>So the mass genocidal movements in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

48
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:39.574
<v Speaker 1>which were probably the defining </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of the 20th century and </v>

49
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>then also what that has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual psychology.</v>

50
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.773
<v Speaker 1>My first degree was in political science</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was interested in political </v>

51
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.544
<v Speaker 1>science because I was interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and the reason that human </v>

52
00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 1>societies went to war and when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying political science,</v>

53
00:03:59.081 --> 00:03:59.914
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental theory that underlie </v>

54
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.193
<v Speaker 1>political scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations for conflict or economic </v>

55
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.553
<v Speaker 1>people fight over resources and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>never seemed reasonable to me because </v>

56
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously many wars are fought for other</v>

57
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:18.050
<v Speaker 1>reasons than resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>to Central American countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Guatemala and Honduras,</v>

59
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to war over a soccer game.</v>

60
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>So the outcome of the disputed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disputed outcome of a soccer game.</v>

61
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And even if you do think that the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people,</v>

62
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>groups of people engage in conflict are </v>
<v Speaker 1>for economic reasons.</v>

63
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.343
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't exactly explain much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that doesn't explain whether </v>

64
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:42.424
<v Speaker 1>they are fighting for because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute differences in wealth or </v>

65
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.810
<v Speaker 1>because of relative discrepancies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and those.</v>

66
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Those are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different causal elements.</v>

67
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And then even if people do fight for </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic reasons,</v>

68
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>which means they're fighting for things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they value,</v>

69
00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.013
<v Speaker 1>it isn't exactly clear why people value </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they value because different </v>

70
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:02.704
<v Speaker 1>societies value different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So economics in the final analysis ends </v>

71
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:07.504
<v Speaker 1>up being a shallow explanation and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursued economic and political and </v>

72
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>sociological explanations for social </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict for a long time.</v>

73
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>But eventually they became untenable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

74
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why I went and studied</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychology because it struck me</v>

75
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:22.114
<v Speaker 1>that the right level of analysis for </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding mass movements like the </v>

76
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:26.374
<v Speaker 1>Nazi movement or the or the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological possession that </v>

77
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:35.401
<v Speaker 1>characterized the Stalinist Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>communists or or or Pol Pot's,</v>

78
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:38.374
<v Speaker 1>Cambodian communists or any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictators that you can talk about who </v>

79
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>are on the far left or the far right </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the 20th century.</v>

80
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.203
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those were failings of individual </v>

81
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.423
<v Speaker 1>personality and the most astute writers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've ever read who described what </v>

82
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:59.251
<v Speaker 1>they assume to be the causes of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible conflicts made the same point.</v>

83
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:00.494
<v Speaker 1>Which is why I'm having you read Viktor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankl and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn </v>

84
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>associates and is not generally regarded</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a personality psychologist.</v>

85
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the people I've ever read,</v>

86
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:10.934
<v Speaker 1>he's the one who lays out the connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the existential failure of the </v>

87
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>individual and the mass catastrophes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

88
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>And to me that's too important to link </v>
<v Speaker 1>to overlook.</v>

89
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>And it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also strikes me that it's the primary</v>

90
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 1>lesson of the 20th century mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One lesson for example,</v>

91
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:29.684
<v Speaker 1>is beware of videology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I'm going to walk you </v>

92
00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:33.134
<v Speaker 1>through Nea Chin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of Kierkegaard today is because </v>

93
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.643
<v Speaker 1>these people in the late 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their antennas up knew that the </v>

94
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way of looking at is the collapse of</v>

95
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>traditional Western values.</v>

96
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.193
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at what setup </v>
<v Speaker 1>the preconditions for the people's </v>

97
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.883
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Susceptibility to dog is in the 20th </v>

98
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 1>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 20th century.</v>

99
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:56.684
<v Speaker 1>The other way of looking at it in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>senses that as the world came together </v>

100
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:00.824
<v Speaker 1>in the 19th century and ideas were </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed around from culture to culture </v>

101
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>more rapidly than they had ever been </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed around.</v>

102
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Every culture suffered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D culturation in some sense because if I</v>

103
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:12.524
<v Speaker 1>believe something and you believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and there's a long history </v>

104
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:15.404
<v Speaker 1>behind both of our beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we come into contact with will </v>

105
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>either fight and I'll try to destroy you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or or if I don't,</v>

106
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>if I take you seriously and you take me </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

107
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:23.954
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to leave us both </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering exactly what's what's rock </v>

108
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:27.644
<v Speaker 1>solid underneath us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what needs to comments on on in </v>

109
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>this particular quilt</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what is Great.</v>

110
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 1>One either must be silent or speak with </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatness,</v>

111
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 1>with greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means cynically in with innocence.</v>

112
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>What I relate is the history of the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>two centuries.</v>

113
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I described what is coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can no longer come differently?</v>

114
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.060
<v Speaker 1>The advent of nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nihilism is the belief that nothing</v>

115
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.960
<v Speaker 1>or the belief that things have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

116
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.543
<v Speaker 1>Our whole European culture is moving for</v>
<v Speaker 1>some time now with a tortured tension </v>

117
00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:09.420
<v Speaker 1>that is growing from decade to decade as</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards a catastrophe</v>

118
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.843
<v Speaker 1>restlessly violently and headlong like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>river that wants to reach the end that </v>

119
00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:18.630
<v Speaker 1>no longer reflects it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is afraid to reflect.</v>

120
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.283
<v Speaker 1>He that speaks here has conversely done </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing so far but to reflect as a </v>

121
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:25.544
<v Speaker 1>fellow philosopher and solitary by </v>
<v Speaker 1>instinct who has found his advantage in </v>

122
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside outside,</v>

123
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.350
<v Speaker 1>why has the event advent of nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 1>become necessary</v>

124
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.013
<v Speaker 1>because the values we have had hitherto </v>
<v Speaker 1>thus draw their final consequence </v>

125
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.753
<v Speaker 1>because nihilism represents the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical conclusion of our great values </v>

126
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:49.324
<v Speaker 1>and ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we must experience nihilism </v>

127
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.090
<v Speaker 1>before we can find out what value those </v>
<v Speaker 1>values really</v>

128
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 3>we require at some time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Values.</v>

129
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Nihilism stands at the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whence comes this uncanny first of all,</v>

130
00:09:05.141 --> 00:09:05.974
<v Speaker 1>guests</v>

131
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.050
<v Speaker 3>point of departure.</v>

132
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:11.763
<v Speaker 1>It's an error to consider social </v>
<v Speaker 1>distress or physiological degeneration </v>

133
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.460
<v Speaker 1>or corruption of all things as the cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nihilism.</v>

134
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Ours is the most honest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate age,</v>

135
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.503
<v Speaker 3>so Nisha dispenses right away with </v>
<v Speaker 3>sociological explanations for people's </v>

136
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.090
<v Speaker 3>lack of belief in meaning in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

137
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.953
<v Speaker 3>A lot of what you're taught in </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities is sociological in its </v>

138
00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:38.324
<v Speaker 3>causal thinking that the causal path is </v>
<v Speaker 3>often that's the social conditions that </v>

139
00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:46.370
<v Speaker 3>people find themselves in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>determined their response to the world,</v>

140
00:09:46.371 --> 00:09:49.700
<v Speaker 3>but niches stands violently against that</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

141
00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:50.534
<v Speaker 3>And this is 150 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even before in some sense it was </v>

142
00:09:52.611 --> 00:09:53.444
<v Speaker 3>thoroughly well developed and the reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stands against it is because he </v>

143
00:09:57.171 --> 00:10:02.110
<v Speaker 3>points out that</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever you're positioned in society,</v>

144
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:07.770
<v Speaker 3>your position can be made subject to any</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of individual interpretations.</v>

145
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 3>It's meaning like the meaning of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor,</v>

146
00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:12.874
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the meaning of being comparatively </v>

147
00:10:13.841 --> 00:10:17.580
<v Speaker 3>poor isn't a meaning that's etched in </v>
<v Speaker 3>stone and so it.</v>

148
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.670
<v Speaker 3>It has to be interpreted psychologically</v>
<v Speaker 3>before it can become a causal factor,</v>

149
00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:23.290
<v Speaker 3>and if it can be interpreted </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>

150
00:10:23.291 --> 00:10:26.320
<v Speaker 3>then it's not a fact like the existence </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a mountain is a fact.</v>

151
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.000
<v Speaker 3>It's still an interpretation.</v>

152
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.520
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distress itself,</v>

153
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 1>whether psychic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>

154
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:35.934
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or intellectual also need not produce </v>

155
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:38.664
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he also reject suffering itself as a </v>

156
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>cause of nihilism.</v>

157
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Need not at all produced nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the radical rejection of value,</v>

158
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:48.414
<v Speaker 1>meaning and desirability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such distress always permits a variety </v>

159
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:51.834
<v Speaker 1>of interpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather it is in one particular </v>

160
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:56.184
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Christian moral nihilism is rooted </v>

161
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.743
<v Speaker 1>the end of Christianity at the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own morality which cannot be </v>

162
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 1>replaced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which turns against the Christian God.</v>

163
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.943
<v Speaker 1>The sense of truthfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly developed by Christianity is </v>

164
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:11.394
<v Speaker 1>nauseated by the falseness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mendacious snus of all Christian </v>

165
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:18.531
<v Speaker 1>interpretations of the world and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>history to rebound from God is the truth</v>

166
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.790
<v Speaker 1>to the fanatical faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all his false and active</v>

167
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Buddhism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a strange interpretation because</v>

168
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although he was violently anti Christian</v>

169
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>

170
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.810
<v Speaker 3>in his what in his self presentation to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the public was more like a,</v>

171
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was more like a beneficial critic of,</v>

172
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.213
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the western Christian tradition and </v>

173
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.663
<v Speaker 3>because the first thing he realized was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the domination of the West by </v>

174
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.943
<v Speaker 3>essentially by the Catholic church for </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like 1900 years was necessary </v>

175
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:54.394
<v Speaker 3>in order for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the European mind to become trained </v>

176
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 3>and focused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So his point was that you,</v>

177
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.543
<v Speaker 3>unless you learn to place an </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretive scheme on the world and </v>

178
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 3>interpret that world in a coherent </v>
<v Speaker 3>manner through that scheme,</v>

179
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.510
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a trained mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

180
00:12:11.511 --> 00:12:11.891
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

181
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:12.724
<v Speaker 3>and for Nietzsche in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't really matter what the </v>

182
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:15.964
<v Speaker 3>interpretive scheme was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just that at some point you had </v>

183
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 3>to discipline yourself.</v>

184
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Speaker 3>And this would be something like a post </v>
<v Speaker 3>adolescent process you had to discipline</v>

185
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 3>yourself by developing an adherence to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of coherent deep,</v>

186
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 3>coherent view and the consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

187
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:34.210
<v Speaker 3>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be that you would be this.</v>

188
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.490
<v Speaker 3>You could come to be the sort of person </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would,</v>

189
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.533
<v Speaker 3>that would be respectful of the truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and also someone who was who regarded </v>

190
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 3>truth as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a moral virtue,</v>

191
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.170
<v Speaker 3>as a higher order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more virtual,</v>

192
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.423
<v Speaker 3>but then he just point was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity developed that sense in </v>

193
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:52.114
<v Speaker 3>Europe to such a degree that the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of truth seeking went after the axioms </v>

194
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:58.930
<v Speaker 3>of Christianity and demolished them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was his view of what happened</v>

195
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.623
<v Speaker 3>during the enlightenment as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of the interaction between </v>

196
00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:05.950
<v Speaker 3>science and religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

197
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Nietzsche's view was that the modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind will say,</v>

198
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:11.914
<v Speaker 3>because we're speaking 150 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the modern mind had been trained </v>

199
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 3>rigorously to interpret things through a</v>
<v Speaker 3>coherent structure.</v>

200
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.120
<v Speaker 3>And then once that training had </v>
<v Speaker 3>occurred,</v>

201
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:24.820
<v Speaker 3>then it could use any number of coherent</v>
<v Speaker 3>structures.</v>

202
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:29.260
<v Speaker 3>And then it could also use it's ability </v>
<v Speaker 3>to form a relationship with the truth.</v>

203
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.303
<v Speaker 3>To criticize the very thing that gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>rise to that mind and that and that </v>

204
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.510
<v Speaker 3>Nietzsche's diagnosis of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century individual,</v>

205
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.923
<v Speaker 3>a pursuit of truth itself had undermined</v>
<v Speaker 3>the structure that gave birth to the </v>

206
00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:46.360
<v Speaker 3>pursuit of truth and that left people </v>
<v Speaker 3>wide open and left them wide open.</v>

207
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.080
<v Speaker 3>On the one hand to nihilism and nihilism</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the belief that nothing has meaning.</v>

208
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.393
<v Speaker 3>Nothing has any final meeting and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best way of expressing nihilism is what </v>

209
00:13:54.941 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 3>the hell difference is it going to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

210
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.250
<v Speaker 3>in a thousand years what we do today or </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 100 years for that matter,</v>

211
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.370
<v Speaker 3>and it's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a rational reduction of,</v>

212
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.950
<v Speaker 3>of all of the experiences of life to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

213
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.510
<v Speaker 3>to rational insignificance.</v>

214
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.463
<v Speaker 3>Nothing has any final meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the question of course that </v>

215
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 3>emerges from that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

216
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:18.270
<v Speaker 3>why do anything on a deeper question </v>
<v Speaker 3>that emerges for that?</v>

217
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 3>From that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

218
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:24.571
<v Speaker 3>why bear suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And but that's not the only problem from</v>

219
00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 3>an existential point of view because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>existentialists and niches,</v>

220
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.303
<v Speaker 3>well also believed that nihilism was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually unbearable because people </v>

221
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:37.090
<v Speaker 3>suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to have a framework of meaning</v>

222
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.260
<v Speaker 3>in which to place the suffering because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise it undermines their ability to</v>

223
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:46.261
<v Speaker 3>live and then people can't move forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that condition,</v>

224
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.750
<v Speaker 3>and so another one of Nietzsche's </v>
<v Speaker 3>prognostications was that nihilism would</v>

225
00:14:52.731 --> 00:14:53.564
<v Speaker 3>produce its counterpart which was </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism and people would leap </v>

226
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.670
<v Speaker 3>from their immersion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say in in,</v>

227
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.563
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in evolutionarily emergent systems of </v>

228
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:08.231
<v Speaker 3>faith and jump head long into rational </v>
<v Speaker 3>utopian constructions of reality because</v>

229
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.104
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people can't do without an </v>

230
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:14.054
<v Speaker 3>interpretive framework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't as if the consequence of </v>

231
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 3>moving beyond religion was going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>step into enlightenment,</v>

232
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:25.940
<v Speaker 3>which is what materialist rationalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>all's was presumed.</v>

233
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.773
<v Speaker 3>They presume if you could just shed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>superstitious clap trap that's </v>

234
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 3>associated with your religious heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd instantly be enlightened,</v>

235
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.890
<v Speaker 3>but niches point was that is not what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely to happen.</v>

236
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 3>What's likely to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two things.</v>

237
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:39.194
<v Speaker 3>People will either give up on life </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely and become cynical </v>

238
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 3>prematurely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cynical,</v>

239
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.280
<v Speaker 3>which is certainly a disease of of young</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

240
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's always been a disease of </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people,</v>

241
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:49.424
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly been a disease of </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people since say the end of World </v>

242
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.533
<v Speaker 3>War Two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they become nihilistic and not </v>

243
00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:55.934
<v Speaker 3>believe that anything has any meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that undermines their ability to </v>

244
00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:03.030
<v Speaker 3>strive or they'd fall prey to some sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of rigid ideology and niche.</v>

245
00:16:03.031 --> 00:16:08.031
<v Speaker 3>He also understood that if people fell </v>
<v Speaker 3>prey to a religion to originate theology</v>

246
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:09.074
<v Speaker 3>or several rigid ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the only plausible outcome of that </v>

247
00:16:12.921 --> 00:16:17.180
<v Speaker 3>would be like ics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exceptionally intense warfare.</v>

248
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 3>And of course that's exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in the 20th century.</v>

249
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Now he also says this can't be reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skepticism regarding morality is what is</v>

250
00:16:29.601 --> 00:16:30.434
<v Speaker 3>decisive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The end of the moral interpretation of </v>

251
00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:34.124
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which no longer has any sanction after </v>

252
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 3>just tried to escape into some beyond </v>
<v Speaker 3>leads to nihilism,</v>

253
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 3>all lacks meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he says the untenable.</v>

254
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.380
<v Speaker 3>We have one interpretation of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>upon which a tremendous amount of energy</v>

255
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:49.214
<v Speaker 3>has been lavished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awakens the suspicion that all </v>

256
00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:52.184
<v Speaker 3>interpretations of the world are false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a brilliant observation because </v>

257
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:56.870
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His point is,</v>

258
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I've seen this in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fundamentalist Christians,</v>

259
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.473
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who who I've taught in the past because </v>

260
00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:09.761
<v Speaker 3>I have a very biological view of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and these people.</v>

261
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.930
<v Speaker 3>I met more of them when I was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

262
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.330
<v Speaker 3>They were more intelligent than</v>
<v Speaker 3>than they were wise,</v>

263
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.790
<v Speaker 3>meaning the constraints within which </v>
<v Speaker 3>their intellect was forced to operate,</v>

264
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:24.290
<v Speaker 3>which would be the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalists.</v>

265
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Constraints were not sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to encapsulate their intellect.</v>

266
00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:29.330
<v Speaker 3>They were too smart for their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>theories,</v>

267
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.373
<v Speaker 3>so they come to university and and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>be exposed to ideas that were outside </v>

268
00:17:35.091 --> 00:17:35.924
<v Speaker 3>the scope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say of Christian fundamentalism would </v>

269
00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:41.150
<v Speaker 3>just blow their fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions into bits and so then of</v>

270
00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 3>course they fall into nothing but Nina </v>
<v Speaker 3>says it's even worse than that.</v>

271
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:46.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not only that you fall into </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

272
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:51.300
<v Speaker 3>it's that once one of your systems of </v>
<v Speaker 3>belief has been destroyed,</v>

273
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.793
<v Speaker 3>you also learn that systems of beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves are unreliable and so you </v>

274
00:17:56.791 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 3>can't just move easily from one to </v>
<v Speaker 3>another because it's like,</v>

275
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a boat and it sunk,</v>

276
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 3>and now you know that if you jump to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next boat,</v>

277
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.850
<v Speaker 3>that boat could also sake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

278
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.873
<v Speaker 3>It's not only that your boat has sunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's now you know that all boats can </v>

279
00:18:12.661 --> 00:18:13.494
<v Speaker 3>sync,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's part of the position of </v>

280
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 3>the modern person as far as nature is </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned,</v>

281
00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:21.600
<v Speaker 3>is that every one of us knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in principle,</v>

282
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:26.550
<v Speaker 3>that all the boats that we wanted jump </v>
<v Speaker 3>into could potentially sink and so Nicha</v>

283
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:30.150
<v Speaker 3>saw nihilism as the inevitable </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence.</v>

284
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.050
<v Speaker 3>The inevitable rational consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that realization.</v>

285
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you guys before,</v>

286
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.050
<v Speaker 3>Nisha was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very influential person,</v>

287
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 3>influential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>influenced heidegger,</v>

288
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:43.110
<v Speaker 3>and heidegger influenced pinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wanger and boss,</v>

289
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.333
<v Speaker 3>but nature also influenced young as much</v>
<v Speaker 3>as Freud did and young spent his whole </v>

290
00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 3>career trying to solve the question that</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to post.</v>

291
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.493
<v Speaker 3>One of the questions was</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we must experience nihilism </v>

292
00:19:07.461 --> 00:19:10.010
<v Speaker 3>before we can find out what value these </v>
<v Speaker 3>values really have.</v>

293
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.283
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>the collapse of a belief system makes </v>

294
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:16.500
<v Speaker 3>all the values within it.</v>

295
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.230
<v Speaker 3>No longer tenable that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning of niches statement,</v>

296
00:19:21.231 --> 00:19:22.370
<v Speaker 3>that God is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

297
00:19:22.371 --> 00:19:26.540
<v Speaker 3>if you take the central axiom out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>system of belief,</v>

298
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:30.590
<v Speaker 3>you can't hold on to all the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were derived from that axiom.</v>

299
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.140
<v Speaker 3>So here an example is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>

300
00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:33.974
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in modern Western law there's a </v>

301
00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:35.894
<v Speaker 3>presupposition and the presupposition is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in some weird sense everyone is </v>

302
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.513
<v Speaker 3>equal before the law and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated on the idea that not even </v>

303
00:19:44.091 --> 00:19:44.924
<v Speaker 3>applies to someone who's a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a murderer and you and it's </v>

304
00:19:47.571 --> 00:19:50.180
<v Speaker 3>known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be treated with respect,</v>

305
00:19:50.181 --> 00:19:51.014
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be treated with respect by </v>

306
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:53.300
<v Speaker 3>the legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very,</v>

307
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:56.170
<v Speaker 3>very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a miracle that,</v>

308
00:19:56.171 --> 00:19:59.120
<v Speaker 3>that something like that ever emerged </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's so unlikely.</v>

309
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.340
<v Speaker 3>So then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

310
00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:06.341
<v Speaker 3>what is the idea that everyone has worth</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the law grounded in,</v>

311
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.880
<v Speaker 3>where does that idea come from?</v>

312
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.820
<v Speaker 3>It comes from the idea of natural rights</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have natural rights.</v>

313
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.953
<v Speaker 3>And then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well where did the idea of natural </v>

314
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:16.040
<v Speaker 3>rights come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then you're,</v>

315
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:16.993
<v Speaker 3>then you're starting to move beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 3>realm of rational philosophy because </v>

316
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:21.643
<v Speaker 3>natural rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of natural rights has been </v>

317
00:20:22.941 --> 00:20:23.774
<v Speaker 3>something that has been an idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been emerging for thousands and </v>

318
00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:26.924
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know it's grounded in Christianity </v>

319
00:20:30.381 --> 00:20:31.214
<v Speaker 3>at least two in the in the map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's grounded in Christianity to the </v>

320
00:20:37.011 --> 00:20:37.844
<v Speaker 3>degree that one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinguishes Christianity is the idea </v>

321
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.080
<v Speaker 3>that there's a universal faith and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>

322
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.123
<v Speaker 3>whether they're in that faith or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has intrinsic value and so natural </v>

323
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.124
<v Speaker 3>rights are grounded in the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic value of the soul and then </v>

324
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:54.754
<v Speaker 3>that's grounded in the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness itself participates in </v>

325
00:20:58.451 --> 00:20:59.284
<v Speaker 3>creation and say that's an idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>embedded in genesis and also in most </v>

326
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:02.704
<v Speaker 3>creation stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you get rid of the religious </v>

327
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:07.790
<v Speaker 3>underpinnings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which which,</v>

328
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.810
<v Speaker 3>which ground the entire system in a kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of dreamlike mythology.</v>

329
00:21:11.811 --> 00:21:12.644
<v Speaker 3>When you get rid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason that what's leftover </v>

330
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.600
<v Speaker 3>rationally can survive and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

331
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.563
<v Speaker 3>and you can see that if you look at what</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in the 20th century because </v>

332
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:28.340
<v Speaker 3>there were at least two major challenges</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

333
00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:29.743
<v Speaker 3>to the civilizations that evolved and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't only Christian or Jewish </v>

334
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.120
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing happened in China.</v>

335
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:37.863
<v Speaker 3>There,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a replacement of these evolve </v>

336
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.203
<v Speaker 3>moral systems that emerged over a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of time that no one </v>

337
00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:44.594
<v Speaker 3>rationally created once people started </v>
<v Speaker 3>to criticize them and to destroy the </v>

338
00:21:49.101 --> 00:21:52.070
<v Speaker 3>axioms on which they were built and move</v>
<v Speaker 3>them aside.</v>

339
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:56.300
<v Speaker 3>Then there was a gaping hole left and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hole was filled well.</v>

340
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.150
<v Speaker 3>It was filled most particularly either </v>
<v Speaker 3>by Nazi-ism,</v>

341
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.040
<v Speaker 3>which spread like mad throughout central</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe or by communism,</v>

342
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:09.020
<v Speaker 3>which still possesses China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it'll even though China came from,</v>

343
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.063
<v Speaker 3>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a historical culture that was </v>

344
00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:15.020
<v Speaker 3>substantially different from say that of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Western Europe once,</v>

345
00:22:15.021 --> 00:22:15.854
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once rationality emerged to the point </v>

346
00:22:17.811 --> 00:22:18.644
<v Speaker 3>where it can be used as a critical force</v>
<v Speaker 3>which happened in Europe that spread </v>

347
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:25.700
<v Speaker 3>like mad and it undermined the societies</v>
<v Speaker 3>of China.</v>

348
00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Just like it undermined the societies of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the West.</v>

349
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can read.</v>

350
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.990
<v Speaker 3>You can read this if you read Tolstoy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

351
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.373
<v Speaker 3>tolstoy's confessions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia was really the last country that </v>

352
00:22:37.641 --> 00:22:41.870
<v Speaker 3>underwent the transformations that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with the enlightenment.</v>

353
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:47.060
<v Speaker 3>So when tolstoy was a young person in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the late 19th century,</v>

354
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.900
<v Speaker 3>he lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he could literally remember when</v>

355
00:22:50.901 --> 00:22:55.730
<v Speaker 3>the announcement spread through his </v>
<v Speaker 3>school that God was dead.</v>

356
00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.653
<v Speaker 3>Now you're western Europeans had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on that idea for a couple of </v>

357
00:23:00.471 --> 00:23:01.880
<v Speaker 3>hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

358
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.640
<v Speaker 3>with the dawn of the dawn of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

359
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.090
<v Speaker 3>but the Russians were very backwards in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sense,</v>

360
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.200
<v Speaker 3>and they never,</v>

361
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.520
<v Speaker 3>they never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were never affected by the conflict</v>

362
00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:16.354
<v Speaker 3>between rationality and religion until </v>
<v Speaker 3>it happened all at once and it happened </v>

363
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:23.050
<v Speaker 3>all at once at the end of the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>

364
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.870
<v Speaker 3>and the consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's complicated,</v>

365
00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:26.704
<v Speaker 3>but the consequence of that was that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>monarchy exploded and then the </v>

366
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:30.124
<v Speaker 3>consequence of that was that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians were left with nothing and the </v>

367
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:36.130
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that was the Bolshevik </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution,</v>

368
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.940
<v Speaker 3>and then that was what started the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire Soviet nightmare.</v>

369
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 3>You see very frequently that when a </v>
<v Speaker 3>society loses its grounding,</v>

370
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.203
<v Speaker 3>say it's historical truths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it turns to something as an </v>

371
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:50.481
<v Speaker 3>alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

372
00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:55.040
<v Speaker 3>the same thing happened in Quebec </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Quebec didn't undergo the modern</v>

373
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:57.330
<v Speaker 3>transformation until the late 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifties.</v>

374
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:58.183
<v Speaker 3>It was probably the last European </v>
<v Speaker 3>society to go through the enlightenment </v>

375
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:06.920
<v Speaker 3>revolution because the Catholic Church </v>
<v Speaker 3>was an incredibly dominant force in,</v>

376
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.390
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

377
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 3>in Catholic Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until the late 19 fifties in the average</v>

378
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:13.154
<v Speaker 3>family size during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>must've been in the neighborhood of 10 </v>

379
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:18.970
<v Speaker 3>children and then all of a sudden in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>late 19 fifties,</v>

380
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 3>the Quebec has just lost their </v>
<v Speaker 3>catholicism.</v>

381
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:23.390
<v Speaker 3>It was just gone and now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

382
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:28.391
<v Speaker 3>the Quebecois have the lowest marriage </v>
<v Speaker 3>rate in the in the western world and one</v>

383
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:30.080
<v Speaker 3>of the lowest reproduction rates as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

384
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.540
<v Speaker 3>And there was a Gallup poll that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>conducted.</v>

385
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.960
<v Speaker 3>I heard about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about must be 10 years ago.</v>

386
00:24:35.961 --> 00:24:36.794
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this information has </v>

387
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:38.744
<v Speaker 3>ever been made public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a Gallup poll that </v>

388
00:24:40.401 --> 00:24:43.940
<v Speaker 3>indicated that if you are a Catholic who</v>
<v Speaker 3>had lost your faith,</v>

389
00:24:43.941 --> 00:24:44.774
<v Speaker 3>so you left the church,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were 10 times more likely to be a </v>

390
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:50.160
<v Speaker 3>separate list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can see.</v>

391
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.410
<v Speaker 3>The consequence of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if one belief system disappears,</v>

392
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.780
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilism is one possibility,</v>

393
00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.680
<v Speaker 3>but another possibility is that you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>adopt the next thing that's close.</v>

394
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:03.290
<v Speaker 3>That gives you structure and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationalism,</v>

395
00:25:03.291 --> 00:25:04.790
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things,</v>

396
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.820
<v Speaker 3>so nature does diagnose the disease </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally,</v>

397
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.550
<v Speaker 3>and then the psychoanalysts like young </v>
<v Speaker 3>in particular,</v>

398
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.420
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to see neat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You believe that if God died because God</v>

399
00:25:19.421 --> 00:25:21.490
<v Speaker 3>died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were going to have to take on the</v>

400
00:25:21.491 --> 00:25:25.390
<v Speaker 3>responsibility that was once gods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

401
00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:30.391
<v Speaker 3>as a personal problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so me and thus spake Zarathustra.</v>

402
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Nietzsche said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is dead.</v>

403
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.430
<v Speaker 3>We have killed him and we'll never find </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough water to wash away the blood.</v>

404
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.440
<v Speaker 3>But he also said in order for people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>withstand that catastrophe,</v>

405
00:25:41.441 --> 00:25:44.050
<v Speaker 3>they would have to become gods </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves essentially.</v>

406
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:45.723
<v Speaker 3>And while you can see how that might go </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong if you think about people like </v>

407
00:25:48.941 --> 00:25:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Stalin and Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

408
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.460
<v Speaker 3>but the psychoanalysts also like </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoanalysts especially you.</v>

409
00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.470
<v Speaker 3>And then heidegger for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for his part,</v>

410
00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.520
<v Speaker 3>took that idea seriously and they young </v>
<v Speaker 3>young said,</v>

411
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.050
<v Speaker 3>was trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

412
00:26:05.051 --> 00:26:08.320
<v Speaker 3>if we lose our historically conditioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>values,</v>

413
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.213
<v Speaker 3>we no longer believe in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if nihilism is the outcome on one </v>

414
00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:14.140
<v Speaker 3>hand and totalitarianism is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would come.</v>

415
00:26:14.141 --> 00:26:19.090
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's left and the union idea was while</v>

416
00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:24.091
<v Speaker 3>the revelation of the self is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual could not as a rational mind,</v>

417
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.140
<v Speaker 3>but the individual as a totality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that Rogers also believed</v>

418
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.270
<v Speaker 3>the individuals that totality would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of bringing forth genuine values</v>

419
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.360
<v Speaker 3>as a consequence of self exploration and</v>
<v Speaker 3>honesty,</v>

420
00:26:37.361 --> 00:26:38.194
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's associated with the </v>

421
00:26:39.881 --> 00:26:42.490
<v Speaker 3>existential idea of individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

422
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.823
<v Speaker 3>So the one of the upshots of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the union theory is that to the </v>

423
00:26:49.361 --> 00:26:50.194
<v Speaker 3>degree you don't bear the responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>for your own actions to the degree that </v>

424
00:26:53.861 --> 00:26:58.060
<v Speaker 3>you avoid responsibility or shrunk them </v>
<v Speaker 3>off onto say,</v>

425
00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.043
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian or ideological system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by when you avoid responsibility for </v>

426
00:27:03.341 --> 00:27:04.174
<v Speaker 3>your own thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you're the follower of an </v>

427
00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.753
<v Speaker 3>ideological system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have avoided the responsibility of </v>

428
00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:10.294
<v Speaker 3>thinking for yourself and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of that was continual </v>

429
00:27:14.321 --> 00:27:15.154
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As those pathological rational systems </v>

430
00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:22.100
<v Speaker 3>unfolded themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn</v>

431
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:28.650
<v Speaker 3>wrote the Gulag archipelago in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>published it in early 19 seventies,</v>

432
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:29.484
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

433
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.100
<v Speaker 3>there were two things that made that </v>
<v Speaker 3>book very striking.</v>

434
00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.293
<v Speaker 3>One was the stories that he told were so</v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably powerful that you couldn't </v>

435
00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:44.191
<v Speaker 3>read them and not believe it was true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was even the case if you were a</v>

436
00:27:44.711 --> 00:27:45.544
<v Speaker 3>devoted Marxist and at that time in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities and in many ways it hasn't </v>

437
00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:50.434
<v Speaker 3>changed that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The universities in the west were </v>

438
00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:52.984
<v Speaker 3>dominated by Marxists and and to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>degree that was ethically inexcusable </v>

439
00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.340
<v Speaker 3>because people had known since the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifties,</v>

440
00:28:00.341 --> 00:28:01.174
<v Speaker 3>especially since George Orwell wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people had known since the 19 fifties </v>

441
00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.660
<v Speaker 3>that this telling the state was </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderous beyond belief.</v>

442
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:08.763
<v Speaker 3>So Stalin for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed 6 million Ukrainians in the 19 </v>

443
00:28:12.401 --> 00:28:14.890
<v Speaker 3>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He starved them to death.</v>

444
00:28:14.891 --> 00:28:15.724
<v Speaker 3>He took because all of the farmers have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been collectivized at that point and </v>

445
00:28:18.611 --> 00:28:19.444
<v Speaker 3>what that meant was all the good farmers</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been killed and all the resentful </v>

446
00:28:22.121 --> 00:28:22.954
<v Speaker 3>farmers had been given the land and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they collectivized farms and then sell </v>

447
00:28:26.451 --> 00:28:30.640
<v Speaker 3>into all the food to feed the cities or </v>
<v Speaker 3>to or to start with the Ukrainians.</v>

448
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.773
<v Speaker 3>Depending on how you look at it and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>edicts were so harsh that if you are </v>

449
00:28:35.111 --> 00:28:35.944
<v Speaker 3>Ukrainian and you had a family and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were starving and you went into a field </v>

450
00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:40.563
<v Speaker 3>after it had been harvested and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>picked out individual grains from the </v>

451
00:28:44.081 --> 00:28:46.390
<v Speaker 3>dirt to gather in a bowl to feed your </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

452
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.610
<v Speaker 3>If you got caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they would shoot you.</v>

453
00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:56.973
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn observed this and he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was very interested in how this </v>

454
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:00.654
<v Speaker 3>system developed and his conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 3>after decades of thinking was that the </v>

455
00:29:06.451 --> 00:29:07.284
<v Speaker 3>reason the Russian system was able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain itself fundamentally was </v>

456
00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:11.214
<v Speaker 3>because individuals were willing to give</v>
<v Speaker 3>up the responsibility of their own </v>

457
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.593
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the state and constantly lie to </v>

458
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 3>themselves about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that if the.</v>

459
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:24.913
<v Speaker 3>If the individuals that compose the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state had refused to accept things that </v>

460
00:29:29.241 --> 00:29:30.074
<v Speaker 3>they knew full well to be untrue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the state wouldn't have been able </v>

461
00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:35.030
<v Speaker 3>to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

462
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.640
<v Speaker 3>social units.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's case is very strong because in some</v>

463
00:29:37.641 --> 00:29:41.300
<v Speaker 3>sense he was the first person who told </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth about the Gulag archipelago,</v>

464
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 3>which was this chain of prison camps </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Soviets had erected on.</v>

465
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Which their economy was essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>based.</v>

466
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.183
<v Speaker 3>He was the first person who really told </v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth about that and he hit the </v>

467
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:56.821
<v Speaker 3>foundations of Marx's theory so hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>that well,</v>

468
00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:58.443
<v Speaker 3>partly it collapsed and partly it went </v>
<v Speaker 3>underground into movements like </v>

469
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So his,</v>

470
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 3>his proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a dusty proposition actually.</v>

471
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:11.710
<v Speaker 3>That one person who stopped lying could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could overturn a tyranny.</v>

472
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.503
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard thing to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's been multiple examples of </v>

473
00:30:16.361 --> 00:30:17.194
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the 20th century it happened with </v>

474
00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:20.044
<v Speaker 3>Gandhi happen with Vaclav Havel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Czechoslovakia happen with Nelson </v>

475
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.850
<v Speaker 3>Mandela and Hatton was soldier nets and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

476
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.950
<v Speaker 3>so those are pretty powerful examples </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

477
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 3>of the power of a single individual who </v>
<v Speaker 3>refuses to accept the convention.</v>

478
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.020
<v Speaker 3>The convention will lie.</v>

479
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.930
<v Speaker 3>Notice the Esky was writing about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time as Nietzsche.</v>

480
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:45.850
<v Speaker 3>And Dostoevsky is a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

481
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.320
<v Speaker 3>He was an Orthodox Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although he's a very intelligent man and</v>

482
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nietzsche are twins in some sense.</v>

483
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:54.754
<v Speaker 3>So what niche you wrote in philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky wrote in literature and </v>

484
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.690
<v Speaker 3>dusty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dusty as keys primary</v>

485
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.400
<v Speaker 3>statements was that if there is no god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is permitted.</v>

486
00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 3>So it's to take on niches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion of nihilism,</v>

487
00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:11.621
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

488
00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:14.350
<v Speaker 3>if there's no ultimate value of any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort,</v>

489
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.020
<v Speaker 3>then why can't you do exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want?</v>

490
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:22.300
<v Speaker 3>And that's a theme he explores to great </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose in crime and punishment.</v>

491
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:25.523
<v Speaker 3>Neat Dostoyevsky's conclusion was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason you can't do anything you </v>

492
00:31:28.471 --> 00:31:29.304
<v Speaker 3>want is because you actually come </v>
<v Speaker 3>equipped with an inherent set of values </v>

493
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.180
<v Speaker 3>that are real and that if you violate </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to to greater degree,</v>

494
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.193
<v Speaker 3>you'll destroy your own structure as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well as damaging to society that's </v>

495
00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:43.260
<v Speaker 3>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Dostoevsky was a big believer in some</v>

496
00:31:43.261 --> 00:31:44.094
<v Speaker 3>sense like the unions and the Rogerian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there are the locus of values </v>

497
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.470
<v Speaker 3>within a human being and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

498
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.360
<v Speaker 3>and then it's an actual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't disregard it without damage.</v>

499
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.470
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky was also a very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>critic of reason,</v>

500
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.810
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that was</v>

501
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:07.030
<v Speaker 3>it was rezoned in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought down the house of cards,</v>

502
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.570
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that constituted classical face.</v>

503
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:11.703
<v Speaker 3>But the consequence of that rational </v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction of values was the emergence </v>

504
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:18.160
<v Speaker 3>of nihilism or totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the consequences of those two things</v>

505
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.203
<v Speaker 3>is either the inability to live or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>emergent emergence of the murderer </v>

506
00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:23.314
<v Speaker 3>estate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Dostoevsky looked at that and </v>

507
00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:25.691
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

508
00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:30.691
<v Speaker 3>well perhaps our belief that reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself is the proper guide to reality is</v>

509
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:33.424
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is one of the things he </v>

510
00:32:35.201 --> 00:32:36.034
<v Speaker 3>wrote in notes from underground when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was exploring this idea notes from </v>

511
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:40.401
<v Speaker 3>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

512
00:32:40.401 --> 00:32:42.770
<v Speaker 3>it's very short book and it's very much </v>
<v Speaker 3>worth reading.</v>

513
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a dusty Esky wrote five books that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in calculus really great.</v>

514
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.053
<v Speaker 3>And what happened to Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember if I told you this or </v>

515
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:55.760
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was a student radical and he was.</v>

516
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:56.653
<v Speaker 3>He was arrested by the as men because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a riot tour or a protest that him and </v>

517
00:33:01.991 --> 00:33:04.670
<v Speaker 3>his compatriots had come up with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was sort of a bit player in it,</v>

518
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.700
<v Speaker 3>but they put them in prison when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a young man.</v>

519
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.070
<v Speaker 3>And then he was in prison for quite a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>

520
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:14.270
<v Speaker 3>And then one day they took him out into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the courtyard and they shot him at dawn.</v>

521
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.223
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had the soldiers lining up and put </v>

522
00:33:16.941 --> 00:33:19.790
<v Speaker 3>them by a post and shot them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they used blanks,</v>

523
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:21.163
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't know that and it scared </v>
<v Speaker 3>him so bad he had an epileptic seizure </v>

524
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.573
<v Speaker 3>and then he had epileptic seizures for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of his life and the kind of </v>

525
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:31.460
<v Speaker 3>epileptic seizures he had were </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with mystical experience,</v>

526
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.473
<v Speaker 3>so Dostoevsky before he got a seizure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have the sense that he was </v>

527
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.003
<v Speaker 3>experiencing the world in a more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more meaningful way until he was on the </v>

528
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:44.990
<v Speaker 3>very dawn of sort of nip omniscient </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and then he'd have a seizure,</v>

529
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:46.693
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't until he was shot with </v>
<v Speaker 3>blanks and then putting this terrible </v>

530
00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:50.384
<v Speaker 3>prison for a long period of time and had</v>
<v Speaker 3>epilepsy that he became a great </v>

531
00:33:53.271 --> 00:33:54.020
<v Speaker 3>novelist.</v>

532
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.650
<v Speaker 3>It changed them in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His early writings are really,</v>

533
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 3>they're not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sterile and dry,</v>

534
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:01.873
<v Speaker 3>and his later writings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the five grade novels in particular are </v>

535
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.350
<v Speaker 3>there in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in a class of their own.</v>

536
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 3>So Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing Dostoevsky tried to come</v>

537
00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:12.254
<v Speaker 3>to grips with was the fact he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that life itself was a rational </v>

538
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:17.990
<v Speaker 3>because that's an enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition,</v>

539
00:34:17.991 --> 00:34:22.190
<v Speaker 3>that the structure of reality is in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>of itself rational so it can be held.</v>

540
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.233
<v Speaker 3>It can be dealt with by rational means </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's been a very powerful theory </v>

541
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:26.864
<v Speaker 3>because it's enabled us to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is scientific viewpoint and the </v>

542
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:30.644
<v Speaker 3>technology that goes along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rationality is not the only mode of </v>

543
00:34:35.721 --> 00:34:36.554
<v Speaker 3>human knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of other modes of </v>

544
00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:41.630
<v Speaker 3>human knowing and many of those are </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with emotion and motivation.</v>

545
00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:42.464
<v Speaker 3>They're more biologically instantiated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying less computational and </v>

546
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.343
<v Speaker 3>rationality has a very difficult time </v>
<v Speaker 3>even conceptualizing how those other </v>

547
00:34:51.921 --> 00:34:55.550
<v Speaker 3>modes of knowing might be real and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it tends to do is denigrate them as</v>

548
00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.140
<v Speaker 3>mirror opponents to rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Dostoevsky and perspective,</v>

549
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:03.620
<v Speaker 3>and this is also something that Roger's </v>
<v Speaker 3>followed up on and young,</v>

550
00:35:03.621 --> 00:35:08.621
<v Speaker 3>was that life itself is so irrational or</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience itself is so irrational.</v>

551
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.290
<v Speaker 3>Given it suffering and its and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>absurdity.</v>

552
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.590
<v Speaker 3>That a merely rationally formulated </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of life is insufficient.</v>

553
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.173
<v Speaker 3>It can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't manage the job and what </v>

554
00:35:23.631 --> 00:35:28.631
<v Speaker 3>rationality will they're there for do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut away everything from life,</v>

555
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.493
<v Speaker 3>cutaway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything from its definition of </v>

556
00:35:32.001 --> 00:35:35.330
<v Speaker 3>reality that it can't actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>encapsulate.</v>

557
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 3>Dostoyevsky</v>

558
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.203
<v Speaker 1>said in short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one may say anything about the history </v>

559
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:43.014
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that might enter the most </v>

560
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:45.504
<v Speaker 1>disordered imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing one can't say is that </v>

561
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 1>it's rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very word sticks in one's throat</v>

562
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:57.030
<v Speaker 1>and indeed this is the odd thing that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually happening.</v>

563
00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.480
<v Speaker 1>They're continually turning up in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral and rational persons,</v>

564
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:01.403
<v Speaker 1>sages and lovers of humanity who make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>their object to live all their lives as </v>

565
00:36:05.101 --> 00:36:07.920
<v Speaker 1>morally and rationally as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be so,</v>

566
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:08.754
<v Speaker 1>to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a light to their neighbors simply in </v>

567
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:10.644
<v Speaker 1>order to show them that it is possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to live morally and rationally in this </v>

568
00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:14.904
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet we all know that these very </v>

569
00:36:17.671 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 1>people sooner or later have been false </v>
<v Speaker 1>to themselves.</v>

570
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.773
<v Speaker 1>That's a precursor of Freudian ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing some queer trick often and most </v>

571
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:28.284
<v Speaker 1>unseemly one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I asked you what can be expected of </v>

572
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:36.270
<v Speaker 1>band since he is a being endowed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>such strange qualities,</v>

573
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.613
<v Speaker 1>shower upon him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every earthly blessing drown them in a </v>

574
00:36:41.101 --> 00:36:41.934
<v Speaker 1>sea of happiness so that nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbles of bliss can be seen on the </v>

575
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 1>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them economic prosperity so that he</v>

576
00:36:49.141 --> 00:36:51.000
<v Speaker 1>should have nothing else to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sleep,</v>

577
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.313
<v Speaker 1>eat cakes and busy himself with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuation of the species and even </v>

578
00:36:56.881 --> 00:37:01.881
<v Speaker 1>then out of sharing gratitude and spite </v>
<v Speaker 1>man would play you some nasty trick.</v>

579
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.613
<v Speaker 1>He would even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Risk is cakes and would deliberately </v>

580
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:07.314
<v Speaker 1>desired the most fatal rubbish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most uneconomical absurdity simply </v>

581
00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:14.010
<v Speaker 1>to introduce into all this positive good</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

582
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.540
<v Speaker 1>his fatal fantastic element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is just as fantastic.</v>

583
00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:19.374
<v Speaker 1>Dreams is vulgar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folly that he will desire to retain </v>

584
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.063
<v Speaker 1>simply in order to prove to himself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>if that was so necessary that men are </v>

585
00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.344
<v Speaker 1>still men and not the keys of a piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the laws of nature threatened to </v>

586
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:33.084
<v Speaker 1>control so completely that soon one will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to desire nothing except by the </v>

587
00:37:37.651 --> 00:37:39.990
<v Speaker 1>calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not at all.</v>

588
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Even if men really were nothing but a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piano key.</v>

589
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Even if this were approved to him by </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural science and mathematics,</v>

590
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.320
<v Speaker 1>even then he would not become </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>

591
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.813
<v Speaker 1>He would do purposefully do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>perverse out of simple in gratitude </v>

592
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.463
<v Speaker 1>simply to gain his point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if he does not find means he will </v>

593
00:37:58.021 --> 00:38:02.160
<v Speaker 1>contrive destruction and chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering of all sorts,</v>

594
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.600
<v Speaker 1>only to gain his point.</v>

595
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.213
<v Speaker 1>He will launch a curse upon the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as only men can curse gets his </v>

596
00:38:09.361 --> 00:38:10.194
<v Speaker 1>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The primary distinction between him and </v>

597
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:14.820
<v Speaker 1>other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe by his curse alone,</v>

598
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:15.654
<v Speaker 1>he will obtain his object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to convince himself that he's a </v>

599
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:19.224
<v Speaker 1>man and not a piano key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you say that all of this too can </v>

600
00:38:22.531 --> 00:38:26.070
<v Speaker 1>be calculated and tabulated and chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and darkness and curses.</v>

601
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:30.300
<v Speaker 1>So the mere possibility of calculating </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all beforehand would stop.</v>

602
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:31.134
<v Speaker 1>It all and reason would reassert itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That man would purposefully go mad in </v>

603
00:38:36.191 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 1>order to be rid of reason and gain his </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

604
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I answer for it.</v>

605
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:41.583
<v Speaker 1>For the whole work of man really seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to consist of nothing but proving to </v>

606
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:47.830
<v Speaker 1>himself every minute that he's a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a piano key.</v>

607
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.173
<v Speaker 1>It might be at the cost of his skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be by cannibalism and this </v>

608
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:53.794
<v Speaker 1>being so can one help being tempted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejoice that it is not yet come off and </v>

609
00:38:57.461 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 1>that desire still depends on something </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>

610
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.233
<v Speaker 1>You will scream at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is if you condescend to do so that </v>

611
00:39:05.391 --> 00:39:06.224
<v Speaker 1>no one is touching my freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all they're concerned with is that </v>

612
00:39:08.841 --> 00:39:09.674
<v Speaker 1>my free will should have itself of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own free will coincide with my own </v>

613
00:39:13.941 --> 00:39:16.520
<v Speaker 1>normal interests and the laws of nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and arithmetic.</v>

614
00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Good Heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>

615
00:39:18.111 --> 00:39:18.944
<v Speaker 1>what sort of free will is left when he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we come to tabulation and </v>

616
00:39:21.201 --> 00:39:24.080
<v Speaker 1>arithmetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it will all be a case of twice two,</v>

617
00:39:24.081 --> 00:39:25.850
<v Speaker 1>makes four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>

618
00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes four without my will.</v>

619
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.360
<v Speaker 1>As a freewheel meant that</v>

620
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.220
<v Speaker 1>well that was written</v>

621
00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.740
<v Speaker 3>and the late teenage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late 18 hundreds is as well,</v>

622
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:36.574
<v Speaker 3>and Dostoevsky had already figured out </v>
<v Speaker 3>by that point that the consequence of </v>

623
00:39:41.241 --> 00:39:46.241
<v Speaker 3>the new ideas swimming into Russia and </v>
<v Speaker 3>undermining Orthodox Christianity,</v>

624
00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:47.594
<v Speaker 3>which was the say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the natural culture in some sense of </v>

625
00:39:49.491 --> 00:39:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Russia was going to be either nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 3>or totalitarianism,</v>

626
00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:54.523
<v Speaker 3>and he examined the propositions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism and the propositions of </v>

627
00:39:59.241 --> 00:40:01.490
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're essentially utopian,</v>

628
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:02.703
<v Speaker 3>so the idea was except it's like a cult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except this mode of being except this </v>

629
00:40:07.251 --> 00:40:12.251
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of the world and society </v>
<v Speaker 3>will advance towards a point where while</v>

630
00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:16.190
<v Speaker 3>it's saying the case of communism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth is equally distributed in,</v>

631
00:40:16.191 --> 00:40:17.024
<v Speaker 3>everyone is free and it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very powerful idea obviously because it </v>

632
00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:24.650
<v Speaker 3>attracted hundreds of millions of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>each according</v>

633
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:28.680
<v Speaker 3>to each,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to his need,</v>

634
00:40:28.681 --> 00:40:31.740
<v Speaker 3>from each according to his ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds Fair.</v>

635
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.633
<v Speaker 3>You get what you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get what you need to live and you </v>

636
00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:38.160
<v Speaker 3>contribute what's in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's in you to contribute,</v>

637
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.460
<v Speaker 3>and when it was laid out in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an absolute catastrophe.</v>

638
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.430
<v Speaker 3>And Dostoevsky criticized this before it</v>
<v Speaker 3>even happened.</v>

639
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.720
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

640
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.200
<v Speaker 3>human beings do not want utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're too insane for that.</v>

641
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.390
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had comfort,</v>

642
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:55.703
<v Speaker 3>sterile comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had everything you want to just </v>

643
00:40:57.481 --> 00:40:58.314
<v Speaker 3>given to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you do is go crazy just so that you </v>

644
00:41:00.841 --> 00:41:03.000
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have to be bored by all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfection.</v>

645
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:07.170
<v Speaker 3>You destroy it so that the irrational </v>
<v Speaker 3>element that's inside of you,</v>

646
00:41:07.171 --> 00:41:12.171
<v Speaker 3>so this Dionysian element could leap out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and live and so whatever utopia is,</v>

647
00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.560
<v Speaker 3>it's not the permanent solution to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your problems.</v>

648
00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.170
<v Speaker 3>You don't even want to live without </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

649
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Kierkegaard writing out a little earlier</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

650
00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.150
<v Speaker 3>but all along the similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a similar track of ideas.</v>

651
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 3>He's also criticizing idea of utopia,</v>

652
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.983
<v Speaker 1>believing at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the meaning in life is to be found </v>

653
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.363
<v Speaker 1>within the struggle that constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and not in the solution to that </v>

654
00:41:45.471 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 1>struggle which may be as equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and not to utopia.</v>

655
00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.573
<v Speaker 1>It is about four years ago that I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of wanting to try my luck as </v>

656
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:57.050
<v Speaker 1>an author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it quite clearly.</v>

657
00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.970
<v Speaker 1>It was a Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

658
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.103
<v Speaker 1>Sunday afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was seated as usual outside at the </v>

659
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:03.314
<v Speaker 1>cafe in the Fredericksburg Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been a student for half a score of </v>

660
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:09.200
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although never lazy.</v>

661
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.213
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my activity nevertheless was like a </v>

662
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:12.134
<v Speaker 1>glittering inactivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of occupation for which I still </v>

663
00:42:15.321 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 1>have a great partiality and for which </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps I even have a little genius.</v>

664
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.593
<v Speaker 1>I read much spent the remainder of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day idling and thinking or thinking an </v>

665
00:42:24.391 --> 00:42:26.240
<v Speaker 1>idling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was all it came to,</v>

666
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:28.063
<v Speaker 1>so I sat there and I smoke my cigar </v>
<v Speaker 1>until I lapsed into thought among other </v>

667
00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:32.360
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

668
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.193
<v Speaker 1>I remember these you are going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself to become an old man </v>

669
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.073
<v Speaker 1>without being anything and without </v>
<v Speaker 1>really undertaking to do anything on </v>

670
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:44.174
<v Speaker 1>other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever you look around you in </v>

671
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:46.214
<v Speaker 1>literature and in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the celebrated names and </v>

672
00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:48.854
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the precious and much heralded men who </v>

673
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:53.420
<v Speaker 1>are coming into prominence and are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

674
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:54.913
<v Speaker 1>the many benefactors of the age who know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to benefit mankind by making life </v>

675
00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:00.350
<v Speaker 1>easier and easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody railways,</v>

676
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.770
<v Speaker 1>others by omnibuses and steamboats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others by the telegraph,</v>

677
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:04.873
<v Speaker 1>others by easily apprehended compendiums</v>
<v Speaker 1>and short recitals of everything worth </v>

678
00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:09.284
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>

679
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.983
<v Speaker 1>and finally the true benefactors of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>age who makes spiritual existence in </v>

680
00:43:13.421 --> 00:43:17.470
<v Speaker 1>virtue of thought easier and easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet more and more significant,</v>

681
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:18.993
<v Speaker 1>and what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My soliloquy was interrupted because my </v>

682
00:43:22.541 --> 00:43:26.320
<v Speaker 1>cigarette with smoked out and a new one </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to be lit so I smoked again,</v>

683
00:43:26.321 --> 00:43:28.960
<v Speaker 1>and then suddenly this thought flashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into my mind,</v>

684
00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.113
<v Speaker 1>you must do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in as much as with your limited </v>

685
00:43:33.251 --> 00:43:34.084
<v Speaker 1>capacities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be impossible for you to make </v>

686
00:43:35.921 --> 00:43:38.200
<v Speaker 1>anything easier than it has already </v>
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>

687
00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.153
<v Speaker 1>You must with the same humanitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm as the others undertake to </v>

688
00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:44.254
<v Speaker 1>make something harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This notion pleased me immensely and at </v>

689
00:43:49.301 --> 00:43:50.134
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it flattered me to think that I liked </v>

690
00:43:51.671 --> 00:43:54.730
<v Speaker 1>the rest of them would be loved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>esteemed by the whole community,</v>

691
00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:58.600
<v Speaker 1>for when all combined in every way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make everything easier,</v>

692
00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:04.260
<v Speaker 1>there remains only one possible danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely that the eas will become so great</v>

693
00:44:04.301 --> 00:44:09.110
<v Speaker 1>that it becomes altogether too great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's only one left,</v>

694
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:09.944
<v Speaker 1>although it is not yet a felt want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people will want difficulty out of </v>

695
00:44:14.901 --> 00:44:18.260
<v Speaker 1>love for mankind and out of despair at </v>
<v Speaker 1>my embarrassing situation,</v>

696
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.243
<v Speaker 1>seeing that I had accomplished nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was unable to make anything easier </v>

697
00:44:22.401 --> 00:44:23.234
<v Speaker 1>than it had already been made and moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a genuine interest in those who make </v>

698
00:44:26.301 --> 00:44:27.134
<v Speaker 1>everything easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can save that as my task to create </v>

699
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:31.250
<v Speaker 1>difficulties everywhere.</v>

700
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Character guard is often regarded as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>existentialist.</v>

701
00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:45.813
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the ideas that runs its way </v>

702
00:44:47.371 --> 00:44:48.204
<v Speaker 3>through existentialism is the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be human is to simultaneously be </v>

703
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:55.500
<v Speaker 3>saddled with an intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>

704
00:44:55.501 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 3>a moral responsibility that you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible not only to yourself,</v>

705
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:00.894
<v Speaker 3>to your soul saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also to the people around you and </v>

706
00:45:03.181 --> 00:45:04.014
<v Speaker 3>that that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>an arbitrary imposition that's imposed </v>

707
00:45:07.701 --> 00:45:11.180
<v Speaker 3>upon you by rationality or by your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fellow man for that matter,</v>

708
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:15.920
<v Speaker 3>but something that's right at the heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reality of existence itself,</v>

709
00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.000
<v Speaker 3>such that if you</v>

710
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.823
<v Speaker 2>fort</v>

711
00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.150
<v Speaker 3>or fall short of bearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that responsibility,</v>

712
00:45:22.151 --> 00:45:25.180
<v Speaker 3>you'll pay a price in guilt and in shape</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's suffering.</v>

713
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.440
<v Speaker 3>Vince Wanger and brought boss working </v>
<v Speaker 3>off heidegger's lead said that guilt and</v>

714
00:45:34.911 --> 00:45:38.930
<v Speaker 3>fear our debts to possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're guilty about something,</v>

715
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.900
<v Speaker 3>well it's because you're not upholding </v>
<v Speaker 3>your responsibility.</v>

716
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Whereas for Freud that was often a form </v>
<v Speaker 3>of pathology,</v>

717
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.843
<v Speaker 3>excess guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course excess guilt can become </v>

718
00:45:48.801 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 3>pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Kierkegaard,</v>

719
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:53.840
<v Speaker 3>his point is that guilt itself isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to be cured.</v>

720
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:54.793
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

721
00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:55.673
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an integral and necessary part of </v>

722
00:45:57.831 --> 00:45:58.664
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like disgust and despair and fear </v>

723
00:46:00.651 --> 00:46:01.484
<v Speaker 3>and all the negative emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They alert you to your place in the </v>

724
00:46:04.041 --> 00:46:08.690
<v Speaker 3>world and guide you towards the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfolding of your spirit.</v>

725
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Failure to shoulder your existential </v>
<v Speaker 3>burden is what results in neurotic,</v>

726
00:46:14.631 --> 00:46:15.680
<v Speaker 3>guilt and fear,</v>

727
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:21.683
<v Speaker 3>Vince Wanger and boss also believed that</v>
<v Speaker 3>like existential anxiety and that's the </v>

728
00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:30.360
<v Speaker 3>feeling of nothingness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is fear of loss of world.</v>

729
00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.113
<v Speaker 3>That the world that you inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conceptual world that you inhabit </v>

730
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 3>can be destroyed at any moment and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're aware of that at some level.</v>

731
00:46:38.521 --> 00:46:39.354
<v Speaker 3>It's the same comment that needs to made</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and and Nisha believe that this was </v>

732
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:43.404
<v Speaker 3>something that modern people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly susceptible to because our </v>

733
00:46:45.481 --> 00:46:46.314
<v Speaker 3>rationality is always capable of sawing </v>
<v Speaker 3>off the branch that we're sitting on </v>

734
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.170
<v Speaker 3>because no matter what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're engaged in it deeply,</v>

735
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.300
<v Speaker 3>the critical part of your mind can </v>
<v Speaker 3>always say,</v>

736
00:46:54.301 --> 00:46:55.134
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes you think that's so </v>

737
00:46:55.591 --> 00:46:58.440
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know an answer could be,</v>

738
00:46:58.441 --> 00:46:59.274
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it manifests itself as being worthwhile </v>

739
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.190
<v Speaker 3>and why should I pay attention to those </v>
<v Speaker 3>rational doubts,</v>

740
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.233
<v Speaker 3>but that's not how we're trained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trained that rationality is the </v>

741
00:47:09.751 --> 00:47:12.660
<v Speaker 3>thing that encompasses everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of being trained.</v>

742
00:47:12.661 --> 00:47:16.200
<v Speaker 3>That rationality is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>encompassed by something else,</v>

743
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 3>and so if doubts come up that </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrational,</v>

744
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.140
<v Speaker 3>we immediately believed them because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rational,</v>

745
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:24.150
<v Speaker 3>instead of asking ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

746
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:24.984
<v Speaker 3>if the rational doubt is undermining the</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning in my life and making it </v>

747
00:47:28.261 --> 00:47:29.094
<v Speaker 3>difficult for me to proceed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the thing to do is to question </v>

748
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:33.370
<v Speaker 3>whether or not that doubt is valid.</v>

749
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Now it depends on what you regard as </v>
<v Speaker 3>real because if it's,</v>

750
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.000
<v Speaker 3>if it's the rational argument itself </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's real,</v>

751
00:47:41.001 --> 00:47:43.730
<v Speaker 3>then you can't dispense with the doubts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you say,</v>

752
00:47:43.731 --> 00:47:44.564
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rationality is too limited in its </v>

753
00:47:45.861 --> 00:47:48.740
<v Speaker 3>apprehension to deal with the absurdity </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life.</v>

754
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:52.220
<v Speaker 3>There are other sorts of answers like </v>
<v Speaker 3>music for example,</v>

755
00:47:52.221 --> 00:47:56.240
<v Speaker 3>or or art or or the kind of engagement </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>

756
00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:57.643
<v Speaker 3>that you experienced when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in something that you're </v>

757
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:03.690
<v Speaker 3>incredibly interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are forms of reality that are that</v>

758
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:05.263
<v Speaker 3>you can regard those as forms of reality</v>
<v Speaker 3>that transcend rationalism instead of </v>

759
00:48:09.561 --> 00:48:10.394
<v Speaker 3>being something embedded inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>rationalism that can be destroyed by </v>

760
00:48:12.711 --> 00:48:13.544
<v Speaker 3>doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the problem with doubt is that it </v>

761
00:48:15.231 --> 00:48:17.540
<v Speaker 3>can undermine you completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Smiling,</v>

762
00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:18.443
<v Speaker 3>but even worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can lay you open to ideological </v>

763
00:48:20.751 --> 00:48:25.751
<v Speaker 3>possession and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's say tannic in its in its,</v>

764
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 3>in its catastrophe.</v>

765
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.833
<v Speaker 3>We're all talked to you a little bit now</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the concentration camp </v>

766
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:39.960
<v Speaker 3>concentration camps were established </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

767
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.890
<v Speaker 3>There were established in England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>

768
00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:42.641
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>

769
00:48:42.641 --> 00:48:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Cambodia and Yugoslavia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the Soviet Union,</v>

770
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.790
<v Speaker 3>the estimates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are estimates that were derived by</v>

771
00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:49.624
<v Speaker 3>soldier nets and where that 66 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>people died and internal repression in </v>

772
00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:56.650
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet Union between 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19 and 1959.</v>

773
00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.000
<v Speaker 3>That's a figure that's 10 times as great</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the figures that are commonly used to</v>

774
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:03.400
<v Speaker 3>describe the genocide rate in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Holocaust,</v>

775
00:49:03.401 --> 00:49:06.730
<v Speaker 3>which was more like 6 million and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's and it's and also estimated,</v>

776
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:07.564
<v Speaker 3>but no one knows that 100 million people</v>
<v Speaker 3>died in China during Mao's cultural </v>

777
00:49:11.441 --> 00:49:12.274
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Michael decided that he was going </v>

778
00:49:13.511 --> 00:49:14.344
<v Speaker 3>to wipe out all of Chinese tradition and</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed much of the much of the </v>

779
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:20.680
<v Speaker 3>ancient artifacts that characterize that</v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition in a,</v>

780
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:25.180
<v Speaker 3>in a like a riotous catastrophe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>lasted more than a decade.</v>

781
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

782
00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:33.620
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn says the imagination and </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>

783
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.513
<v Speaker 3>spiritual strength of Shakespeare's </v>
<v Speaker 3>evildoers stopped short and it doesn't </v>

784
00:49:37.731 --> 00:49:41.530
<v Speaker 3>corpses because they had no idea ology </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>

785
00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what gives evil doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's long sought justification and gives</v>

786
00:49:45.741 --> 00:49:49.130
<v Speaker 3>the evildoer the necessary steadfastness</v>
<v Speaker 3>and determination.</v>

787
00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:52.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the social theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which helps to make his act seem good.</v>

788
00:49:52.401 --> 00:49:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Instead of bad in his own eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>others,</v>

789
00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:56.683
<v Speaker 3>this was how the agents of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inquisition fortified their wills by </v>

790
00:49:59.061 --> 00:49:59.894
<v Speaker 3>invoking Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conqueror of foreign lands by </v>

791
00:50:02.211 --> 00:50:04.490
<v Speaker 3>extolling the grander of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherland,</v>

792
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:09.500
<v Speaker 3>the colonizers by civilization that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazis by race and the Jacob begins early</v>

793
00:50:09.501 --> 00:50:10.334
<v Speaker 3>and late by equality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brotherhood and the happiness of future </v>

794
00:50:12.621 --> 00:50:16.220
<v Speaker 3>generations without evildoers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would have been new archipelago.</v>

795
00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.013
<v Speaker 3>The archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gulag archipelago is social </v>

796
00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.533
<v Speaker 3>knutson's metaphor for the for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison camps like the prison camps that </v>

797
00:50:26.271 --> 00:50:31.271
<v Speaker 3>exists now in Korea in which millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are starving and dying for the.</v>

798
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.713
<v Speaker 3>For the prison camps that littered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire Soviet Union and those cultures </v>

799
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 3>became so pathological that in east </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>

800
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:39.734
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the wall fell down and East </v>

801
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Germany was arguably one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilized parts of the Soviet state.</v>

802
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 3>One person out of three was a government</v>
<v Speaker 3>informer.</v>

803
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.693
<v Speaker 3>So if you have a family of five people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reasonable probability that </v>

804
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:56.390
<v Speaker 3>two of them are going to tell a </v>
<v Speaker 3>government agent what you say and think,</v>

805
00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:02.000
<v Speaker 3>and that that was also portrayed as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest possible moral virtue because it</v>

806
00:51:02.001 --> 00:51:02.834
<v Speaker 3>was much better for you to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>admirable citizen of the state than say </v>

807
00:51:06.561 --> 00:51:09.140
<v Speaker 3>a loyal daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's where children were taught in</v>

808
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:09.974
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the family was a defunct unit and </v>

809
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:12.974
<v Speaker 3>that individual relationships were </v>
<v Speaker 3>secondary and not all that mattered was </v>

810
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.780
<v Speaker 3>adherence to the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With that constituted,</v>

811
00:51:17.781 --> 00:51:18.614
<v Speaker 3>this central axioms of the state</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this Solzhenitsyn's description of </v>

812
00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:29.170
<v Speaker 3>how communist ideological uniformity was</v>
<v Speaker 3>enforced.</v>

813
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:30.123
<v Speaker 3>In the prison camp,</v>

814
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:36.410
<v Speaker 1>an anonymous author is told how </v>
<v Speaker 1>executions were carried out at a Dac,</v>

815
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.433
<v Speaker 1>a camp on the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would take the opposition members </v>

816
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:41.303
<v Speaker 1>with their things out of the camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>compound on a prisoner transport at </v>

817
00:51:43.651 --> 00:51:47.700
<v Speaker 1>night and outside the compound stood the</v>
<v Speaker 1>small house of the third section.</v>

818
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 1>The condemned men were taken into a room</v>
<v Speaker 1>one at a time and they.</v>

819
00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:56.560
<v Speaker 1>The camp guards sprang on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their mouths were stuffed with something</v>

820
00:51:56.561 --> 00:51:59.650
<v Speaker 1>soft and their arms were bound with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cords behind their backs.</v>

821
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.473
<v Speaker 1>Then they were led out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courtyard where harnessed carts were </v>

822
00:52:03.161 --> 00:52:03.994
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bound prisoners were piled on the </v>

823
00:52:05.831 --> 00:52:09.700
<v Speaker 1>carts from five to seven at a time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven off to the Gorkha,</v>

824
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.280
<v Speaker 1>the camp cemetery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On arrival,</v>

825
00:52:12.281 --> 00:52:15.580
<v Speaker 1>they were tipped into big pits that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>already been prepared and buried alive,</v>

826
00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.750
<v Speaker 1>not out of brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

827
00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:20.620
<v Speaker 1>it had been ascertained</v>

828
00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.793
<v Speaker 3>that weren't dragging and lifting them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was much easier to cope with living </v>

829
00:52:24.511 --> 00:52:25.070
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

830
00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:25.903
<v Speaker 1>Corpses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work went on for many nights at a </v>

831
00:52:28.071 --> 00:52:32.150
<v Speaker 1>DAC and that is how the moral political </v>
<v Speaker 1>unity of our party was achieved.</v>

832
00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.453
<v Speaker 3>If you have a rigid belief system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is because it's axioms </v>

833
00:52:42.971 --> 00:52:43.804
<v Speaker 3>are such that it encompasses all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality and then there are details left </v>

834
00:52:46.901 --> 00:52:50.800
<v Speaker 3>outside that don't seem to fit into that</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality well then you ignore that,</v>

835
00:52:50.801 --> 00:52:51.634
<v Speaker 3>but what if they're embodied?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if there are people who are </v>

836
00:52:53.441 --> 00:52:55.960
<v Speaker 3>objecting to the way you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

837
00:52:55.961 --> 00:53:00.760
<v Speaker 3>the equivalent to repressing evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>that runs contrary to your theory is the</v>

838
00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:03.070
<v Speaker 3>murder of people who object to what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

839
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.590
<v Speaker 3>and those two things are linked much </v>
<v Speaker 3>tighter than you would think you know,</v>

840
00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:08.351
<v Speaker 3>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

841
00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:10.870
<v Speaker 3>I would never do something like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Communists did in,</v>

842
00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:11.830
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

843
00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:14.560
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the what?</v>

844
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.620
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evangelization of my beliefs.</v>

845
00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.280
<v Speaker 3>But the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that in general,</v>

846
00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:26.281
<v Speaker 3>people will do such things if they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>granted the and provided with the proper</v>

847
00:53:26.941 --> 00:53:31.941
<v Speaker 3>apparatus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Frankel from his accounts of the</v>

848
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:38.300
<v Speaker 3>concentration camps under Nazi Germany.</v>

849
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:43.760
<v Speaker 1>The most ghastly moment of the 24 hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>of camp life was the awakening when at a</v>

850
00:53:43.761 --> 00:53:46.760
<v Speaker 1>steel nocturnal our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three shrill blows have a whistle,</v>

851
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Torres Pediculus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leslie from are exhausted,</v>

852
00:53:48.891 --> 00:53:51.320
<v Speaker 1>sleep and from the longings in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

853
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:56.060
<v Speaker 1>We then began to tussle with our wet </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes into which we could scarcely force</v>

854
00:53:56.061 --> 00:53:59.000
<v Speaker 1>our feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were sore and swollen with edema,</v>

855
00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.793
<v Speaker 1>and then there were the usual moans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>groans about petty troubles such as the </v>

856
00:54:03.231 --> 00:54:05.750
<v Speaker 1>snapping of wires which replaced </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoelaces.</v>

857
00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.793
<v Speaker 1>One morning I heard someone whom I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be brave and dignified cry like a </v>

858
00:54:09.831 --> 00:54:13.880
<v Speaker 1>child because he finally had to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the snowy marching fields in his bare</v>

859
00:54:13.881 --> 00:54:16.550
<v Speaker 1>feet as the shoes were too shrunken for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to wear.</v>

860
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:21.090
<v Speaker 1>In those ghastly moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a little bit of comfort,</v>

861
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:22.403
<v Speaker 1>a small piece of bread which I drew out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my pocket and munched with absorbed </v>

862
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:29.830
<v Speaker 1>delight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn.</v>

863
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:36.940
<v Speaker 3>Many of the Gulag camps contained two </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes of prisoners,</v>

864
00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:40.720
<v Speaker 3>rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>murderers and thieves who were very well</v>

865
00:54:40.721 --> 00:54:43.930
<v Speaker 3>organized in Russia and the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 3>and political prisoners,</v>

866
00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:48.280
<v Speaker 3>and because the Soviets believed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that people were thieves,</v>

867
00:54:48.281 --> 00:54:49.114
<v Speaker 3>murderers and rapists was because of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>appalling sociological conditions that </v>

868
00:54:53.021 --> 00:54:53.854
<v Speaker 3>they grew up into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believed they were socially </v>

869
00:54:56.411 --> 00:54:58.810
<v Speaker 3>friendly elements who could still be </v>
<v Speaker 3>redeemed,</v>

870
00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:00.693
<v Speaker 3>so they put them in charge of the camps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the political prisoners were at </v>

871
00:55:04.031 --> 00:55:09.031
<v Speaker 3>the bottom of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The prisoners ran the camps with minimal</v>

872
00:55:09.441 --> 00:55:10.274
<v Speaker 3>supervision and the counts were often </v>
<v Speaker 3>forced labor camps and forced labor </v>

873
00:55:15.351 --> 00:55:18.890
<v Speaker 3>meant do something difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pointless until you die.</v>

874
00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:24.700
<v Speaker 3>It didn't mean it meant only secondarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>produced something of potential value to</v>

875
00:55:25.551 --> 00:55:26.384
<v Speaker 3>the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saw this with Nazi Germany to the </v>

876
00:55:28.521 --> 00:55:29.354
<v Speaker 3>Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they started to lose the Second </v>

877
00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:32.443
<v Speaker 3>World War,</v>

878
00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:34.383
<v Speaker 1>they could have stopped their holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 1>machinations and used the people they </v>

879
00:55:37.871 --> 00:55:38.740
<v Speaker 1>had imprisoned</v>

880
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.100
<v Speaker 3>to build implements to further the war </v>
<v Speaker 3>effort,</v>

881
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:43.830
<v Speaker 3>which they did to some degree so they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could have used them as slaves.</v>

882
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:46.740
<v Speaker 3>So this would be the logic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take the slaves,</v>

883
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 3>make the munitions when the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then after you've won the war,</v>

884
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:51.953
<v Speaker 3>you can run around and mop everybody up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't what the Nazis did when </v>

885
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:58.020
<v Speaker 3>they started to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of doing what you think would be</v>

886
00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:02.220
<v Speaker 3>rational in the pursuit of what was </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically their goal,</v>

887
00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:03.803
<v Speaker 3>they amped up the killing and and took </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources away from the war itself and </v>

888
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:09.984
<v Speaker 3>some of the conclusion that's reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 3>to draw from that is that the killing </v>

889
00:56:13.561 --> 00:56:14.394
<v Speaker 3>was the purpose of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the rest of it was just window </v>

890
00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:18.114
<v Speaker 3>dressing and exactly as associates and </v>
<v Speaker 3>described in the earlier quotes that I </v>

891
00:56:22.531 --> 00:56:23.364
<v Speaker 3>told you was ideology was only there to </v>
<v Speaker 3>allow the people who were fundamentally </v>

892
00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:27.514
<v Speaker 3>motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motivated towards genocide and </v>

893
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:29.494
<v Speaker 3>destruction to pretend to themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they hadn't become rotten to the </v>

894
00:56:33.161 --> 00:56:36.400
<v Speaker 3>absolute core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when push came to shove and they had</v>

895
00:56:36.401 --> 00:56:39.940
<v Speaker 3>to show where their allegiances lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't even.</v>

896
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:41.343
<v Speaker 3>They weren't even valid followers of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazi party because they put the </v>

897
00:56:46.601 --> 00:56:47.434
<v Speaker 3>continued pursuit of death above their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own survival even as an ideology and </v>

898
00:56:51.881 --> 00:56:52.714
<v Speaker 3>that's how we the only Gigi generates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of the reason for that is that </v>

899
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 3>the narrower the box that you stuffed </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself into,</v>

900
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:03.640
<v Speaker 3>the weaker your character becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's nothing left of you.</v>

901
00:57:03.641 --> 00:57:04.474
<v Speaker 3>You're just a shell that has demons in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and but you're still the sort of </v>

902
00:57:07.631 --> 00:57:10.210
<v Speaker 3>thing that can suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you cram everything,</v>

903
00:57:10.211 --> 00:57:13.210
<v Speaker 3>you are into a box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a small box,</v>

904
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 3>and you get rid of everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't fit.</v>

905
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:16.203
<v Speaker 3>You get rid of everything in you that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes life bearable and then life </v>

906
00:57:18.731 --> 00:57:21.640
<v Speaker 3>becomes unbearable and then if life </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes unbearable,</v>

907
00:57:21.641 --> 00:57:22.474
<v Speaker 3>well then of course you're motivated to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do nothing but to take revenge on it </v>

908
00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:26.163
<v Speaker 3>because why wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If all you were doing with suffering </v>

909
00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:32.830
<v Speaker 3>stupidly and meaninglessly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you positively,</v>

910
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:33.723
<v Speaker 3>how could you possibly show a positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>face to yourself into the rest of </v>

911
00:57:36.731 --> 00:57:41.731
<v Speaker 3>humanity in called lower than 60 degrees</v>
<v Speaker 3>below zero work days were written off.</v>

912
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.730
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on such days,</v>

913
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:48.370
<v Speaker 3>the records show that the workers had </v>
<v Speaker 3>not gone out to work.</v>

914
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:53.520
<v Speaker 3>They were often digging canals on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>frozen Siberian prairie by hand.</v>

915
00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 3>There was one canal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was on the river,</v>

916
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.323
<v Speaker 3>but I can't remember precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Stalin killed 300,000 people in a </v>

917
00:58:06.461 --> 00:58:10.480
<v Speaker 3>single winter digging it by hand and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was done,</v>

918
00:58:10.481 --> 00:58:12.580
<v Speaker 3>it was so shallow that no ships could </v>
<v Speaker 3>use it.</v>

919
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:17.520
<v Speaker 3>The record showed that the workers had </v>
<v Speaker 3>not gone out to work,</v>

920
00:58:17.521 --> 00:58:18.354
<v Speaker 3>but they chased them out anyway and </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever they squeezed out of them on </v>

921
00:58:20.041 --> 00:58:20.874
<v Speaker 3>those days was added to the other days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thereby raising the percentages and the </v>

<v Speaker 3>who froze to death on such cold days on </v>

923
00:58:28.651 --> 00:58:29.484
<v Speaker 3>some other basis and the ones who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>left who could no longer walk and we're </v>

924
00:58:32.101 --> 00:58:35.490
<v Speaker 3>straining every sinew to crawl along on </v>
<v Speaker 3>all fours on the way back to camp,</v>

925
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.533
<v Speaker 3>the convoy simply shot so that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't escape before they could come </v>

926
00:58:38.971 --> 00:58:39.530
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:47.103
<v Speaker 1>The invisible world that flies in the </v>

933
00:59:02.541 --> 00:59:04.630
<v Speaker 1>crackle in the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wind of late autumn blows up the</v>

934
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:06.370
<v Speaker 3>flame of the bonfire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth.</v>

935
00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 3>The compound is dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm alone at the bonfire and I can bring</v>

936
00:59:10.961 --> 00:59:14.860
<v Speaker 3>it still some more carpenter shavings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This compound here is a privileged one,</v>

937
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:18.340
<v Speaker 3>so privileged that it's almost as if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>were out in freedom.</v>

938
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 3>This is an island of paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the Marfino Sriracha,</v>

939
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:26.000
<v Speaker 1>a scientific institute staff by </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers</v>

940
00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 1>staffed with prisoners in its most </v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged period.</v>

941
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 1>No one is overseeing me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling me to a cell,</v>

942
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:33.974
<v Speaker 1>chasing me away from the bonfire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even then it is chilly in the </v>

943
00:59:36.711 --> 00:59:41.270
<v Speaker 1>penetrating wind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was already been standing in the</v>

944
00:59:41.271 --> 00:59:43.570
<v Speaker 1>wind for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her arms,</v>

945
00:59:43.571 --> 00:59:45.140
<v Speaker 1>straight down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her head drooping,</v>

946
00:59:45.141 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 1>weeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then growing,</v>

947
00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:48.560
<v Speaker 1>numb and still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then again,</v>

948
00:59:48.561 --> 00:59:51.140
<v Speaker 1>she begs pityingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen chief,</v>

949
00:59:51.141 --> 00:59:53.630
<v Speaker 1>please forgive me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it again.</v>

950
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:59.550
<v Speaker 1>The wind carries her moan to me just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>if she were moaning next to my ear.</v>

951
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>The citizen chief at the gate house </v>
<v Speaker 1>fires up his stove and does not answer.</v>

952
01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.083
<v Speaker 1>This was the gatehouse of the camp next </v>
<v Speaker 1>door to us from which workers came into </v>

953
01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:09.564
<v Speaker 1>our compound to lay water pipes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>repair the old ramshackle seminary </v>

954
01:00:13.321 --> 01:00:14.154
<v Speaker 1>building across from me beyond the art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fully intertwined many stranded barb </v>

955
01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:19.994
<v Speaker 1>wire barricade and two steps away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gate house beneath a bright lantern </v>

956
01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.413
<v Speaker 1>stood the punished girl head hanging the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind tugging at her gray work skirt her </v>

957
01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>feet growing numb from the cold</v>

958
01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.453
<v Speaker 1>and a thin scarf over her head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had been warmed during the day when </v>

959
01:00:36.521 --> 01:00:38.590
<v Speaker 1>they had been digging a ditch on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

960
01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.000
<v Speaker 1>And another girl slipping down into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ravine had crawled your way to the Vladi</v>

961
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Kino highway and escaped a guard had </v>
<v Speaker 1>bungled.</v>

962
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>And Moscow city buses ran right along </v>
<v Speaker 1>the highway.</v>

963
01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.820
<v Speaker 1>When they caught on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was too late to catch her.</v>

964
01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:53.283
<v Speaker 1>They raised the alarm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mean dark major arrived and shouted </v>

965
01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:57.723
<v Speaker 1>that if they failed to catch the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire camp would be deprived of </v>

966
01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>visits and parcels for a whole month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of her escape</v>

967
01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.570
<v Speaker 1>and the women bring it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tears went into a rage and they were all</v>

968
01:01:07.571 --> 01:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>shouting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them in particular,</v>

969
01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:13.090
<v Speaker 1>who kept a viciously rolling her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

970
01:01:13.091 --> 01:01:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I hope they catch her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bitch.</v>

971
01:01:14.411 --> 01:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I hope they take scissors and clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clip,</v>

972
01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:19.030
<v Speaker 1>take off all her hair in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lineup.</v>

973
01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't something she had thought of</v>
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>

974
01:01:21.851 --> 01:01:23.710
<v Speaker 1>This is the way they punished women in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag.</v>

975
01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:24.843
<v Speaker 1>But the girl who was now standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the gate house in the cold had </v>

976
01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>sighed and said instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least she can have a good time out in</v>

977
01:01:31.751 --> 01:01:32.584
<v Speaker 1>freedom for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That jailer overheard what she said and </v>

978
01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:35.824
<v Speaker 1>now she was being punished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else had been taken off to the </v>

979
01:01:38.351 --> 01:01:39.184
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had been sent outside there to </v>

980
01:01:40.241 --> 01:01:42.700
<v Speaker 1>stand at attention in front of the gate </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

981
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>This had been at 6:00 PM and it was now </v>
<v Speaker 1>11:00 PM.</v>

982
01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>She tried to shift from one foot to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

983
01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.620
<v Speaker 1>but the guard struck out his head and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder stand at attention,</v>

984
01:01:53.621 --> 01:01:57.820
<v Speaker 1>whore or it will be worse for you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now she was not moving.</v>

985
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Only weeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgive me,</v>

986
01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:03.460
<v Speaker 1>citizen chief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me into the camp.</v>

987
01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even in the camp,</v>

988
01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>no one was about to say to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

989
01:02:09.041 --> 01:02:10.120
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>

990
01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.250
<v Speaker 1>The reason they were keeping her out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

991
01:02:12.251 --> 01:02:13.084
<v Speaker 1>so lauren was that the next day was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunday and she would not be needed for </v>

992
01:02:16.001 --> 01:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a straw.</v>

993
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>naive,</v>

994
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.860
<v Speaker 2>uneducated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uneducated slip of a girl.</v>

995
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:26.460
<v Speaker 2>She had been in prison for some spool of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thread.</v>

996
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.630
<v Speaker 2>What a dangerous thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You expressed their little sister.</v>

997
01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:34.140
<v Speaker 2>They want to teach you a lesson for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of your life.</v>

998
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

999
01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:37.953
<v Speaker 1>We fought the war and we looked into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonfires to see what kind of victory it </v>

1000
01:02:41.951 --> 01:02:42.784
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wind wafted a glowing husk from the </v>

1001
01:02:45.131 --> 01:02:48.730
<v Speaker 1>bonfire</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that flame in you.</v>

1002
01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise the whole wide world will read</v>

1003
01:02:51.431 --> 01:02:52.264
<v Speaker 1>about you</v>

1004
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.003
<v Speaker 2>from Milton.</v>

1005
01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.060
<v Speaker 3>This is from paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lost.</v>

1006
01:02:58.270 --> 01:02:59.103
<v Speaker 3>Milton wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paradise lost just before the rise of </v>

1007
01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:01.444
<v Speaker 3>the nation states and melt and also had </v>
<v Speaker 3>the intuition that there was something </v>

1008
01:03:05.351 --> 01:03:06.184
<v Speaker 3>wrong with rationality and he identified</v>
<v Speaker 3>rationality with the mythology of Satan </v>

1009
01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:13.360
<v Speaker 3>and in the mythology of Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Satan was</v>

1010
01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:18.490
<v Speaker 3>represented as the highest angel in </v>
<v Speaker 3>God's heavenly kingdom.</v>

1011
01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.533
<v Speaker 3>So you can think about that as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest psychological function who had </v>

1012
01:03:22.421 --> 01:03:25.570
<v Speaker 3>rebelled against God and that was then </v>
<v Speaker 3>cast into hell.</v>

1013
01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:26.643
<v Speaker 3>And the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an idea that's being expressed </v>

1014
01:03:28.391 --> 01:03:29.200
<v Speaker 3>by Milton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>

1015
01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.033
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the foremost politik </v>

1016
01:03:33.551 --> 01:03:34.384
<v Speaker 3>geniuses of the English language milkmen</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shakespeare and what Milton was trying </v>

1017
01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:39.514
<v Speaker 3>to understand what's what is the nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>of evil and his representation gathered </v>

1018
01:03:45.131 --> 01:03:49.720
<v Speaker 3>up the dream like theories of evil that </v>
<v Speaker 3>had been collected around all of Western</v>

1019
01:03:49.721 --> 01:03:53.110
<v Speaker 3>civilization for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his hypothesis was this.</v>

1020
01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:54.843
<v Speaker 3>Evil is the force that believes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's knowledge is complete and that it </v>

1021
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:03.190
<v Speaker 3>can do without the transcendent and as </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon as it makes that claim,</v>

1022
01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:08.220
<v Speaker 3>it instantly exists in a place that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from hell and it could</v>

1023
01:04:09.521 --> 01:04:13.480
<v Speaker 3>get out merely by admitting it's error </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it will never do that</v>

1024
01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:17.403
<v Speaker 1>for when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from the author of all ill could </v>

1025
01:04:19.331 --> 01:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>spring so deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a malice to confound the race of mankind</v>

1026
01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:28.291
<v Speaker 1>in one route and earth withheld to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mingle and involve done all to spite the</v>

1027
01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:29.164
<v Speaker 1>great creator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from Richard the Third </v>

1028
01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shall despair.</v>

1029
01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.870
<v Speaker 1>There is no creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loves me,</v>

1030
01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and if I die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no soul will pity me,</v>

1031
01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:42.410
<v Speaker 1>nay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherefore should they.</v>

1032
01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Since that I myself find in myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no pity to myself.</v>

1033
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:51.223
<v Speaker 3>Soldier knits and describes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reactions inactions of Communist Party </v>

1034
01:04:53.691 --> 01:04:56.320
<v Speaker 3>members who are devoured by the system </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that often happened.</v>

1035
01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.390
<v Speaker 3>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1036
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:58.223
<v Speaker 3>the prison system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The [inaudible] system was very in </v>

1037
01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:03.260
<v Speaker 3>discriminating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could land there for good reasons or</v>

1038
01:05:03.261 --> 01:05:04.094
<v Speaker 3>bad and the bad reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're probably better because the </v>

1039
01:05:05.811 --> 01:05:09.380
<v Speaker 3>punishment was more severe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were in prison for your innocence</v>

1040
01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:10.663
<v Speaker 3>and Communist Party members often got </v>
<v Speaker 3>vacuumed up and this was ontologically </v>

1041
01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.013
<v Speaker 3>and existentially intolerable for them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they committed their whole soul </v>

1042
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:22.921
<v Speaker 3>to the ideological dogma and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tyrannical aspect.</v>

1043
01:05:23.171 --> 01:05:24.004
<v Speaker 3>Pick them up and destroyed them like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were worth nothing to say that </v>

1044
01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:29.740
<v Speaker 3>things were painful for them is to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost nothing.</v>

1045
01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Speaker 3>They were incapable of assimilating such</v>
<v Speaker 3>a blow,</v>

1046
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 3>such a downfall and from their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to form their own dear party.</v>

1047
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:37.833
<v Speaker 3>The typical arrest was you're at home </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your family in your bed and it's </v>

1048
01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:43.114
<v Speaker 3>3:00 in the morning and the doors kicked</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and they take you out of your bed </v>

1049
01:05:47.201 --> 01:05:48.034
<v Speaker 3>in whatever you happen to be wearing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tell you to say goodbye to your </v>

1050
01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:51.334
<v Speaker 3>family and give you like 25 seconds to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pack and then you're gone and no one </v>

1051
01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:56.650
<v Speaker 3>sees you again.</v>

1052
01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.070
<v Speaker 3>They take you to the prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take off all your clothes.</v>

1053
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:00.963
<v Speaker 3>They shave your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have you pick out some random </v>

1054
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:06.970
<v Speaker 3>clothes from a pile of clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully they don't fit and then you're</v>

1055
01:06:06.971 --> 01:06:09.070
<v Speaker 3>tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You confess,</v>

1056
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.790
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're off to the prison camp to say</v>

1057
01:06:12.791 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 3>that things were painful for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to say almost nothing.</v>

1058
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:17.680
<v Speaker 3>They were incapable of assimilating such</v>
<v Speaker 3>a blow,</v>

1059
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:18.783
<v Speaker 3>such a downfall and from their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to from their own dear party and </v>

1060
01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:25.810
<v Speaker 3>from all appearances for nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After all,</v>

1061
01:06:25.811 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 3>they had been guilty of nothing as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the party was concerned,</v>

1062
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:29.523
<v Speaker 3>nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was painful to them to such a degree </v>

1063
01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:33.963
<v Speaker 3>that it was considered taboo among them </v>
<v Speaker 3>on comradely to ask what were you in </v>

1064
01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:38.584
<v Speaker 3>prison for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were the only squeamish generation </v>

1065
01:06:41.021 --> 01:06:41.854
<v Speaker 3>of prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rest of us with our tongues hanging </v>

1066
01:06:43.241 --> 01:06:45.460
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't wait to tell the story to every</v>

1067
01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:49.270
<v Speaker 3>chance newcomer we met and to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>cell as if it were an anecdote.</v>

1068
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Here's the sort of people they were told</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

1069
01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.333
<v Speaker 3>The Oseberg's husband had already been </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrested and they had come to carry out </v>

1070
01:06:57.971 --> 01:06:58.804
<v Speaker 3>a search and arrest her too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The search lasted for hours and she </v>

1071
01:07:02.981 --> 01:07:03.814
<v Speaker 3>spent those four hours sorting out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes of the congress of the bristle </v>

1072
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.533
<v Speaker 3>brush industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of which she had been the secretary </v>

1073
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:11.464
<v Speaker 3>until the previous day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The incomplete state of the minutes </v>

1074
01:07:13.631 --> 01:07:17.320
<v Speaker 3>troubled her more than her children who </v>
<v Speaker 3>she was now leaving forever.</v>

1075
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Even the interrogator conducting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>search could not resist telling her,</v>

1076
01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.710
<v Speaker 3>come on now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say farewell to your children.</v>

1077
01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:25.683
<v Speaker 3>Here's the sort of people they were a </v>
<v Speaker 3>letter from her 15 year old daughter </v>

1078
01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:31.320
<v Speaker 3>came to yellows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aventa,</v>

1079
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:34.630
<v Speaker 3>set Cova in the prison for longterm </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoners.</v>

1080
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me,</v>

1081
01:07:36.341 --> 01:07:39.010
<v Speaker 3>write to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you guilty or not?</v>

1082
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:42.340
<v Speaker 3>I hope you weren't guilty because then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>won't join the Komsomol,</v>

1083
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:43.263
<v Speaker 3>which was the young communist </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization and I won't forgive them </v>

1084
01:07:45.911 --> 01:07:48.700
<v Speaker 3>because of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you are guilty,</v>

1085
01:07:48.701 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 3>I won't write you anymore and I will </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate you.</v>

1086
01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:51.843
<v Speaker 3>And the mother was stricken by remorse </v>
<v Speaker 3>in her damp grave like cell with it's </v>

1087
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:58.060
<v Speaker 3>dim little lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could her daughter lived without the</v>

1088
01:07:58.061 --> 01:07:58.894
<v Speaker 3>Komsomol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could she possibly be permitted to </v>

1089
01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:04.000
<v Speaker 3>hate Soviet power?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Better that she should hate me.</v>

1090
01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:05.620
<v Speaker 3>And so she wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am guilty.</v>

1091
01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Enter the Komsomol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could it be anything but hard.</v>

1092
01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:11.163
<v Speaker 3>It was more than the human heart could </v>
<v Speaker 3>bear to fall beneath the beloved acts </v>

1093
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 3>and then to have to</v>

1094
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.873
<v Speaker 1>justify its wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the price of man pays for </v>

1095
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his God given salty human dogma.</v>

1096
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.903
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any orthodox communist will affirm that </v>

1097
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:25.784
<v Speaker 1>set go the acted correctly even today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cannot be convinced that this is </v>

1098
01:08:29.061 --> 01:08:29.894
<v Speaker 1>precisely quote the perversion of small </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces that the mother perverted her </v>

1099
01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.044
<v Speaker 1>daughter and harmed her soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sort of people they were yt </v>

1100
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>gave sincere testimony against her </v>
<v Speaker 1>husband.</v>

1101
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Anything to aid the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1102
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:45.314
<v Speaker 1>how one could pity them if they at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>had come to comprehend their former </v>

1103
01:08:49.161 --> 01:08:49.994
<v Speaker 1>wretchedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole chapter could have been </v>

1104
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>writing quite differently if today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least they had forsaken their earlier</v>

1105
01:08:54.891 --> 01:08:55.724
<v Speaker 1>views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happened the way Marissa Daniel </v>

1106
01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.380
<v Speaker 1>had dreamed it would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I leave here someday,</v>

1107
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live as if nothing had </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken place.</v>

1108
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty in our view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just plain pigheadedness.</v>

1109
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Those devotes to the theories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

1110
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:11.803
<v Speaker 1>construed loyalty to that development to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean renunciation to any personal </v>

1111
01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:18.080
<v Speaker 1>development whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Nikolai Adamovich villain,</v>

1112
01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:20.690
<v Speaker 1>chuck said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after serving 17 years,</v>

1113
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.930
<v Speaker 1>we believed in the party and we were not</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistaken.</v>

1114
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Is this loyalty or pigheadedness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1115
01:09:27.741 --> 01:09:29.720
<v Speaker 1>it was not for show and not out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocrisy.</v>

1116
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.823
<v Speaker 1>Hypocrisy that they argued in the cells </v>
<v Speaker 1>and defense of all the government's </v>

1117
01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:33.734
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They needed ideological arguments in </v>

1118
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.640
<v Speaker 1>order to hold onto a sense of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>rightness.</v>

1119
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise insanity was not far off.</v>

1120
01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Is this from paradise lost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in this scene,</v>

1121
01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.093
<v Speaker 1>Satan is cast into hell and it's because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his rebellion against the </v>

1122
01:09:54.911 --> 01:09:58.990
<v Speaker 1>transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His idea that he himself is sufficient.</v>

1123
01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:03.310
<v Speaker 1>This is his statement to his crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>farewell,</v>

1124
01:10:03.311 --> 01:10:08.311
<v Speaker 1>happy fields where joy forever dwells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hail horrors,</v>

1125
01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:12.390
<v Speaker 1>hail infernal world and Dow Profundus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tail received.</v>

1126
01:10:12.391 --> 01:10:13.224
<v Speaker 1>I knew possessor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one who brings a mind not to be changed </v>

1127
01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:18.124
<v Speaker 1>by place or time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mind is its own place and in itself </v>

1128
01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.350
<v Speaker 1>can make a heaven of hell or hell of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven.</v>

1129
01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.393
<v Speaker 1>What matters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where if I be still the same and what I </v>

1130
01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:33.200
<v Speaker 1>should be all but less than he whom </v>
<v Speaker 1>thunder have made greater.</v>

1131
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Here at least we shall be free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Almighty hath not built here for his</v>

1132
01:10:37.641 --> 01:10:40.580
<v Speaker 1>envy will not drive us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence here we may rain,</v>

1133
01:10:40.581 --> 01:10:45.581
<v Speaker 1>secure and in my choice to reign is </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth ambition,</v>

1134
01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:47.023
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inhale better to reign in hell than </v>

1135
01:10:48.801 --> 01:10:49.634
<v Speaker 1>serve in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The existentialists of the late 19th </v>

1136
01:11:07.211 --> 01:11:12.211
<v Speaker 1>century attempted to diagnose the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology of the human personality at a</v>

1137
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.813
<v Speaker 3>deeper level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that anyone else had ever </v>

1138
01:11:16.381 --> 01:11:20.400
<v Speaker 3>attempted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are fundamental conclusion was</v>

1139
01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:21.234
<v Speaker 3>that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are destruction by rationality of </v>

1140
01:11:32.991 --> 01:11:35.600
<v Speaker 3>the evolved systems of meaning that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people had</v>

1141
01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:42.100
<v Speaker 3>previously lived within,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had undermined</v>

1142
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:44.963
<v Speaker 3>the psychological strength of each </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual divorced from their own </v>

1143
01:11:49.151 --> 01:11:54.151
<v Speaker 3>history</v>
<v Speaker 3>that led them to be to gravitate towards</v>

1144
01:11:54.731 --> 01:11:59.731
<v Speaker 3>either nihilism or as a counter position</v>
<v Speaker 3>to gravitate towards totalitarianism.</v>

1145
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:03.653
<v Speaker 3>The whole 20th century played out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pendulum swing between nihilism and </v>

1146
01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:08.424
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism and in the background </v>
<v Speaker 3>the existentialists and the </v>

1147
01:12:11.581 --> 01:12:12.414
<v Speaker 3>psychodynamic theorists were putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward a theory which was that if </v>

1148
01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:20.991
<v Speaker 3>people lived up to their own possibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>and held onto their own experience as if</v>

1149
01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 3>it were true and did not substitute for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that idiot,</v>

1150
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.823
<v Speaker 3>logical and consensual beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it would be possible for each </v>

1151
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:33.864
<v Speaker 3>person to find a wellspring of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a sufficient replacement </v>

1152
01:12:37.471 --> 01:12:41.910
<v Speaker 3>for what had been lost historically </v>
<v Speaker 3>without having to fall into the pitfalls</v>

1153
01:12:41.911 --> 01:12:44.610
<v Speaker 3>of nihilism or totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you might say,</v>

1154
01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:45.444
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1155
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:47.970
<v Speaker 3>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1156
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.160
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing because it's mostly </v>
<v Speaker 3>that effects you,</v>

1157
01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:50.994
<v Speaker 3>although if you're nihilistic than </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone around you is going to be </v>

1158
01:12:52.771 --> 01:12:56.220
<v Speaker 3>pulled down as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but totalitarianism is a whole different</v>

1159
01:12:56.221 --> 01:12:57.054
<v Speaker 3>issue because what we know now is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>once things become ideologically </v>

1160
01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.120
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next step is mass murder and and it.</v>

1161
01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.033
<v Speaker 3>It's the next step is mass murder in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>manner that makes it appear that the </v>

1162
01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:10.584
<v Speaker 3>purpose for the ideological rigidity </v>
<v Speaker 3>vacation to begin with was the </v>

1163
01:13:13.501 --> 01:13:16.200
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to participate in mass </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder.</v>

1164
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:17.663
<v Speaker 3>So you know how Hitler died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler lost faith in the German people </v>

1165
01:13:21.871 --> 01:13:22.770
<v Speaker 3>because they were</v>

1166
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:28.850
<v Speaker 3>losing the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he concluded in the waning stages</v>

1167
01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:32.580
<v Speaker 3>of world war two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Germany should just be destroyed in</v>

1168
01:13:32.581 --> 01:13:36.330
<v Speaker 3>fire and everything else that he could </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly consume would go with them.</v>

1169
01:13:36.331 --> 01:13:39.990
<v Speaker 3>And so he died in a bunker underneath </v>
<v Speaker 3>Berlin when it was in flames.</v>

1170
01:13:39.991 --> 01:13:40.824
<v Speaker 3>He committed suicide when Europe was </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflamed and Hitler was a worshiper of </v>

1171
01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:49.791
<v Speaker 3>the kind of fire that purifies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use that mythology of cleansing fire to</v>

1172
01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.333
<v Speaker 3>to enter into a terrible pact with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the entire nation that he followed </v>

1173
01:13:57.721 --> 01:14:02.721
<v Speaker 3>and lead and Stallon Stellan just didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>just kill individuals that he pulled off</v>

1174
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:08.600
<v Speaker 3>the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He killed like all the engineers and all</v>

1175
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:10.860
<v Speaker 3>the doctors because he believed they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were records.</v>

1176
01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:16.360
<v Speaker 3>They killed all the good farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed 6 million Ukrainians.</v>

1177
01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:17.283
<v Speaker 3>They moved whole nations of people into </v>
<v Speaker 3>Siberia and let them die and there's </v>

1178
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

1179
01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:24.093
<v Speaker 3>every bit of evidence there is suggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>that what Stalin was doing was </v>

1180
01:14:28.601 --> 01:14:29.434
<v Speaker 3>practicing murderous genocide on an ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>larger scale and hoping that it would </v>

1181
01:14:35.411 --> 01:14:40.411
<v Speaker 3>culminate in a thermonuclear war</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we escaped that just by a thread.</v>

1182
01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:45.443
<v Speaker 3>The existentialists make that claim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is a remarkable and </v>

1183
01:14:48.661 --> 01:14:49.494
<v Speaker 3>powerful claim that the way out of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic situations is not through </v>

1184
01:14:57.001 --> 01:14:57.834
<v Speaker 3>political action per se or it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be resolved by one party </v>

1185
01:15:02.461 --> 01:15:05.100
<v Speaker 3>defeating another or one position </v>
<v Speaker 3>defeating another.</v>

1186
01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:10.140
<v Speaker 3>That's our continuation of the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>process that produces the problem,</v>

1187
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:17.290
<v Speaker 3>the existential and the psychodynamic </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer to this problem is that it's more</v>

1188
01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.600
<v Speaker 3>a disease of the soul than a disease of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the state,</v>

1189
01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.213
<v Speaker 3>and that the way to address it is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ensure that you live in a manner that </v>

1190
01:15:25.851 --> 01:15:30.851
<v Speaker 3>makes you neither nihilistic nor </v>
<v Speaker 3>susceptible to ideological possession.</v>

1191
01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Soldier in Edson</v>

1192
01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.220
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and other other thinkers liked him,</v>

1193
01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:42.433
<v Speaker 3>liked frankl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believed that this society was a </v>

1194
01:15:46.881 --> 01:15:51.680
<v Speaker 3>macrocosm of the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the other way around.</v>

1195
01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:56.681
<v Speaker 3>Not that the individual is sub element </v>
<v Speaker 3>of society believed that the choice that</v>

1196
01:15:57.171 --> 01:16:02.171
<v Speaker 3>each individual made was potentially so </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful in relationship to pathological</v>

1197
01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:03.434
<v Speaker 3>behavior or honest or honest and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughtful behavior that a single </v>

1198
01:16:08.751 --> 01:16:12.440
<v Speaker 3>individual properly developed could </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up against the tyranny and wind.</v>

1199
01:16:13.730 --> 01:16:16.310
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought about this for a very long</v>

1200
01:16:16.311 --> 01:16:17.144
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the lesson of the 20th century is </v>

1201
01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:25.660
<v Speaker 3>that a single individual can stand up </v>
<v Speaker 3>against a tyrant and when,</v>

1202
01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:33.090
<v Speaker 3>and each of us are single individuals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the danger of tyranny and the danger</v>

1203
01:16:33.251 --> 01:16:38.251
<v Speaker 3>of nihilism or not passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so as inheritors of the catastrophic</v>

1204
01:16:39.821 --> 01:16:44.800
<v Speaker 3>legacy of the 20th century and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhabitants of the new millennium,</v>

1205
01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:50.340
<v Speaker 3>part of your responsibility is to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own life and to live it honestly,</v>

1206
01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:56.620
<v Speaker 3>and to pay attention to your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience and not take the easy way out</v>

1207
01:16:56.621 --> 01:17:01.621
<v Speaker 3>that ideological systems offer you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're destined to transform themselves</v>

1208
01:17:02.241 --> 01:17:03.074
<v Speaker 3>into rigid and murderous pathologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you offload your responsibility for </v>

1209
01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:09.680
<v Speaker 3>thinking and acting to them.</v>

1210
01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:12.850
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1211
01:17:12.851 --> 01:17:16.400
<v Speaker 3>what are they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1212
01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:17.243
<v Speaker 3>all the evidence suggests that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not the sort of thing that you want to </v>

1213
01:17:19.261 --> 01:17:24.261
<v Speaker 3>have in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The grades are up.</v>

1214
01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:33.570
<v Speaker 3>We'll see you on Tuesday.</v>
