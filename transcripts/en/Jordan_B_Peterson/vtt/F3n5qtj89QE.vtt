1
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want to go through a lot of </v>

2
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 1>material today and hopefully I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully that'll work out.</v>

3
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>It should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so far what we've been doing is </v>

4
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>laying out an argument that you inhabit </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you might describe as a frame of </v>

5
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:36.631
<v Speaker 1>reference or a story or that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupied by sequential subpersonalities.</v>

6
00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:44.191
<v Speaker 1>That's another reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it might be the most </v>

7
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:44.191
<v Speaker 1>reasonable way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

8
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.200
<v Speaker 1>and that these frames of reference or </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities have a point of view </v>

9
00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:54.541
<v Speaker 1>and to source associated thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated memories and that most </v>

10
00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:59.800
<v Speaker 1>importantly perhaps as well as directing</v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior and emotions.</v>

11
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>They also structure your perceptions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the most critical.</v>

12
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the most critically important </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization about the frames that you </v>

13
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 1>bring to bear on the world because they.</v>

14
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>It's through them that the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself and what that means to </v>

15
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>some degree is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

16
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you have an indeterminant role to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of your moral choices.</v>

17
00:01:26.261 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Because these are essentially value </v>
<v Speaker 1>based structures.</v>

18
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of your moral choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You determined to do an indeterminant </v>

19
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.761
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The manner in which the world manifests </v>

20
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.191
<v Speaker 1>itself to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in that sense you're a cocreator of </v>

21
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:44.641
<v Speaker 1>your own being and then you're also a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocreator through your action and your </v>

22
00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 1>communication for the being of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people as well and and,</v>

23
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the external world in so far as </v>

24
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.011
<v Speaker 1>you act upon it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a nontrivial realization too to </v>

25
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>understand that to what degree your </v>
<v Speaker 1>value structures filter the world for </v>

26
00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:07.441
<v Speaker 1>you and shape it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we've been talking so far about </v>

27
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:10.591
<v Speaker 1>the structure of that world and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I introduced some neurophysiological </v>

28
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 1>ideas last time.</v>

29
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 1>They got the idea being that you come </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the world obviously embodied with,</v>

30
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>with a set of inbuilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll call them subpersonalities at </v>

31
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them,</v>

32
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>those are regulated by very archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient brain systems that you share </v>

33
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 1>with many other creatures on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary chain,</v>

34
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>which is partly why you can communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and understand other creatures.</v>

35
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Because if you didn't share that </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying biological structure,</v>

36
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>they would be opaque to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the same way that perhaps an octopus </v>

37
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>is relatively opaque to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you,</v>

38
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand it because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't share an embodied platform and its</v>

39
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.400
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore entirely foreign to you,</v>

40
00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:56.401
<v Speaker 1>but you share your embodied platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly very specifically with all </v>

41
00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>mammals and of course you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals quite well,</v>

42
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:05.431
<v Speaker 1>but you can even really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>blizzards to some degree and especially </v>

43
00:03:05.431 --> 00:03:09.661
<v Speaker 1>the more social ones and so there's this</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous degree of inbuilt biological </v>

44
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:14.821
<v Speaker 1>structure and biological commonality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it most particularly in </v>

45
00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:17.450
<v Speaker 1>reference to the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be the the,</v>

46
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>the built in initial subpersonality </v>
<v Speaker 1>generator or something like that and the</v>

47
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:27.481
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus is responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulating what you might regard as the </v>

48
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>most fundamental biological elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

49
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 1>The things that the systems that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only keep you alive,</v>

50
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.260
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also impel you to do such things as </v>

51
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.031
<v Speaker 1>defend yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously part of survival and also to </v>

52
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:48.421
<v Speaker 1>reproduce and to explore and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration elements quite interesting </v>

53
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:52.321
<v Speaker 1>because you think of that as a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated form of behavior and it </v>

54
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:55.771
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's rooted in an unbelievably </v>

55
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:57.991
<v Speaker 1>archaic neurophysiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus roughly sets you </v>

56
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>into motivated frames and then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>those frames either fail or when they're</v>

57
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>all acquiescent because they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>satiated,</v>

58
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:10.501
<v Speaker 1>it pops you into an exploratory state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and you wander around exploring </v>

59
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>foraging for information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

60
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:18.091
<v Speaker 1>so that you can update all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities that you use to to </v>

61
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>organize your perceptions and frame your</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and so forth.</v>

62
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Now the so the hypothalamus throws up </v>
<v Speaker 1>these frames that makes you hungry,</v>

63
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>it makes you thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you defensively aggressive.</v>

64
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.850
<v Speaker 1>It helps regulate your temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>through behavior and all of those </v>

65
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with that is that it's a</v>

66
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 1>set of impulsive unit dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

67
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Each one operating in the moment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>each one only concerned with the </v>

68
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>satiation of its particular aim will </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

69
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.960
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you live for more than the moment you </v>

70
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 1>live across many moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stretch yourself across time.</v>

71
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And we know human beings know that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch across time and so actually have</v>

72
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:06.811
<v Speaker 1>to consider not only the organization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their behavior in the short term,</v>

73
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>but also the organization of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

74
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:14.941
<v Speaker 1>In the short term so that it also works </v>
<v Speaker 1>across weeks and across months and </v>

75
00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:18.961
<v Speaker 1>across years and maybe even for longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>spans of time than that and also equally</v>

76
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:24.211
<v Speaker 1>and similarly it has to work across </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and one of the things that's kind</v>

77
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:29.281
<v Speaker 1>of interesting about that is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually isn't much difference between </v>

78
00:05:29.281 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 1>establishing a value structure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>works for you now and next week and next</v>

79
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.790
<v Speaker 1>month and into the future and </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing a value structure that </v>

80
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.881
<v Speaker 1>works for you and other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously because you could say </v>

81
00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:45.121
<v Speaker 1>that whoever you are in a year is sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like another person and so in so far </v>

82
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>as you can organize yourself so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people find what you're doing,</v>

83
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say acceptable and valuable.</v>

84
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.480
<v Speaker 1>You're also organizing yourself so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you're acting in the best </v>

85
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>interests of your future self and so</v>

86
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 2>then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

87
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 2>if the hypothalamus can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

88
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can organize your,</v>

89
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.340
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your being such that you can satiate </v>

90
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 2>satisfy your most basic needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you need the rest of the brain?</v>

91
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 2>And answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

92
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.230
<v Speaker 2>it looks like it's to solve the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>of more complex forms of being so these,</v>

93
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.780
<v Speaker 2>these fundamental biological subsystems </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to interact with each other in a </v>

94
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 2>productive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't just cycle unit dimensionally</v>

95
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:34.301
<v Speaker 2>from motivated state to motivated state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a very effective solution and </v>

96
00:06:34.301 --> 00:06:38.981
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to learn to operate in a world </v>

97
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:39.520
<v Speaker 2>with time and with other people and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes the,</v>

98
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.450
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

99
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 2>the adaptation problem much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more complex.</v>

100
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 2>And it's for that reason as far as I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell enough,</v>

101
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.810
<v Speaker 2>no doubt for other reasons as well that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

102
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 2>there is utility in the provision of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extra subcortical and cortical </v>

103
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

104
00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.190
<v Speaker 2>And I think the right way to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cortex in some ways is actually as </v>

105
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 2>living space for the hypothalamus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the subcortical structures.</v>

106
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 2>So you know what happens when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you develop as a young child,</v>

107
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 2>especially in the very early stages of </v>
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>

108
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 2>the underlying subcortical systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the systems for the census,</v>

109
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 2>more or less compete for Don Dominion </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the cortical territory.</v>

110
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take a kitten and you closed one </v>

111
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 2>of its eyes shortly after birth and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave it covered for a number of months,</v>

112
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 2>what will happen is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the remaining I will invade both </v>

113
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 2>hemispheres,</v>
<v Speaker 2>visual representation systems so that it</v>

114
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:39.701
<v Speaker 2>becomes this angle remaining eye becomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more acute and more critically </v>

115
00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 2>dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an invader,</v>

116
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 2>really like an invader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the other one does.</v>

117
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:48.521
<v Speaker 2>And then if you uncover the other eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cat after a critical period of </v>

118
00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 2>development that cat will never learn to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see out of that eye.</v>

119
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.710
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

120
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 2>you've got these underlying biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>

121
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 2>motivational and sensory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're looking to expand themselves</v>

122
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 2>as the organism manifests itself in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

123
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 2>And it does that by occupying cortical </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory in a competitive process.</v>

124
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're deaf,</v>

125
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

126
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

127
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.440
<v Speaker 2>your visual cortex will become occupied </v>
<v Speaker 2>by auditory and tactile process because </v>

128
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

129
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:20.620
<v Speaker 2>You can basically see with your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 2>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

131
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it's not so easy to hear </v>

132
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.300
<v Speaker 2>with your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's harder,</v>

133
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 2>although you can hear to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with touch,</v>

134
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can feel vibration.</v>

135
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 2>All of your senses overlap to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantial degree and if one of them is</v>

136
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 2>missing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's perfectly reasonable for the others</v>

137
00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:42.131
<v Speaker 2>to occupy the territory that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would otherwise be given over to </v>

138
00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:46.601
<v Speaker 2>that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this actually has some practical </v>

139
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:46.601
<v Speaker 2>implications.</v>

140
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Even so silent reading is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively new ability,</v>

141
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly.</v>

142
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Literacy is a relatively new invention </v>
<v Speaker 2>from an evolutionary perspective about </v>

143
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:04.281
<v Speaker 2>two to silent read is to use your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>as ears so you know when you read </v>

144
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:08.070
<v Speaker 2>silently you could hear the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak in your head.</v>

145
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.340
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the part of the brain that you </v>

146
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.701
<v Speaker 2>use to read silently with is right </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the visual and the auditory </v>

147
00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 2>cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This right where they overlap.</v>

148
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.440
<v Speaker 2>So you are literally literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are using your eyes,</v>

149
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 2>ears and so that's quite the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

150
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.970
<v Speaker 2>You can figure out how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

151
00:09:27.971 --> 00:09:32.790
<v Speaker 2>so you can think about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamic systems being in place more</v>

152
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:37.791
<v Speaker 2>or less ready to go at birth and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to organize themselves into a </v>

153
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:41.331
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated and integrated single ego </v>
<v Speaker 2>that acts across time and in the social </v>

154
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

155
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Piaget originally started talking </v>

156
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.961
<v Speaker 2>about child development,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he regarded the child as something that </v>

157
00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:54.240
<v Speaker 2>was born into the world with just a set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of very primordial reflexes.</v>

158
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Mostly sucking reflex is and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary motor reflexes.</v>

159
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.680
<v Speaker 2>He was a very much a constructionist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say,</v>

160
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had he been alive now,</v>

161
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 2>his constructionism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it be modified and modified by the</v>

162
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:11.601
<v Speaker 2>relevant neurophysiological data showing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a lot more built into us </v>

163
00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:16.401
<v Speaker 2>right from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Piaget expected you still might </v>

164
00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 2>need experienced to catalyze the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development,</v>

165
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:22.251
<v Speaker 2>but obviously children are born with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to hear and to see and to sense </v>

166
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:27.291
<v Speaker 2>with touch and they're hungry and tired </v>
<v Speaker 2>and angry and like they have the whole </v>

167
00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:32.181
<v Speaker 2>range of emotions at hand and they also </v>
<v Speaker 2>come into the world with their </v>

168
00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 2>motivation already in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you wouldn't be able to form a</v>

169
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 2>relationship with them.</v>

170
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's modified by the development </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the higher cortical systems through </v>

171
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.131
<v Speaker 2>play and through social negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the biology is there to begin with </v>

172
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 2>and so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>

173
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.340
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way to think about it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to understanding how these,</v>

174
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:58.250
<v Speaker 2>how both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the fundamental biological systems </v>

175
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.941
<v Speaker 2>operate and how they manifest themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>in in personality and in story because </v>

176
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell a story about how you got angry</v>

177
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.910
<v Speaker 2>and it's basically a story about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated by a particular kind of </v>

178
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 2>subpersonality which would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamic and exactly how you </v>

179
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.240
<v Speaker 2>manifested that in what the consequences</v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

180
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.760
<v Speaker 2>And you know I was very mad at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

181
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 2>but I knew I couldn't get too upset </v>
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>

182
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That indicates both highly motivated </v>

183
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.411
<v Speaker 2>nature of the original response tendency</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then your immediate proclivity to </v>

184
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:34.431
<v Speaker 2>have to figure out how to negotiate that</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression within the social space so </v>

185
00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 2>that the medium to longterm consequences</v>
<v Speaker 2>are positive rather than negative.</v>

186
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.920
<v Speaker 2>And people are very interested in such </v>
<v Speaker 2>bits of information.</v>

187
00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:45.921
<v Speaker 2>She sent such units of information </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we need to know how to conduct </v>

188
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:50.841
<v Speaker 2>ourselves in complex environments and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's willing to share their </v>

189
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:52.770
<v Speaker 2>experience and they can narrate it in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting story,</v>

190
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.960
<v Speaker 2>we're absolutely more than happy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen because in some sense we're </v>

191
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.651
<v Speaker 2>assembling our identities out of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories and then you can think that </v>

192
00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:05.460
<v Speaker 2>there are patterns across stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really a useful thing to </v>

193
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.121
<v Speaker 2>understand because what that gives you </v>
<v Speaker 2>real insight into what constitutes an </v>

194
00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:13.321
<v Speaker 2>archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because an archetype is what's common </v>

195
00:12:13.321 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 2>across sets of stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be one way of looking at it.</v>

196
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:19.681
<v Speaker 2>So an archetype is like a Meta story and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what part of what we're going to turn</v>

197
00:12:19.851 --> 00:12:24.851
<v Speaker 2>to now in this discussion is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>description of certain metta stories and</v>

198
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a particular Metta story that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm most interested in.</v>

199
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the story about how stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed themselves and so that's </v>

200
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 2>that I think is the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>story that that,</v>

201
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.070
<v Speaker 2>that characterizes human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is the story I was,</v>

202
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 2>here I am implemented some behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went there.</v>

203
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 2>There was better than here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental unit,</v>

204
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:54.391
<v Speaker 2>but the thing about structures like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they may work in one situation </v>

205
00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:00.510
<v Speaker 2>and not in another or at one time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not in another and thus they have to be </v>

206
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:04.261
<v Speaker 2>modified and it was partly for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason that piaget has his career as a </v>

207
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:09.781
<v Speaker 2>developmental psychologist progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started to understand that it was more </v>

208
00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:13.711
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so much to understand the given </v>

209
00:13:13.711 --> 00:13:16.800
<v Speaker 2>structure of a knowledge structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to understand the manner in which </v>

210
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.251
<v Speaker 2>knowledge structures transformed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was partly partly illustrated in </v>

211
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:23.140
<v Speaker 2>his description of stage theory because </v>
<v Speaker 2>stages,</v>

212
00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:28.141
<v Speaker 2>we're really movement from one set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>axiomatic presuppositions.</v>

213
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.690
<v Speaker 2>That through through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through with which the child was </v>

214
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.991
<v Speaker 2>structuring the world into a state where</v>
<v Speaker 2>that system failed because it wasn't </v>

215
00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:41.821
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently comprehensive and then into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the development of a new stage that </v>

216
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:47.521
<v Speaker 2>could do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The previous stage could plus account </v>

217
00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:47.830
<v Speaker 2>for all the things that the previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage couldn't.</v>

218
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:53.310
<v Speaker 2>So that's also why Piaget believed that </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge actually accumulated because </v>

219
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:58.170
<v Speaker 2>each time there was a transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new structure could had a wider </v>

220
00:13:58.361 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Speaker 2>range of application than the previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

221
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:05.821
<v Speaker 2>Even though it kept all the advantages </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the previous structure and so that's </v>

222
00:14:05.821 --> 00:14:08.761
<v Speaker 2>a good way of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of conceptualizing </v>

223
00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:10.030
<v Speaker 2>progress because it's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a relativist.</v>

224
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally you don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between knowledge structure </v>

225
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.431
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you certainly don't believe in the </v>

226
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:19.801
<v Speaker 2>idea of progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you think about a more </v>

227
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:22.651
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated structure as being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do more things properly,</v>

228
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:28.141
<v Speaker 2>then you can certainly map out progress </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no problem and you know you know </v>

229
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 2>that because you see people operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world who are less competent,</v>

230
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking and more competent </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

231
00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:37.240
<v Speaker 2>and there doesn't seem to be much debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

232
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.910
<v Speaker 2>You can recognize people like that very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very easily.</v>

233
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.980
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the basic structure and we've </v>

234
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.851
<v Speaker 2>talked about that at length and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggested that while you're occupying a </v>

235
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:50.440
<v Speaker 2>structure like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world manifests itself to you not as</v>

236
00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 2>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as number one.</v>

237
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Things to ignore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the major category.</v>

238
00:14:56.041 --> 00:15:01.041
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to some guy yesterday who </v>
<v Speaker 2>is working pinky was in San Diego on </v>

239
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.830
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence and neural </v>
<v Speaker 2>networks and he.</v>

240
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:08.831
<v Speaker 2>He was working with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually started to a neural network </v>

241
00:15:08.831 --> 00:15:12.760
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll learn how to weight certain </v>

242
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 2>stimulus features,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say in order to identify an image,</v>

243
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:20.621
<v Speaker 2>so the thing will be trained up on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole set of diverse images and it </v>

244
00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:22.490
<v Speaker 2>learns through feedback to discriminate </v>
<v Speaker 2>between them,</v>

245
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:27.670
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with the neural network </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's not easy to understand </v>

246
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.581
<v Speaker 2>what's actually going on inside of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it sells itself generated so we </v>

247
00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Speaker 2>could easily end up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

248
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.440
<v Speaker 2>creating fully conscious machines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not understanding at all how they work.</v>

249
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the most likely outcome in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimation.</v>

250
00:15:38.991 --> 00:15:42.800
<v Speaker 2>But this guy was working with another </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who had figured out how to model the</v>

251
00:15:42.801 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 2>weights and one of the things he told me</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that a tremendous amount of what the</v>

252
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 2>neural network is doing is learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's not relevant.</v>

253
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is exactly what.</v>

254
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.790
<v Speaker 2>And these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

255
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:57.791
<v Speaker 2>these neural network models produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>output that's analogous to the output </v>

256
00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.360
<v Speaker 2>that's produced by sections of cortical </v>
<v Speaker 2>tissue.</v>

257
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It's not identical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so partly they make the same kind of</v>

258
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:07.991
<v Speaker 2>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an indication that they're </v>

259
00:16:07.991 --> 00:16:09.851
<v Speaker 2>functioning in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things that have neural </v>

260
00:16:09.851 --> 00:16:13.331
<v Speaker 2>net does when you're training it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned to figure out which things it </v>

261
00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Speaker 2>can ignore and that's mostly what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is what can be ignored.</v>

262
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's a tremendous realization too </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it.</v>

263
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:23.890
<v Speaker 2>It highlights again how important the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure within which you exist,</v>

264
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:29.830
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how importantly the structure within </v>

265
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.991
<v Speaker 2>which you exist determines what </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself to you as you move </v>

266
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:35.771
<v Speaker 2>through the world because you ignore </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost everything so you ignore almost </v>

267
00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:39.521
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you concentrate on things that </v>

268
00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:41.651
<v Speaker 2>move you along your way or obstacles </v>
<v Speaker 2>that get in your way and those things </v>

269
00:16:41.651 --> 00:16:43.010
<v Speaker 2>have emotional significance there.</v>

270
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Valence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason their valence is because </v>

271
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:48.530
<v Speaker 2>there are conceptualized in relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the journey.</v>

272
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you run across a tool or something </v>

273
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.040
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an opportunity we could say,</v>

274
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.110
<v Speaker 2>which is like an abstract tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that moves you forward and the fact</v>

275
00:16:57.111 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 2>that it's moving you forward is signaled</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the incentive reward system.</v>

276
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Dopaminergic mediated incentive reward </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

277
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.980
<v Speaker 2>That's grounded in the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same system that you use when you </v>

278
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.641
<v Speaker 2>explore the same system that's activated</v>
<v Speaker 2>by psychomotor stimulants like cocaine </v>

279
00:17:12.641 --> 00:17:14.210
<v Speaker 2>and heroin and most of the drugs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people abuse,</v>

280
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:19.810
<v Speaker 2>that that system indicates to you that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this entity is non ignorable because </v>

281
00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:27.371
<v Speaker 2>it's positively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>functionally related to the </v>

282
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:27.980
<v Speaker 2>transformation of the world that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting to accomplish,</v>

283
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.810
<v Speaker 2>so that makes you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you that,</v>

284
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:36.100
<v Speaker 2>that that provides you with with hope </v>
<v Speaker 2>and incentive to move forward.</v>

285
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.380
<v Speaker 2>If fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivating force of life for human </v>

286
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.440
<v Speaker 2>beings with the possible exception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say of aggression and sexuality,</v>

287
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.470
<v Speaker 2>which I would say operate much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sporadically.</v>

288
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.710
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty much continual and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course the negative emotions are </v>

289
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.531
<v Speaker 2>generated when you encounter something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets in the way which can require a</v>

290
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:57.060
<v Speaker 2>small detour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

291
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.360
<v Speaker 2>or can blow apart the frame that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabiting completely.</v>

292
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 2>And part of what we're trying to do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how you compute,</v>

293
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.960
<v Speaker 2>how emotional to get about about certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes of events.</v>

294
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:14.370
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that it's so complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>is because often when you run into a.</v>

295
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.100
<v Speaker 2>When you run into a tool or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity,</v>

296
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:22.310
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not too hard to compute how useful </v>

297
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.641
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although sometimes something can happen </v>

298
00:18:25.641 --> 00:18:28.071
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say you win a lottery where </v>

299
00:18:28.071 --> 00:18:30.141
<v Speaker 2>the possibility space is so great that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an indefinite positive </v>

300
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

301
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 2>when you're going to be overwhelmed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>

302
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty rare that something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens,</v>

303
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.430
<v Speaker 2>but it does happen to it.</v>

304
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it happens when someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're desperately chasing for Amaris </v>

305
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.191
<v Speaker 2>purposes agrees to go out with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another place where that sort of </v>

306
00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:48.210
<v Speaker 2>excitement occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to occur to football players,</v>

307
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they make a touchdown on tv too,</v>

308
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 2>because they do their little touchdown </v>
<v Speaker 2>dance around like mad dogs and you know,</v>

309
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:57.480
<v Speaker 2>scientists never do that when they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of paper published.</v>

310
00:18:57.481 --> 00:19:02.481
<v Speaker 2>So there's something about scoring a </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal that's really got that incentive </v>

311
00:19:02.481 --> 00:19:02.481
<v Speaker 2>reward blast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

312
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.390
<v Speaker 2>So anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

313
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:11.180
<v Speaker 2>the positive emotion systems are </v>
<v Speaker 2>operating roughly speaking because you </v>

314
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.920
<v Speaker 2>have encountered something that moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>you forward on your path.</v>

315
00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:17.280
<v Speaker 2>And we could say that given as we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed,</v>

316
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:21.480
<v Speaker 2>that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your value structure is a nested entity,</v>

317
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With small goals,</v>

318
00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:26.130
<v Speaker 2>nested inside larger goals or small </v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities,</v>

319
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:31.131
<v Speaker 2>nested inside of larger personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a positive thing that's really positive </v>

320
00:19:31.131 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 2>has implications for what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now that are positive but also has</v>

321
00:19:34.471 --> 00:19:37.440
<v Speaker 2>positive implications higher up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction chain,</v>

322
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:38.150
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

323
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.160
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you study really hard for an </v>

324
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.580
<v Speaker 2>exam and you get a really good grade on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you're surprised,</v>

325
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.180
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

326
00:19:45.181 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Speaker 2>that's extraordinarily useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I passed the grade,</v>

327
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I passed the exam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did well in the course,</v>

328
00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:53.400
<v Speaker 2>but that means that maybe I'm a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>student than I thought,</v>

329
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 2>and given what I'm aiming for in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future,</v>

330
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:58.200
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm a more competent person that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had believed.</v>

331
00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:03.201
<v Speaker 2>And so you can see that the positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion with echo through those levels </v>

332
00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 2>of analysis because it has implications </v>
<v Speaker 2>on each level.</v>

333
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Now you're also trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you encounter something negative to</v>

334
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.380
<v Speaker 2>constrain its propagation across those </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>

335
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:18.381
<v Speaker 2>because let's say you study really hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you fail a dismally and so then you </v>

336
00:20:18.381 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

337
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I messed up this course,</v>

338
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.980
<v Speaker 2>I've messed up this exam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I messed up this course.</v>

339
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as good as student as I think I </v>
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>

340
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm a failure as a person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll.</v>

341
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 2>That can take you out completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

342
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:35.060
<v Speaker 2>and of course there are more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certainly more traumatic </v>

343
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.181
<v Speaker 2>events that can be fall you than that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>typical one that really will wipe </v>

344
00:20:38.181 --> 00:20:42.681
<v Speaker 2>someone out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine someone who's naive and </v>

345
00:20:42.681 --> 00:20:43.410
<v Speaker 2>dependent and over sheltered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

346
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 2>and they and so they're off into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

347
00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:49.030
<v Speaker 2>although they're not prepared it and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know they're,</v>

348
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:54.150
<v Speaker 2>they're axiomatic presuppositions aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated enough to allow for the </v>

349
00:20:55.571 --> 00:21:00.571
<v Speaker 2>existence of radical uncertainty or </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolence and then one day they're </v>

350
00:21:00.571 --> 00:21:01.350
<v Speaker 2>attacked when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're out,</v>

351
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.910
<v Speaker 2>they get mugged or maybe they get raped </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something worse,</v>

352
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.970
<v Speaker 2>and they develop posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder from that.</v>

353
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>event is so anomalous,</v>

354
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:15.781
<v Speaker 2>especially combined with its malevolence</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it demolishes the interpretation </v>

355
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 2>frames from the local level all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to the superordinate level,</v>

356
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.500
<v Speaker 2>and then the person is cast into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic state and they're terrified and </v>

357
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.091
<v Speaker 2>angry and vengeful and and paralyzed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed and and all of those things </v>

358
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>

359
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they never put the pieces back</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

360
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They descend into chaos and that's that.</v>

361
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.970
<v Speaker 2>And if you're in a situation like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>long enough,</v>

362
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.770
<v Speaker 2>you know the cortisol that's produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>can produce permanent neurophysiological</v>

363
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 2>changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrinkage of the hippocampus,</v>

364
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:52.470
<v Speaker 2>which is the part of the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>moves information from short term </v>

365
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.711
<v Speaker 2>attention to longterm storage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrinkage of the hippocampus and growth </v>

366
00:21:55.711 --> 00:21:59.821
<v Speaker 2>of the Amygdala,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something that seems to tag </v>

367
00:21:59.821 --> 00:22:01.480
<v Speaker 2>stimuli roughly speaking with emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance,</v>

368
00:22:01.481 --> 00:22:03.730
<v Speaker 2>more or less permanently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

369
00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Because if you really encountered </v>
<v Speaker 2>something traumatic,</v>

370
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:11.790
<v Speaker 2>the hippocampus restricts information </v>
<v Speaker 2>with regards to its application in this </v>

371
00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:15.670
<v Speaker 2>certain time and place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of situation specific.</v>

372
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Speaker 2>But if you encounter something truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>

373
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.890
<v Speaker 2>your brain is set up so that you will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of it.</v>

374
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Rep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of context,</v>

375
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.760
<v Speaker 2>so it's called the Amygdala,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can peruse context,</v>

376
00:22:27.761 --> 00:22:30.910
<v Speaker 2>independent fears and those are those </v>
<v Speaker 2>are basically,</v>

377
00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:33.070
<v Speaker 2>while they can be part of posttraumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress disorder,</v>

378
00:22:33.071 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 2>they can be part of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

379
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:38.200
<v Speaker 2>very serious phobia and so you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>contextualize them.</v>

380
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:43.350
<v Speaker 2>What you really do with someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>a problem like that as you try to walk </v>

381
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.551
<v Speaker 2>them through a recontextualization </v>
<v Speaker 2>process so you know maybe if they're </v>

382
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:48.100
<v Speaker 2>afraid of snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so afraid of them,</v>

383
00:22:48.101 --> 00:22:51.520
<v Speaker 2>they can't even really think of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have the well first,</v>

384
00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:54.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have them sit for one second </v>
<v Speaker 2>and think of a cartoon snake,</v>

385
00:22:55.090 --> 00:23:00.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what happens is their brain notices </v>

386
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.251
<v Speaker 2>that they can hold that image and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing negative happens and so then </v>

387
00:23:02.251 --> 00:23:05.731
<v Speaker 2>it's that in some sense it's built in </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibitory structure that partially that</v>

388
00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:09.670
<v Speaker 2>partially inhibits which is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibitory structures do.</v>

389
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:14.671
<v Speaker 2>That partially inhibits the otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>context independent fear that would </v>

390
00:23:14.671 --> 00:23:18.661
<v Speaker 2>constitute the phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you basically build up contexts </v>

391
00:23:18.661 --> 00:23:22.681
<v Speaker 2>of safety around the phobia until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>context signifies lack of danger in the </v>

392
00:23:22.841 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 2>person can progress forward if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really damaged.</v>

393
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:30.511
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if the trauma was really </v>

394
00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:30.511
<v Speaker 2>severe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>

395
00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:33.670
<v Speaker 2>so you see you don't see irrelevant </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

396
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.880
<v Speaker 2>That's most things you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See things that move you forward and you</v>

397
00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:41.881
<v Speaker 2>do see things that get in your way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the class of things that get in your </v>

398
00:23:41.881 --> 00:23:45.950
<v Speaker 2>way are in determinant occurrences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>novel or anomalous occurrences,</v>

399
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.100
<v Speaker 2>and almost everything that gets in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>way is in some sense a novel occurrence </v>

400
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.030
<v Speaker 2>because you usually structure your </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior so that you don't go anywhere </v>

401
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 2>where something wildly anomalous is </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to occur.</v>

402
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.470
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so not if you encountered an obstacle to</v>

403
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:05.471
<v Speaker 2>things happening at the same time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one is that your movement forward to </v>

404
00:24:05.471 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 2>your specific goal or sets of goals is </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocked.</v>

405
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.400
<v Speaker 2>But the second thing that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're faced with a mystery and the </v>

406
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.700
<v Speaker 2>mystery is this thing wasn't supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist,</v>

407
00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:18.701
<v Speaker 2>but it does exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what implication does that have for </v>

408
00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:18.701
<v Speaker 2>everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

409
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.330
<v Speaker 2>and that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard on people.</v>

410
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.510
<v Speaker 2>They do not like that at all and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder because it's,</v>

411
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.990
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the constrained chaos that's </v>

412
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.501
<v Speaker 2>underneath everything inhibited by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>contextual knowledge that suddenly </v>

413
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:37.690
<v Speaker 2>popped its head up into your world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like the shark in the </v>

414
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 2>movie jaws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course a mythological story.</v>

415
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:41.860
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

416
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:44.750
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what that movie signified,</v>

417
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.200
<v Speaker 2>a safe vacation paradise all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened by some subterranean thing </v>

418
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:55.781
<v Speaker 2>that can pull you down and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that destroys the peace and the </v>

419
00:24:55.781 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 2>harmony of that particular community to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dragon story.</v>

420
00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:58.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

421
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 2>it's the story that people have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling forever.</v>

422
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.060
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

423
00:25:03.061 --> 00:25:08.061
<v Speaker 2>and what you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can think of that thing that </v>

424
00:25:08.061 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 2>re-emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shark that rises up from the depths</v>

425
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 2>or that whale or that dragon or that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator or,</v>

426
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.290
<v Speaker 2>or the foreign invader for that matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the barbarian,</v>

427
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:17.060
<v Speaker 2>they all fit into the same category.</v>

428
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.360
<v Speaker 2>That's what had been deemed irrelevant </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly manifesting itself.</v>

429
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.020
<v Speaker 2>And when you think about how much is </v>
<v Speaker 2>deemed irrelevant,</v>

430
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it's suddenly manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

431
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.320
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly the purpose for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason for the,</v>

432
00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>for the trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

433
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:35.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

434
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I've eradicated from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizations,</v>

435
00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:40.100
<v Speaker 2>99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine percent of everything.</v>

436
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.740
<v Speaker 2>It's zeroed out and all of a sudden I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a mistake,</v>

437
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 2>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where I am.</v>

438
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's relevant when you don't know </v>

439
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:49.720
<v Speaker 2>where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>

440
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.980
<v Speaker 2>since you don't know everything is </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant and you can imagine the sort of</v>

441
00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.320
<v Speaker 2>terror that people who experienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>paranoid schizophrenia are living in </v>

442
00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.341
<v Speaker 2>perennially because what happens to them</v>
<v Speaker 2>is precisely that they undergo </v>

443
00:26:03.341 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 2>neurophysiological transformations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes everything,</v>

444
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:10.571
<v Speaker 2>that they once dependent on disappear </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything comes back is relevant </v>

445
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.060
<v Speaker 2>and that puts them in the early stages </v>
<v Speaker 2>of schizophrenia.</v>

446
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.700
<v Speaker 2>That's extraordinarily stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurophysiologically.</v>

447
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:21.940
<v Speaker 2>So they're overwhelmed with cortisol and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their brains do deteriorate as a </v>

448
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.180
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that is just too much so </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

449
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.830
<v Speaker 2>surprisingly right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you can't deal with.</v>

450
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 2>You can hardly deal with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let alone with everything.</v>

451
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Now and often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you see,</v>

452
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 2>and it's rarely conceptualized this way </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the training of,</v>

453
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:41.500
<v Speaker 2>of of clinical therapists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but often what you see when you are </v>

454
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:46.020
<v Speaker 2>dealing with people who are in crisis </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't people who have a mental illness.</v>

455
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.670
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my experience,</v>

456
00:26:47.671 --> 00:26:52.671
<v Speaker 2>that's actually quite rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's far more common is that the </v>

457
00:26:52.671 --> 00:26:56.151
<v Speaker 2>person that you're talking to has become</v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmed by catastrophe so their life</v>

458
00:26:56.461 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 2>has fallen apart in some way that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing actually impossible.</v>

459
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe someone very close to them in </v>

460
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.840
<v Speaker 2>their family that they were depending on</v>
<v Speaker 2>has developed a very serious illness and</v>

461
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:10.310
<v Speaker 2>that's throwing their entire financial </v>
<v Speaker 2>state into utter chaos.</v>

462
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they've developed a condition </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes it impossible for them to </v>

463
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:15.680
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you know you can.</v>

464
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.000
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine the potential range of </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophes and they're coming to see </v>

465
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.120
<v Speaker 2>you because they're anxious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed.</v>

466
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:26.300
<v Speaker 2>But the reason they're anxious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed is because everything they </v>

467
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.541
<v Speaker 2>have ignored has popped its head back up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and is hell bent on their destruction.</v>

468
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
<v Speaker 2>And often you see people who are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked by five or six of these </v>

469
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.301
<v Speaker 2>monsters out at the same time and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't their mental illness that stops </v>

470
00:27:38.301 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 2>them from being able to deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although that,</v>

471
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:44.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever weaknesses you have are going </v>

472
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.361
<v Speaker 2>to interfere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that what they're facing </v>

473
00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:47.670
<v Speaker 2>is no damn joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you were facing it,</v>

474
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.700
<v Speaker 2>you'd feel exactly the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you're trying to come up with </v>

475
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.050
<v Speaker 2>practical solutions to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendously complex problems.</v>

476
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very well,</v>

477
00:27:58.201 --> 00:28:00.810
<v Speaker 2>it's extraordinarily difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>

478
00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:05.811
<v Speaker 2>people often don't come to a therapist </v>
<v Speaker 2>until they've exhausted their entire </v>

479
00:28:05.811 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 2>range of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cannot figure out what to do.</v>

480
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.650
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

481
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:15.651
<v Speaker 2>in a situation like that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>administer antidepressants and maybe </v>

482
00:28:15.651 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 2>that'll help the person increase their </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress resistance.</v>

483
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.650
<v Speaker 2>But as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

484
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 2>and it may be that because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed and have been brought down,</v>

485
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:26.721
<v Speaker 2>that they are in fact exaggerated the </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger of some of the smaller monsters </v>

486
00:28:26.721 --> 00:28:30.771
<v Speaker 2>that are after them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But making the person more stress </v>

487
00:28:30.771 --> 00:28:31.080
<v Speaker 2>resilient doesn't give them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

488
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:36.081
<v Speaker 2>a new job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it certainly doesn't bring back the </v>

489
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:38.721
<v Speaker 2>person they've been living with for two </v>
<v Speaker 2>years who has a degenerating </v>

490
00:28:38.721 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 2>neurological disease or some form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

491
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Like these things are major.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

492
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.180
<v Speaker 2>I often see people who while they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a relationship,</v>

493
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:46.920
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're rather isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>older,</v>

494
00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:52.010
<v Speaker 2>older people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the partners is dying in their </v>

495
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 2>entire financial situation has become </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic.</v>

496
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's not a mental illness </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

497
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean they may have got into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation because of one inadequacy or </v>

498
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.300
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't even want to push that too</v>

499
00:29:03.301 --> 00:29:08.301
<v Speaker 2>far because that sort of thing can </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to anyone and and will in fact </v>

500
00:29:08.301 --> 00:29:12.531
<v Speaker 2>happen to most people in one form or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another at least at some point in their </v>

501
00:29:12.531 --> 00:29:16.251
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to be damned prepared for </v>

502
00:29:16.251 --> 00:29:16.251
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be prepared for that because</v>

503
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.240
<v Speaker 2>it's bitter and harsh and anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>provoking and painful.</v>

504
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.000
<v Speaker 2>But if you're not ready that it's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

505
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.590
<v Speaker 2>And often you can stop things from </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming hell even though you can't stop</v>

506
00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:31.890
<v Speaker 2>them from being bitter and painful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety provoking and all of that.</v>

507
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.400
<v Speaker 2>You can at least delimit the catastrophe</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

508
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:38.160
<v Speaker 2>So that it doesn't permanently bring you</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

509
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 2>the people around you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not so bad,</v>

510
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

511
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:46.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a hell of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or at least it's a lot better than the </v>

512
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 2>alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the problem.</v>

513
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:50.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things object things are obstacles.</v>

514
00:29:50.081 --> 00:29:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how big is the obstacle?</v>

515
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 2>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same question is how big is the</v>

516
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Predator that's lurking outside the door</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our cave?</v>

517
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.570
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same problem except </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct,</v>

518
00:30:01.571 --> 00:30:03.280
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized abstractly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

519
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:08.310
<v Speaker 2>and I would say exactly the same systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're distant ancestors used to </v>

520
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:13.291
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize the lurking Predator are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the systems that are activated now when </v>

521
00:30:13.291 --> 00:30:17.080
<v Speaker 2>you encounter the reemergence of all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters that you've ignored,</v>

522
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.290
<v Speaker 2>it's the same neurological platform you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

523
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:21.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could it be otherwise?</v>

524
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Because evolution is a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

525
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Everything about you is built on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient foundations,</v>

526
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very little new.</v>

527
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Certainly very little radically new </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes into existence.</v>

528
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:36.820
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly tinkering with structures </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been around forever.</v>

529
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Like your body plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

530
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 2>That's unbelievably old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you share that with.</v>

531
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.630
<v Speaker 2>You share that with lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

532
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.660
<v Speaker 2>So it's incredibly ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know when you share a bilateral </v>

533
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.900
<v Speaker 2>symmetry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with most invertebrates,</v>

534
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.620
<v Speaker 2>so those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things are extraordinarily old and</v>

535
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:58.150
<v Speaker 2>so for our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for our ancestors,</v>

536
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 2>what was down out of the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say down in the grass,</v>

537
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 2>that was the thing that lurked in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>

538
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Well for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the unknown has become much </v>

539
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.971
<v Speaker 2>more abstractly conceptualized like we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can think of the unknown as such things </v>

540
00:31:11.971 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 2>we don't know and so then we can think </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the abstract Predator and abstract.</v>

541
00:31:16.451 --> 00:31:21.451
<v Speaker 2>Predator is the thing that lurks in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown that always confronts us now </v>

542
00:31:21.451 --> 00:31:25.921
<v Speaker 2>because people are strange and complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures and because we're partly </v>

543
00:31:25.921 --> 00:31:30.690
<v Speaker 2>predators and partly prey animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't only conceptualize the thing </v>

544
00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:34.090
<v Speaker 2>that lurks in the unknown as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a devouring predator.</v>

545
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:39.150
<v Speaker 2>We also conceptualize it as something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that offers possibility it because we've</v>

546
00:31:39.181 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 2>learned that if we go into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can find things that we need for,</v>

547
00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:48.100
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for now and for the medium and for the </v>

548
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.041
<v Speaker 2>long term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be beneficial for us to confront </v>

549
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.070
<v Speaker 2>the things that we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's human beings.</v>

550
00:31:51.071 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 2>In a nutshell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do,</v>

551
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.330
<v Speaker 2>and so that's the basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

552
00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.360
<v Speaker 2>that's why I believe that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal story because it </v>

553
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.051
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally characterizes our motive </v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the world where information </v>

554
00:32:04.051 --> 00:32:04.810
<v Speaker 2>foragers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd go out into the unknown,</v>

555
00:32:04.811 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 2>that terrifying unknown and we gather </v>
<v Speaker 2>things of value.</v>

556
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not much different than squirrels </v>
<v Speaker 2>foraging for nuts really,</v>

557
00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:12.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

558
00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:17.860
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we use the exactly the same </v>

559
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.310
<v Speaker 2>biological systems to go out and forage </v>
<v Speaker 2>for information that squirrels use when </v>

560
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:25.171
<v Speaker 2>they go out and forage for nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess the system developed in part </v>

561
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.290
<v Speaker 2>because we were fruit eaters as well and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we found trees that had fruit in them</v>

562
00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 2>and learn where they were and how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>gather them.</v>

563
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 2>And then you see a tight relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>there between and food,</v>

564
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:45.850
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no difference between </v>

565
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:45.850
<v Speaker 1>eating and knowing where the food is and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the.</v>

566
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:50.841
<v Speaker 1>So our systems of knowing where things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are grew massively and so that turned us</v>

567
00:32:51.051 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>into the kind of abstract creatures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are.</v>

568
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.770
<v Speaker 1>So we're always looking for ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing more of what we need.</v>

569
00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we do that abstractly,</v>

570
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:06.430
<v Speaker 1>so alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you encounter something that's </v>

571
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.150
<v Speaker 1>anomalous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something unexpected,</v>

572
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:13.750
<v Speaker 1>so oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a relationship that you're not</v>

573
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:16.070
<v Speaker 1>that happy about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good example,</v>

574
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 1>and the person that you're with is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly much colder to you than usual.</v>

575
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>

576
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.730
<v Speaker 1>is that good news or bad news?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

577
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:30.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good news in so far as you're not </v>

578
00:33:30.731 --> 00:33:30.731
<v Speaker 1>that happy with the relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's.</v>

579
00:33:30.731 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's bad news in so far as you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship to continue and so very</v>

580
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:37.700
<v Speaker 1>frequently it's the case that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat ambivalent about the frame that</v>

581
00:33:37.701 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 1>you inhabit.</v>

582
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.510
<v Speaker 1>And so anomalous information has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>twofold meaning.</v>

583
00:33:41.511 --> 00:33:42.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

584
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.240
<v Speaker 1>now I can finally get out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

585
00:33:45.241 --> 00:33:50.241
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the person is particularly cold </v>

586
00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:50.241
<v Speaker 1>and distant to you and maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulting,</v>

587
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:55.570
<v Speaker 1>then half of you is going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset because this is happening and the </v>

588
00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:56.690
<v Speaker 1>other half is roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be saying,</v>

589
00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:58.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just the opportunity I wanted.</v>

590
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is you're in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame.</v>

591
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.880
<v Speaker 1>That constitutes the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say in the story you've laid out </v>

592
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.781
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that novel event occurs and it produces </v>

593
00:34:10.781 --> 00:34:14.270
<v Speaker 1>activation in two competing systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the positive system that explores</v>

594
00:34:14.271 --> 00:34:19.271
<v Speaker 1>for new opportunities and the other is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the threat system that paralyzes you </v>

595
00:34:19.271 --> 00:34:23.180
<v Speaker 1>because your current mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization is no longer valid and</v>

596
00:34:23.181 --> 00:34:28.181
<v Speaker 1>so it normally has this deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambivalent nature and one of the things </v>

597
00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:33.641
<v Speaker 1>that I've tried to understand for a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is how you compute that and it </v>

598
00:34:33.641 --> 00:34:37.151
<v Speaker 1>seems to be that you need to consider it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to this hierarchical </v>

599
00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:39.710
<v Speaker 1>value structure that we've talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

600
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:44.710
<v Speaker 1>So you might say that imagine your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system is tuned so that if </v>

601
00:34:45.201 --> 00:34:48.620
<v Speaker 1>anomalous things happen at high </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution levels,</v>

602
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you produce a very small amount of </v>

603
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion and a comparatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>large amount of curiosity.</v>

604
00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened by the anomalous event isn't </v>

605
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.360
<v Speaker 1>that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the.</v>

606
00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.980
<v Speaker 1>The possibility that information looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

607
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.870
<v Speaker 1>That might be useful as high compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the threat.</v>

608
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Whereas generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter something,</v>

609
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you go into a store one day and on</v>

610
00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:19.760
<v Speaker 1>a whim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shoplift something.</v>

611
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:23.650
<v Speaker 1>In a fit of stupid impulsivity and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get caught at,</v>

612
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.390
<v Speaker 1>happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

613
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:29.650
<v Speaker 1>there was an NDP member of parliament 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago who did exactly that.</v>

614
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:33.260
<v Speaker 1>He only had a pretty good reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went into a department store,</v>

615
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:35.360
<v Speaker 1>swiped something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some gloves or something.</v>

616
00:35:35.361 --> 00:35:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember what it was and </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught.</v>

617
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

618
00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sufficiently anomalous behavior </v>

619
00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.030
<v Speaker 1>to or occurrence to make you question </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're actually a good </v>

620
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.050
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

621
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.940
<v Speaker 1>it's almost as if at the higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution levels of the value structure</v>

622
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:55.941
<v Speaker 1>of something anomalous occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's either neutral or tilted </v>

623
00:35:55.941 --> 00:35:59.901
<v Speaker 1>slightly towards positive and at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher levels and the more abstract and </v>

624
00:35:59.901 --> 00:36:01.470
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive levers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If something anomalous happens,</v>

625
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:06.670
<v Speaker 1>then it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more likely to blow out large </v>

626
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.171
<v Speaker 1>portions of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the systems you use to organize the </v>

627
00:36:09.171 --> 00:36:12.681
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be experienced as </v>

628
00:36:12.681 --> 00:36:12.681
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly what you're trying to do when</v>

629
00:36:12.681 --> 00:36:16.281
<v Speaker 1>something anomalous occurs is to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>search up and down this value of </v>

630
00:36:16.281 --> 00:36:19.431
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an argument with someone that </v>

631
00:36:19.431 --> 00:36:19.431
<v Speaker 1>you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

632
00:36:19.431 --> 00:36:22.491
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're arguing about how you </v>

633
00:36:22.491 --> 00:36:23.520
<v Speaker 1>interact with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When one of you comes home,</v>

634
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:28.730
<v Speaker 1>you'd like a kiss and a hug at the door </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've just assumed sit there and </v>

635
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.330
<v Speaker 1>watch tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have an argument about that.</v>

636
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the argument mean?</v>

637
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Does it mean that some little thing has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be adjusted at the level of micro </v>

638
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:40.701
<v Speaker 1>detail or does it mean you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that you've tangled up your life </v>

639
00:36:40.701 --> 00:36:45.021
<v Speaker 1>with really doesn't care for you at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a complete jerk and you </v>

640
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:47.901
<v Speaker 1>should leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While a big part of the argument is </v>

641
00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:48.270
<v Speaker 1>going to be how do we construe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurrence?</v>

642
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.500
<v Speaker 1>How do we construe the occurrence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a major event or a minor event?</v>

643
00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:57.890
<v Speaker 1>And my advice would be unless there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong reason,</v>

644
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:03.980
<v Speaker 1>presume it's a minor event and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating at that level because </v>

645
00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.690
<v Speaker 1>otherwise every argument becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe and if that's the case,</v>

646
00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you actually can't solve any problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to discuss anything.</v>

647
00:37:09.751 --> 00:37:14.751
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you bring up an </v>

648
00:37:14.751 --> 00:37:14.751
<v Speaker 1>anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something unpleasant,</v>

649
00:37:14.751 --> 00:37:18.530
<v Speaker 1>the other person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll assume that everything's over and </v>

650
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:19.920
<v Speaker 1>get so shorted out that you won't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to talk with them.</v>

651
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:24.120
<v Speaker 1>So those are the sort of people who will</v>
<v Speaker 1>cry if you bring up anything negative.</v>

652
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

653
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:30.470
<v Speaker 1>they're threatened by their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their value might say their value </v>

654
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.470
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fragile,</v>

655
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.360
<v Speaker 1>highly constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they're not standing on enough</v>

656
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.970
<v Speaker 1>pillars so that anything you tossed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

657
00:37:35.971 --> 00:37:40.971
<v Speaker 1>that's a question is enough to shake the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire structure to its foundations or </v>

658
00:37:40.971 --> 00:37:42.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're acting that out just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate you.</v>

659
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:45.000
<v Speaker 1>That's another option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in many ways,</v>

660
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:50.001
<v Speaker 1>partly what you seem to be doing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about something is to </v>

661
00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:54.890
<v Speaker 1>shift your frames of reference up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>down your value hierarchy to constrain </v>

662
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:59.451
<v Speaker 1>the occurrence and to determine the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree to which it's positive and the </v>

663
00:37:59.451 --> 00:38:03.621
<v Speaker 1>degree to which it's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also complicated too because </v>

664
00:38:03.621 --> 00:38:07.490
<v Speaker 1>whether something is positive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative depends on the frame of </v>

665
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.710
<v Speaker 1>reference that you bring to bear on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

666
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why I was saying earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the relationship.</v>

667
00:38:10.351 --> 00:38:15.351
<v Speaker 1>If you're ambivalent about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and something negative </v>

668
00:38:15.351 --> 00:38:15.351
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know something disruptive,</v>

669
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:20.570
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly possible to adopt a frame</v>
<v Speaker 1>of reference almost immediately that </v>

670
00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:21.180
<v Speaker 1>makes that into something positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

671
00:38:21.181 --> 00:38:22.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm was done with this anyways.</v>

672
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you said that because it gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>me the excuse I needed to terminate </v>

673
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.760
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's such a.</v>

674
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:33.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange thing that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift the emotional valence of almost </v>

675
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.890
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost anything.</v>

676
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 1>By shifting your frame</v>

677
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 2>of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are boundaries.</v>

678
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.840
<v Speaker 2>You can teach animals pleasure to </v>
<v Speaker 2>electric shocks,</v>

679
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.780
<v Speaker 2>painful electric shocks if you pair them</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliably,</v>

680
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.050
<v Speaker 2>lead with the provision of something </v>
<v Speaker 2>intensely rewarding cocaine,</v>

681
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:52.960
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or or hypothalamic stimulation,</v>

682
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:57.640
<v Speaker 2>they can learn to associate pain with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something good and respond positively to</v>

683
00:38:57.641 --> 00:39:02.641
<v Speaker 2>it to work for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you see this in you even a </v>

684
00:39:02.641 --> 00:39:02.800
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of you have no doubt.</v>

685
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Learn to eat foods that aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>edible like all of us are a good example</v>

686
00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or coffee.</v>

687
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.740
<v Speaker 2>They're bitter and generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

688
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Poisonous things tend to be bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't really like bitter things,</v>

689
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.990
<v Speaker 2>but if you train yourself you can get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point where I,</v>

690
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 2>I taught my daughter how to eat olives </v>
<v Speaker 2>when she was very young and I,</v>

691
00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I bet her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

692
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.020
<v Speaker 2>I think she was only three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better that she couldn't eat 20 all of</v>

693
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.260
<v Speaker 2>over the next week or something.</v>

694
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.200
<v Speaker 2>She'd always respond to a challenge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

695
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:33.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first three olives,</v>

696
00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:38.491
<v Speaker 2>it was not a fun experience for her </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it faced a kids have a lot of </v>

697
00:39:38.491 --> 00:39:42.091
<v Speaker 2>taste buds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her face would get all crinkled up and </v>

698
00:39:42.091 --> 00:39:43.570
<v Speaker 2>she just wasn't enjoying it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I paid for that desperately later in</v>

699
00:39:43.571 --> 00:39:48.571
<v Speaker 2>my life because I used to go to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialty shop and buy these </v>

700
00:39:48.571 --> 00:39:48.630
<v Speaker 2>particularly good spicy olives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

701
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:53.850
<v Speaker 2>by the court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they were in the fridge she'd </v>

702
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:53.850
<v Speaker 2>come home and just devoured the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>court.</v>

703
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

704
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a mad believe mic.</v>

705
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean on all of us for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then I never got any of them so </v>

706
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:02.520
<v Speaker 2>it serves me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

707
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.260
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is you can rewire yourself</v>

708
00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:09.580
<v Speaker 2>quite completely by placing negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>things in a positive context.</v>

709
00:40:09.581 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 2>And the degree to which you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is quite remarkable.</v>

710
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:13.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

711
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.680
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be limits beyond which </v>

712
00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.120
<v Speaker 2>your ability to turn pain into pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

713
00:40:19.121 --> 00:40:20.550
<v Speaker 2>is compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

714
00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody's ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to associate being seriously </v>

715
00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.220
<v Speaker 2>burnt by something hot with something </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasurable,</v>

716
00:40:27.221 --> 00:40:27.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

717
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:33.040
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know how the system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly adjust themselves so that there </v>

718
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.390
<v Speaker 2>are limits to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

719
00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:38.580
<v Speaker 2>how you can transform an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulus because you can transform them </v>

720
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.301
<v Speaker 2>quite quite remarkably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But obviously there's some boundaries </v>

721
00:40:42.301 --> 00:40:43.030
<v Speaker 2>that we don't understand very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

722
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so no.</v>

723
00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:50.011
<v Speaker 2>So roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could say that the degree to which </v>

724
00:40:50.011 --> 00:40:53.101
<v Speaker 2>something is experienced as utter chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>is proportionate to the level of the </v>

725
00:40:54.611 --> 00:40:59.611
<v Speaker 2>value hierarchy that that anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 2>event is construed or experience to </v>

726
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:04.621
<v Speaker 2>disrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you really see this happening and </v>

727
00:41:04.621 --> 00:41:05.650
<v Speaker 2>people who are depressed because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might think,</v>

728
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.740
<v Speaker 2>here's another way of thinking about it.</v>

729
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:08.800
<v Speaker 2>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

730
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I a good cook?</v>

731
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 2>You're asking yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fail.</v>

732
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:14.110
<v Speaker 2>At cooking something so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

733
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.470
<v Speaker 2>am I capable of completing a meal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

734
00:41:17.471 --> 00:41:21.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if if all you've done is a set the table</v>

735
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:26.251
<v Speaker 2>badly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the right thing to do is to </v>

736
00:41:26.251 --> 00:41:29.161
<v Speaker 2>learn how to set the table and not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>question your ability to complete a </v>

737
00:41:29.161 --> 00:41:30.820
<v Speaker 2>meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might say,</v>

738
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:35.821
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well when should you move up one level </v>

739
00:41:35.821 --> 00:41:35.821
<v Speaker 2>competence of one level of abstraction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might say,</v>

740
00:41:35.821 --> 00:41:39.350
<v Speaker 2>well imagine there's five things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to do at this level in order to</v>

741
00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:43.160
<v Speaker 2>successfully complete that level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to cut vegetables,</v>

742
00:41:43.161 --> 00:41:48.161
<v Speaker 2>you have to set the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do the dishes in order to </v>

743
00:41:48.161 --> 00:41:48.950
<v Speaker 2>complete a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you break six dishes,</v>

744
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you burn the soup and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you sat the table property.</v>

745
00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.170
<v Speaker 2>You got two out of three wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe at that point it started.</v>

746
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 2>It's time to start wondering if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually capable of completing a meal,</v>

747
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:09.370
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to jump from a single</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake at the higher level to the to </v>

748
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:11.760
<v Speaker 2>the or at the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

749
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:16.780
<v Speaker 2>At the higher resolution level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to jump from a single </v>

750
00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.591
<v Speaker 2>mistake at that level to the next level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that you'll </v>

751
00:42:20.591 --> 00:42:20.591
<v Speaker 2>get a cascade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

752
00:42:20.591 --> 00:42:25.511
<v Speaker 2>I set the table badly error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means I can't complete a meal </v>

753
00:42:25.511 --> 00:42:29.890
<v Speaker 2>error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means I can't take care of my </v>

754
00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 2>family error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means I'm not a good parent error.</v>

755
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:35.560
<v Speaker 2>That means I'm not a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens to depressed people </v>

756
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.790
<v Speaker 2>and I think what happens is their </v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonin levels fall right fall like,</v>

757
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:45.610
<v Speaker 2>like serotonin levels fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're brought down a dominance </v>

758
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.851
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we already know that if you live at </v>

759
00:42:48.851 --> 00:42:50.861
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live where it's dangerous and the </v>

760
00:42:50.861 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 2>reason for that is everything around you</v>
<v Speaker 2>is already not good and you don't have a</v>

761
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:58.391
<v Speaker 2>lot of social support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're sort of clinging desperately </v>

762
00:42:58.391 --> 00:43:01.420
<v Speaker 2>to the underside of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that means is you probably </v>

763
00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:01.420
<v Speaker 2>can't even afford a single mistake.</v>

764
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Your serotonin levels fall and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows error signals to propagate up the</v>

765
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 2>value system so that every little thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a catastrophe.</v>

766
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Now that in itself is a catastrophe </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you're living at the bottom </v>

767
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 2>of the dominance hierarchy and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>already super stressed,</v>

768
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:22.690
<v Speaker 2>the additional stress that you're likely</v>
<v Speaker 2>to experience as a consequence of an </v>

769
00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 2>additional error is going to be maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>push you over the limits,</v>

770
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is is that it is dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

771
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what seems to happen to people who are </v>

772
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.111
<v Speaker 2>depressed is that their serotonin levels</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall roughly speaking as if they </v>

773
00:43:35.151 --> 00:43:38.930
<v Speaker 2>plummeted down a dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>without have actually having plumbing to</v>

774
00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:42.800
<v Speaker 2>download it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're still competent,</v>

775
00:43:42.801 --> 00:43:44.600
<v Speaker 2>capable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ensconced in their,</v>

776
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.910
<v Speaker 2>in their relatively productive </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>

777
00:43:46.911 --> 00:43:50.630
<v Speaker 2>but they're reacting as if every little </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing has become a catastrophe.</v>

778
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:56.020
<v Speaker 2>And so partly what happens is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>provide people with Serotonin reuptake </v>

779
00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.951
<v Speaker 2>inhibitors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the propagation of negative </v>

780
00:43:59.951 --> 00:44:02.951
<v Speaker 2>emotion across these levels of value </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy seems to be reduced.</v>

781
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:08.020
<v Speaker 2>So maybe then it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it takes two errors at this level to </v>

782
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.741
<v Speaker 2>trigger off an error message at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>level while you're in a lot better </v>

783
00:44:11.741 --> 00:44:11.741
<v Speaker 2>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

784
00:44:11.741 --> 00:44:12.920
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a definition of resilience.</v>

785
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:17.270
<v Speaker 2>So now you can also do that with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitively to some degree.</v>

786
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:22.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because maybe somebody will come to you </v>

787
00:44:22.271 --> 00:44:23.270
<v Speaker 2>in therapy and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a bad day at work,</v>

788
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.210
<v Speaker 2>my boss hates me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lose my job,</v>

789
00:44:26.211 --> 00:44:27.890
<v Speaker 2>and then my marriage is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissolve,</v>

790
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 2>and so you walk them through it at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>micro level.</v>

791
00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly happened to you at work and</v>

792
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 2>then they lay out the specific story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

793
00:44:36.631 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the multiple ways that might be</v>

794
00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:43.641
<v Speaker 2>interpreted and is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there some possibility that it's not </v>

795
00:44:43.641 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 2>the catastrophe that you're envisioning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

796
00:44:44.761 --> 00:44:49.680
<v Speaker 2>You get them to contextualize it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>help them build out up micro defenses.</v>

797
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 2>That might be one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

798
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.420
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people who are prone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression are not good at defending </v>

799
00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:56.420
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

800
00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:00.771
<v Speaker 2>They don't have at hand the mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>to forgive themselves or even really to </v>

801
00:45:00.771 --> 00:45:03.660
<v Speaker 2>understand their own failure or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>more importantly sometimes</v>

802
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.420
<v Speaker 2>they unwrap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely underestimate.</v>

803
00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:12.570
<v Speaker 2>They radically overestimate their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>incompetence and radically overestimate </v>

804
00:45:12.581 --> 00:45:17.581
<v Speaker 2>the competence of everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's also another reason why </v>

805
00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:20.260
<v Speaker 2>it's sometimes useful for people to seek</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy because they'll come in and say,</v>

806
00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:25.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm anxious and nervous and you know I </v>

807
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:26.590
<v Speaker 2>have this amount of negative emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make these sorts of mistakes,</v>

808
00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.650
<v Speaker 2>and you listen and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

809
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:33.760
<v Speaker 2>so does everybody else that that's par </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the course,</v>

810
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Speaker 2>but there are so isolated and so afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that have been happening </v>

811
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:43.081
<v Speaker 2>to them and so unwilling to expose </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to social evaluation that </v>

812
00:45:43.081 --> 00:45:47.701
<v Speaker 2>they never really communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone else and find out that the level </v>

813
00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:52.441
<v Speaker 2>of misery that characterized as their </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence is pretty much normal and </v>

814
00:45:52.441 --> 00:45:56.431
<v Speaker 2>average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so just helping people learn that </v>

815
00:45:56.431 --> 00:45:59.740
<v Speaker 2>can often be of tremendous advantage to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the because the real issue isn't </v>

816
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:02.410
<v Speaker 2>precisely whether or not you're a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

817
00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.020
<v Speaker 2>That's an absolute idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

818
00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:05.740
<v Speaker 2>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

819
00:46:05.741 --> 00:46:08.230
<v Speaker 2>are you good person compared to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute ideal?</v>

820
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:11.950
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also not exactly.</v>

821
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not a useful comparison across most</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

822
00:46:15.581 --> 00:46:17.290
<v Speaker 2>What you really want to know is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

823
00:46:17.291 --> 00:46:19.750
<v Speaker 2>how do you stack up against other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

824
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a.</v>

825
00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 2>If you're at your job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue isn't whether or not you're </v>

826
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.731
<v Speaker 2>competent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue is whether you're competent </v>

827
00:46:29.731 --> 00:46:32.550
<v Speaker 2>compared to the other people around you </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are supposed to be doing the same </v>

828
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.180
<v Speaker 2>thing because in an absolute sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're completely incompetent,</v>

829
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:39.660
<v Speaker 2>but in a relative sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be at the top of the pack or </v>

830
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:39.660
<v Speaker 2>even in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's generally okay.</v>

831
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:45.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't know what the relative </v>

832
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:45.090
<v Speaker 2>status is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good at all.</v>

833
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:49.380
<v Speaker 2>So alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now if so,</v>

834
00:46:51.311 --> 00:46:53.860
<v Speaker 2>here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say</v>

835
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.070
<v Speaker 2>you're in a class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's near the beginning of the semester.</v>

836
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:07.280
<v Speaker 2>You write an exam or you handed in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>essay and you don't get the mark that </v>

837
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:07.280
<v Speaker 2>you desired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

838
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.110
<v Speaker 2>So what are your options?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

839
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:10.290
<v Speaker 2>one option would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've hit an anomaly.</v>

840
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Things didn't happen the way you wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to happen,</v>

841
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:14.850
<v Speaker 2>and so maybe you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>

842
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.860
<v Speaker 2>that was a boring and stupid class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

843
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:22.010
<v Speaker 2>this gives me an excuse to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's not such a negative thing </v>

844
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:25.790
<v Speaker 2>or you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well I really better buckle down and </v>

845
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:26.040
<v Speaker 2>study and you decide to stay in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

846
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.830
<v Speaker 2>So basically what you've done is </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintained your framework.</v>

847
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work through this class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

848
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.240
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've decided to modify some of the sub</v>

849
00:47:34.241 --> 00:47:37.150
<v Speaker 2>routines that make up that frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

850
00:47:37.151 --> 00:47:42.151
<v Speaker 2>well I should study more next time or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to prioritize this class compared </v>

851
00:47:42.151 --> 00:47:45.781
<v Speaker 2>to other classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a micro alteration within the </v>

852
00:47:45.781 --> 00:47:48.780
<v Speaker 2>overarching framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But another thing you can do is say to </v>

853
00:47:49.481 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 2>hell with the class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just won't,</v>

854
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:51.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll just drop it.</v>

855
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.970
<v Speaker 2>And so the advantage to that is problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

856
00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:02.180
<v Speaker 2>The disadvantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now you have a different problem </v>

857
00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:02.180
<v Speaker 2>which is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

858
00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:06.351
<v Speaker 2>you drop the class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have another class that you can </v>

859
00:48:06.351 --> 00:48:08.571
<v Speaker 2>replace it with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a good way of dealing with a </v>

860
00:48:08.571 --> 00:48:08.571
<v Speaker 2>micro failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

861
00:48:08.571 --> 00:48:13.161
<v Speaker 2>to move up a level of analysis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the whole frame because you </v>

862
00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:17.301
<v Speaker 2>could also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I should just drop out of </v>

863
00:48:17.301 --> 00:48:17.301
<v Speaker 2>university and maybe I should go hang </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

864
00:48:17.301 --> 00:48:17.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

865
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same line of logic,</v>

866
00:48:19.591 --> 00:48:23.670
<v Speaker 2>it's just taken up to a higher degree of</v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction and so generally speaking,</v>

867
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:29.060
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to solve a problem by </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving up a level in wiping out the </v>

868
00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.980
<v Speaker 2>frame within which the problem was </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>

869
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to do that carefully?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in principle,</v>

870
00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.260
<v Speaker 2>the frame that you were working within </v>
<v Speaker 2>had already,</v>

871
00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:40.050
<v Speaker 2>you'd already assigned value to it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked at it.</v>

872
00:48:40.051 --> 00:48:45.051
<v Speaker 2>You've already invested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big sacrifice to blow out the </v>

873
00:48:45.051 --> 00:48:45.300
<v Speaker 2>whole frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now sometimes you can do it.</v>

874
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.880
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is,</v>

875
00:48:47.881 --> 00:48:52.881
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the bad grade and you're upset </v>

876
00:48:52.881 --> 00:48:56.001
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you've been plunged from your </v>

877
00:48:56.001 --> 00:48:56.430
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>satiated state,</v>

878
00:48:56.431 --> 00:48:59.040
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a state of relative chaos,</v>

879
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.050
<v Speaker 2>and the chaos is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

880
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:06.590
<v Speaker 2>I hit an obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't expect it and now I don't know </v>

881
00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:09.651
<v Speaker 2>what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what does it mean to not know </v>

882
00:49:09.651 --> 00:49:09.651
<v Speaker 2>what to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

883
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:10.590
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

884
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:15.810
<v Speaker 2>it can mean I need to study harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can mean I should drop this course.</v>

885
00:49:16.361 --> 00:49:18.890
<v Speaker 2>It can mean I should major in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different subject.</v>

886
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe I shouldn't be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

887
00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.730
<v Speaker 2>It could mean maybe my future plans have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been formulated badly.</v>

888
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:29.731
<v Speaker 2>It can mean my future plans have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>formulated badly because I don't </v>

889
00:49:29.731 --> 00:49:31.870
<v Speaker 2>understand myself very well and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been telling lies about my past.</v>

890
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing can really expand on you and </v>

891
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.351
<v Speaker 2>that's what the chaotic domain is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real manifestation of those </v>

892
00:49:40.351 --> 00:49:41.650
<v Speaker 2>things that you had considered </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant,</v>

893
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when you go to pickup the exam,</v>

894
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.850
<v Speaker 2>you've got your identity as a competent </v>
<v Speaker 2>student intact.</v>

895
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:52.860
<v Speaker 2>You're not questioning whether you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be in the course or whether you </v>

896
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 2>should be in that major or whether you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be in university.</v>

897
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:59.010
<v Speaker 2>None of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all in the implicitly accepted </v>

898
00:49:59.010 --> 00:49:59.790
<v Speaker 2>category and as soon as the anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>

899
00:49:59.791 --> 00:50:03.160
<v Speaker 2>he merges all of those things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had rendered.</v>

900
00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Axiomatic start to become questionable </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's like the shark coming up out,</v>

901
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 2>coming up from the depths to pull you </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

902
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 2>And that's the classic way of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>representing that and symbolizing it.</v>

903
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.640
<v Speaker 2>That's Jonah and the whale for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's something is manifested itself </v>

904
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.280
<v Speaker 2>from the deep unknown and pulls you </v>
<v Speaker 2>under like an alligator at a,</v>

905
00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:29.340
<v Speaker 2>at a waterhole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I'm sure one of the sources </v>

906
00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:31.220
<v Speaker 2>from which we derived that particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of mythological representation,</v>

907
00:50:31.221 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 2>because you could imagine that when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were on the Velt,</v>

908
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:39.130
<v Speaker 2>after living on trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to go down to the dam waterholes </v>

909
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:40.310
<v Speaker 2>and you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've watched enough nature programs to</v>

910
00:50:40.311 --> 00:50:42.920
<v Speaker 2>know what a denial crocodile can do to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>water buffalo.</v>

911
00:50:42.921 --> 00:50:46.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to go down to the water,</v>

912
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 2>the chaotic water and the source of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>life as well,</v>

913
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:54.430
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to risk and encounter with the </v>

914
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.430
<v Speaker 2>terrible thing that lurks in the depths.</v>

915
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.300
<v Speaker 2>And so we use that as a central metaphor</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

916
00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.600
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for mapping those sorts of things that </v>

917
00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 2>have happened to us in a much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract space.</v>

918
00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.820
<v Speaker 2>And you know that because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you're going to do,</v>

919
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:08.190
<v Speaker 2>let's say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

920
00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:13.260
<v Speaker 2>the professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a professor obviously who gave </v>

921
00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.180
<v Speaker 2>you the bad grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

922
00:51:14.181 --> 00:51:19.181
<v Speaker 2>So one logical presupposition is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in some sense insufficient in </v>

923
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:25.061
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but another logical and instantaneous </v>

924
00:51:25.061 --> 00:51:29.891
<v Speaker 2>categorization is to throw that person </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the category of malevolent </v>

925
00:51:29.891 --> 00:51:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll do that by becoming upset and</v>

926
00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:35.840
<v Speaker 2>cursing the person in your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cursing is exactly right,</v>

927
00:51:35.841 --> 00:51:40.841
<v Speaker 2>and I can tell you why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know if I told you this or </v>

928
00:51:40.911 --> 00:51:43.250
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but primates of various sorts.</v>

929
00:51:43.251 --> 00:51:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Like vervet monkeys have Predator alarm </v>
<v Speaker 2>cries.</v>

930
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:51.800
<v Speaker 2>They have one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look across a vast array of </v>

931
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 2>predators are primates.</v>

932
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.740
<v Speaker 2>They have one for things that attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the sky.</v>

933
00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.040
<v Speaker 2>And so those would be predatory birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have one for like cats that </v>

934
00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:04.091
<v Speaker 2>climbing into the trees to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that means hit the hit the little </v>

935
00:52:04.091 --> 00:52:07.841
<v Speaker 2>branches because the cat can't be out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they have one for a things </v>

936
00:52:07.841 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 2>that Russell through the grass snakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

937
00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 2>And so each of those produces a </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinctive alarm cry.</v>

938
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:19.630
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the same alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That alarm Christ system is the same </v>

939
00:52:19.881 --> 00:52:24.881
<v Speaker 2>system that we use to swear with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>short got her old words.</v>

940
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:28.010
<v Speaker 2>So they're archaic words because short </v>
<v Speaker 2>words tend to be very,</v>

941
00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:33.011
<v Speaker 2>very old and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have a separate system that </v>

942
00:52:33.011 --> 00:52:36.970
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of vocalizations and that's </v>

943
00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:36.970
<v Speaker 2>the system that's disinhibited and two </v>
<v Speaker 2>reps,</v>

944
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:42.070
<v Speaker 2>which is why people with tourette swear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you curse the professor for </v>

945
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:45.020
<v Speaker 2>giving you the bad grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are using the same bloody linguistic</v>

946
00:52:45.021 --> 00:52:50.021
<v Speaker 2>system that your ancestors used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>categorize snakes in the grass or </v>

947
00:52:50.021 --> 00:52:51.680
<v Speaker 2>predators that sweep swooped down from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sky.</v>

948
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.540
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>

949
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.060
<v Speaker 2>So when people regard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite rude,</v>

950
00:52:56.061 --> 00:52:56.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

951
00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:00.860
<v Speaker 2>if you swear at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they'll be taken aback by that they</v>

952
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:04.370
<v Speaker 2>considered insulting to be thrown into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the arbitrary Predator category.</v>

953
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:08.840
<v Speaker 2>And so that also turns the world into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good versus evil story very rapidly with</v>

954
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:11.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the oppressive person who's judging</v>

955
00:53:11.331 --> 00:53:16.331
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the role of malevolent Predator </v>

956
00:53:16.331 --> 00:53:19.451
<v Speaker 2>and you playing the role of innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>innocent pray essentially very,</v>

957
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:23.450
<v Speaker 2>very easy for that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

958
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:27.870
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so where's my little clicker?</v>

959
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.400
<v Speaker 2>So if the anomaly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't can,</v>

960
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

961
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:43.311
<v Speaker 2>so you're thinking through the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get a good mark on the exam </v>

962
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:45.620
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

963
00:53:45.621 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I can do about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've already got six classes say</v>

964
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 2>or seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're overloaded,</v>

965
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:55.770
<v Speaker 2>you're working part time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're studying as hard as you can,</v>

966
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.870
<v Speaker 2>and so you try to do a micro</v>

967
00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:02.180
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rearranging your priorities,</v>

968
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:07.480
<v Speaker 2>concentrating more on your studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you're already operating at </v>

969
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.301
<v Speaker 2>top capacity and it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not straightforward for you to </v>

970
00:54:10.301 --> 00:54:14.471
<v Speaker 2>calculate how you might reconstruct your</v>
<v Speaker 2>micro priority so the problem goes away.</v>

971
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:20.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's under those circumstances that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonable to pop up one level of </v>

972
00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:20.120
<v Speaker 2>abstraction and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

973
00:54:20.121 --> 00:54:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I have to give something up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sacrificial motifs.</v>

974
00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I have to sacrifice something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it going to be?</v>

975
00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can't afford to have the part </v>

976
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:31.700
<v Speaker 2>time job even though that's going to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>you under financial stress.</v>

977
00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you have to hire a tutor even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though that's going to put you under </v>

978
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.001
<v Speaker 2>financial stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you have to drop out of the </v>

979
00:54:40.001 --> 00:54:42.611
<v Speaker 2>chorus and only takes six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though that's going to say delay </v>

980
00:54:42.611 --> 00:54:43.400
<v Speaker 2>your graduation for one semester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna.</v>

981
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:48.430
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be costs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so what's happening when you're </v>

982
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.900
<v Speaker 2>thrown into the chaotic state by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>anomaly is that the problem space,</v>

983
00:54:50.901 --> 00:54:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Matt magnifies itself and you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a microanalysis,</v>

984
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:56.750
<v Speaker 2>which is the best place to start.</v>

985
00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at fixing things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinate to this frame,</v>

986
00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:03.650
<v Speaker 2>but you may have to leap up a level or </v>
<v Speaker 2>two and fix something.</v>

987
00:55:03.651 --> 00:55:08.651
<v Speaker 2>It's Super Ordinance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it may be the case that you failed </v>

988
00:55:08.651 --> 00:55:11.561
<v Speaker 2>two classes and your parent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of your parents develops a very </v>

989
00:55:11.561 --> 00:55:12.290
<v Speaker 2>fatal disease and so you have to go home</v>
<v Speaker 2>and take care of them.</v>

990
00:55:12.291 --> 00:55:12.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

991
00:55:12.921 --> 00:55:14.480
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much chaos.</v>

992
00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done with your university career.</v>

993
00:55:16.611 --> 00:55:18.830
<v Speaker 2>For now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go up a number of levels,</v>

994
00:55:18.831 --> 00:55:23.030
<v Speaker 2>blow apart that frame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that'll alleviate the problem.</v>

995
00:55:23.031 --> 00:55:28.031
<v Speaker 2>Even though it by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by letting all the snakes out of the </v>

996
00:55:28.031 --> 00:55:28.280
<v Speaker 2>basket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it causes all sorts of other problems.</v>

997
00:55:28.281 --> 00:55:29.300
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

998
00:55:29.301 --> 00:55:32.720
<v Speaker 2>well what am I going to do instead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this mean for my future and so</v>

999
00:55:32.721 --> 00:55:34.730
<v Speaker 2>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a cost.</v>

1000
00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.610
<v Speaker 2>There's definite cost to moving up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction hierarchy,</v>

1001
00:55:37.611 --> 00:55:42.611
<v Speaker 2>but the reason that a sufficient to </v>
<v Speaker 2>normally put places you in chaos is </v>

1002
00:55:42.611 --> 00:55:47.501
<v Speaker 2>because it makes all sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've already considered alive </v>

1003
00:55:47.501 --> 00:55:50.560
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that can be extraordinarily chaotic </v>

1004
00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.550
<v Speaker 2>and so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anomaly knocks you flat.</v>

1005
00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:57.550
<v Speaker 2>You can sustain the frame anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You plunge into a chaotic state and you </v>

1006
00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:02.351
<v Speaker 2>know your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your whole life is a sequence of those </v>

1007
00:56:02.351 --> 00:56:02.840
<v Speaker 2>things at a micro level and at a macro </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

1008
00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:05.660
<v Speaker 2>you know every time you encounter </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you don't understand.</v>

1009
00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:11.000
<v Speaker 2>You have to retool the framework of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation that you were using prior</v>

1010
00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:16.001
<v Speaker 2>to encountering that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now sometimes it's just a small </v>

1011
00:56:16.001 --> 00:56:16.310
<v Speaker 2>modification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like at least in principle when you were</v>

1012
00:56:16.311 --> 00:56:21.311
<v Speaker 2>in a class and you're learning things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're undoing what you already knew and</v>

1013
00:56:21.981 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 2>reese and sewing back together </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly,</v>

1014
00:56:24.401 --> 00:56:28.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's at a small enough level so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it only feels exhilarating,</v>

1015
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:33.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're releasing just enough novelty to </v>

1016
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:37.740
<v Speaker 2>activate your exploratory systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's value in the </v>

1017
00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not enough to knock you flat and you</v>

1018
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:44.881
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's interesting </v>

1019
00:56:44.881 --> 00:56:46.471
<v Speaker 2>about the whole safe space phenomenon is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people differ in the thresh hold </v>

1020
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.800
<v Speaker 2>that they have with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>receipt of anomalous information.</v>

1021
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:52.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and if you're,</v>

1022
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:57.330
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a naive person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sheltered person to be exposed to </v>

1023
00:56:57.330 --> 00:57:01.291
<v Speaker 2>anything that has a hint of real </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolence in it might be enough to </v>

1024
00:57:01.291 --> 00:57:04.291
<v Speaker 2>destabilize you quite badly and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real problem if you're pursuing </v>

1025
00:57:04.291 --> 00:57:08.610
<v Speaker 2>education in history or literature </v>
<v Speaker 2>because history and literature is </v>

1026
00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:12.241
<v Speaker 2>nothing but a sequence of absolute moral</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophes thrown at you one after the</v>

1027
00:57:12.551 --> 00:57:17.551
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to be pretty solid to be </v>

1028
00:57:17.551 --> 00:57:17.551
<v Speaker 2>able to withstand that.</v>

1029
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.760
<v Speaker 2>So you collapsed from your stable state </v>
<v Speaker 2>into an unstable state and that's where </v>

1030
00:57:28.891 --> 00:57:33.891
<v Speaker 2>everything comes up to haunt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it can really be bad in a chaotic </v>

1031
00:57:33.891 --> 00:57:37.620
<v Speaker 2>state because this often also happens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are depressed,</v>

1032
00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:40.800
<v Speaker 2>but it can happen to people under normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances too.</v>

1033
00:57:40.801 --> 00:57:42.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1034
00:57:42.301 --> 00:57:46.290
<v Speaker 2>let's say you've been happily married or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you were happily married,</v>

1035
00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:49.350
<v Speaker 2>and then one day you come home and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner is gone.</v>

1036
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Well then what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1037
00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:58.120
<v Speaker 2>you think mlevel and Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing you think useless.</v>

1038
00:57:58.161 --> 00:58:00.080
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>

1039
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:00.890
<v Speaker 2>You think</v>

1040
00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.760
<v Speaker 2>the past is unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president is unstable and the future</v>

1041
00:58:05.761 --> 00:58:07.710
<v Speaker 2>is unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing,</v>

1042
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.540
<v Speaker 2>but then things can really get out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

1043
00:58:09.541 --> 00:58:11.370
<v Speaker 2>So then you're just in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1044
00:58:11.371 --> 00:58:16.371
<v Speaker 2>but then you start thinking at 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning about all the stupid </v>

1045
00:58:16.371 --> 00:58:19.260
<v Speaker 2>things you've done in your life that led</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to this point and that can just take</v>

1046
00:58:19.261 --> 00:58:24.261
<v Speaker 2>you completely apart because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go back over your past </v>

1047
00:58:24.261 --> 00:58:24.261
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1048
00:58:24.261 --> 00:58:29.060
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for you to remember because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do remember these things where </v>

1049
00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:29.610
<v Speaker 2>you made errors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1050
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:34.880
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you're not torturing yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>to begin with about the specific errors </v>

1051
00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.990
<v Speaker 2>that you made in that relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although you probably will,</v>

1052
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:38.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll think,</v>

1053
00:58:38.191 --> 00:58:39.150
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1054
00:58:39.151 --> 00:58:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I kind of knew this was coming and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind will say,</v>

1055
00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:47.151
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of knew when it started and </v>

1056
00:58:47.151 --> 00:58:47.151
<v Speaker 2>then it'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1057
00:58:47.151 --> 00:58:48.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe you should have done this back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then and you actually knew it and you'll</v>

1058
00:58:48.541 --> 00:58:48.950
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1059
00:58:48.951 --> 00:58:50.790
<v Speaker 2>I actually did know it and I didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1060
00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:55.790
<v Speaker 2>And then that'll trigger off a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>host of other memories about just </v>

1061
00:58:55.790 --> 00:58:58.950
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you knew and didn't act on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that'll trigger off a bunch of other</v>

1062
00:58:58.951 --> 00:59:03.030
<v Speaker 2>memories about stupid things that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>made and mistakes that you've hidden and</v>

1063
00:59:03.031 --> 00:59:08.031
<v Speaker 2>make you question just exactly what sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of creature you are and why all your,</v>

1064
00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:12.870
<v Speaker 2>how all your moral insufficiencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined by yourself have led you to this</v>

1065
00:59:12.871 --> 00:59:17.871
<v Speaker 2>dismal state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's very little difference </v>

1066
00:59:17.871 --> 00:59:20.151
<v Speaker 2>between that and hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a mythology of the </v>

1067
00:59:20.151 --> 00:59:20.151
<v Speaker 2>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1068
00:59:20.151 --> 00:59:24.411
<v Speaker 2>The underworld is partly a place of and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a place where people go when </v>

1069
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:29.051
<v Speaker 2>things fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But part of that is there's a </v>

1070
00:59:29.051 --> 00:59:31.331
<v Speaker 2>subdivision in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tail and that subdivision is the </v>

1071
00:59:31.331 --> 00:59:34.781
<v Speaker 2>place that you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you take yourself apart because of </v>

1072
00:59:34.781 --> 00:59:34.781
<v Speaker 2>your recognition of your own moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>failings,</v>

1073
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 2>now that can be useful because maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some things to learn and likely you</v>

1074
00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:44.261
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can also be something that's so </v>

1075
00:59:44.261 --> 00:59:46.100
<v Speaker 2>devastating that you just can't recover </v>
<v Speaker 2>from so because you may conclude,</v>

1076
00:59:46.101 --> 00:59:51.101
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason my relationship collapsed </v>

1077
00:59:51.101 --> 00:59:54.610
<v Speaker 2>precipitously is because I'm so blind in</v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolent that there's absolutely no </v>

1078
00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:59.141
<v Speaker 2>hope for my recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know sometimes that's actually </v>

1079
00:59:59.141 --> 01:00:01.010
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so distinguishing you never know,</v>

1080
01:00:01.011 --> 01:00:01.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1081
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Is when things happen to you that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you want or expect.</v>

1082
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:08.330
<v Speaker 2>It's an open question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much you're responsible for it.</v>

1083
01:00:08.331 --> 01:00:13.331
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conscientious person under those </v>

1084
01:00:13.331 --> 01:00:13.400
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just take themselves apart because</v>

1085
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:17.930
<v Speaker 2>the conscientious person is liable to </v>
<v Speaker 2>presume that if something bad happens to</v>

1086
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:22.931
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because they did something wrong </v>

1087
01:00:22.931 --> 01:00:23.870
<v Speaker 2>and you can see that's useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something bad happened to you because</v>

1088
01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you did something wrong and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn what you did wrong and fix it,</v>

1089
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.930
<v Speaker 2>then the bad thing won't happen to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1090
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:32.390
<v Speaker 2>So Hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wonderful way of thinking,</v>

1091
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's very tricky because there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>random element to life and sometimes you</v>

1092
01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:42.971
<v Speaker 2>get knocked flat by circumstances that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really beyond any reasonable </v>

1093
01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 2>person's control and this happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people.</v>

1094
01:00:45.831 --> 01:00:48.650
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they get laid off on mass at work,</v>

1095
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you know their company starts to fail.</v>

1096
01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:53.990
<v Speaker 2>The thousand people are laid off sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrarily.</v>

1097
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Some of those people are truly </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious and conscientious even </v>

1098
01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:03.071
<v Speaker 2>though there is very little relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>between their work habits and the </v>

1099
01:01:03.071 --> 01:01:04.820
<v Speaker 2>consequences for their job can </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuity.</v>

1100
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:10.030
<v Speaker 2>They'll go home and brood about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take themselves apart and those are the </v>

1101
01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:13.511
<v Speaker 2>people who end up catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really depressed because they can't </v>

1102
01:01:13.511 --> 01:01:16.190
<v Speaker 2>stand not being in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're functional and productive.</v>

1103
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:19.340
<v Speaker 2>So nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1104
01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:19.940
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1105
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a cognitive response that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very useful,</v>

1106
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:28.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually only useful when it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you did that resulted in that end </v>

1107
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:33.130
<v Speaker 2>and not merely the blind random forces </v>
<v Speaker 2>of nature happening to focus on you.</v>

1108
01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.940
<v Speaker 2>And that's also a problematic issue too </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know there's actually some </v>

1109
01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:45.170
<v Speaker 2>relief and concluding that it's your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fault because the alternative is that it</v>

1110
01:01:45.171 --> 01:01:47.000
<v Speaker 2>just happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1111
01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.240
<v Speaker 2>And that means that there are whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>swaths of terrible things that might </v>

1112
01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.450
<v Speaker 2>happen to you that are completely beyond</v>
<v Speaker 2>your control.</v>

1113
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:58.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like deciding that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't at fault leaves you in leaves,</v>

1114
01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:00.350
<v Speaker 2>you sitting pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just says,</v>

1115
01:02:00.351 --> 01:02:05.351
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't brought to your knees </v>

1116
01:02:05.351 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 2>because of your own stupidity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolence.</v>

1117
01:02:05.661 --> 01:02:10.661
<v Speaker 2>Instead you were brought to your knees </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the absolute uncaring forces of </v>

1118
01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:11.480
<v Speaker 2>society and nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1119
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:15.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not much of a constellation.</v>

1120
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although sometimes it's exactly the </v>

1121
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:20.530
<v Speaker 2>right thing to conclude and</v>

1122
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:25.040
<v Speaker 1>it is part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think being mature to understand that </v>

1123
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.401
<v Speaker 1>you are prey to random forces and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be able to distinguish between </v>

1124
01:02:28.401 --> 01:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>when you're at fault from something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when something just happened to you.</v>

1125
01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:36.620
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say that the right rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thumb is to start with the assumption</v>

1126
01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:41.811
<v Speaker 1>that something just happened to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>only then start to investigate the </v>

1127
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:44.250
<v Speaker 1>degree to which you had something to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

1128
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Situational analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

1129
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>personal analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

1130
01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>it's safer because if you start with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first one,</v>

1131
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you'll take yourself apart morally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually.</v>

1132
01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1133
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.660
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very stressful.</v>

1134
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 1>You should leave that for emergencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

1135
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:08.850
<v Speaker 1>so down you are in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1136
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the classic human </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1137
01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:16.401
<v Speaker 1>That classic human story is I was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>from point a to point B and I wanted to </v>

1138
01:03:16.951 --> 01:03:18.600
<v Speaker 1>get to point b and here's how I did it.</v>

1139
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.600
<v Speaker 1>But then along the way something popped </v>
<v Speaker 1>up unexpectedly and stopped me and it </v>

1140
01:03:25.591 --> 01:03:27.000
<v Speaker 1>threw me for a loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1141
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:32.210
<v Speaker 1>everything fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another metaphorical way of </v>

1142
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:35.541
<v Speaker 1>representing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything fell apart and I didn't know </v>

1143
01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:35.541
<v Speaker 1>up from down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1144
01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I lost myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like I was wandering in a desert </v>

1145
01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:44.750
<v Speaker 1>and that it lasted for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a situation where people are </v>

1146
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:46.740
<v Speaker 1>also likely to turn into such things as </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and other drugs,</v>

1147
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:51.950
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular to being a good one because </v>

1148
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:53.550
<v Speaker 1>it suppresses anxiety and increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward,</v>

1149
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:58.970
<v Speaker 1>and so down there in a chaotic state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can medicate yourself and you'll be </v>

1150
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:59.970
<v Speaker 1>inclined to to you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1151
01:03:59.971 --> 01:04:01.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no hope for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1152
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any way out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While under those circumstances,</v>

1153
01:04:05.131 --> 01:04:08.670
<v Speaker 1>what else do you have to turn to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very.</v>

1154
01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.810
<v Speaker 1>That's to be in the belly of the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

1155
01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:16.380
<v Speaker 1>You Remember in the Pinocchio Story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where Japan Eto ended up,</v>

1156
01:04:16.381 --> 01:04:20.580
<v Speaker 1>and that was because he had severed his </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the exploratory hero.</v>

1157
01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:22.950
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was Pinocchio,</v>

1158
01:04:22.951 --> 01:04:27.951
<v Speaker 1>or lost the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could call that an involuntary </v>

1159
01:04:30.651 --> 01:04:33.740
<v Speaker 1>encountered with the dragon of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1160
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Really what it is is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's it's.</v>

1161
01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.860
<v Speaker 1>It's your home happy and the Predator </v>
<v Speaker 1>invades your layer.</v>

1162
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of</v>

1163
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.640
<v Speaker 1>the garden of Eden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1164
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:50.250
<v Speaker 1>it's the story of the garden of Eden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no place that's so safe that </v>

1165
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:50.670
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a snake in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1166
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the fundamental story of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even God himself can't define a space so</v>

1167
01:04:56.131 --> 01:04:59.970
<v Speaker 1>tightly and absolutely that a Predator </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

1168
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>The Predator of the unknown can't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself manifest within.</v>

1169
01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a book here a while back</v>

1170
01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.160
<v Speaker 1>on dragons was only a week or two ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found this book.</v>

1171
01:05:13.161 --> 01:05:16.470
<v Speaker 1>It was published in 2002 and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1172
01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>it's an book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's flawed,</v>

1173
01:05:18.251 --> 01:05:21.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interesting book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find the name of it for you,</v>

1174
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:26.670
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who wrote this book was very </v>

1175
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:30.721
<v Speaker 1>interested in the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of dragons can be found </v>

1176
01:05:30.721 --> 01:05:30.721
<v Speaker 1>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

1177
01:05:30.721 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>like no matter where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that representation seems to exist.</v>

1178
01:05:34.121 --> 01:05:37.090
<v Speaker 1>It's the wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the winged legged serpent,</v>

1179
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>and he was very interested in trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>puzzle out why and he had an interesting</v>

1180
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis and I do believe there's some</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth to it.</v>

1181
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>He said like in the case of the vervet </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>

1182
01:05:47.321 --> 01:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>that there were three class of predators</v>
<v Speaker 1>on tree dwelling primates,</v>

1183
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:56.310
<v Speaker 1>winged bodied like a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because cats in particular like to eat </v>

1184
01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:03.070
<v Speaker 1>tree dwelling primates and snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

1185
01:06:03.071 --> 01:06:06.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats,</v>

1186
01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:13.050
<v Speaker 1>birds of prey and predatory and snakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>are all different,</v>

1187
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.540
<v Speaker 1>but then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do you mean by different?</v>

1188
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because categories are constructed in </v>

1189
01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.150
<v Speaker 1>relationship to their functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

1190
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.600
<v Speaker 1>They're all the same if the categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that eat you if you're not </v>

1191
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.141
<v Speaker 1>careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's absolutely no reason for </v>

1192
01:06:31.141 --> 01:06:34.141
<v Speaker 1>human beings not to have produced a </v>
<v Speaker 1>category that's an exemplar of things </v>

1193
01:06:34.141 --> 01:06:38.440
<v Speaker 1>that eat you if you're not careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's an amalgam snake,</v>

1194
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.000
<v Speaker 1>predatory cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory bird,</v>

1195
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:46.690
<v Speaker 1>winged serpent with lakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1196
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And often it has claws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the clause on it,</v>

1197
01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:55.290
<v Speaker 1>on this one are like telethons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often like that in dragon </v>

1198
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.230
<v Speaker 1>representations or sometimes they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like the claws of predators,</v>

1199
01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:01.330
<v Speaker 1>but the talent representation is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

1200
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Often like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing has two legs,</v>

1201
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>like a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not always because sometimes dragons </v>

1202
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>don't have any legs at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>

1203
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.610
<v Speaker 1>They're mostly snakes with wings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they have four legs,</v>

1204
01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:18.090
<v Speaker 1>but they often also have two legs and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you need a representation of </v>

1205
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Predator.</v>

1206
01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:25.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a differentiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation precisely of type of </v>

1207
01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would come second.</v>

1208
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:27.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the kid who points out the cat</v>

1209
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.940
<v Speaker 1>little kid points at the cat walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the street says doggy.</v>

1210
01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a dog.</v>

1211
01:07:33.371 --> 01:07:33.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1212
01:07:33.941 --> 01:07:35.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>

1213
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.960
<v Speaker 1>The child's use of dog isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of dog.</v>

1214
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:45.990
<v Speaker 1>It's representation of four legged pedal</v>
<v Speaker 1>entity and cat is an exemplar of that </v>

1215
01:07:46.691 --> 01:07:51.691
<v Speaker 1>category and so his dog and so it bunny </v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbit for that matter and you might </v>

1216
01:07:51.691 --> 01:07:51.691
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1217
01:07:51.691 --> 01:07:55.420
<v Speaker 1>so that's the category of pet and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly reasonable category.</v>

1218
01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:58.200
<v Speaker 1>You could say you should differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into bunny rabbit,</v>

1219
01:07:58.210 --> 01:08:03.210
<v Speaker 1>dog and cat because there's important </v>
<v Speaker 1>information lost in the low </v>

1220
01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:07.591
<v Speaker 1>representation representation of pet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bloody useful information </v>

1221
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:12.751
<v Speaker 1>conserved now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the wall garden and the dragon</v>

1222
01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:18.241
<v Speaker 1>of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you something </v>

1223
01:08:18.241 --> 01:08:18.241
<v Speaker 1>interesting about genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the story in genesis.</v>

1224
01:08:18.241 --> 01:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>This took me like 30 years to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1225
01:08:19.281 --> 01:08:21.530
<v Speaker 1>I could not figure it out for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longest period of time.</v>

1226
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:27.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a segue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll give you an idea of how these </v>

1227
01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:27.260
<v Speaker 1>things operate across vast spans of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1228
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 1>so in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the garden of Eden,</v>

1229
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1230
01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>The primordial human beings and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a walled garden.</v>

1231
01:08:36.081 --> 01:08:38.600
<v Speaker 1>That's paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise means walled garden.</v>

1232
01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:43.601
<v Speaker 1>An Eden means well watered place and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea that the proper </v>

1233
01:08:43.601 --> 01:08:46.910
<v Speaker 1>habitat of human beings is an amalgam of</v>
<v Speaker 1>social structure and now and nature,</v>

1234
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly right because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we live in,</v>

1235
01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a.</v>

1236
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:54.680
<v Speaker 1>We never live in nature and we never </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in society.</v>

1237
01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.470
<v Speaker 1>We live in an amalgam of society and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

1238
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the human environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a walled garden.</v>

1239
01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:05.290
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's a productive well-watered </v>

1240
01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 1>place where we could thrive.</v>

1241
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:10.390
<v Speaker 1>It's safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's ruled over by a father figure </v>

1242
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:11.510
<v Speaker 1>in this particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this particular story,</v>

1243
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:14.690
<v Speaker 1>and that's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could think about that as the spirit</v>

1244
01:09:14.691 --> 01:09:19.691
<v Speaker 1>of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's at least one way of considering </v>

1245
01:09:19.691 --> 01:09:22.391
<v Speaker 1>it so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a snake in the garden and it's </v>

1246
01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:26.030
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbeknownst to God,</v>

1247
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:28.750
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he's.</v>

1248
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:33.790
<v Speaker 1>He knows everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I guess he probably knows about the </v>

1249
01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:35.981
<v Speaker 1>snake to and he tells Adam and Eve not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to interact with it and find and they </v>

1250
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:37.970
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the snake wakes them up,</v>

1251
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when they interact with the </v>

1252
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.591
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're given a fruit that opens their </v>

1253
01:09:44.591 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 1>eyes and makes them aware that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>naked and vulnerable and then dooms them</v>

1254
01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:49.130
<v Speaker 1>to work well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you the whole story much later</v>

1255
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:50.750
<v Speaker 1>in the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to give you an overview of it</v>

1256
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:55.751
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this really strange </v>

1257
01:09:55.751 --> 01:09:58.001
<v Speaker 1>idea that developed over the course of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of not only Christianity</v>

1258
01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:03.281
<v Speaker 1>but Judaism and and a number of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>religions that fed into the mainstream </v>

1259
01:10:03.281 --> 01:10:05.210
<v Speaker 1>of Christian ideas including </v>
<v Speaker 1>zoroastrianism.</v>

1260
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:10.660
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea that that emerged across</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very long period of time that the </v>

1261
01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.890
<v Speaker 1>snake in the garden was the same as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan.</v>

1262
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>The source of all evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as I've been trying to figure out </v>

1263
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:21.041
<v Speaker 1>for the longest period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why in the world the manifestation of </v>

1264
01:10:21.041 --> 01:10:22.700
<v Speaker 1>what's essentially a representation of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>predator.</v>

1265
01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:27.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's the snake and the snake is </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with trees.</v>

1266
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1267
01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.310
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that in all likelihood is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we dwelt in trees,</v>

1268
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and snakes like trees and they're around</v>

1269
01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:39.221
<v Speaker 1>trees and they can climb trees and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the snake was a typical Predator on </v>

1270
01:10:39.221 --> 01:10:40.310
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our ancient relatives,</v>

1271
01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:41.750
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's fine.</v>

1272
01:10:41.751 --> 01:10:44.570
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that that representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes perfect sense.</v>

1273
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.550
<v Speaker 1>There's predators that lurk in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden.</v>

1274
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if you interact with them,</v>

1275
01:10:48.921 --> 01:10:50.150
<v Speaker 1>they wake you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1276
01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:53.480
<v Speaker 1>they better wake you up because if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't wake you up when you interact with</v>

1277
01:10:53.481 --> 01:10:54.740
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get eaten.</v>

1278
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:58.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably just as well to wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though there's painful consequences</v>

1279
01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:02.850
<v Speaker 1>associated with becoming conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that manifests itself immediately in</v>

1280
01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.520
<v Speaker 1>the story of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1281
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:06.260
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Adam and eve,</v>

1282
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this weird association.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1283
01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it's very undeveloped in the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that,</v>

1284
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.940
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are part and parcel of this line of</v>

1285
01:11:14.941 --> 01:11:19.941
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more like a consequence of a </v>

1286
01:11:19.941 --> 01:11:20.130
<v Speaker 1>cloud of mythological stories that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded it.</v>

1287
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:25.460
<v Speaker 1>But the reason for that I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that imagine that what human beings </v>

1288
01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to puzzle out was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the Predator.</v>

1289
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on one level of analysis,</v>

1290
01:11:30.031 --> 01:11:33.240
<v Speaker 1>the Predator is the thing that slinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the ground and the threatens you,</v>

1291
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 1>and also it's the thing that's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortal enemy and that wakes you up.</v>

1292
01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:41.720
<v Speaker 1>But then that's one conceptualization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator and fair enough you can </v>

1293
01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>identify it and you can take </v>
<v Speaker 1>precautionary measures,</v>

1294
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:49.070
<v Speaker 1>but a better conceptualization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator might be where does it come </v>

1295
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.070
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>

1296
01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while there's a layer of snake </v>

1297
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.301
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if we want to get rid of the </v>

1298
01:11:57.301 --> 01:11:59.391
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be conceptualizing it as a </v>

1299
01:11:59.391 --> 01:12:02.301
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be conceptualizing it as one </v>

1300
01:12:02.301 --> 01:12:04.920
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of a layer of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we should do is go down,</v>

1301
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:07.950
<v Speaker 1>follow the damn snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it goes and find it's layer and</v>

1302
01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:10.410
<v Speaker 1>wipe out all of the snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1303
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a more abstract representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1304
01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:15.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not Predator anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the source of predation.</v>

1305
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to solve the Predator</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem permanently,</v>

1306
01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 1>you don't kill the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get rid of all the snakes.</v>

1307
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

1308
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:30.350
<v Speaker 1>So and people are pretty damn good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that's why you have stories of </v>

1309
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:33.980
<v Speaker 1>people like St Patrick who chased all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the snakes out of Ireland and all sorts </v>

1310
01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:37.260
<v Speaker 1>of saints were snake eradication saints </v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

1311
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of reasons for that.</v>

1312
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:40.350
<v Speaker 1>But then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1313
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:43.950
<v Speaker 1>well the worst Predator is the layer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>

1314
01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you might think,</v>

1315
01:12:45.151 --> 01:12:50.151
<v Speaker 1>well wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst Predator isn't the layer of </v>

1316
01:12:50.151 --> 01:12:52.731
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the worst Predator is the enemies </v>

1317
01:12:52.731 --> 01:12:53.490
<v Speaker 1>that come to attack us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are human enemies.</v>

1318
01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:56.490
<v Speaker 1>And so what we do is we defend ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the human enemies.</v>

1319
01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:59.270
<v Speaker 1>We put walls around our cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fortify our,</v>

1320
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.040
<v Speaker 1>our land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we defend ourselves against the evil</v>

1321
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:06.270
<v Speaker 1>that's lurking in other people's hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's like a higher order snake.</v>

1322
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And then we build these walls around us </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's inside gets larger and larger</v>

1323
01:13:11.581 --> 01:13:14.640
<v Speaker 1>and larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens is the snake start</v>

1324
01:13:14.641 --> 01:13:17.360
<v Speaker 1>popping up inside the cities because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1325
01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.960
<v Speaker 1>we pushed all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

1326
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:23.580
<v Speaker 1>we've protected ourselves from all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil that lurks outside,</v>

1327
01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:28.680
<v Speaker 1>but we've now created a space where that</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil can manifest itself inside.</v>

1328
01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:33.860
<v Speaker 1>So there's criminals inside the city and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people who want to bring you </v>

1329
01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:34.350
<v Speaker 1>down and there's malevolence within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

1330
01:13:34.351 --> 01:13:38.100
<v Speaker 1>not only outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then there's the problem of the snake</v>

1331
01:13:38.101 --> 01:13:41.910
<v Speaker 1>that's closer to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the ultimate problem,</v>

1332
01:13:41.911 --> 01:13:43.740
<v Speaker 1>which is the snake that lives in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>

1333
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:49.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that each individual's capacity for </v>

1334
01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:52.191
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then now that was conceptualized as </v>

1335
01:13:52.191 --> 01:13:52.191
<v Speaker 1>a transcendent spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1336
01:13:52.191 --> 01:13:56.640
<v Speaker 1>So that's the spirit of Satan who's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>WHO's the adversary of the hero,</v>

1337
01:13:57.150 --> 01:14:02.150
<v Speaker 1>the adversary of the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why there's an association </v>

1338
01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:05.391
<v Speaker 1>between the snake in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is great series of mythologies </v>

1339
01:14:05.391 --> 01:14:09.441
<v Speaker 1>about the existence of evil itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a consequence of our continued </v>

1340
01:14:09.441 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 1>capacity to abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started using the Predator detection</v>

1341
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.280
<v Speaker 2>system to detect snakes and maybe no </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory cats and maybe birds of prey </v>

1342
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.810
<v Speaker 2>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that didn't solve the bloody problem</v>

1343
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:25.260
<v Speaker 2>because just because you hid from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory bird today didn't mean the </v>

1344
01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.621
<v Speaker 2>bloody thing wasn't going to be back </v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow and tomorrow starts to matter </v>

1345
01:14:28.621 --> 01:14:29.950
<v Speaker 2>as you get smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then once you're on that pathway and</v>

1346
01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:33.250
<v Speaker 2>you starting to think about abstractly </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Predator,</v>

1347
01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.260
<v Speaker 2>the nature of what constitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator starts to become because you're</v>

1348
01:14:38.261 --> 01:14:40.810
<v Speaker 2>trying to solve that across all </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations similar,</v>

1349
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:47.250
<v Speaker 2>it starts to become very much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract and it ends up being something </v>

1350
01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:50.341
<v Speaker 2>like a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an eternal personality and in the </v>

1351
01:14:50.341 --> 01:14:52.300
<v Speaker 2>internal personality that has its effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>on everyone all the time.</v>

1352
01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:58.020
<v Speaker 2>So and it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting to see those ideas </v>

1353
01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.950
<v Speaker 2>because they basically evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People did not understand those ideas as</v>

1354
01:14:59.951 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 2>they produced them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1355
01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:06.301
<v Speaker 2>It was all put forward in a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological context and in a rich story</v>

1356
01:15:07.311 --> 01:15:10.630
<v Speaker 2>context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the stories were as conscious as the</v>

1357
01:15:10.631 --> 01:15:15.631
<v Speaker 2>information got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was never articulated past the level </v>

1358
01:15:15.631 --> 01:15:15.631
<v Speaker 2>of story.</v>

1359
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:19.440
<v Speaker 1>So remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely remarkable.</v>

1360
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take a break for 15 minutes.</v>

1361
01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

1362
01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:32.810
<v Speaker 1>So this I showed you this map before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to.</v>

1363
01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I produced this map because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to understand the </v>

1364
01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.160
<v Speaker 1>fundamental substructure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological world.</v>

1365
01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the right way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and I'm not claiming that this </v>

1366
01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:50.061
<v Speaker 1>is the only way it can be represented </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know full well that it can be </v>

1367
01:15:50.061 --> 01:15:51.690
<v Speaker 1>represented other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a pretty good schema.</v>

1368
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea it maps onto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1369
01:15:57.750 --> 01:16:01.320
<v Speaker 1>it maps onto this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can imagine that when you're here</v>

1370
01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.140
<v Speaker 1>you're unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1371
01:16:04.141 --> 01:16:05.970
<v Speaker 1>so explored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1372
01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:10.980
<v Speaker 1>The explored territory in an archaic way</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fires at the center,</v>

1373
01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:17.540
<v Speaker 1>the campfire and the tribal boundary </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounds that space and that's safe </v>

1374
01:16:20.251 --> 01:16:21.450
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1375
01:16:21.451 --> 01:16:26.451
<v Speaker 1>so it's a place in nature obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>within which there's a pyramid and </v>

1376
01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:29.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a fire at the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid,</v>

1377
01:16:29.491 --> 01:16:31.260
<v Speaker 1>and the pyramid is the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

1378
01:16:31.261 --> 01:16:34.320
<v Speaker 1>the social dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where people live.</v>

1379
01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:36.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>

1380
01:16:36.961 --> 01:16:40.260
<v Speaker 1>well that's circumscribes space where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand.</v>

1381
01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.170
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the explored territory,</v>

1382
01:16:43.171 --> 01:16:48.171
<v Speaker 1>not only because you understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural world that prevails there and </v>

1383
01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:58.190
<v Speaker 1>the cumulative effort of all of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>compatriots keeps all the terrible </v>

1384
01:16:58.190 --> 01:17:02.211
<v Speaker 1>animals at bay so it's actually safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a natural perspective and you </v>

1385
01:17:02.211 --> 01:17:04.290
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's explored when you're there,</v>

1386
01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:08.820
<v Speaker 1>you're safe and good things happen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you mostly and then not a but a,</v>

1387
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:12.680
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't just the natural space </v>
<v Speaker 1>construed as the environment.</v>

1388
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:17.681
<v Speaker 1>It's the natural space construed of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between you and all the </v>

1389
01:17:17.681 --> 01:17:19.370
<v Speaker 1>other primates that inhabit that space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also.</v>

1390
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:24.500
<v Speaker 1>It's so society obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also part of nature and so that</v>

1391
01:17:25.221 --> 01:17:30.221
<v Speaker 1>explored territory is your understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the natural world and the social </v>

1392
01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:39.431
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly the concordance of </v>

1393
01:17:39.431 --> 01:17:40.310
<v Speaker 1>your understanding with what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that space.</v>

1394
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.550
<v Speaker 1>So like take this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1395
01:17:43.551 --> 01:17:48.551
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of you has expectations about </v>

1396
01:17:48.551 --> 01:17:51.791
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen in this classroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you bring those and their desires </v>

1397
01:17:51.791 --> 01:17:54.800
<v Speaker 1>actually did not merely expectations </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's goal directed and you bring</v>

1398
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:59.801
<v Speaker 1>those with you into the classroom and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>long as what's happening is in </v>

1399
01:17:59.801 --> 01:18:03.341
<v Speaker 1>concordance with those desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're safe and calm and maybe at </v>

1400
01:18:03.341 --> 01:18:05.420
<v Speaker 1>least mildly interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be the point,</v>

1401
01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's explored territory because what </v>

1402
01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:14.591
<v Speaker 1>you understand matches what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a place and it's a place that</v>

1403
01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:19.691
<v Speaker 1>you strive to be and you strive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain and maybe you even strive to </v>

1404
01:18:20.361 --> 01:18:25.361
<v Speaker 1>expand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which which is a slightly different </v>

1405
01:18:25.361 --> 01:18:25.361
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you certainly strive to maintain it.</v>

1406
01:18:25.361 --> 01:18:26.180
<v Speaker 1>That's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one place.</v>

1407
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Then there's another place which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you end up with that doesn't work,</v>

1408
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:32.450
<v Speaker 1>and you can think about that as well.</v>

1409
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:34.490
<v Speaker 1>You know in the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1410
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:39.550
<v Speaker 1>when when Mufasa Mufasa brings Simba up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the top of pride rock just when the </v>

1411
01:18:43.221 --> 01:18:48.221
<v Speaker 1>sun is either rising or setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're on top of the rock and </v>

1412
01:18:48.221 --> 01:18:52.121
<v Speaker 1>the top of the rock is lit and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting up the top in the light and </v>

1413
01:18:52.121 --> 01:18:56.981
<v Speaker 1>Mufasa tells Simba that his territory is</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that the light touches and </v>

1414
01:18:58.130 --> 01:19:00.800
<v Speaker 1>everything that the light touches is </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you've understood.</v>

1415
01:19:00.801 --> 01:19:05.801
<v Speaker 1>It's everything that your capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>illumination and enlightenment has </v>

1416
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.830
<v Speaker 1>turned into a habitable space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're the king of that domain,</v>

1417
01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:12.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in so far as you're guided by</v>

1418
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:17.321
<v Speaker 1>the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that little scene meant and </v>

1419
01:19:17.321 --> 01:19:20.141
<v Speaker 1>move fasa tells Simba not to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond where the light has touched into </v>

1420
01:19:20.151 --> 01:19:24.110
<v Speaker 1>the dark territories and that's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the elephant graveyard is in that story.</v>

1421
01:19:24.111 --> 01:19:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And move our Simba and Nala go out there</v>

1422
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:30.290
<v Speaker 1>because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you tell a human being not to</v>

1423
01:19:30.291 --> 01:19:35.291
<v Speaker 1>do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little lions being human beings </v>

1424
01:19:35.291 --> 01:19:36.980
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they immediately run off and do it,</v>

1425
01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:38.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's an echo of the story.</v>

1426
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Say in in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Genesis,</v>

1427
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.400
<v Speaker 1>where God tells Adam and eve not to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>the apple and this the first thing they </v>

1428
01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.220
<v Speaker 1>immediately do because if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone not to do something,</v>

1429
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:51.550
<v Speaker 1>you first specify what it is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do and then give them some </v>

1430
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:54.170
<v Speaker 1>sort of incomprehensible reason for why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't do it,</v>

1431
01:19:54.171 --> 01:19:56.630
<v Speaker 1>and they'll just do it instantly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're like,</v>

1432
01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:02.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way the Catholics are </v>

1433
01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:03.350
<v Speaker 1>convinced that people suffer from </v>
<v Speaker 1>original sin and it's a very intelligent</v>

1434
01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:06.590
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it also has its problems.</v>

1435
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the.</v>

1436
01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:13.580
<v Speaker 1>There's the known territory and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of that there's unknown </v>

1437
01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.720
<v Speaker 1>territory and those are the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental elements of existence.</v>

1438
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:20.721
<v Speaker 1>There's the place you are when you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on and there's the place </v>

1439
01:20:20.721 --> 01:20:24.561
<v Speaker 1>you are when you don't know what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and that can be mapped onto </v>

1440
01:20:24.561 --> 01:20:24.561
<v Speaker 1>geographic territory.</v>

1441
01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:27.540
<v Speaker 1>If you go on beyond the borders of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

1442
01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:32.630
<v Speaker 1>then you're in unknown territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be mapped conceptually </v>

1443
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:33.030
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1444
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:37.800
<v Speaker 1>we're all sitting in this room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone leaps in with a weapon.</v>

1445
01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:43.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like this was known territory a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second ago and now it's not known </v>

1446
01:20:44.101 --> 01:20:46.860
<v Speaker 1>territory at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you'd say,</v>

1447
01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:48.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things have remained the same.</v>

1448
01:20:48.421 --> 01:20:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1449
01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:51.090
<v Speaker 1>but all the relevant things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly changed.</v>

1450
01:20:51.091 --> 01:20:56.091
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so part of the way of </v>

1451
01:20:56.091 --> 01:20:57.711
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing that is that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can manifest a geographic </v>

1452
01:20:59.101 --> 01:21:02.910
<v Speaker 1>transformation by moving from genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>geographic,</v>

1453
01:21:02.911 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 1>explored territory into genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>geographic,</v>

1454
01:21:05.341 --> 01:21:10.341
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do that in time as well </v>

1455
01:21:10.341 --> 01:21:14.300
<v Speaker 1>because we exist in time as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and so a space that's stable and </v>

1456
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:19.470
<v Speaker 1>unchanging can be transformed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something completely other than it is by</v>

1457
01:21:19.471 --> 01:21:23.190
<v Speaker 1>the movement forward of time so well.</v>

1458
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:28.430
<v Speaker 1>So why am I telling you that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because we've mapped the idea of </v>

1459
01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:37.820
<v Speaker 1>the difference in space between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>known and the unknown to the difference </v>

1460
01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:42.360
<v Speaker 1>in time between a place that works now </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a place that no longer works,</v>

1461
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.480
<v Speaker 1>even though it's the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

1462
01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just extended across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1463
01:21:48.411 --> 01:21:53.411
<v Speaker 1>and so that's order versus chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the chaos that can manifest </v>

1464
01:21:53.411 --> 01:21:58.011
<v Speaker 1>itself within the order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that's represented in the Yin </v>

1465
01:21:58.011 --> 01:21:58.011
<v Speaker 1>and Yang symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1466
01:21:58.011 --> 01:22:01.140
<v Speaker 1>because you see the Black Paisley with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the white and the White Paisley with the</v>

1467
01:22:01.141 --> 01:22:06.141
<v Speaker 1>black.in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that order can turn into chaos at a </v>

1468
01:22:06.141 --> 01:22:08.961
<v Speaker 1>moment's notice and in the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos can turn to order in a moments </v>

1469
01:22:08.961 --> 01:22:13.191
<v Speaker 1>notice at a moment's notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we're trying to map the geography</v>

1470
01:22:13.651 --> 01:22:15.240
<v Speaker 1>onto the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto the APP,</v>

1471
01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:20.300
<v Speaker 1>onto something that's more abstract and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive and and and we do that </v>

1472
01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:24.561
<v Speaker 1>using conceptual schemes that we evolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>over vast spans of time and have just </v>

1473
01:22:26.131 --> 01:22:31.131
<v Speaker 1>moved up one level of obstruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>known territory or what's exploring </v>

1474
01:22:31.131 --> 01:22:33.360
<v Speaker 1>unknown territory or what's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>explored.</v>

1475
01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:37.380
<v Speaker 1>The trans transformation or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusion of one into the other,</v>

1476
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:40.710
<v Speaker 1>and then the reconstitution of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when an election does,</v>

1477
01:22:40.711 --> 01:22:42.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1478
01:22:42.001 --> 01:22:47.001
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have our leader who's the person at </v>

1479
01:22:47.001 --> 01:22:51.141
<v Speaker 1>the top of the dominance hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>defines the nature of this particular </v>

1480
01:22:51.141 --> 01:22:52.260
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an election.</v>

1481
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:55.860
<v Speaker 1>It's regulated chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what's going to happen.</v>

1482
01:22:55.861 --> 01:22:58.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the death of the old king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

1483
01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:03.440
<v Speaker 1>We go into a chaotic state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone argues for awhile and then out </v>

1484
01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.350
<v Speaker 1>of that argument they produce a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus and Poof,</v>

1485
01:23:05.351 --> 01:23:07.300
<v Speaker 1>we're in a new state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1486
01:23:07.301 --> 01:23:08.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the Metta story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1487
01:23:09.190 --> 01:23:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos order,</v>

1488
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's partial order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

1489
01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.760
<v Speaker 1>reconstituted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and revivified order.</v>

1490
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing is that this order is </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than that order,</v>

1491
01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:23.650
<v Speaker 1>so there's progress and that's partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>why I think the idea of moral relativism</v>

1492
01:23:23.651 --> 01:23:28.651
<v Speaker 1>is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's progress in moral order and it </v>

1493
01:23:28.651 --> 01:23:31.180
<v Speaker 1>was defined property by piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new moral order does everything.</v>

1494
01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:36.181
<v Speaker 1>The other boral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old moral order did and some </v>

1495
01:23:36.181 --> 01:23:36.880
<v Speaker 1>additional things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what constitutes progress.</v>

1496
01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a strange idea and we'll talk </v>

1497
01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.660
<v Speaker 1>about this more as we progress through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the class.</v>

1498
01:23:44.050 --> 01:23:45.580
<v Speaker 1>What's the ultimate in order?</v>

1499
01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not there,</v>

1500
01:23:48.811 --> 01:23:53.811
<v Speaker 1>so obviously because it can collapse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not this because it can collapse </v>

1501
01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:56.680
<v Speaker 1>and so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1502
01:23:56.681 --> 01:23:58.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no ultimate order even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's progression,</v>

1503
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 1>but then you have to move it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One level of abstraction.</v>

1504
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:07.480
<v Speaker 1>What's the ultimate order doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to do that?</v>

1505
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:10.660
<v Speaker 1>That's the ultimate order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1506
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:15.661
<v Speaker 1>It's order at a different level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis and you can see that's what's </v>

1507
01:24:15.661 --> 01:24:18.280
<v Speaker 1>represented in that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that idea means.</v>

1508
01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:23.050
<v Speaker 1>That's the phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Phoenix is something that lives ages</v>

1509
01:24:23.051 --> 01:24:28.051
<v Speaker 1>and then allows itself to be consumed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and then reemerge us and they </v>

1510
01:24:28.051 --> 01:24:32.610
<v Speaker 1>pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix gets old and Burns and the new </v>

1511
01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:36.721
<v Speaker 1>phoenix reemergence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the real phoenix is the thing </v>

1512
01:24:36.721 --> 01:24:37.240
<v Speaker 1>that's constant across those </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations.</v>

1513
01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:41.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the union self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he meant.</v>

1514
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:47.010
<v Speaker 1>The self is the element of the psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>that remains intact across </v>

1515
01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:48.580
<v Speaker 1>transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody amazing idea.</v>

1517
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can think about that.</v>

1518
01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:57.730
<v Speaker 1>That's why you haven't claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1519
01:24:57.731 --> 01:25:02.731
<v Speaker 1>in ion primarily that Christ was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol of the self that was his</v>

1520
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.800
<v Speaker 1>consequence of decades of meditation on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of Christianity because </v>

1521
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:16.590
<v Speaker 1>it's the dying and resurrecting part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psyche that remains constant across </v>

1522
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:20.870
<v Speaker 1>the transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ultimate order isn't to identify </v>

1523
01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:26.281
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your current state of being and </v>

1524
01:25:26.281 --> 01:25:27.820
<v Speaker 1>it isn't identified with that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1525
01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.500
<v Speaker 1>you can't by definition and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even to identify with that.</v>

1526
01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:36.460
<v Speaker 1>It's to let these things go as they need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>

1527
01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:41.520
<v Speaker 1>That's a sacrifice and to allow this </v>
<v Speaker 1>continual process of transformation to </v>

1528
01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.261
<v Speaker 1>occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of that is the admission that </v>

1529
01:25:46.261 --> 01:25:49.141
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so partly what you're doing is at </v>

1530
01:25:49.141 --> 01:25:52.591
<v Speaker 1>micro levels and macro levels where are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you not what you could be and when you </v>

1531
01:25:53.321 --> 01:25:58.321
<v Speaker 1>realize that it'll take you apart a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit and burn you down to your </v>

1532
01:25:58.321 --> 01:26:01.000
<v Speaker 1>core a little bit and then allow you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerate.</v>

1533
01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:05.360
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the everything that you don't need burns</v>

1534
01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:05.750
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1535
01:26:06.730 --> 01:26:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what this means.</v>

1536
01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:16.400
<v Speaker 1>You remember in Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may remember that Harry goes down,</v>

1537
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 1>so in the second volume and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second movie,</v>

1538
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Harry's at Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the school where you learn how </v>

1539
01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:25.480
<v Speaker 1>to be magic because that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are,</v>

1540
01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.530
<v Speaker 1>and there's something that threatens the</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1541
01:26:27.531 --> 01:26:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what threatens the school.</v>

1542
01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1543
01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Voldemort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing,</v>

1544
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.480
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the snake that lurks </v>

1545
01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.821
<v Speaker 1>underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the basilisk that threatens the </v>

1546
01:26:39.821 --> 01:26:40.850
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the Basilisk is the dragon,</v>

1547
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:45.851
<v Speaker 1>and when the bassline looks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're paralyzed because you're a </v>

1548
01:26:45.851 --> 01:26:48.380
<v Speaker 1>prey animal and if a Predator captures </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in its gaze,</v>

1549
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:53.950
<v Speaker 1>you freeze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason you freeze is because </v>

1550
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:56.111
<v Speaker 1>your body reacts to the Predator as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that should turn you to stone.</v>

1551
01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Sorry about that.</v>

1552
01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.640
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do about the basilisk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1553
01:27:05.641 --> 01:27:10.641
<v Speaker 1>one thing you do is you run and hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing you do is go </v>

1554
01:27:10.641 --> 01:27:12.600
<v Speaker 1>confronted and it slayer and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter does now.</v>

1555
01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:15.780
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting about him is he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also touched by evil,</v>

1556
01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:20.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that he's an embodiment </v>

1557
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:23.421
<v Speaker 1>of what you would regard as someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's integrated the shadow and without </v>

1558
01:27:23.421 --> 01:27:25.530
<v Speaker 1>that capacity isn't able to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with snakes.</v>

1559
01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's not so good because since </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are snakes,</v>

1560
01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:33.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not such a bad idea to know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with them and he goes down </v>

1561
01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:37.281
<v Speaker 1>into the underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right into the chaotic domain that's </v>

1562
01:27:37.281 --> 01:27:37.920
<v Speaker 1>underneath the school in order to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>the snake.</v>

1563
01:27:37.921 --> 01:27:38.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's layer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1564
01:27:38.791 --> 01:27:41.490
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can you tell me if I'm wrong,</v>

1565
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really go down through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathroom through a toilet.</v>

1566
01:27:45.330 --> 01:27:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1567
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's an indication of the union </v>

1568
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:53.120
<v Speaker 1>dictum that where are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you most what you need most is to </v>

1569
01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.741
<v Speaker 1>be found where you least want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a client once who actually had a </v>

1570
01:27:57.741 --> 01:28:01.221
<v Speaker 1>dream like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He dreamt that he had to go into the </v>

1571
01:28:01.221 --> 01:28:02.390
<v Speaker 1>underground world through an outhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1572
01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting and it was an </v>

1573
01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 1>elaboration of precisely this theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you've thrown away as of </v>

1574
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:13.971
<v Speaker 1>little value to you and maybe what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate and hold in contempt and fear is </v>

1575
01:28:13.971 --> 01:28:18.651
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you have to face if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go down to the place where the </v>

1576
01:28:18.651 --> 01:28:19.920
<v Speaker 1>transformations occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens in Harry Potter,</v>

1577
01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:25.220
<v Speaker 1>while this Bass licks his wandering </v>
<v Speaker 1>around paralyzing everyone who isn't </v>

1578
01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:28.110
<v Speaker 1>able to communicate with snakes and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fight the bast list precisely.</v>

1579
01:28:28.111 --> 01:28:30.600
<v Speaker 1>He goes down into its layers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underground world,</v>

1580
01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.660
<v Speaker 1>and that what what down there is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake has got a generic Vra,</v>

1581
01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:37.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His girlfriend,</v>

1582
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:38.220
<v Speaker 1>that's her name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1583
01:28:38.221 --> 01:28:39.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1584
01:28:39.001 --> 01:28:44.001
<v Speaker 1>it's a variant of Virginia that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variant of virgin and the snake always </v>

1585
01:28:44.001 --> 01:28:45.270
<v Speaker 1>has a virgin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of its characteristics,</v>

1586
01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:46.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like gold.</v>

1587
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:49.320
<v Speaker 1>He goes down there to rescue her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens to him?</v>

1588
01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.820
<v Speaker 1>He gets bit and he's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>

1589
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:58.710
<v Speaker 1>The Phoenix comes along and cries tears </v>
<v Speaker 1>into his wounds and charism,</v>

1590
01:28:59.330 --> 01:28:59.990
<v Speaker 3>and that's</v>

1591
01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:07.090
<v Speaker 1>so the idea is that what saves you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the encounter with the snake is your </v>

1592
01:29:07.090 --> 01:29:11.750
<v Speaker 1>capacity to let things go and die and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back to life.</v>

1593
01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1594
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:16.460
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting a that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1595
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:21.290
<v Speaker 1>that story is told in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that series of volumes because the,</v>

1596
01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1597
01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:27.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plot structure is perfect in a </v>

1598
01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:27.950
<v Speaker 1>mythological sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly right.</v>

1599
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:32.090
<v Speaker 1>And the Phoenix APP actually happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the pat of the main wizard,</v>

1600
01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:34.280
<v Speaker 1>which is also perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly right.</v>

1601
01:29:34.281 --> 01:29:36.320
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name now?</v>

1602
01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dumbledore.</v>

1603
01:29:37.791 --> 01:29:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's basically,</v>

1604
01:29:38.751 --> 01:29:42.230
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God the father and his pat,</v>

1605
01:29:42.231 --> 01:29:43.130
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1606
01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:47.480
<v Speaker 1>his close ally is the thing that can die</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that transforms.</v>

1607
01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see the echoes of Christian </v>

1608
01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:52.840
<v Speaker 1>thought in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't exactly right.</v>

1609
01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:57.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the Christian thought and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological substructure upon which the</v>

1610
01:29:57.471 --> 01:30:02.471
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter volume is based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are drawing from the same underlying </v>

1611
01:30:02.471 --> 01:30:05.831
<v Speaker 1>pool of ideas and symbols and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>universally accessible and you can tell </v>

1612
01:30:06.291 --> 01:30:11.291
<v Speaker 1>that because if they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that book wouldn't have sold how many </v>

1613
01:30:11.291 --> 01:30:14.651
<v Speaker 1>million copies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many million copies did itself and </v>

1614
01:30:14.651 --> 01:30:17.981
<v Speaker 1>the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably overwhelmingly </v>

1615
01:30:17.981 --> 01:30:19.790
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got kids to read 600 page books,</v>

1616
01:30:19.791 --> 01:30:22.220
<v Speaker 1>like multiple volumes lining up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1617
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:27.170
<v Speaker 1>You got to ask yourself why silly </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about magical orphans.</v>

1618
01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:28.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1619
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:33.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people aren't so stupid and </v>

1620
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:35.390
<v Speaker 1>certainly if they happen to be reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively complex books,</v>

1621
01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:39.470
<v Speaker 1>attributing that to stupidity seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be rather counterproductive.</v>

1622
01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the chaotic domain.</v>

1623
01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Now we got to think about the chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain for a minute.</v>

1624
01:30:57.230 --> 01:31:02.230
<v Speaker 1>The chaotic domain is where you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's going to happen and anything</v>

1625
01:31:02.241 --> 01:31:03.590
<v Speaker 1>could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Positive or negative,</v>

1626
01:31:03.650 --> 01:31:08.650
<v Speaker 1>anything can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can think about the chaotic </v>

1627
01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:11.240
<v Speaker 1>domain as the birthplace of order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the place from which order emerges.</v>

1628
01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1629
01:31:12.281 --> 01:31:13.790
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can in some sense.</v>

1630
01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:18.930
<v Speaker 1>You remember what happens in Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Pinocchio goes down into the depths </v>

1631
01:31:22.330 --> 01:31:24.760
<v Speaker 1>and the and then into the whale to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescue his father.</v>

1632
01:31:24.761 --> 01:31:26.740
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the most frightening place </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1633
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000
<v Speaker 1>He tests himself against it and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescues his father and he brings him up </v>

1634
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.421
<v Speaker 1>to the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the consequence of that is that he </v>

1635
01:31:36.421 --> 01:31:36.850
<v Speaker 1>dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what dies is the stupid puppet,</v>

1636
01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.750
<v Speaker 1>and so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1637
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:42.360
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you're a stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet,</v>

1638
01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:47.630
<v Speaker 1>are you willing to let that die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it depends on </v>

1639
01:31:47.630 --> 01:31:52.221
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which you're actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid puppet because the more that's </v>

1640
01:31:52.221 --> 01:31:56.181
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more of you has to die and it's not </v>

1641
01:31:56.181 --> 01:32:00.020
<v Speaker 1>something trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why these myths insist upon the </v>

1642
01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:03.291
<v Speaker 1>horror of the thing that lurks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak is that that death might be </v>

1643
01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:06.430
<v Speaker 1>enough to actually kill you if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not properly prepared for it.</v>

1644
01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens to people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are extraordinarily traumatized,</v>

1645
01:32:09.371 --> 01:32:14.371
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like huge parts of them are killed </v>

1646
01:32:14.371 --> 01:32:14.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they often don't recover.</v>

1647
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:17.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1648
01:32:17.471 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 1>and then of course this is often acted </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the real world too,</v>

1649
01:32:20.231 --> 01:32:25.231
<v Speaker 1>if you know this can happen on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological basis and so your own </v>

1650
01:32:25.231 --> 01:32:29.380
<v Speaker 1>psychological experiences can be enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to radically disrupt and hurt you,</v>

1651
01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:34.620
<v Speaker 1>but it can be worked out in the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>world too because if you're wandering </v>

1652
01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.771
<v Speaker 1>around naively with your eyes closed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run into someone who's really </v>

1653
01:32:37.771 --> 01:32:41.401
<v Speaker 1>psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take you apart and you'll have </v>

1654
01:32:41.401 --> 01:32:42.930
<v Speaker 1>no defense against it whatsoever because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too blinded,</v>

1655
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:47.940
<v Speaker 1>naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you encounter someone like that </v>

1656
01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:47.940
<v Speaker 1>and they leave you in the ashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they might,</v>

1657
01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.990
<v Speaker 1>it certainly possible that you'll never </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover from it.</v>

1658
01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:53.560
<v Speaker 1>You just will not be able to handle the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aftermath,</v>

1659
01:32:53.561 --> 01:32:58.561
<v Speaker 1>but also you won't be able to handle the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that something like that could </v>

1660
01:32:58.561 --> 01:33:01.861
<v Speaker 1>actually happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really the nature of of </v>

1661
01:33:01.861 --> 01:33:05.280
<v Speaker 1>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot believe that that could </v>

1662
01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.040
<v Speaker 1>actually happen and that's an encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost always,</v>

1663
01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:09.250
<v Speaker 1>and this has been the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly be my clinical experience.</v>

1664
01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:14.920
<v Speaker 1>What traumatizes people is malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not tragedy,</v>

1665
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:18.580
<v Speaker 1>although tragedy can traumatize people </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's severe enough,</v>

1666
01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.430
<v Speaker 1>but generally no people can withstand </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy.</v>

1667
01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:27.360
<v Speaker 1>They are done in by real malevolence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sometimes it's the realization of </v>

1668
01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.910
<v Speaker 1>their own malevolence that does the men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when that isn't the case,</v>

1669
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.660
<v Speaker 1>they encounter someone who's out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world who's actually operating to</v>

1670
01:33:34.661 --> 01:33:39.661
<v Speaker 1>hurt them and so and if the person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathic enough and this is actually</v>

1671
01:33:39.911 --> 01:33:44.230
<v Speaker 1>goes beyond pure psychopathy because at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least the psychopath has the sense to be</v>

1672
01:33:44.231 --> 01:33:45.160
<v Speaker 1>self interested.</v>

1673
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:50.370
<v Speaker 1>You can go far farther than that where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're perfectly willing to hurt </v>

1674
01:33:50.370 --> 01:33:52.480
<v Speaker 1>yourself as long as you hurt the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>person at the same time and that's where</v>

1675
01:33:52.481 --> 01:33:57.481
<v Speaker 1>you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're doing something like </v>

1676
01:33:57.481 --> 01:33:59.071
<v Speaker 1>conjuring up the idea that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot up a school because those people </v>

1677
01:33:59.071 --> 01:34:00.190
<v Speaker 1>always killed themselves at the end and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

1678
01:34:00.191 --> 01:34:05.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't they just save everyone a lot </v>

1679
01:34:05.191 --> 01:34:05.191
<v Speaker 1>of trouble and killed themselves at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning?</v>

1680
01:34:05.191 --> 01:34:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't exactly be the point.</v>

1681
01:34:05.831 --> 01:34:09.460
<v Speaker 1>What they what they want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His life means nothing to me.</v>

1682
01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm perfectly willing to make as </v>

1683
01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:16.330
<v Speaker 1>many people as I possibly can suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I demonstrate that.</v>

1684
01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:20.620
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a step past psychopathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you encounter that in someone,</v>

1685
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:25.870
<v Speaker 1>it's or in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be a deeply unsettling </v>

1686
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:29.281
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An idea behind many of these stories is </v>

1687
01:34:29.281 --> 01:34:32.461
<v Speaker 1>that you cannot figure out what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that before you haven't </v>

1688
01:34:32.461 --> 01:34:32.461
<v Speaker 1>encountered like that.</v>

1689
01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.950
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1690
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:38.890
<v Speaker 1>that's as horrifying and experience as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine,</v>

1691
01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's precisely that.</v>

1692
01:34:40.691 --> 01:34:43.060
<v Speaker 1>It's as horrifying and experience as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could imagine.</v>

1693
01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so back this chaos.</v>

1694
01:34:48.611 --> 01:34:53.611
<v Speaker 1>This is the birthplace of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why often it's represented as </v>

1695
01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 1>feminine because feminine things are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>

1696
01:34:58.011 --> 01:34:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1697
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:04.300
<v Speaker 1>people are stuck with the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreting their experience through </v>

1698
01:35:05.301 --> 01:35:09.560
<v Speaker 1>the biological platform of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation that they evolved.</v>

1699
01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.060
<v Speaker 1>And so we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1700
01:35:11.061 --> 01:35:12.770
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we recognize feminine,</v>

1701
01:35:12.771 --> 01:35:15.400
<v Speaker 1>we recognize masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we recognize parent,</v>

1702
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:16.860
<v Speaker 1>we recognize child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1703
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.110
<v Speaker 1>that's ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1704
01:35:18.111 --> 01:35:23.111
<v Speaker 1>That's as ancient as mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are fundamental social </v>

1705
01:35:23.111 --> 01:35:27.521
<v Speaker 1>cognitive categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had to exploit those categories </v>

1706
01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:29.180
<v Speaker 1>to represent the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that,</v>

1707
01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:31.790
<v Speaker 1>when we started to be able to represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world beyond that,</v>

1708
01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.500
<v Speaker 1>you as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as a primate,</v>

1709
01:35:33.501 --> 01:35:37.400
<v Speaker 1>like a chimpanzee or a tree dwelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary to complex primate,</v>

1710
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.410
<v Speaker 1>almost all of their categories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

1711
01:35:39.411 --> 01:35:40.940
<v Speaker 1>cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1712
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they live in complex social </v>

1713
01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:47.891
<v Speaker 1>environments and there's a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the size of the social </v>

1714
01:35:47.891 --> 01:35:49.790
<v Speaker 1>environment that a primate inhabits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brain size.</v>

1715
01:35:50.150 --> 01:35:51.920
<v Speaker 1>The bigger the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger the environment,</v>

1716
01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.780
<v Speaker 1>and you could think there's a loop </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1717
01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:55.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your brain's too small,</v>

1718
01:35:55.701 --> 01:36:00.701
<v Speaker 1>you can't handle the larger environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the environment grows and it selects </v>

1719
01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 1>for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for creatures that are complex enough to</v>

1720
01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:08.741
<v Speaker 1>compute the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that gives us selective </v>

1721
01:36:08.741 --> 01:36:11.291
<v Speaker 1>advantage to creatures that are acute it</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are sharp enough to compute the </v>

1722
01:36:11.291 --> 01:36:14.500
<v Speaker 1>environment and so there's more of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it loops and the brain grows and and</v>

1723
01:36:14.501 --> 01:36:17.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not the only thing driving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution of the brain among primates,</v>

1724
01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:19.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a primary source.</v>

1725
01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:24.940
<v Speaker 1>So we have those categories to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and then we have to view the world </v>

1726
01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:27.350
<v Speaker 1>as it manifests itself outside those </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary categories.</v>

1727
01:36:27.351 --> 01:36:32.351
<v Speaker 1>Through the lens of those categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens is we use the </v>

1728
01:36:32.351 --> 01:36:35.951
<v Speaker 1>symbolism of of sex differentiation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the symbolism of parent child </v>

1729
01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:41.291
<v Speaker 1>relationships to to begin to account for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which the world manifests </v>

1730
01:36:41.811 --> 01:36:44.420
<v Speaker 1>itself masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1731
01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the patriarchy,</v>

1732
01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.420
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

1733
01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1734
01:36:48.561 --> 01:36:51.710
<v Speaker 1>partly it's conceived of in opposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the patriarchy,</v>

1735
01:36:51.711 --> 01:36:54.920
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing from which order rises,</v>

1736
01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:58.700
<v Speaker 1>so it's perfectly reasonable to consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feminine and then order again,</v>

1737
01:36:58.910 --> 01:37:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1738
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:05.850
<v Speaker 1>you have order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

1739
01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:07.530
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

1740
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:10.980
<v Speaker 1>and then you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this transformational process.</v>

1741
01:37:10.981 --> 01:37:15.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mythological hero and those </v>

1742
01:37:15.981 --> 01:37:15.981
<v Speaker 1>are the three fundamental characters of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>

1743
01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.740
<v Speaker 1>individual culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

1744
01:37:20.130 --> 01:37:21.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the universal world,</v>

1745
01:37:21.781 --> 01:37:24.780
<v Speaker 1>and then that's differentiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further positive individual,</v>

1746
01:37:24.810 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual heroin,</v>

1747
01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.310
<v Speaker 1>adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrant and wise king.</v>

1748
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:35.790
<v Speaker 1>The destructive element of nature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the creative element of nature and and </v>

1749
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:36.580
<v Speaker 1>those are perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

1750
01:37:36.581 --> 01:37:41.581
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do a lovely job of actually </v>

1751
01:37:41.581 --> 01:37:45.540
<v Speaker 1>representing how the world does manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself to us in the domains that are </v>

1752
01:37:45.971 --> 01:37:50.971
<v Speaker 1>permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a conscious observer </v>

1753
01:37:50.971 --> 01:37:50.971
<v Speaker 1>who's ambivalent about the nature of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1754
01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:55.830
<v Speaker 1>There's always a social structure that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>half tyrannical and half order producing</v>

1755
01:37:55.950 --> 01:38:00.120
<v Speaker 1>and there's always the nature that gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>rise to everything and that destroys it.</v>

1756
01:38:00.121 --> 01:38:05.121
<v Speaker 1>At the same time always it's permanent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's another reason it's so </v>

1757
01:38:05.821 --> 01:38:10.821
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another reason why the </v>

1758
01:38:10.821 --> 01:38:12.501
<v Speaker 1>mythological representations or hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>real because they think what makes </v>

1759
01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:16.620
<v Speaker 1>something real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say protons are real.</v>

1760
01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because at one level of analysis,</v>

1761
01:38:21.271 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 1>every single thing is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>protons,</v>

1762
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:26.970
<v Speaker 1>so you can use it as an explanatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool.</v>

1763
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
<v Speaker 1>The concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use it as an explanatory tool </v>

1764
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.140
<v Speaker 1>for every possible situation and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>true across all possible spans of time.</v>

1765
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Although protons do decay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes billions and billions of </v>

1766
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:40.110
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so real means works now.</v>

1767
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:43.920
<v Speaker 1>It works forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>applies now and applies everywhere.</v>

1768
01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what this map means.</v>

1769
01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:52.100
<v Speaker 1>It's that there's always an observer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always a framework of </v>

1770
01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:53.580
<v Speaker 1>interpretation and there's always that </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is being observed.</v>

1771
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:57.630
<v Speaker 1>There's always the the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the social environment,</v>

1772
01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:03.320
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's always the nature that </v>

1773
01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:03.720
<v Speaker 1>exists outside of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always the knower,</v>

1774
01:39:03.721 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 1>the known and the unknown always.</v>

1775
01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:10.200
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1776
01:39:10.201 --> 01:39:15.201
<v Speaker 1>how do those things interrelate while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you differentiate them into their </v>

1777
01:39:15.201 --> 01:39:17.580
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative elements because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the positive and negative</v>

1778
01:39:17.581 --> 01:39:22.581
<v Speaker 1>element and then you tell stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the different categories interact </v>

1779
01:39:22.581 --> 01:39:24.780
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the stories do and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more mythological the story,</v>

1780
01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:30.020
<v Speaker 1>the more that underlying Schema is self </v>
<v Speaker 1>evident in the,</v>

1781
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:35.950
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the plot and you especially see that </v>

1782
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:39.111
<v Speaker 1>I think in stories for children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's because children can't </v>

1783
01:39:40.621 --> 01:39:44.820
<v Speaker 1>understand stories unless they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal like blatantly archetipal and</v>

1784
01:39:44.821 --> 01:39:45.840
<v Speaker 1>that would make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1785
01:39:45.841 --> 01:39:50.841
<v Speaker 1>Because the stories have to appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the instinctive knowledge of the child </v>

1786
01:39:50.841 --> 01:39:52.230
<v Speaker 1>or the child wouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehend them.</v>

1787
01:39:52.231 --> 01:39:57.231
<v Speaker 1>And so I saw this quite dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my own kids watching them watch </v>

1788
01:39:58.020 --> 01:39:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Disney movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>

1789
01:39:59.371 --> 01:40:04.290
<v Speaker 1>My Son was absolutely obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio and particularly obsessed with</v>

1790
01:40:04.291 --> 01:40:09.291
<v Speaker 1>the scene where Pinocchio and and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father are escaping from the whale and </v>

1791
01:40:09.291 --> 01:40:12.510
<v Speaker 1>the whale turns into this sort of smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>belching locomotive thing that's chasing</v>

1792
01:40:12.511 --> 01:40:13.170
<v Speaker 1>them through the water.</v>

1793
01:40:13.410 --> 01:40:16.950
<v Speaker 1>He would rewind that and watch it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewind it and watch it and rewind it and</v>

1794
01:40:16.951 --> 01:40:21.951
<v Speaker 1>watch it like over and over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think what the hell's that kid up </v>

1795
01:40:21.951 --> 01:40:22.200
<v Speaker 1>to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1796
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took us what,</v>

1797
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:27.270
<v Speaker 1>six hours to do a brief run through </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Pinocchio.</v>

1798
01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:32.271
<v Speaker 1>Still by still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of information in that </v>

1799
01:40:32.271 --> 01:40:34.851
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tremendous amount of information and </v>

1800
01:40:34.851 --> 01:40:36.540
<v Speaker 1>then with the kids trying to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate it to,</v>

1801
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:41.100
<v Speaker 1>to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to embody it and that's all happening in</v>

1802
01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:43.620
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say unconsciously it's like it's</v>

1803
01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:47.400
<v Speaker 1>unconscious in that he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate what he was doing and neither</v>

1804
01:40:47.401 --> 01:40:52.401
<v Speaker 1>could anyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean he wasn't doing </v>

1805
01:40:52.401 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was definitely something.</v>

1806
01:40:53.711 --> 01:40:58.711
<v Speaker 1>He was doing the same thing that enabled</v>
<v Speaker 1>my nephew to put on the night suit when </v>

1807
01:41:00.131 --> 01:41:03.520
<v Speaker 1>he did that little night hat and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sword and figure out how to go after the</v>

1808
01:41:03.521 --> 01:41:04.810
<v Speaker 1>great dragon of chaos.</v>

1809
01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:08.920
<v Speaker 1>And so I wanted to tell you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more about this idea of chaos.</v>

1810
01:41:08.921 --> 01:41:13.921
<v Speaker 1>So here's the Schema of have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural son and we'll get to why </v>

1811
01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:19.740
<v Speaker 1>it's masculine and not feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's also taken me a long time to </v>

1812
01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:22.420
<v Speaker 1>crack because the women in this class </v>
<v Speaker 1>have always asked me,</v>

1813
01:41:22.421 --> 01:41:27.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero and mythological stories is </v>

1814
01:41:27.421 --> 01:41:27.421
<v Speaker 1>male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does that leave women?</v>

1815
01:41:27.421 --> 01:41:28.620
<v Speaker 1>And I never knew what to say about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1816
01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:30.880
<v Speaker 1>You can look at sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1817
01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:35.470
<v Speaker 1>that that that story and sleeping beauty</v>
<v Speaker 1>is raised rescued by a prince,</v>

1818
01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:39.310
<v Speaker 1>and you can think of that prince at two </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of analysis simultaneously.</v>

1819
01:41:39.311 --> 01:41:42.550
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as an actual mail</v>
<v Speaker 1>who plays that role,</v>

1820
01:41:42.551 --> 01:41:47.170
<v Speaker 1>but you can also think about it as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory and exploratory,</v>

1821
01:41:47.171 --> 01:41:52.171
<v Speaker 1>assertive and courageous part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine psyche that's necessary to </v>

1822
01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:57.360
<v Speaker 1>bring unconsciousness up into </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and the story works </v>

1823
01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.150
<v Speaker 1>perfectly across both those levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

1824
01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and that is.</v>

1825
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:03.270
<v Speaker 1>That is the classic way I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1826
01:42:03.630 --> 01:42:06.730
<v Speaker 1>of explaining this particular mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

1827
01:42:06.731 --> 01:42:09.790
<v Speaker 1>but it came to my attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was so interesting.</v>

1828
01:42:09.791 --> 01:42:12.280
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what triggered this for me.</v>

1829
01:42:12.281 --> 01:42:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this book called a billion</v>

1830
01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:20.671
<v Speaker 1>wicked thoughts that was written by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of engineers at Google and they </v>

1831
01:42:20.671 --> 01:42:24.331
<v Speaker 1>were looking at billions of search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of google searches and you </v>

1832
01:42:25.031 --> 01:42:30.031
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no shortage of pornography on </v>

1833
01:42:30.031 --> 01:42:32.281
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and it and there's much </v>
<v Speaker 1>less by proportion than there was when </v>

1834
01:42:32.281 --> 01:42:35.881
<v Speaker 1>the Internet was first invented and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so interesting because it actually </v>

1835
01:42:35.881 --> 01:42:39.361
<v Speaker 1>turned out that one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>drove the development of the Internet </v>

1836
01:42:39.361 --> 01:42:43.561
<v Speaker 1>and the technology was the proclivity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>young men to search out sexually </v>

1837
01:42:43.561 --> 01:42:47.971
<v Speaker 1>provocative images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what was at the forefront of </v>

1838
01:42:47.971 --> 01:42:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the development of the nets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extraordinarily interesting.</v>

1839
01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:53.670
<v Speaker 1>They were motivated to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were motivated to use it for that </v>

1840
01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:55.750
<v Speaker 1>purpose and that provided the platform </v>
<v Speaker 1>from which it emerged.</v>

1841
01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1842
01:42:58.630 --> 01:43:03.630
<v Speaker 1>the Google engineers looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>pornographic search processes and then </v>

1843
01:43:04.091 --> 01:43:09.091
<v Speaker 1>segregated male searches from female </v>
<v Speaker 1>searches and what they found was that </v>

1844
01:43:09.091 --> 01:43:10.360
<v Speaker 1>the mail search scout images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>price surprise,</v>

1845
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:12.430
<v Speaker 1>no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one considers that,</v>

1846
01:43:12.730 --> 01:43:14.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly interesting.</v>

1847
01:43:14.171 --> 01:43:17.740
<v Speaker 1>But the female searched out literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of pornography.</v>

1848
01:43:17.741 --> 01:43:22.741
<v Speaker 1>It was written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I can give you an example of </v>

1849
01:43:22.741 --> 01:43:23.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know about harlequin romances,</v>

1850
01:43:23.170 --> 01:43:26.080
<v Speaker 1>does everybody still know about those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody not know about those?</v>

1851
01:43:26.710 --> 01:43:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there are mass market romances and </v>

1852
01:43:31.710 --> 01:43:33.390
<v Speaker 1>have a very stereotypical type and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>

1853
01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:38.460
<v Speaker 1>The original ones were pretty harmless </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of no violence and no real </v>

1854
01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:42.511
<v Speaker 1>sexual contact con content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was 40 years ago and they've </v>

1855
01:43:42.511 --> 01:43:47.131
<v Speaker 1>differentiated tremendously and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's hardcore harlequin romances and </v>

1856
01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.050
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with particularly garish covers and then</v>

1857
01:43:50.051 --> 01:43:55.051
<v Speaker 1>there's the old more tame basic sexless </v>
<v Speaker 1>and aggression list.</v>

1858
01:43:55.811 --> 01:43:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Romance is where everything is implied </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not explicit,</v>

1859
01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.980
<v Speaker 1>but the explicit ones exist.</v>

1860
01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 1>So they did a plot analysis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical pornographic female fantasy.</v>

1861
01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was so.</v>

1862
01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.650
<v Speaker 1>It's so comical because engineers did </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1863
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Social scientists would never do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they'd be probably too concerned</v>

1864
01:44:16.251 --> 01:44:18.260
<v Speaker 1>about the ethics of it or some damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1865
01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:19.570
<v Speaker 1>but engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1866
01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:24.580
<v Speaker 1>they'll just plow ahead with no concern </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever for such things and they </v>

1867
01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:26.720
<v Speaker 1>actually discover things that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

1868
01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:31.900
<v Speaker 1>they discovered the basic plot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>female pornographic literary product and</v>

1869
01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:38.380
<v Speaker 1>they identified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happened was that a </v>

1870
01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:42.310
<v Speaker 1>innocent well meaning an attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>young woman encounters a male who's a </v>

1871
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:47.261
<v Speaker 1>bit of a monster and the monster is five</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of classic male monster for all </v>

1872
01:44:47.261 --> 01:44:51.200
<v Speaker 1>your males who want to know this is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can become a vampire.</v>

1873
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:53.270
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a wolf,</v>

1874
01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:58.550
<v Speaker 1>billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pirate and surgeon.</v>

1875
01:44:59.690 --> 01:45:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very interesting because.</v>

1876
01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all there's a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1877
01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:06.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're actually blushing.</v>

1878
01:45:06.411 --> 01:45:08.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually blushing about that.</v>

1879
01:45:08.151 --> 01:45:09.380
<v Speaker 1>That's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very funny.</v>

1880
01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:13.370
<v Speaker 1>So sorry to point it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so comical,</v>

1881
01:45:13.371 --> 01:45:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1882
01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:15.170
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1883
01:45:15.171 --> 01:45:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this,</v>

1884
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:19.520
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just cracking me up.</v>

1885
01:45:19.521 --> 01:45:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1886
01:45:20.601 --> 01:45:22.910
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pirate Vampire,</v>

1887
01:45:22.911 --> 01:45:26.390
<v Speaker 1>all of that explains it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about all these damn vampire shows,</v>

1888
01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:30.140
<v Speaker 1>right there are so popular online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so popular on Netflix.</v>

1889
01:45:30.141 --> 01:45:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the werewolf.</v>

1890
01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.250
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing sexier than a werewolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>

1891
01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.590
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's predatory dope.</v>

1892
01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:38.780
<v Speaker 1>There's predatory dominance that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit in that,</v>

1893
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:40.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a billionaire,</v>

1894
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:43.280
<v Speaker 1>it's more abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but clearly that's an indication of very</v>

1895
01:45:43.281 --> 01:45:45.770
<v Speaker 1>high success in the male dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

1896
01:45:45.771 --> 01:45:50.771
<v Speaker 1>so but there's this desire for </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression that's in that are real </v>

1897
01:45:50.771 --> 01:45:51.140
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1898
01:45:51.230 --> 01:45:53.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's not surprising to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me at all,</v>

1899
01:45:53.571 --> 01:45:58.571
<v Speaker 1>it makes perfect sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about the basic plot is that </v>

1900
01:45:58.571 --> 01:46:02.981
<v Speaker 1>the woman encounters this mysterious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive male and teams.</v>

1901
01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the female hero myth as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell,</v>

1902
01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:14.120
<v Speaker 1>it's beauty and the beast and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1903
01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:20.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fun in taming someone who's </v>

1904
01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:22.031
<v Speaker 1>already tame and what makes you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you really want someone who's many </v>

1905
01:46:22.031 --> 01:46:22.100
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no interest in that.</v>

1906
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Plus when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1907
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:29.590
<v Speaker 1>when chaos manifests itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think that someone team </v>

1908
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:33.881
<v Speaker 1>is going to be good for anything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real question and so that </v>

1909
01:46:33.881 --> 01:46:36.620
<v Speaker 1>aggression is absolutely vital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely necessary,</v>

1910
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:40.640
<v Speaker 1>but because it's incredibly dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course it is,</v>

1911
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:45.410
<v Speaker 1>it has to be civilized and so what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is that the archetypal female in</v>

1912
01:46:45.411 --> 01:46:49.040
<v Speaker 1>these pornographic romances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seduces and tames,</v>

1913
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:53.220
<v Speaker 1>aggressive male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's her encounter with chaos.</v>

1914
01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Now it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more,</v>

1915
01:46:55.690 --> 01:47:00.690
<v Speaker 1>of course females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more complicated and that's </v>

1916
01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:03.321
<v Speaker 1>exactly how it is and it's no wonder </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there their lives are more </v>

1917
01:47:03.321 --> 01:47:03.321
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>

1918
01:47:03.321 --> 01:47:05.050
<v Speaker 1>so back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1919
01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:11.160
<v Speaker 1>So this map isn't predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty and beast story and I don't know </v>

1920
01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.720
<v Speaker 1>what to do about that at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

1921
01:47:12.721 --> 01:47:17.721
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go with this map for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time being because it's been the </v>

1922
01:47:17.721 --> 01:47:20.181
<v Speaker 1>dominant one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the archetypical son whose </v>

1923
01:47:20.181 --> 01:47:20.460
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an adversary that's cane versus able,</v>

1924
01:47:20.461 --> 01:47:25.461
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a table versus cane hero versus </v>

1925
01:47:25.461 --> 01:47:29.100
<v Speaker 1>adversary and then that that that Dyad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hostile brothers,</v>

1926
01:47:29.101 --> 01:47:31.770
<v Speaker 1>that's the Motif,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological motif that that lays out.</v>

1927
01:47:31.771 --> 01:47:36.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a very common mythological motif </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nested inside the social order of</v>

1928
01:47:36.601 --> 01:47:41.601
<v Speaker 1>order versus tyranny and that's nested </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the destruction and creation of </v>

1929
01:47:41.601 --> 01:47:46.221
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of that is nested inside </v>

1930
01:47:46.221 --> 01:47:49.250
<v Speaker 1>the dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's interesting because you say </v>

1931
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:54.590
<v Speaker 1>this is you have the the entity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows and that's the hero,</v>

1932
01:47:57.811 --> 01:48:02.811
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the structure within </v>
<v Speaker 1>which that entity is operating and then </v>

1933
01:48:02.811 --> 01:48:05.160
<v Speaker 1>you have the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the sun,</v>

1934
01:48:05.161 --> 01:48:06.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the mother,</v>

1935
01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:11.660
<v Speaker 1>the mother stands for chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but outside of that there's this </v>

1936
01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:14.430
<v Speaker 1>additional chaos that's paradoxical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

1937
01:48:14.431 --> 01:48:19.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you need to have two kinds of </v>

1938
01:48:19.431 --> 01:48:19.431
<v Speaker 1>chaos?</v>

1939
01:48:19.431 --> 01:48:21.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's where things get ridiculously</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

1940
01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:27.680
<v Speaker 1>The little or chaos is what's defined in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what you already know,</v>

1941
01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:32.860
<v Speaker 1>so it's manageable in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that which combined with what you </v>

1942
01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:37.181
<v Speaker 1>already know can bring something forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a sexual metaphor in that </v>

1943
01:48:37.181 --> 01:48:38.120
<v Speaker 1>you take what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take something you don't know,</v>

1944
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't enough to overwhelm this and </v>

1945
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:46.751
<v Speaker 1>this isn't enough to suppress this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two come together in a creative </v>

1946
01:48:46.751 --> 01:48:49.580
<v Speaker 1>union and something new is born from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the Holy Father,</v>

1947
01:48:49.581 --> 01:48:52.250
<v Speaker 1>the holy mother bang and the hero that </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges out of that.</v>

1948
01:48:52.610 --> 01:48:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the chaos that so </v>

1949
01:48:57.610 --> 01:48:59.411
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming that it just demolishes </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and it's the ultimate source </v>

1950
01:48:59.411 --> 01:49:04.181
<v Speaker 1>of what's known and what's unknown in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to what's known and the </v>

1951
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:09.250
<v Speaker 1>knower itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's symbolized by this dragon of </v>

1952
01:49:10.081 --> 01:49:12.090
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to show you another way of</v>

1953
01:49:12.091 --> 01:49:16.740
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most primordial of symbols.</v>

1954
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Here's the PSG and idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Child occupies a circumscribed domain of</v>

1955
01:49:24.241 --> 01:49:29.241
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The child applies that domain of </v>

1956
01:49:29.241 --> 01:49:29.520
<v Speaker 1>knowledge to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally that works.</v>

1957
01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something unexpected happens,</v>

1958
01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:38.480
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that unexpected thing can be </v>

1959
01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.600
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cataclysmic significance.</v>

1960
01:49:39.601 --> 01:49:44.601
<v Speaker 1>Let's say if it's too overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child will just cry and then the </v>

1961
01:49:44.601 --> 01:49:45.990
<v Speaker 1>parent comes in and fixes up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous thing,</v>

1962
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:50.380
<v Speaker 1>but the child's and playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1963
01:49:50.410 --> 01:49:55.410
<v Speaker 1>pushes his food off the table or pushes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spoon off the table and watches it </v>

1964
01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:59.041
<v Speaker 1>fall and is playing and he's playing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge of order and chaos trying to </v>

1965
01:49:59.041 --> 01:50:03.930
<v Speaker 1>expand his knowledge domains at the rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is most palatable to him.</v>

1966
01:50:04.141 --> 01:50:04.600
<v Speaker 1>We'll say,</v>

1967
01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Speaker 1>so what's happening precisely?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1968
01:50:12.551 --> 01:50:17.551
<v Speaker 1>you can say that the child is in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific place and is doing a specific </v>

1969
01:50:17.551 --> 01:50:21.031
<v Speaker 1>thing with the specific outcome or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can generalize from that and you can </v>

1970
01:50:21.031 --> 01:50:21.031
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1971
01:50:21.031 --> 01:50:24.781
<v Speaker 1>the child is occupying a structured is </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupying a structure,</v>

1972
01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:30.151
<v Speaker 1>a cognitive structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's that which is outside the </v>

1973
01:50:30.151 --> 01:50:31.660
<v Speaker 1>cognitive structure and then you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1974
01:50:31.661 --> 01:50:35.560
<v Speaker 1>well how do you conceptualize that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is outside the cognitive structure</v>

1975
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:41.070
<v Speaker 1>and now answer to that is you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's outside the cognitive </v>

1976
01:50:41.070 --> 01:50:44.161
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still exists and so here's a way </v>

1977
01:50:44.161 --> 01:50:44.161
<v Speaker 1>of conceptualizing it.</v>

1978
01:50:47.530 --> 01:50:52.530
<v Speaker 1>What's outside?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cognitive structure is latent </v>

1979
01:50:52.530 --> 01:50:56.341
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a domain of latent information and </v>

1980
01:50:56.471 --> 01:51:00.100
<v Speaker 1>information means in formation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1981
01:51:00.101 --> 01:51:03.160
<v Speaker 1>And so what you're trying to do when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go beyond your knowledge structure is to</v>

1982
01:51:03.161 --> 01:51:08.161
<v Speaker 1>look for new regularities in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that you can map and </v>

1983
01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:09.310
<v Speaker 1>incorporate them into your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your structure,</v>

1984
01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:15.060
<v Speaker 1>but that that domain of and information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's chaos itself and that's what's </v>

1985
01:51:15.421 --> 01:51:18.850
<v Speaker 1>symbolized by the dragon of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why its Predator,</v>

1986
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:24.000
<v Speaker 1>multidimensional Predator plus thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that holds treasure at the same time </v>

1987
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.990
<v Speaker 1>because in order for us to guard </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>

1988
01:51:25.991 --> 01:51:30.991
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order for us to guard ourselves </v>

1989
01:51:30.991 --> 01:51:33.841
<v Speaker 1>properly against the internal eternal </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of the absolute unknown,</v>

1990
01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:38.770
<v Speaker 1>we had to conceptualize it first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say absolute unknown.</v>

1991
01:51:38.771 --> 01:51:39.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1992
01:51:39.321 --> 01:51:44.321
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's such a strange </v>

1993
01:51:44.321 --> 01:51:46.561
<v Speaker 1>category?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the category of all things that </v>

1994
01:51:46.561 --> 01:51:46.561
<v Speaker 1>have not yet been categorized.</v>

1995
01:51:46.561 --> 01:51:49.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the antithesis of zero.</v>

1996
01:51:49.781 --> 01:51:52.690
<v Speaker 1>It took people a long time to come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of zero.</v>

1997
01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:55.600
<v Speaker 1>It's such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the category that contains nothing.</v>

1998
01:51:55.750 --> 01:52:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you need a category like that </v>

1999
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:00.750
<v Speaker 1>for well to do mathematics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

2000
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:05.250
<v Speaker 1>this category is the category of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have not yet been mastered </v>

2001
01:52:05.250 --> 01:52:08.770
<v Speaker 1>and your job is to be a master of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>category of all things that have not yet</v>

2002
01:52:08.771 --> 01:52:12.040
<v Speaker 1>been mastered and you're not going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that until you can conceptualize it.</v>

2003
01:52:12.041 --> 01:52:17.020
<v Speaker 1>You conceptualize it with the gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoarding,</v>

2004
01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Metta Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's your opponent and your </v>

2005
01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.610
<v Speaker 1>job is not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your job is to know how to confront that</v>

2006
01:52:24.611 --> 01:52:29.611
<v Speaker 1>continually and to extract out from it </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it holds is value and that's the </v>

2007
01:52:29.611 --> 01:52:32.320
<v Speaker 1>permanent solution to the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's never going to go away,</v>

2008
01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:32.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2009
01:52:32.650 --> 01:52:36.520
<v Speaker 1>It's an eternal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you can do is master it the same way</v>

2010
01:52:36.521 --> 01:52:41.521
<v Speaker 1>that a surfer masters await you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>master it in the process of mastering </v>

2011
01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:46.621
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no solution to the problem </v>

2012
01:52:46.621 --> 01:52:46.700
<v Speaker 1>except the solution of continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastery,</v>

2013
01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:51.080
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're shaped transforming wizard.</v>

2014
01:52:51.290 --> 01:52:56.290
<v Speaker 1>That's doing its best to keep up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the continual transformation of that </v>

2015
01:52:56.290 --> 01:52:59.981
<v Speaker 1>which you do not yet understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's absolutely no </v>

2016
01:52:59.981 --> 01:53:03.491
<v Speaker 1>difference between that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this thing that women chase in their</v>

2017
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>pornographic fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

2018
01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.460
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word wall,</v>

2019
01:53:08.461 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 1>so good example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the vampire,</v>

2020
01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:12.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2021
01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:17.360
<v Speaker 1>there's this capacity for what's normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>to transform into something that's </v>

2022
01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:21.041
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily aggressive and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest mastery as a consequence of </v>

2023
01:53:21.041 --> 01:53:24.581
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the transforming spirit and it </v>

2024
01:53:24.581 --> 01:53:27.791
<v Speaker 1>can transform itself and it without </v>
<v Speaker 1>bound and certainly in directions that </v>

2025
01:53:27.791 --> 01:53:30.590
<v Speaker 1>aren't socially acceptable.</v>

2026
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

2027
01:53:32.331 --> 01:53:37.331
<v Speaker 1>there's a line you want to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>push and that's again why in in the </v>

2028
01:53:37.331 --> 01:53:37.331
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry,</v>

2029
01:53:37.490 --> 01:53:42.490
<v Speaker 1>first of all is touched by evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>second is always breaking rules </v>

2030
01:53:42.490 --> 01:53:42.490
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2031
01:53:42.490 --> 01:53:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And he's the most favored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So interesting because he's the most </v>

2032
01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:49.070
<v Speaker 1>favored of Dumbledore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely because he knows when to break</v>

2033
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:54.071
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's so interesting because </v>

2034
01:53:54.071 --> 01:53:54.071
<v Speaker 1>double door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

2035
01:53:54.071 --> 01:53:57.371
<v Speaker 1>is the spirit of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the patriarchy for all </v>

2036
01:53:57.371 --> 01:54:00.461
<v Speaker 1>intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his favorite is that child that </v>

2037
01:54:00.461 --> 01:54:03.290
<v Speaker 1>refer refuses to abide by the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchy,</v>

2038
01:54:03.291 --> 01:54:05.690
<v Speaker 1>but only under the proper circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2039
01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:10.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't sacrifice the old rule unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a reason for doing so.</v>

2040
01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:16.600
<v Speaker 1>The thing you're doing has to be better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the thing that you would be </v>

2041
01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:18.920
<v Speaker 1>compelled to do by the old rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to dare to do it.</v>

2042
01:54:19.190 --> 01:54:19.850
<v Speaker 1>And you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2043
01:54:19.851 --> 01:54:22.670
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do that unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're already touched to some degree by</v>

2044
01:54:22.671 --> 01:54:26.000
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>

2045
01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:28.490
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2046
01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:34.940
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another way of thinking about it.</v>

2047
01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:41.450
<v Speaker 1>The winged reptile is a thing of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and a thing of the sky.</v>

2048
01:54:41.451 --> 01:54:45.230
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about it as a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>of matter and to thing of spirit.</v>

2049
01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>

2050
01:54:47.211 --> 01:54:48.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly does that mean?</v>

2051
01:54:48.621 --> 01:54:51.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of the union of spirit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

2052
01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:53.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's matter?</v>

2053
01:54:53.810 --> 01:54:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

2054
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:58.190
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't just the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also what matters.</v>

2055
01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.070
<v Speaker 1>And what spirit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2056
01:55:01.071 --> 01:55:06.020
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that flies free of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>material world that's above the ground,</v>

2057
01:55:06.021 --> 01:55:11.021
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in the theoretical space that's </v>

2058
01:55:11.021 --> 01:55:11.021
<v Speaker 1>up in heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also whatever it is in us,</v>

2059
01:55:11.021 --> 01:55:12.980
<v Speaker 1>that psyche or spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2060
01:55:12.981 --> 01:55:13.940
<v Speaker 1>so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2061
01:55:13.941 --> 01:55:15.320
<v Speaker 1>what's the origin of that</v>

2062
01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:17.750
<v Speaker 3>chaos?</v>

2063
01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:23.960
<v Speaker 1>And we can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put that out as a </v>

2064
01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:26.331
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to put it out as an extension of </v>

2065
01:55:26.331 --> 01:55:26.760
<v Speaker 1>what we've been saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the child,</v>

2066
01:55:27.570 --> 01:55:32.570
<v Speaker 1>the child bootstraps itself up from </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing roughly speaking right through </v>

2067
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:37.011
<v Speaker 1>its developmental process is the merges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a fully fledged nervous system and </v>

2068
01:55:37.011 --> 01:55:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it produces cognitive structures within </v>
<v Speaker 1>which it exists and views the world.</v>

2069
01:55:40.651 --> 01:55:45.651
<v Speaker 1>But there's something outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive structures and that's this </v>

2070
01:55:45.651 --> 01:55:49.101
<v Speaker 1>latent information will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then we could say that latent </v>

2071
01:55:49.101 --> 01:55:50.970
<v Speaker 1>information is properly conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 1>as matter and spirit.</v>

2072
01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you investigate it,</v>

2073
01:55:53.670 --> 01:55:58.670
<v Speaker 1>when you interact with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you parse it into the world and into </v>

2074
01:55:58.670 --> 01:56:03.081
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means to be informed by </v>

2075
01:56:03.081 --> 01:56:03.570
<v Speaker 1>your contact with the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It informs you.</v>

2076
01:56:03.870 --> 01:56:06.930
<v Speaker 1>It makes you more than you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's like your extra.</v>

2077
01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:11.340
<v Speaker 1>That's the resource you're extracting </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the absolute unknown.</v>

2078
01:56:11.341 --> 01:56:14.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the information that allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstitute your being.</v>

2079
01:56:14.370 --> 01:56:17.910
<v Speaker 1>At the same time you differentiate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the world,</v>

2080
01:56:18.210 --> 01:56:23.210
<v Speaker 1>so matter emerges from the latent </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and what matters and you </v>

2081
01:56:23.791 --> 01:56:25.920
<v Speaker 1>emerge from the latent information in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2082
01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:30.180
<v Speaker 1>this dialogical process that involves </v>
<v Speaker 1>your continual exploration.</v>

2083
01:56:30.181 --> 01:56:31.920
<v Speaker 1>You build yourself and you build the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

2084
01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:36.540
<v Speaker 1>and so the dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wing dragon of chaos that guards the</v>

2085
01:56:36.541 --> 01:56:40.830
<v Speaker 1>gold is the latest information that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you explore,</v>

2086
01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:43.440
<v Speaker 1>enables you to build yourself and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate the world.</v>

2087
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>

2088
01:56:46.290 --> 01:56:46.650
<v Speaker 1>This.</v>

2089
01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:53.690
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the great stories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind and it's not.</v>

2090
01:56:54.230 --> 01:56:56.270
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the only variant of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

2091
01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:58.610
<v Speaker 1>There's many variants of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2092
01:57:00.850 --> 01:57:03.820
<v Speaker 1>but this variant is useful for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our purposes.</v>

2093
01:57:05.410 --> 01:57:07.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a story I stumbled across a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago.</v>

2094
01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you the second story </v>
<v Speaker 1>first because I don't have the energy to</v>

2095
01:57:13.151 --> 01:57:18.151
<v Speaker 1>tell you the first story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a story that the ancient </v>

2096
01:57:18.151 --> 01:57:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians predicated their society on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to understand this story,</v>

2097
01:57:21.941 --> 01:57:26.941
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you have to know is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters were in these characters </v>

2098
01:57:26.941 --> 01:57:26.941
<v Speaker 1>were gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's four of them.</v>

2099
01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Although the Egyptians had far more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>four gods.</v>

2100
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:35.310
<v Speaker 1>You might think of these as the central </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gods and you might think what is the </v>

2101
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:36.520
<v Speaker 1>central God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>

2102
01:57:36.521 --> 01:57:41.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that the gods compete for </v>

2103
01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:43.201
<v Speaker 1>dominance across time in people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginations and some gods when they </v>

2104
01:57:44.921 --> 01:57:48.100
<v Speaker 1>occupied the primary position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance in the hierarchy,</v>

2105
01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:53.280
<v Speaker 1>in the dominance hierarchy of gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are ideals and ideals compete </v>

2106
01:57:53.650 --> 01:57:56.470
<v Speaker 1>across time for dominance and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied.</v>

2107
01:57:56.860 --> 01:58:00.340
<v Speaker 1>And so when diverse tribal people come </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

2108
01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:04.900
<v Speaker 1>they throw all their gods into the ring </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they fight across time and something</v>

2109
01:58:04.901 --> 01:58:09.901
<v Speaker 1>emerges as a victor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the emergence of monotheism </v>

2110
01:58:09.901 --> 01:58:13.621
<v Speaker 1>out of polytheism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it parallels the development of a </v>

2111
01:58:13.851 --> 01:58:18.851
<v Speaker 1>unified morality in within each of us as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we develop across time and the the god </v>

2112
01:58:24.131 --> 01:58:27.850
<v Speaker 1>that emerges as dominant across time </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears a substantial,</v>

2113
01:58:27.851 --> 01:58:30.190
<v Speaker 1>represent a substantial</v>

2114
01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:36.460
<v Speaker 1>resemblance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you have a set of gods in this </v>

2115
01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:37.430
<v Speaker 1>locale that are competing across time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and something emerges as dominant,</v>

2116
01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and then over here you have another set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gods that compete across time,</v>

2117
01:58:41.110 --> 01:58:46.110
<v Speaker 1>dominance and something emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see major commonalities across </v>

2118
01:58:46.110 --> 01:58:48.940
<v Speaker 1>the two things that emerge and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is because the emergent,</v>

2119
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:54.070
<v Speaker 1>the process of emergence that gives rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>to both of them is similar in both </v>

2120
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:55.390
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of what accounts for the</v>

2121
01:58:55.391 --> 01:59:00.391
<v Speaker 1>cross cultural similarity of high order </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious ideas.</v>

2122
01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:02.380
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

2123
01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:04.690
<v Speaker 1>you need to know the characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2124
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus Cyrus is the old king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Dumbledore.</v>

2125
01:59:11.051 --> 01:59:13.180
<v Speaker 1>For all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the old king.</v>

2126
01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:18.660
<v Speaker 1>He's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the spirit that established the </v>

2127
01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was young,</v>

2128
01:59:19.001 --> 01:59:22.300
<v Speaker 1>he was a great hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now he's old and he's willing.</v>

2129
01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:26.010
<v Speaker 1>He's archaic and he's willfully blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Cyrus.</v>

2130
01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:31.800
<v Speaker 1>He has a brother Seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth is set and set is Satan because the</v>

2131
01:59:32.651 --> 01:59:37.540
<v Speaker 1>word Satan comes from the word Seth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>set via the Coptic Christians.</v>

2132
01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:38.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

2133
01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:42.610
<v Speaker 1>So he's a precursor to the western idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Satan.</v>

2134
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:46.720
<v Speaker 1>You have isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis is queen of the underworld,</v>

2135
01:59:46.721 --> 01:59:51.721
<v Speaker 1>and Isis was the goddess of a religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that prevailed across </v>

2136
01:59:53.831 --> 01:59:58.300
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis and you have horace.</v>

2137
01:59:58.750 --> 02:00:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Horace is a Falcon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Egyptian,</v>

2138
02:00:01.991 --> 02:00:06.991
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's knows that I write with the </v>

2139
02:00:06.991 --> 02:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>open pupil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's horace.</v>

2140
02:00:07.330 --> 02:00:10.840
<v Speaker 1>And Horace is a falcon because falcons </v>
<v Speaker 1>can see way better.</v>

2141
02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>They can see better than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can see better than anything else </v>

2142
02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>except for perhaps eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they fly above everything.</v>

2143
02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Zazu in lion king is horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2144
02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And [inaudible] Fossa is Cyrus and scar </v>
<v Speaker 1>is seth.</v>

2145
02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>And there's no specific representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Isis,</v>

2146
02:00:32.281 --> 02:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>but the closest there is in that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>is probably the queen of the hyenas.</v>

2147
02:00:36.781 --> 02:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>That's played by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actress.</v>

2148
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Um Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2149
02:00:43.021 --> 02:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Whoopi Goldberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2150
02:00:44.371 --> 02:00:45.220
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because she.</v>

2151
02:00:45.450 --> 02:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>They inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like the queen of the underworld,</v>

2152
02:00:48.121 --> 02:00:53.121
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the queen of the hyenas that live </v>

2153
02:00:53.121 --> 02:00:53.121
<v Speaker 1>out in among the death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>

2154
02:00:53.121 --> 02:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth Osiris,</v>

2155
02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>seth,</v>

2156
02:00:58.890 --> 02:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and horace.</v>

2157
02:01:00.570 --> 02:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Here's how the story goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2158
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>cirrus is a great cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He established the Egyptian state.</v>

2159
02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>You could think about him as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of the,</v>

2160
02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:13.940
<v Speaker 1>of Egyptian custom and tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about a as the thing that </v>

2161
02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>the pyramid represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2162
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>but he was great when he was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not young anymore.</v>

2163
02:01:18.241 --> 02:01:23.241
<v Speaker 1>He's old and he's willfully blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that he doesn't </v>

2164
02:01:23.241 --> 02:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>see what he could see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He refuses to see what he could see.</v>

2165
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Why is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2166
02:01:26.241 --> 02:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>cirrus old and willfully blind because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what culture is.</v>

2167
02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:35.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a paternal spirit that's old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>willfully blind and it's always that </v>

2168
02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always that way,</v>

2169
02:01:35.311 --> 02:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a construction of the dad.</v>

2170
02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>The Dad aren't alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

2171
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>so they're out of date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't update themselves anymore and</v>

2172
02:01:44.121 --> 02:01:49.121
<v Speaker 1>you inhabit their corpse and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually what happens in an earlier </v>

2173
02:01:49.121 --> 02:01:52.211
<v Speaker 1>story that I'll tell you next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that early Mesopotamian gods inhabited </v>

2174
02:01:52.281 --> 02:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>the corpse of their father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking anyway.</v>

2175
02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:56.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2176
02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus was great and when he was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't young anymore.</v>

2177
02:01:59.991 --> 02:02:04.991
<v Speaker 1>He's old and he's willfully blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won't look where he knows he should </v>

2178
02:02:04.991 --> 02:02:08.291
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have the energy or maybe he </v>

2179
02:02:08.291 --> 02:02:10.091
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brother Seth is not a good guy and </v>

2180
02:02:10.091 --> 02:02:14.871
<v Speaker 1>no cyrus knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he underestimates his malevolence </v>

2181
02:02:14.871 --> 02:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so seth wants to rule the kingdom.</v>

2182
02:02:16.190 --> 02:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

2183
02:02:18.170 --> 02:02:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Every stable society is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is threatened by willful blindness and </v>

2184
02:02:23.170 --> 02:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>malevolence always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every bureaucracy has that proclivity to</v>

2185
02:02:27.981 --> 02:02:32.981
<v Speaker 1>stagnate and to become blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why corporations die all the </v>

2186
02:02:32.981 --> 02:02:36.791
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why a fortune 500 company only </v>

2187
02:02:36.791 --> 02:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why we have to have elections.</v>

2188
02:02:37.731 --> 02:02:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It's to stop the Dad from staying in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control for too long.</v>

2189
02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Seth Cyrus turns a blind eye to seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth is happy about that same thing </v>

2190
02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:48.710
<v Speaker 1>happens in the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

2191
02:02:49.130 --> 02:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Seth one day waits for a cyrus to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake and to be weak,</v>

2192
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>and he attacks him and he chops it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into pieces and he distributed to the </v>

2193
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.020
<v Speaker 1>pieces across the entire Egyptian state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2194
02:03:00.021 --> 02:03:03.260
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians regarded their provinces </v>
<v Speaker 1>as pieces of,</v>

2195
02:03:03.261 --> 02:03:04.400
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus's body.</v>

2196
02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you can kill or cyrus because </v>

2197
02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:10.700
<v Speaker 1>he's a god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is he god a God?</v>

2198
02:03:10.701 --> 02:03:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Because he represents the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and there's always structure.</v>

2199
02:03:15.531 --> 02:03:18.530
<v Speaker 1>It can't be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always reconstitutes itself.</v>

2200
02:03:18.531 --> 02:03:23.531
<v Speaker 1>It can be hurt and broken into pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what happens to a </v>

2201
02:03:23.531 --> 02:03:24.440
<v Speaker 1>cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart.</v>

2202
02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they get old and because </v>

2203
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.220
<v Speaker 1>malevolence undermines them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Egyptians were trying to</v>

2204
02:03:31.221 --> 02:03:32.120
<v Speaker 1>sort out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2205
02:03:32.121 --> 02:03:34.710
<v Speaker 1>so seth distributes is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2206
02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:38.540
<v Speaker 1>cyrus all over Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he can't get himself back together.</v>

2207
02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart and they can't be </v>

2208
02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>brought back together.</v>

2209
02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:44.930
<v Speaker 1>But the spirit of Vocera still lives in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pieces.</v>

2210
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:47.900
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orders demolished.</v>

2211
02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.420
<v Speaker 1>What would you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos emerges.</v>

2212
02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:53.660
<v Speaker 1>That's isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis is queen of the underworld.</v>

2213
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:57.740
<v Speaker 1>She's Cyrus's wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order and chaos.</v>

2214
02:03:57.741 --> 02:04:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Just like the Yin and the Yang order </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses.</v>

2215
02:04:00.981 --> 02:04:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Up comes the queen of the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's looking for order.</v>

2216
02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Chaos cries out for order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's looking for order.</v>

2217
02:04:07.130 --> 02:04:09.920
<v Speaker 1>She goes all around Egypt trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>

2218
02:04:09.921 --> 02:04:13.220
<v Speaker 1>So Cyrus back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a state of chaos.</v>

2219
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:16.580
<v Speaker 1>She finds this fellas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She makes herself pregnant with it.</v>

2220
02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:18.620
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2221
02:04:18.621 --> 02:04:22.610
<v Speaker 1>it means it's like it's like Japan in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the belly of the whale.</v>

2222
02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:26.240
<v Speaker 1>That thing has the potential to reemerge</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2223
02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:28.880
<v Speaker 1>The thing that collapses into its </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces,</v>

2224
02:04:28.881 --> 02:04:33.881
<v Speaker 1>it's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can unite with the chaos and produce </v>

2225
02:04:33.881 --> 02:04:38.261
<v Speaker 1>something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of the disillusion of </v>

2226
02:04:38.261 --> 02:04:39.330
<v Speaker 1>structure into chaos and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverification.</v>

2227
02:04:40.930 --> 02:04:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Isis makes herself pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes back down to the underworld.</v>

2228
02:04:43.681 --> 02:04:47.600
<v Speaker 1>She gives birth to horace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horace is the Egyptian I show.</v>

2229
02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:50.610
<v Speaker 1>He's the son of the great father and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great mother.</v>

2230
02:04:50.611 --> 02:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a mess.</v>

2231
02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Cyanic figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

2232
02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:58.730
<v Speaker 1>much of the mythology that described </v>
<v Speaker 1>horace was extracted without much </v>

2233
02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>modification and then attributed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

2234
02:05:01.921 --> 02:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Very much memory and you can read about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parallels.</v>

2235
02:05:04.570 --> 02:05:09.570
<v Speaker 1>You read about it online if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's any number of parallels and of </v>

2236
02:05:09.570 --> 02:05:12.060
<v Speaker 1>course there is a mythology that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews came out of Egypt and of course the</v>

2237
02:05:12.061 --> 02:05:17.061
<v Speaker 1>Christians emerged from the juice and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a tremendous influence of </v>

2238
02:05:17.061 --> 02:05:20.751
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian thinking on the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these later ideas and you see pictures </v>

2239
02:05:20.751 --> 02:05:25.431
<v Speaker 1>of Isis with horace on her lap that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually identical in content and form </v>

2240
02:05:25.431 --> 02:05:28.170
<v Speaker 1>to the later pictures of Mary with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant Christ.</v>

2241
02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:31.140
<v Speaker 1>But that's the holy mother of God in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>

2242
02:05:31.170 --> 02:05:35.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not a Christian motif,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's far deeper than a Christian motif.</v>

2243
02:05:35.071 --> 02:05:37.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a human motif,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so isis,</v>

2244
02:05:37.531 --> 02:05:40.500
<v Speaker 1>queen of the underworld gives birth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>horace,</v>

2245
02:05:40.501 --> 02:05:44.580
<v Speaker 1>and horace grows up outside the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why in underworld?</v>

2246
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what human beings do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're alienated from your culture </v>

2247
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:52.590
<v Speaker 1>always why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's old and dead and corrupt,</v>

2248
02:05:52.830 --> 02:05:55.200
<v Speaker 1>and so that leaves you growing up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

2249
02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:58.830
<v Speaker 1>What would you call alienated from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental culture?</v>

2250
02:05:59.430 --> 02:06:02.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of adolescence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horace grows up.</v>

2251
02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>He can see that's what differentiates </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from,</v>

2252
02:06:05.991 --> 02:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus,</v>

2253
02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:09.840
<v Speaker 1>that's why he's a falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes and has a fight with seth,</v>

2254
02:06:09.841 --> 02:06:14.841
<v Speaker 1>and now the difference between Osiris </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Horus is that horse does not </v>

2255
02:06:14.841 --> 02:06:16.290
<v Speaker 1>underestimate seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows exactly what he's up against.</v>

2256
02:06:16.330 --> 02:06:19.860
<v Speaker 1>He goes and has a terrible battle with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him trying to get his kingdom back.</v>

2257
02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Something else that's echoed in the lion</v>
<v Speaker 1>king story and well horus and or seth or</v>

2258
02:06:26.191 --> 02:06:28.740
<v Speaker 1>fighting seth terrorists out one of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

2259
02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2260
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Because Seth is the embodiment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction and malevolence,</v>

2261
02:06:34.381 --> 02:06:38.760
<v Speaker 1>and no matter how conscious you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter that even voluntarily,</v>

2262
02:06:38.761 --> 02:06:43.761
<v Speaker 1>the probability that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage your consciousness is </v>

2263
02:06:43.761 --> 02:06:46.170
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's white people don't do it,</v>

2264
02:06:47.190 --> 02:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>so the eyes torn out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seth is defeated and Horace banishes</v>

2265
02:06:52.501 --> 02:06:54.270
<v Speaker 1>him to the nether regions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdom.</v>

2266
02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:56.280
<v Speaker 1>You can't kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2267
02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Because the malevolent destructive </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest to threatened states never dies.</v>

2268
02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:05.670
<v Speaker 1>It's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only remove it temporarily.</v>

2269
02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horace is King Pharaoh,</v>

2270
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:12.150
<v Speaker 1>King God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his eyes and so you think,</v>

2271
02:07:12.151 --> 02:07:17.151
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to just pop that back in his </v>

2272
02:07:17.151 --> 02:07:17.151
<v Speaker 1>hand and then he's going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead.</v>

2273
02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:20.280
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be able to take his place </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the upper most pantheon,</v>

2274
02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:24.870
<v Speaker 1>pantheon of gods properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what he does.</v>

2275
02:07:25.650 --> 02:07:28.440
<v Speaker 1>He takes his eye and he goes back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>

2276
02:07:28.890 --> 02:07:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Just like Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going into the depths to rescue Japan </v>

2277
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Eto and down there is the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus who's,</v>

2278
02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:37.690
<v Speaker 1>who's extend as a kind of half dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghost.</v>

2279
02:07:40.170 --> 02:07:40.870
<v Speaker 1>It gives us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2280
02:07:40.910 --> 02:07:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now will cyrus can see.</v>

2281
02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:49.990
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go down into the chaotic,</v>

2282
02:07:50.230 --> 02:07:55.230
<v Speaker 1>when threatened by malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even to the point of damage to your </v>

2283
02:07:55.781 --> 02:08:00.781
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go down into the chaos and you find </v>

2284
02:08:00.781 --> 02:08:04.231
<v Speaker 1>the dead spirit of your tradition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you give it vision and so provided with </v>

2285
02:08:06.041 --> 02:08:11.041
<v Speaker 1>vision or Cyrus regenerates and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>Osiris and horus go back up to to to the</v>

2286
02:08:11.321 --> 02:08:16.321
<v Speaker 1>world linked together and rule jointly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Egyptians believed that the </v>

2287
02:08:18.881 --> 02:08:23.881
<v Speaker 1>Pharaoh who had an immortal spirit was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the embodiment of the conjunction of </v>

2288
02:08:24.371 --> 02:08:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Horus and Osiris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what gave him sovereignty.</v>

2289
02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:30.460
<v Speaker 1>So you think about how brilliant that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2290
02:08:30.461 --> 02:08:33.520
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians are trying to puzzle out </v>
<v Speaker 1>who should lead,</v>

2291
02:08:34.090 --> 02:08:36.190
<v Speaker 1>who should be pharaoh and what do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be?</v>

2292
02:08:36.191 --> 02:08:38.620
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be pharaoh in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>for things to work,</v>

2293
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:45.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to be awake to malevolence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and you have to embody your </v>

2294
02:08:46.481 --> 02:08:51.481
<v Speaker 1>tradition and that puts you at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest pinnacle of the dominant </v>

2295
02:08:51.481 --> 02:08:51.670
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

2296
02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:55.720
<v Speaker 1>It's and that's the same as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

2297
02:08:56.020 --> 02:09:01.020
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing as the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the gods across centuries or </v>

2298
02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Ian's and the emergence of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible moral virtue.</v>

2299
02:09:05.291 --> 02:09:10.291
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of that competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the eye on the top of the pyramid,</v>

2300
02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:12.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2301
02:09:12.690 --> 02:09:15.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Washington monument there's a cap</v>

2302
02:09:15.041 --> 02:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>on the Washington monument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the protopic,</v>

2303
02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:20.680
<v Speaker 1>The Washington monument is a pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the top of the pyramid is a cap.</v>

2304
02:09:20.681 --> 02:09:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of aluminum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason it's made out of aluminum</v>

2305
02:09:24.101 --> 02:09:25.990
<v Speaker 1>is because when they made the Washington</v>
<v Speaker 1>monument,</v>

2306
02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:29.470
<v Speaker 1>it was the most valuable metal known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what does it mean?</v>

2307
02:09:29.770 --> 02:09:32.710
<v Speaker 1>It means there's a pyramid and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something at the top of it,</v>

2308
02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that's taught at the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the pyramid isn't the same as the </v>

2309
02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:38.710
<v Speaker 1>rest of the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

2310
02:09:39.130 --> 02:09:41.380
<v Speaker 1>The pyramid exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a dominance hierarchy.</v>

2311
02:09:41.381 --> 02:09:46.381
<v Speaker 1>Something climbs up to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just at the top of one </v>

2312
02:09:46.381 --> 02:09:47.590
<v Speaker 1>pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at the top of all of them.</v>

2313
02:09:48.010 --> 02:09:51.700
<v Speaker 1>The thing that rises to the top of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>given pyramid is the same thing that can</v>

2314
02:09:51.701 --> 02:09:56.701
<v Speaker 1>dominate all pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't good enough to be the best at a</v>

2315
02:09:57.431 --> 02:10:02.431
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to be is the best at </v>

2316
02:10:02.431 --> 02:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>the set of all possible dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>

2317
02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that's gold at the </v>

2318
02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:09.720
<v Speaker 1>top of the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the eye.</v>

2319
02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:11.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Egyptians figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>

2320
02:10:12.340 --> 02:10:16.360
<v Speaker 1>It means the thing that puts you at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top is attention.</v>

2321
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your eyes open.</v>

2322
02:10:19.391 --> 02:10:22.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>

2323
02:10:23.890 --> 02:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about human beings is we </v>

2324
02:10:28.890 --> 02:10:32.971
<v Speaker 1>can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see better than any other </v>

2325
02:10:32.971 --> 02:10:36.001
<v Speaker 1>creature except birds of prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so our capacity to see is in fact </v>

2326
02:10:37.521 --> 02:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>what we'll use in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are actually organized around</v>

2327
02:10:40.551 --> 02:10:42.080
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike most animals,</v>

2328
02:10:42.081 --> 02:10:44.450
<v Speaker 1>their brains are organized around smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not us.</v>

2329
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:50.290
<v Speaker 1>We can see we stand upright so we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see a long distance and in our ability </v>

2330
02:10:50.290 --> 02:10:52.340
<v Speaker 1>to see is what saves us and what saves </v>
<v Speaker 1>our communities.</v>

2331
02:10:52.490 --> 02:10:55.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's what these stories are trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to portray.</v>

2332
02:10:57.080 --> 02:10:59.510
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why didn't people just say so?</v>

2333
02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:02.120
<v Speaker 1>An answer to that is because they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know</v>

2334
02:11:03.730 --> 02:11:06.880
<v Speaker 1>it took a long time to figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

2335
02:11:07.090 --> 02:11:11.930
<v Speaker 1>It's taken forever to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2336
02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:17.200
<v Speaker 1>it's part of what I hoped when I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>this book and part of the reason that </v>

2337
02:11:17.391 --> 02:11:22.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm teaching it is because it seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that it would be useful for everyone </v>

2338
02:11:22.391 --> 02:11:25.640
<v Speaker 1>to actually understand this instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just having it told as a story.</v>

2339
02:11:25.641 --> 02:11:26.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great,</v>

2340
02:11:26.571 --> 02:11:27.380
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2341
02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:31.010
<v Speaker 1>you need the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why not also just understand it</v>

2342
02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:33.370
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

2343
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:37.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what we're trying to do.</v>

2344
02:11:37.690 --> 02:11:39.010
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to understand this,</v>

2345
02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:40.900
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

2346
02:11:42.770 --> 02:11:43.940
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough for today.</v>
