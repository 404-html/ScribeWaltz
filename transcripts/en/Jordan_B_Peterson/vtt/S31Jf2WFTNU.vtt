00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Hi there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I'd update you with regards</v>

2
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>to what has been going on at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto in the last week.</v>

3
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.103
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I released my three videos </v>

4
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>starting on September 27th dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness,</v>

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the legislative level and in terms of</v>

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>certain policy decisions at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto,</v>

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.363
<v Speaker 1>most particularly the mandatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement that the human resources </v>

8
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>staff take a antiracism and antibiotics </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

9
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:36.384
<v Speaker 1>So on October 3rd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I received the first of two warning </v>

10
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>letters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.653
<v Speaker 1>telling me that I was required to act in</v>
<v Speaker 1>accordance with university policies and </v>

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.443
<v Speaker 1>with the relevant law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to read you the first </v>

13
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>but I'll read you the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I got on October 18th.</v>

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.593
<v Speaker 1>So dear Professor Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are writing in followup to professor </v>

16
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>ferber's letter to you of October 3rd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>

17
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Professor Ferber is the chair of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology department and um,</v>

18
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>she gave me the first letter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.853
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of her interactions </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a variety of administrators at the </v>

20
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:17.484
<v Speaker 1>university</v>
<v Speaker 1>regarding the ongoing concerns related </v>

21
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.314
<v Speaker 1>to your videos and complaints that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been made to the university by members </v>

22
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:26.514
<v Speaker 1>of the university community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including transgendered persons and the </v>

23
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>organizations that represent and support</v>
<v Speaker 1>them on campus about some of the content</v>

24
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>of those videos.</v>

25
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.953
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us be clear that the university is </v>

26
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:41.214
<v Speaker 1>committed to the protection of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>of speech as a core value for our </v>

27
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>community and for any university in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic society.</v>

28
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.943
<v Speaker 1>The university is likewise committed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting the academic freedom of our </v>

29
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:53.334
<v Speaker 1>faculty members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including their right to criticize the </v>

30
00:01:55.561 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>university and society at large with </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom from institutional censorship.</v>

31
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.613
<v Speaker 1>As articulated in article five of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Memorandum of agreement between the </v>

32
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto and the University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto Faculty Association,</v>

33
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.293
<v Speaker 1>the University's commitment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting these core values includes </v>

34
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:12.684
<v Speaker 1>your right to express and debate views </v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be discomforting or even </v>

35
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>offensive to others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

36
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>as professor ferber has already pointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to you,</v>

37
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>these rights are not without limitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and must be exercised in accordance with</v>

38
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>your responsibilities as a faculty </v>
<v Speaker 1>member,</v>

39
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.183
<v Speaker 1>including upholding applicable laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have continued to state public </v>

40
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.283
<v Speaker 1>publicly that if a student or colleague </v>
<v Speaker 1>or staff member requests that you </v>

41
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>referred to the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender neutral pronouns,</v>

42
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.003
<v Speaker 1>you will refuse to do so and that you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>not recognize the rights of others to </v>

43
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>tell you which personal pronoun to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>when addressing them.</v>

44
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.343
<v Speaker 1>The law of Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically the Ontario Human Rights </v>

45
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.033
<v Speaker 1>Code protects against discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on gender expression and gender </v>

46
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the context,</v>

47
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>if personal pronouns are being used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the refusal by a teacher or colleague to</v>

48
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:04.624
<v Speaker 1>use the personal pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an expression of the person's </v>

49
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>gender identity can constitute </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination.</v>

50
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.023
<v Speaker 1>In many situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not necessary to use personal </v>

51
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:16.994
<v Speaker 1>pronouns at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where it is the personal pronoun </v>

52
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:20.624
<v Speaker 1>that is chosen as the person's gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity related and gender expression </v>

53
00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:24.824
<v Speaker 1>related identifier should be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your statements that you will refuse to </v>

54
00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:30.044
<v Speaker 1>use transgendered your statements that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will refuse to refer to </v>

55
00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:35.114
<v Speaker 1>transgendered persons using gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral pronouns if they ask you to do </v>

56
00:03:38.361 --> 00:03:39.194
<v Speaker 1>so are contrary to the rights of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>persons to equal treatment without </v>

57
00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:47.030
<v Speaker 1>discrimination based on their gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity and gender expression.</v>

58
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.673
<v Speaker 1>You should also be aware that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of the university community are </v>

59
00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:52.034
<v Speaker 1>concerned and distressed about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>declarations of your discriminatory </v>

60
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:55.484
<v Speaker 1>intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The university has received </v>

61
00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:58.154
<v Speaker 1>communications from individual student </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups and employee groups that find my </v>

62
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:06.941
<v Speaker 1>comments to be unacceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally disturbing and painful.</v>

63
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.303
<v Speaker 1>Some members of the university community</v>
<v Speaker 1>report that the statements and the </v>

64
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 1>invective that has followed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensuing commentary and debates on social</v>

65
00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:20.990
<v Speaker 1>media have caused them to fear for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>safety on the university campus.</v>

66
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.603
<v Speaker 1>Some students have reported being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>target of specific and violent threats </v>

67
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.170
<v Speaker 1>including threats of assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>injury,</v>

68
00:04:27.171 --> 00:04:30.800
<v Speaker 1>and death against them individually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>as members of the Trans Community.</v>

69
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.263
<v Speaker 1>We trust that these impacts on students </v>
<v Speaker 1>and others were not your intention in </v>

70
00:04:35.061 --> 00:04:37.160
<v Speaker 1>making these remarks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

71
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.350
<v Speaker 1>in view of these impacts as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirements of the Ontario Human Rights</v>

72
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.183
<v Speaker 1>Code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we urge you to stop repeating these </v>

73
00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:48.224
<v Speaker 1>statements.</v>

74
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.663
<v Speaker 1>As professor ferber informed you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your responsibilities as a faculty </v>

76
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.913
<v Speaker 1>including the Ontario human rights code </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to do so as you exercise your </v>

77
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:06.810
<v Speaker 1>academic freedom or freedom of </v>

78
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.883
<v Speaker 1>your responsibilities as a faculty </v>
<v Speaker 1>member also include dealing with other </v>

79
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:11.094
<v Speaker 1>members of the university community in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that provide equal treatment </v>

80
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.603
<v Speaker 1>without discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Article Five of the memo of agreement </v>

<v Speaker 1>right to academic freedom,</v>

83
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.393
<v Speaker 1>but also notes the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty members to establish fair and </v>

84
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:32.460
<v Speaker 1>ethical dealings with students as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as with colleagues.</v>

85
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.093
<v Speaker 1>The impact of your behavior runs the </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk of undermining your ability to </v>

86
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:42.480
<v Speaker 1>conduct essential components of your job</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a faculty member,</v>

87
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.243
<v Speaker 1>and we urge you to consider your </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligations as a faculty member to act </v>

88
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:52.551
<v Speaker 1>in a manner that is consistent with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law and with university policy.</v>

89
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.593
<v Speaker 1>You have referred to allegations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal behavior by some in at the </v>

00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:58.394
<v Speaker 1>Rally of October 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 the university deplores acts of </v>

91
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>violence and it's just rupture of civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

92
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>The allegations of criminal behavior are</v>
<v Speaker 1>being investigated by the Toronto Police</v>

93
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.390

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
