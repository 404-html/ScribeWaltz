1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't quite get through what I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to in the last lecture.</v>

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>So I think I'm going to steal half an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour from this lecture and do that and</v>

3
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>then we'll go to this lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't get a chance to read</v>
<v Speaker 1>you some of the things I wanted to read</v>

5
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>you</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're really worth.</v>

6
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really worth hearing.</v>

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>So I think I'm going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I've spent a</v>

8
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>very long time trying to figure out is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what motivated people to do the terrible</v>

9
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>things that they did in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps,</v>

10
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the 20th century in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp was pretty widespread</v>

11
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>it's still being used extensively in</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea for example.</v>

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>And most of the popularity population</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is starving.</v>

14
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like it's done with yet.</v>

15
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best authors that I've ever read</v>

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>with regards to insights about the kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of totalitarian possession that leads</v>

17
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>people to commit extraordinarily brutal</v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocities in the service of their</v>

18
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>belief have been ball soldier knits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's not normally considered a</v>

19
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>personality psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also Viktor Frankl.</v>

20
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I have you read soldier</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon is because I think soldier knits</v>

21
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>and has a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Frankel's an amazing thinker,</v>

22
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>but soldier knits and is one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>geniuses that comes along about every</v>

23
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

24
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>and I think soldier Nixon wrote the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

25
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>the most pertinent and analysis of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between individual</v>

26
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>cowardice and the propensity to adopt</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian beliefs and then the</v>

27
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>propensity to commit acts of cruelty in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of those beliefs.</v>

28
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a really tricky issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

29
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

30
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>it's commonly been assumed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

31
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>that people who are right wing</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian people are right wing</v>

32
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian because they're afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who aren't like them or they're</v>

33
00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>afraid of ideas that aren't like their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas or something like that.</v>

34
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often a fear based explanation.</v>

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to that.</v>

36
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

37
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>if your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your belief systems are disrupted by</v>

39
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>a piece of information that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly want to receive,</v>

40
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>it certainly does expose you to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of chaos.</v>

41
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:22.231
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

43
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>where perhaps you received the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that you knew a loved one</v>

44
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>has been unfaithful to you or betrayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

45
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Now part of what you're going to feel in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to that,</v>

46
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>his anxiety and it's because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>destabilizes your past and all your</v>

47
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>memories and d stabilizes your future</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it destabilizes your,</v>

48
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>your present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that presents you with a whole</v>

49
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>bunch of uncertainty where at one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a pretty functional map and you</v>

50
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>knew how things related to one another</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how you should act.</v>

51
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>And so it's reasonable to presuppose</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that produces fear,</v>

52
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>especially because we know from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from work by someone,</v>

53
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>people like Jeffrey Gray</v>

54
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were going to talk about in the next</v>

55
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 2>lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you expose laboratory animals to</v>

56
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 2>novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is certainly an annex,</v>

57
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected is something novel</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something anomalous,</v>

58
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 2>it's something novel that they react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

59
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 2>you can conceptualize the reaction</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly in two ways.</v>

60
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:19.751
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

61
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 2>they become afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They manifest anxiety,</v>

62
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 2>which you can dampen down with</v>
<v Speaker 2>antianxiety drugs like valium,</v>

63
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 2>benzodiazepines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barbiturates,</v>

64
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 2>and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

65
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>but they also manifest curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

66
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>but the anxiety usually supersedes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity.</v>

67
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 2>So the anxiety has to wear off before</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coup curiosity will come forward.</v>

68
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 2>And that depends to some degree on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude of the novel event and</v>

69
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 2>calculating how large novel of is turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to be extraordinarily difficult.</v>

70
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>But we'll talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk through that as well.</v>

71
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And so the anxiety models and so those</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be,</v>

72
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 2>so things is things like terror</v>
<v Speaker 2>management theory,</v>

73
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

74
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 2>The anxiety models are pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're missing things.</v>

75
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 2>They're missing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>

76
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 2>so here's a couple of things that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be missing.</v>

77
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 2>I've pursued the idea that when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter a</v>

78
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 2>datum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say,</v>

79
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 2>cause it could be a stimulus or it could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be an idea or it could be a person,</v>

80
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>but let's call it a piece of information</v>
<v Speaker 2>that contradicts your axiomatic</v>

81
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 2>presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your theory then,</v>

82
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 2>what might happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hippocampus is a brain area that</v>

83
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 2>seems to do something like detect mick</v>
<v Speaker 2>mismatches between what you expect or</v>

84
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 2>want to have happen and what actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

85
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to send a signal down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reticular activating system,</v>

86
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 2>which is the part of your brain that</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually governs consciousness.</v>

87
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's what wakes you up in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>and puts you to sleep at night.</v>

88
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 2>And also what makes you wake up very</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly.</v>

89
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 2>If you hear an unexpected noise at</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

90
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 2>it stops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it stops it,</v>

91
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 2>it releases the reticular activating</v>
<v Speaker 2>system from inhibition.</v>

92
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 2>And so it's basically the hippocampus</v>
<v Speaker 2>does something like tell your reticular</v>

93
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 2>activating system to take it easy as</v>
<v Speaker 2>long as everything's going the way you</v>

94
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 2>want it to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it doesn't go the way you want it</v>

95
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 2>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it releases the reticular</v>

96
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 2>activating system from inhibition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that seems to do is to release</v>

97
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 2>a whole variety of underlying</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurological circuits from inhibition.</v>

98
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 2>So then you become anxious but you also</v>
<v Speaker 2>become curious.</v>

99
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 2>But it's possible that you'll become a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of other things too.</v>

100
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is part of the generalized stress</v>

101
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 2>response as far as I can tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when,</v>

102
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 2>when you manifest the general stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>responses that your body prepares for</v>

103
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.330
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

104
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you don't know what to do when</v>

105
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 2>something you don't expect happens.</v>

106
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like the definition of not want</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowing what to do.</v>

107
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 2>And so because your body's pretty smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just ramps itself up in terms of its</v>

108
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 2>preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very stressful.</v>

109
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Technically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stressful because you're burning a</v>

110
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:57.230
<v Speaker 2>lot of energy and resources that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could devote to other things,</v>

111
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 2>suppresses your immune system and gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ready.</v>

112
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and,</v>

113
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.373
<v Speaker 2>and at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

114
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for any length of time that can be fun</v>

115
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 2>in small doses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact it is because people like</v>

116
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 2>novelty in small doses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in large doses and chronically it's</v>

117
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 2>like that's death itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

118
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 2>So it seems that people really don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to have their,</v>

119
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 2>their expectations dashed or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or more accurately,</v>

120
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 2>they don't like it when what they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have happen doesn't happen,</v>

121
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 2>which isn't exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is then,</v>

122
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 2>what does happen when what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't happen?</v>

123
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 2>How exactly do you characterize it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One way of characterizing it as fear and</v>

124
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>another way of characterizing it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like generalized disinhibition</v>

125
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 2>of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another one.</v>

126
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 2>And I think that one's more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more accurate because it's</v>

127
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 2>more comprehensive and it's deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's a third variable that</v>

128
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 2>we're going to talk about quite a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

129
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.260
<v Speaker 2>that everybody's just sort of coming to</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms with now,</v>

130
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 2>which is that it turns out that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are tilted towards right wing</v>

131
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

132
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 2>they're high in conscientiousness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

133
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 2>and they're low in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you fractionate</v>

134
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can,</v>

135
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 2>you can break it into two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can break it into industriousness</v>

136
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 2>and orderliness and industriousness is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bang dead on predictor of how well you</v>

137
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 2>guys do in university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

138
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.310
<v Speaker 2>it's damn near as powerful as</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

139
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not as powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't measure it as well either.</v>

140
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 2>And so that's industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have,</v>

141
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 2>we don't know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 2>industriousness.</v>

142
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know how to measure it through self</v>

143
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 2>report and we know how to correlate</v>
<v Speaker 2>those self reports with life outcomes.</v>

144
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 2>We have no neuropsychological model for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

145
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 2>We have no conceptual model for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no pharmacological model for it.</v>

146
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did I say animal model?</v>

147
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 2>We have no animal model for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we don't know anything about</v>

148
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 2>it except that it predicts longterm life</v>
<v Speaker 2>success better than anything else except</v>

149
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Iq in managerial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>administrative and academic positions</v>

150
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 2>like grades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So but orderliness,</v>

151
00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different story cause it</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out that orderliness,</v>

152
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 2>we haven't published this yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but orderliness is associated with</v>

153
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:08.111
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity to discussed and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird thing because for a long time we</v>

154
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 2>thought that all the negative emotions</v>
<v Speaker 2>loaded on neuroticism.</v>

155
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 2>So this is big five speak fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

156
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.630
<v Speaker 2>pain and anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration,</v>

157
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shame,</v>

158
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 2>guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and fear.</v>

159
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 2>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were more likely to feel one,</v>

160
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:27.270
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to feel all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of the negative emotions clump</v>

161
00:08:27.271 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's basically what neuroticism is</v>

162
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:33.530
<v Speaker 2>from a big five perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out that disgust,</v>

163
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:38.531
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity loads on orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I tell you man,</v>

164
00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 2>that is one major finding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I think</v>

165
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 2>because we know we know a fair bit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgust,</v>

166
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:47.170
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now give me one second.</v>

167
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.430
<v Speaker 2>That's mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part through the work of</v>

168
00:08:49.431 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Haidt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a very,</v>

169
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy who started scouting,</v>

170
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 2>discussed before anybody else figured</v>
<v Speaker 2>out that it was worthwhile to discuss or</v>

171
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:00.030
<v Speaker 2>to just do I investigate roughly</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>

172
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he fall.</v>

173
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 2>He found that people who are disgust</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive,</v>

174
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 2>we're very obsessed with moral purity.</v>

175
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned out to be the same thing.</v>

176
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:12.501
<v Speaker 2>So bodily contamination and moral</v>
<v Speaker 2>impurity are roughly the same phenomena.</v>

177
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 2>And then it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really figured this out when I was</v>

178
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.740
<v Speaker 2>reading Hitler's table talk cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler's table talk by the way,</v>

179
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:24.741
<v Speaker 2>it was a book that was put together of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler's spontaneous speeches discussion</v>

180
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 2>while he was eating dinner for like</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years.</v>

181
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:29.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating book because it</v>

182
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 2>really gives you some insight into how</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought.</v>

183
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 2>And he was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a very peculiar person cause he was</v>

184
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 2>very high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a creativity dimension and very</v>

185
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 2>high in orderliness and people like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't very common.</v>

186
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his whole metaphor for,</v>

187
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for German,</v>

188
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:49.350
<v Speaker 2>for the area and race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole metaphor was body.</v>

189
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like the areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a pure body with pure blood and</v>

190
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 2>they were under assault from parasites.</v>

191
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.250
<v Speaker 2>And so it was a disgust metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

192
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

193
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 2>it kinda sounds like fear because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could say,</v>

194
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:05.670
<v Speaker 2>well Hitler was afraid of the Gypsies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was afraid of the Jews.</v>

195
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was afraid of non ariens.</v>

196
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:08.840
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

197
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's reasonable to say</v>

198
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 2>that the Nazis were precisely possessed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by fear.</v>

199
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 2>That is exactly how they looked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at conservatives,</v>

200
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not calling conservatives Nazis by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

201
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:20.250
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi philosophy is an extension of</v>
<v Speaker 2>political belief on the right,</v>

203
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:27.330
<v Speaker 2>just like totalitarian communism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is extension of political</v>

204
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 2>belief on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can fall into a pit either way,</v>

205
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:31.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

206
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.270
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

207
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:40.150
<v Speaker 2>they're German and the Germans are a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people,</v>

208
00:10:40.151 --> 00:10:40.961
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

209
00:10:40.961 --> 00:10:43.270
<v Speaker 2>they have a very advanced industrial</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

210
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Their engineering is very precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To what degree that's a national trait.</v>

211
00:10:46.691 --> 00:10:49.300
<v Speaker 2>God only knows to what and to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

212
00:10:49.301 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 2>That's a consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

213
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sociological pressure.</v>

214
00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:55.360
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand anything about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things.</v>

215
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.793
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

216
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Hitler was absolutely obsessed with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with purity and with willpower and those</v>

217
00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:07.000
<v Speaker 2>things go together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So orderly people seem to be very</v>

218
00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:09.640
<v Speaker 2>enamored of their own willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

219
00:11:09.641 --> 00:11:12.610
<v Speaker 2>They sort of worship it as the top God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

220
00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

221
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.930
<v Speaker 2>anorexic people tend to be very orderly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they get discussed.</v>

222
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I think anorexia is a disorder of</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgust.</v>

223
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Anorexic girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get completely disgusted by their</v>

224
00:11:23.781 --> 00:11:24.980
<v Speaker 2>own bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:26.390
<v Speaker 2>and that's a fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about that.</v>

226
00:11:26.391 --> 00:11:30.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a very tight line because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>any number of disgusting things about</v>

227
00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:33.680
<v Speaker 2>bodies and you have to attend to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't,</v>

228
00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:36.170
<v Speaker 2>then you end up contaminated in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of ways.</v>

229
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can catch us sexual disease for</v>

230
00:11:38.841 --> 00:11:40.910
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can just catch a disease or you</v>

231
00:11:40.911 --> 00:11:43.970
<v Speaker 2>could be developing infection or any</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of things that will take you</v>

232
00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:45.350
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

233
00:11:45.351 --> 00:11:48.320
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for human beings to</v>

234
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.350
<v Speaker 2>get the calibration right with regards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

235
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bodies and their feeling about</v>

236
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 2>their bodies and the fact that you also</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to keep the damn thing clean and</v>

237
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:59.590
<v Speaker 2>organized and are otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:01.750
<v Speaker 2>all hell breaks loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's no joke.</v>

239
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.850
<v Speaker 2>When Hitler was before Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

240
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.980
<v Speaker 2>started the concentration camps and went</v>
<v Speaker 2>after when we had after things in a big</v>

241
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:10.120
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very,</v>

242
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 2>very concerned with the hygiene of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>German people,</v>

243
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

244
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.400
<v Speaker 2>And he did things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

245
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.160
<v Speaker 2>his first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's his first stop policy</v>

246
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 2>implementations where tuberculosis</v>
<v Speaker 2>screening and had people go around in</v>

247
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 2>vans and ex-ray everyone to try to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of tuberculosis.</v>

248
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:25.001
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

249
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:27.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get rid of tuberculosis.</v>

250
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:30.010
<v Speaker 2>And then they started cleaning up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>factory so they,</v>

251
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of the bugs and the rats and</v>

252
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 2>sweep them all out and plant flowers out</v>
<v Speaker 2>front.</v>

253
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 2>It was like a beautification campaign</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they used Zyklon B to do that.</v>

254
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 2>And Zyklon b was the gas that was used</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the concentration counts.</v>

255
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's quite interesting.</v>

256
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.190
<v Speaker 2>And that movement from insects in rats</v>
<v Speaker 2>to human beings.</v>

257
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 2>And that there was an intermediary</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

258
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:53.100
<v Speaker 2>which seemed to be mental hospitals</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the next day and they did was go</v>

259
00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 2>and clean up the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

260
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 2>the people that the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler in particular,</v>

261
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 2>but the Nazis and general felt were</v>
<v Speaker 2>inferior or contemptible or something</v>

262
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:03.200
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

263
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.730
<v Speaker 2>And like contempt and disgust seem to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>very tightly together.</v>

264
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.280
<v Speaker 2>And contempt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a vicious emotion.</v>

265
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.850
<v Speaker 2>So like if you're in a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

266
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 2>close relationship and they start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become contemptuous of you,</v>

267
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.410
<v Speaker 2>and you could tell that because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>rolled their eyes,</v>

268
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce them or separately from them is</v>

269
00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Contempt is a very corrosive emotion.</v>

270
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 2>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

271
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 2>the transformation and purity campaign</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Hitler just extended and extended and</v>

272
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:34.810
<v Speaker 2>extended and extended and extended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

273
00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 2>God only knows where it would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended.</v>

274
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:40.630
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that's why he was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>worshiper of fire because fire is a</v>

275
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:44.350
<v Speaker 2>purifying substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Nazis really used fire as a</v>

276
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 2>symbol of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their movement because Hitler would</v>

277
00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:51.730
<v Speaker 2>have these massive nighttime political</v>
<v Speaker 2>rallies,</v>

278
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with 150,000 people all put in perfect</v>

279
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 2>squares,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

280
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.050
<v Speaker 2>with this massive background of fire and</v>
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

281
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.870
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it all seems to boil down to the</v>

282
00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 2>fact that he was extraordinarily disgust</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive and not became a cardinal</v>

283
00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:09.430
<v Speaker 2>element of his political platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that was associated with</v>

284
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.130
<v Speaker 2>orderliness and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

285
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 2>you can try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can track it all the way down to the</v>

286
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a paper published in Plos</v>

287
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I should really put on the website</v>

288
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:19.510
<v Speaker 2>about a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I unfortunately,</v>

289
00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who published it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were looking at,</v>

290
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say iss to your political</v>

291
00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:25.990
<v Speaker 2>attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could do that,</v>

292
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:29.080
<v Speaker 2>say with an authoritarian scale</v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian and belief scale.</v>

293
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Cause authoritarianism has been studied</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit since the end of World War</v>

294
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 2>II.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody really knew what to do with it in</v>

295
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 2>relationship to personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

296
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:38.050
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can assess it,</v>

297
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to with a reasonable degree of accuracy.</v>

298
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 2>These people went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did two things.</v>

299
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:46.180
<v Speaker 2>They did a cross country survey and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>within country surveys,</v>

300
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.520
<v Speaker 2>so you imagine you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were looking at a phenomena,</v>

301
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 2>you could look at the country level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you asked Canada or you could go into</v>

302
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:54.950
<v Speaker 2>the u s and then you could look at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>state level.</v>

303
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.480
<v Speaker 2>And it's nice to do the analysis at both</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels to see if it replicates itself</v>

304
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:01.930
<v Speaker 2>across the two different conceptual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.840
<v Speaker 2>two different conceptual strata.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they've found is mind boggling.</v>

306
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 2>It's Nobel prize winning stuff as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned,</v>

307
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 2>is that the correlation between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalence of infectious disease in a</v>

308
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:17.981
<v Speaker 2>locale and the degree to which are</v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian beliefs were held in that</v>

309
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 2>locale was bout 0.7.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you never see that in the</v>

310
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 2>social sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's higher than the correlation</v>

311
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:28.190
<v Speaker 2>between Iq and grades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about as good as we ever get in</v>

312
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:29.024
<v Speaker 2>terms of prediction.</v>

313
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:34.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's like really it's that high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

314
00:15:34.071 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that that implies</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that one of the ways to get rid of</v>

315
00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 2>right wing authoritarian attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming that you want to get rid of</v>

316
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 2>such things is too is through public</v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

317
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could easily be that the reason that</v>

318
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 2>we're all tilted fairly hard to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>center and even to the left is that</v>

319
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:51.470
<v Speaker 2>everybody's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

320
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:55.900
<v Speaker 2>we've got suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got functioning sanitation and</v>

321
00:15:55.901 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

322
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 2>don't have to worry about that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

323
00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:00.590
<v Speaker 2>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people used to have to worry about</v>

324
00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 2>that before the antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you get an infection man,</v>

325
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:06.410
<v Speaker 2>your dad and that's on its way back by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

326
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Cause we keep using antibiotics for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything under the sun.</v>

327
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Just very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

328
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 2>very stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

329
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.320
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave you all that background because</v>

330
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tangled mess.</v>

331
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.830
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the authoritarian personality issue.</v>

332
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a sociological element to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the disease element.</v>

333
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:29.030
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the existential element</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've talked about in detail where</v>

334
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:34.090
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be also something about</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's unwillingness to stand up for</v>

335
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 2>themselves and develop their own beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and adhere to the truth and to adopt</v>

336
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:39.530
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 2>extremely rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian belief systems and then go</v>

338
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 2>persecute people for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't know how to separate all</v>

339
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:49.070
<v Speaker 2>those things out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought I would read you some</v>

340
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:53.660
<v Speaker 2>things that were written both by soldier</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knutsen and by Frankel about a,</v>

341
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:57.050
<v Speaker 2>the concentration camps in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause Frankl was a concentration camp</v>

342
00:16:57.051 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 2>survivor survivor and be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps in the Soviet Union</v>

343
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.580
<v Speaker 2>because soldier Nansen was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camp survivor.</v>

344
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.350
<v Speaker 2>He was a rather fortunate concentration</v>
<v Speaker 2>camp inmates in so far as there is such</v>

345
00:17:09.351 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 2>a thing because he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had some specialized knowledge that</v>

346
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 2>made him sufficiently valuable not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>starve to death.</v>

347
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here is one of soldier Nixon's</v>

348
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.970
<v Speaker 2>descriptions of one of his experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>or that some firsthand observer told him</v>

349
00:17:25.281 --> 00:17:27.140
<v Speaker 2>because when he wrote the Gulag</v>
<v Speaker 2>archipelago,</v>

350
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.660
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote a lot about his own</v>

351
00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:31.850
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he also wrote a lot about the</v>

352
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:34.490
<v Speaker 2>experiences that other people had</v>
<v Speaker 2>related to him while he was in the</v>

353
00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 2>camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

354
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.110
<v Speaker 2>one of the people he met told how</v>
<v Speaker 2>executions were carried out at a dock,</v>

355
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:42.590
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

356
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.990
<v Speaker 2>which is a work camp hum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It destructive labor camp on that mature</v>

357
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.470
<v Speaker 2>river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would take the opposition members.</v>

358
00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>So these were people who weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>communists.</v>

359
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people who got thrown in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gulag prisons and the Soviet Union were</v>

360
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 2>basically political prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

361
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't a staunch communist or</v>

362
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 2>you've been turned in for some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've being turned in for political,</v>

363
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

364
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treason,</v>

365
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a neighbor who really wanted your</v>

366
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they turn you on,</v>

367
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:10.530
<v Speaker 2>you need to get hold off to</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camp,</v>

368
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:11.041
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

369
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:14.280
<v Speaker 2>your neighbor would get your apartment's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very pretty arrangement for everyone</v>

370
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:15.670
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

371
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.820
<v Speaker 2>the gulags were full of political</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners.</v>

372
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:20.190
<v Speaker 2>They were also full of normal criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murderers,</v>

373
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 2>rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thieves.</v>

374
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:25.380
<v Speaker 2>And those guys basically ran the camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because the stalinists thought that</v>

375
00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 2>murderers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rapists,</v>

376
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:28.320
<v Speaker 2>and thieves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were,</v>

377
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call those?</v>

378
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.980
<v Speaker 2>You could rehabilitate them because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were actually victims of an unjust class</v>

379
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:36.270
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

380
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically you could save them,</v>

381
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:42.360
<v Speaker 2>whereas if you had rich parents or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>your parents owned farm or maybe they</v>

382
00:18:42.361 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 2>just had a bloody house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows then you were socially</v>

383
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:49.140
<v Speaker 2>suspect element because he came from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bourgeoisie,</v>

384
00:18:49.141 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 2>it not the proletariat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got thrown in jail alongside the</v>

385
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 2>murderers and rapists and thieves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 2>they were regarded as morally superior</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>

387
00:18:56.491 --> 00:18:57.380
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

388
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 2>something that only a bloody communists</v>
<v Speaker 2>could think through and come to that</v>

389
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:02.550
<v Speaker 2>conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

390
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 2>it's mind boggling.</v>

391
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.330
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what happened in the counts</v>

392
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

393
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.800
<v Speaker 2>political murder essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is what Solzhenitsyn's</v>

394
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:12.960
<v Speaker 2>talking about in this particular case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he says,</v>

395
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.010
<v Speaker 2>this is how executions were carried out</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a dock,</v>

396
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.730
<v Speaker 2>a camp on the [inaudible] river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would take the opposition members</v>

397
00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:25.080
<v Speaker 2>with their things out of the camp</v>
<v Speaker 2>compound on a prisoner transport at</v>

398
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:30.000
<v Speaker 2>night and outside the compound stood</v>
<v Speaker 2>those small house of the third section.</v>

399
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 2>The condemned men were taken into a room</v>
<v Speaker 2>one at a time and they're the camp</v>

400
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:37.080
<v Speaker 2>guards sprang on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their mouths were stuffed with something</v>

401
00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:40.290
<v Speaker 2>soft and their arms were bound with</v>
<v Speaker 2>cords behind their backs.</v>

402
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Then they were led out into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>courtyard where harnessed carts were</v>

403
00:19:43.591 --> 00:19:46.350
<v Speaker 2>waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bound prisoners were piled onto the</v>

404
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:50.220
<v Speaker 2>carts from five to seven at a time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>driven off to the Gorkha,</v>

405
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.200
<v Speaker 2>the camp cemetery on arrival.</v>

406
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.910
<v Speaker 2>They were tipped into big pits that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>already been prepared and buried alive.</v>

407
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Not Out of brutality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

408
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.780
<v Speaker 2>it'd be Nasser tained that when dragging</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lifting them,</v>

409
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 2>it was much easier to cope with living</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

410
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Then with corpses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work went on for many nights at a</v>

411
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 2>deck and this is how the moral political</v>
<v Speaker 2>unity of our party was achieved.</v>

412
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Now you see what seems to be happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is that the people who are engaged</v>

413
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:24.201
<v Speaker 2>in these activities are classifying</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who oppose their political beliefs</v>

414
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.850
<v Speaker 2>as contemptible and therefore worthy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>

415
00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:33.090
<v Speaker 2>And that that seems to be partly a fear</v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

416
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:35.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that which is not us,</v>

417
00:20:35.371 --> 00:20:38.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems very much also to partly to be</v>

418
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.840
<v Speaker 2>tied very deeply into this disgust and</v>
<v Speaker 2>contamination system about which we</v>

419
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.540
<v Speaker 2>don't know much about the cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of that system.</v>

420
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Although one of the things that's that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth considering,</v>

421
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has gone through my mind,</v>

422
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

423
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 2>you might ask why the hell to human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings categorized things because other</v>

424
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:57.310
<v Speaker 2>animals don't really do that the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

425
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 2>We really categorize things like mad and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

426
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all,</v>

427
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're omnivores,</v>

428
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a kind of a weird problem because</v>

429
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 2>if you're omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can eat anything except the things</v>

430
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 2>you should need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

431
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:16.720
<v Speaker 2>and making a clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a real problem.</v>

432
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 2>If you're a Koala bear and all you eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>is eucalyptus leaves,</v>

433
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:20.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem solved.</v>

434
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 2>Unless the eucalyptus leaves aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and then you die.</v>

435
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.660
<v Speaker 2>But if you're an Omnivore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to run all over the place and</v>

436
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 2>you can eat damn near anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to keep track of the things</v>

437
00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 2>that will kill you and the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are poisoning the things that are</v>

438
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:33.650
<v Speaker 2>contaminated and the things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you and it's,</v>

439
00:21:33.651 --> 00:21:38.320
<v Speaker 2>it's not an easy thing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like part of our</v>

440
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:41.890
<v Speaker 2>classification system and the cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements seem to actually have emerged</v>

441
00:21:41.891 --> 00:21:46.120
<v Speaker 2>out of out of contamination and</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed concerns and that seems to be</v>

442
00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 2>grounded in some sense in what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

443
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our ability to make decisions about what</v>

444
00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:52.180
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put in our mouths and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

445
00:21:52.181 --> 00:21:54.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people don't like to put disgusting</v>

446
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:55.060
<v Speaker 2>things in their mouth.</v>

447
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

448
00:21:56.591 --> 00:21:58.630
<v Speaker 2>you can overcome that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people will eat,</v>

449
00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moldy cheese,</v>

450
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:04.270
<v Speaker 2>but you really have to work to overcome</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you have to work to overcome</v>

451
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your disgust at eating bitter</v>

452
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:09.070
<v Speaker 2>substances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to develop a taste for</v>

453
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:12.370
<v Speaker 2>coffee and you have to develop a taste</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all of us because a lot of things</v>

454
00:22:12.371 --> 00:22:14.950
<v Speaker 2>that are bitter are actually poisonous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

455
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that there are things that you</v>

456
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 2>can put in your mouth that are good for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and there are things that you can't</v>

457
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 2>put in your mouth cause they're bad for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

458
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.520
<v Speaker 2>is rooted somehow very deeply in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our ideas of categorization and also</v>

459
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:29.740
<v Speaker 2>in our ideas of morality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

460
00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:31.660
<v Speaker 2>And you think of morality as a higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>order,</v>

461
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:33.580
<v Speaker 2>cognitive function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think about,</v>

462
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern people are as obsessed with food</v>

463
00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 2>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the victorians were obsessed with sex</v>

464
00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 2>and people are making divisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>primary divisions of morality based on</v>

465
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:45.880
<v Speaker 2>what each other eat all the time.</v>

466
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vegetarianism movement or the Vegan</v>

467
00:22:48.761 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 2>movement is a really good example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

468
00:22:50.351 --> 00:22:52.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of concerns have been</v>

469
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.330
<v Speaker 2>present throughout human history as far</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I can tell,</v>

470
00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:57.850
<v Speaker 2>because there's lots of ancient sex that</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

471
00:22:57.851 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 2>that are vegetarian and just lots of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in India who are vegetarian</v>

472
00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:03.220
<v Speaker 2>primarily and often for religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>

473
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:04.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a matter of,</v>

474
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also seems that we divide,</v>

475
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:11.080
<v Speaker 2>we tend to divide people into groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even ethnic groups on the basis of what</v>

476
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:15.100
<v Speaker 2>one group is allowed to eat and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>another group will eat.</v>

477
00:23:15.101 --> 00:23:15.934
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

478
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians elite will eat swine.</v>

479
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.020
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

480
00:23:23.021 --> 00:23:24.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

481
00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.790
<v Speaker 2>more conservative Jews and Muslims in</v>
<v Speaker 2>general won't touch.</v>

482
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.370
<v Speaker 2>It's disgusting and it's contaminated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

483
00:23:30.371 --> 00:23:32.140
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

484
00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 2>It's something other than fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more,</v>

485
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:39.270
<v Speaker 2>and the danger of conceptualizing it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of contaminated and disgusting.</v>

486
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.570
<v Speaker 2>And you see this a lot in the language</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the say the Auschwitz camp guards</v>

487
00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 2>used with to the people that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting in the ovens,</v>

488
00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:48.140
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't people,</v>

489
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>they were rats and insects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the language.</v>

490
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not like people are afraid of rats</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the insects,</v>

491
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

492
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:56.900
<v Speaker 2>it's a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a big problem,</v>

493
00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 2>but you can easily hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is something to be destroyed,</v>

494
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.110
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we also don't know to what</v>

495
00:24:03.111 --> 00:24:06.080
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you use the disgust system to</v>

496
00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 2>classify someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're automatically putting</v>

497
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 2>them into the category of disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that should be destroyed.</v>

498
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a woman named Martha Nussbaum</v>

499
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:17.360
<v Speaker 2>who's a legal scholar and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggested she's liberal.</v>

500
00:24:17.361 --> 00:24:22.040
<v Speaker 2>And she suggested that</v>
<v Speaker 2>our legal decisions should never be</v>

501
00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:24.260
<v Speaker 2>based on discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

502
00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 2>But then I read Nussbaum and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

503
00:24:26.571 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to say that except the disgust</v>
<v Speaker 2>system is what stops you from eating</v>

504
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 2>things that will kill you.</v>

505
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 2>And you can't just shut the damn thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>off because you know,</v>

506
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:40.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a fundamental biological mechanism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it orients you in the world now.</v>

507
00:24:40.161 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Speaker 2>And so we don't know how to control it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spillover say into radical political</v>

508
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:45.980
<v Speaker 2>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just saying,</v>

509
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 2>don't do that or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

510
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:51.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not wrestling with the problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>because first of all,</v>

511
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.320
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be not disgusted by</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

512
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.980
<v Speaker 2>That's a really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>

513
00:24:57.981 --> 00:24:59.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get too radical about that,</v>

514
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:03.350
<v Speaker 2>you get to orderly then not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

515
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're anorexic he can't even stand</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own body.</v>

516
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.550
<v Speaker 2>That's really not a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

517
00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 2>cause at the anorexic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've worked with,</v>

518
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:13.040
<v Speaker 2>they often talk about their fantasies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they look at their body and what</v>

519
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 2>they see is like corruptible flash</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

520
00:25:16.311 --> 00:25:19.610
<v Speaker 2>And they have fantasies about purity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the purity is they want to reduce</v>

521
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 2>themselves to bone.</v>

522
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:24.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause bone is white and it's pure and it</v>

523
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:26.810
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have this sort of corruptible</v>
<v Speaker 2>flesh hanging off it.</v>

524
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 2>And you know that that seems to go along</v>
<v Speaker 2>with fairly severe perceptual</v>

525
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:34.760
<v Speaker 2>aberrations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So cause a anorexics don't really see,</v>

526
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 2>seem to be able to look at their body as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole.</v>

527
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 2>What they seem to do is focus</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessively on parts and they can never</v>

528
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:45.530
<v Speaker 2>really get the parts together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

529
00:25:45.531 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 2>and I don't exactly know how that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with disgust either except</v>

530
00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 2>that that hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

531
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:54.650
<v Speaker 2>that hyper alertness and hyper</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration could easily be associated</v>

532
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:59.000
<v Speaker 2>with analysis of things that that might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be disgusting and dangerous.</v>

533
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankel,</v>

534
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.160
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is from the Nazi concentration</v>

535
00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:11.330
<v Speaker 1>camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The note most ghastly moment of the 24</v>

536
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:16.331
<v Speaker 1>hours of camp life was the awakening</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Adh is still nocturnal hour.</v>

537
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:20.750
<v Speaker 1>The three shrill blows of a whistle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Torres Petty Leslie from are exhausted</v>

538
00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:23.810
<v Speaker 1>sleep and from the longings in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

539
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.250
<v Speaker 1>We then began the tussle with our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shoes into which we could scarcely</v>

540
00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 1>force our feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were sore and swollen with a Dema</v>

541
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:36.110
<v Speaker 1>and there were the usual moans and</v>
<v Speaker 1>groans about petty troubles such as the</v>

542
00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:38.870
<v Speaker 1>snapping of wires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which replaced shoe laces.</v>

543
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.390
<v Speaker 1>One morning I heard someone</v>

544
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>whom I knew to be brave and cry like</v>

545
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 1>a child because he finally had to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snowy marching grounds in his bare</v>

546
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 1>feet as his shoes were too shrunk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for him to wear.</v>

547
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.670
<v Speaker 1>And these gospely moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a little bit of comfort,</v>

548
00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.170
<v Speaker 1>a small piece of bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I drew out of my pocket and</v>

549
00:27:00.171 --> 00:27:01.880
<v Speaker 1>munched with absorbed delight</v>

550
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Lord of what happened in the Gulag camps</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that,</v>

551
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that were putting in the</v>

552
00:27:08.681 --> 00:27:11.230
<v Speaker 1>camps where we're putting into work</v>
<v Speaker 1>brigades and you know,</v>

553
00:27:11.231 --> 00:27:13.960
<v Speaker 1>so there was a huge canal that was dug</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union,</v>

554
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was in the 30s and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe,</v>

555
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the canals name at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

556
00:27:19.631 --> 00:27:22.720
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they killed 300,000 people in three</v>

557
00:27:22.721 --> 00:27:27.100
<v Speaker 1>months building it because they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick axing dirt in the,</v>

558
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.490
<v Speaker 1>in the brutal cold to build this canal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

559
00:27:30.491 --> 00:27:33.070
<v Speaker 1>because it had to be done now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

560
00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.700
<v Speaker 1>according to Solzhenitsyn's description,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time they finished the canal,</v>

561
00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.870
<v Speaker 1>while 300,000 people had died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was too shallow to be useful for</v>

562
00:27:40.871 --> 00:27:43.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the purpose they wanted to put it</v>

563
00:27:43.901 --> 00:27:46.270
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so basically it was built but never</v>

564
00:27:46.271 --> 00:27:47.830
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>

565
00:27:47.831 --> 00:27:49.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the purpose of the canal if it</v>

566
00:27:49.721 --> 00:27:52.180
<v Speaker 1>was never used?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is the purpose of</v>

567
00:27:52.181 --> 00:27:55.270
<v Speaker 1>the canal was to kill 300,000 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they were working on it.</v>

568
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.460
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think that people can't have</v>

569
00:27:57.461 --> 00:27:59.590
<v Speaker 1>such purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not thinking very hard</v>

570
00:27:59.591 --> 00:28:02.740
<v Speaker 1>because they certainly can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And stellan certainly did.</v>

571
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

572
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Here's soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon's comments about about work camps</v>

573
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:09.630
<v Speaker 1>during the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is Russia,</v>

574
00:28:09.631 --> 00:28:12.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Russia has a winters in cold</v>

575
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:17.750
<v Speaker 1>lower than 60 degrees below zero work</v>
<v Speaker 1>days were written off.</v>

576
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.710
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on such days,</v>

577
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.040
<v Speaker 1>the record showed that the workers have</v>
<v Speaker 1>not gone out to work,</v>

578
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.230
<v Speaker 1>but they chased them out anyway and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they squeezed out of them on</v>

579
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:32.640
<v Speaker 1>those days was added to the other days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are by raising the percentages.</v>

580
00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:33.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

581
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And the serve biomedical section wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>off those who froze to death on such</v>

582
00:28:37.331 --> 00:28:39.340
<v Speaker 1>cold days on some other basis.</v>

583
00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

584
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And the ones who were left who could no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer walk,</v>

585
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.890
<v Speaker 1>and we're straining every sinew to crawl</v>
<v Speaker 1>along on all fours on the way back to</v>

586
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:51.390
<v Speaker 1>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The convoy simply shot so that they</v>

587
00:28:51.391 --> 00:28:53.480
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't escape before they could go</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back together.</v>

588
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:54.423
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

589
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:03.380
<v Speaker 1>when I was studying this material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was also looking at him poetic</v>

590
00:29:03.381 --> 00:29:07.010
<v Speaker 1>representations of contamination and</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption and evil.</v>

591
00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:12.011
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to read you a poem from</v>
<v Speaker 1>William Blake that seems to sum up the</v>

592
00:29:12.321 --> 00:29:17.321
<v Speaker 1>attitude that's necessary to harbor</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you would be capable of doing</v>

593
00:29:18.201 --> 00:29:21.140
<v Speaker 1>such things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from the complete works of</v>

594
00:29:21.141 --> 00:29:23.450
<v Speaker 1>William Blake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh rose,</v>

595
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.650
<v Speaker 1>thou art sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The invisible worm that flies in the</v>

596
00:29:27.651 --> 00:29:32.651
<v Speaker 1>night in the howling storm has found out</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I bet of crimson joy and his dark</v>

597
00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:38.471
<v Speaker 1>secret love does die life destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something I took out of the</v>

598
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago,</v>

599
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 2>the volume two of the Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an amazing book.</v>

600
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:48.790
<v Speaker 2>The Gulag archipelago itself is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable work of literature.</v>

601
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.713
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

602
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.790
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's phenomenal.</v>

603
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.950
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an immense book.</v>

604
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 2,700 pages long and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>written in little tiny type.</v>

605
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 2,700 dense pages and it record</v>

606
00:30:03.591 --> 00:30:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

607
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.070
<v Speaker 2>experiences of the concentration camp</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the concentration camps and the</v>

608
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:11.770
<v Speaker 2>stories that he gathered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual stories that he gathered</v>

609
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:16.090
<v Speaker 2>that describe it qualitatively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Solzhenitsyn also made an attempt to</v>

610
00:30:16.091 --> 00:30:21.091
<v Speaker 2>put the hit the camps did write a</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of the camps and also a history</v>

611
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:24.670
<v Speaker 2>of the political and social institutions</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gave rise to them.</v>

612
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.150
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychological analysis of the</v>

613
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 2>conditions that made these camps</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and probable.</v>

614
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:36.940
<v Speaker 2>And he identified the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem in the Soviet Union has the</v>

615
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 2>willingness of the Soviet citizens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie to themselves and to each other on a</v>

616
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:43.090
<v Speaker 2>constant and ongoing basis.</v>

617
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 2>So to some degree it's a reflection of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that I told you about before of</v>

618
00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:52.480
<v Speaker 2>the instrumental use of language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Language was something to hide your true</v>

619
00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:55.060
<v Speaker 2>self behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not something to communicate about.</v>

620
00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:59.230
<v Speaker 2>And people were very unwilling to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss anything that might be</v>

621
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:01.930
<v Speaker 2>considered a shortcoming of the system</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any way possible.</v>

622
00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 2>No matter how bad the system God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And no matter how bad they were</v>

623
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:07.930
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because by definition the system was</v>

624
00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 2>always already perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

625
00:31:10.151 --> 00:31:13.630
<v Speaker 2>You told me I had already come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that meant was that if you were</v>

626
00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:17.140
<v Speaker 2>suffering and it was utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there obviously was something seriously</v>

627
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:20.170
<v Speaker 2>wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the best thing to do with a creature</v>

628
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:24.940
<v Speaker 2>that was as seriously garnish dre is you</v>
<v Speaker 2>was to get rid of them and often in the</v>

629
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:27.130
<v Speaker 2>most brutal way that could possibly be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>management.</v>

630
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 2>And so that happened to lots of people.</v>

631
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in East Germany,</v>

632
00:31:31.271 --> 00:31:34.660
<v Speaker 2>they estimated one out of every three</v>
<v Speaker 2>people was a government informer.</v>

633
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.870
<v Speaker 2>So the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is Solzhenitsyn's analysis of</v>

634
00:31:37.871 --> 00:31:40.510
<v Speaker 2>what happened in the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't believe that any of that could</v>

635
00:31:40.511 --> 00:31:45.511
<v Speaker 2>happen unless the entire citizenry had</v>
<v Speaker 2>made an unspoken pact that they were</v>

636
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:49.780
<v Speaker 2>never ever going to say anything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was true to each other or to themselves</v>

637
00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:53.350
<v Speaker 2>under any circumstances whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he believed that that was the</v>

638
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 2>precondition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

639
00:31:54.731 --> 00:31:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I've already mentioned these sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena are very complicated,</v>

640
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.000
<v Speaker 2>but he believed that that was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>precondition for the absolute corruption</v>

641
00:32:01.001 --> 00:32:03.550
<v Speaker 2>of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really worth thinking about,</v>

642
00:32:03.551 --> 00:32:05.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and soldier knits and also said that,</v>

643
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I think this was in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his Nobel prize speech,</v>

644
00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:13.930
<v Speaker 2>but it might've been as Harvard address</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he was invited to speak at</v>

645
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:18.100
<v Speaker 2>graduation at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the newspapers ripped him apart by</v>

646
00:32:18.101 --> 00:32:19.810
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was quite critical of,</v>

647
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 2>of Western society despite the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had been granted asylum in Vermont.</v>

648
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was so interesting to read the</v>

649
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:29.950
<v Speaker 2>crit criticisms because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people base,</v>

650
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.320
<v Speaker 2>even people who should have known a hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a lot better,</v>

651
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like smart people,</v>

652
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.940
<v Speaker 2>we're very irritated at soldier knits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for daring to say that there was</v>

653
00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>anything wrong with the West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that he had been asylum,</v>

654
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the Americans in Vermont,</v>

655
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.630
<v Speaker 2>I personally thought they were lucky to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get him,</v>

656
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:46.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's the right attitude</v>

657
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:48.620
<v Speaker 2>toward someone like him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

658
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:49.454
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

659
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.690
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the book itself,</v>

660
00:32:55.691 --> 00:32:58.450
<v Speaker 2>the Gulag Archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second volume is mostly personal</v>

661
00:32:58.451 --> 00:33:00.160
<v Speaker 2>experiences of one form or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

662
00:33:00.161 --> 00:33:00.994
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to,</v>

663
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.400
<v Speaker 2>while you've read some of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically,</v>

664
00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:05.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unbelievably brilliant book,</v>

665
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.320
<v Speaker 2>but the three volumes together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

666
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.880
<v Speaker 2>2,700 pages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

667
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.010
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're almost unbearable because</v>

668
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.790
<v Speaker 2>they're written by someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically screaming at the top of his</v>

669
00:33:15.791 --> 00:33:19.570
<v Speaker 2>lungs for like 2,700 pages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty impressive.</v>

670
00:33:19.571 --> 00:33:22.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this study once about rats.</v>

671
00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.870
<v Speaker 2>So if you put rats in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a normal environment,</v>

672
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.450
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like you're single caged rat,</v>

673
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.450
<v Speaker 2>but your family loving hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabiting,</v>

674
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.740
<v Speaker 2>exploring sort of rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you make a natural habitat for them,</v>

675
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe you put all the family things at</v>
<v Speaker 2>one end so the rats can hang out with</v>

676
00:33:39.491 --> 00:33:42.100
<v Speaker 2>all their kith and kin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the other end you,</v>

677
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.550
<v Speaker 2>you place a place where they can go</v>
<v Speaker 2>explore and maybe that's where you feed</v>

678
00:33:45.551 --> 00:33:46.240
<v Speaker 2>them hay.</v>

679
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.040
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they get used to that and that's</v>

680
00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:51.370
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you put a cat in out there</v>

681
00:33:51.371 --> 00:33:54.730
<v Speaker 2>where they're feeding and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rat goes out there and he sees the cat</v>

682
00:33:54.731 --> 00:33:56.140
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hell for rats,</v>

683
00:33:56.141 --> 00:33:58.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's back in his rabbit burrow and like</v>

684
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.090
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what he does is he peaks his</v>

685
00:34:01.091 --> 00:34:05.620
<v Speaker 2>head out of the borough and he screams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no rat rat screams ultra sonic screens</v>

686
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:10.330
<v Speaker 2>for the equivalent of three weeks in</v>
<v Speaker 2>human hours.</v>

687
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:15.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like that rat that's one freaked</v>
<v Speaker 2>out rack and none of the other rats go</v>

688
00:34:15.311 --> 00:34:18.190
<v Speaker 2>anywhere when that rat is screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really like,</v>

689
00:34:18.191 --> 00:34:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I think of that as the equivalent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn's book.</v>

690
00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

691
00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a hair raising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

692
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:27.040
<v Speaker 2>endeavor to plow your way through that</v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

693
00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.260
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an indictment of,</v>

694
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:33.070
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 20th century morality in a very clear</v>

695
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:37.180
<v Speaker 2>indication of what happens at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sociopolitical and an economic level if</v>

696
00:34:37.181 --> 00:34:40.660
<v Speaker 2>people abandon their claim to</v>
<v Speaker 2>existential truth at an individual</v>

697
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:40.960
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

698
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's something really worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about because one of the things</v>

699
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I derived from this was that if you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect yourself against the</v>

700
00:34:48.341 --> 00:34:53.341
<v Speaker 2>possibility that you would become as</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt politically or sociologically as</v>

701
00:34:53.621 --> 00:34:56.860
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis for examples or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe the Soviet communists or maybe</v>

702
00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:58.320
<v Speaker 2>the mile was communist sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could,</v>

703
00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.490
<v Speaker 2>or the North Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we could go on and on.</v>

704
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.990
<v Speaker 2>You might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

705
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're smart enough to assume that</v>

706
00:35:03.911 --> 00:35:06.220
<v Speaker 2>you're not already protected because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

707
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's really worth</v>

708
00:35:08.591 --> 00:35:12.010
<v Speaker 2>thinking about is there does seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a direct causal relationship between</v>

709
00:35:12.011 --> 00:35:15.760
<v Speaker 2>people's willing to willingness to</v>
<v Speaker 2>falsify their own personal experience</v>

710
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.020
<v Speaker 2>and the spread of unbelievable political</v>
<v Speaker 2>and economic corruption.</v>

711
00:35:20.021 --> 00:35:23.740
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things we do know is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to make a country rich,</v>

712
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:28.060
<v Speaker 2>the one thing you absolutely have to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is make sure that the people will in</v>

713
00:35:28.061 --> 00:35:29.770
<v Speaker 2>fact trade honestly with one another.</v>

714
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.940
<v Speaker 2>So unless the default presupposition</v>
<v Speaker 2>between people is trust,</v>

715
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.100
<v Speaker 2>it's just damn hard thing to implement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

716
00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 2>And I don't even understand any</v>
<v Speaker 2>country's ever managed it ever.</v>

717
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.300
<v Speaker 2>If the default presupposition is that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>we trade,</v>

718
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:45.450
<v Speaker 2>you won't screw me over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can get rich,</v>

719
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.440
<v Speaker 2>but if the default assumption is God</v>
<v Speaker 2>only knows what's up with you,</v>

720
00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like forget it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how many natural resources</v>

721
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:54.270
<v Speaker 2>we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to stay poor.</v>

722
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 2>So there's something that's incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>like truth,</v>

723
00:35:57.811 --> 00:36:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I think is truth might be the only true</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural resource.</v>

724
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.530
<v Speaker 2>You know the Japanese are good example</v>
<v Speaker 2>because their culture,</v>

725
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 2>their trading culture is fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>

726
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.420
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any bloody at natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources at all.</v>

727
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.400
<v Speaker 1>The rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't explain that.</v>

728
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyhow,</v>

729
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I know your story from Solzhenitsyn</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire fire,</v>

730
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:29.300
<v Speaker 1>the branches crackle in the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wind of late autumn blows the flame of</v>

731
00:36:29.301 --> 00:36:33.170
<v Speaker 1>the bonfire back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A compound is dark.</v>

732
00:36:33.171 --> 00:36:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm alone at the bar and fire and I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it still some more carpenter</v>

733
00:36:37.371 --> 00:36:38.204
<v Speaker 1>shavings.</v>

734
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

735
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.760
<v Speaker 1>The compound here is a privileged one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so privileged that it is almost as if I</v>

736
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:48.660
<v Speaker 1>were out in freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an island of paradise.</v>

737
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:54.080
<v Speaker 1>This is the Marfino Shahram [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scientific institute staffed with</v>

738
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:59.280
<v Speaker 1>prisoners in its most privileged period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one is overseeing me,</v>

739
00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:03.060
<v Speaker 1>calling me to a cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing me away from the bonfire,</v>

740
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.510
<v Speaker 1>and even then it's chilly in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>penetrating wind,</v>

741
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:12.120
<v Speaker 1>but she who's already been standing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind for hours,</v>

742
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.510
<v Speaker 1>her arms straight down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her head drooping,</v>

743
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.110
<v Speaker 1>weeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then growing numb and still,</v>

744
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.060
<v Speaker 1>and then again she begs pity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asley citizen chief,</v>

745
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.450
<v Speaker 1>please forgive me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it again.</v>

746
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:33.120
<v Speaker 1>The wind carries her mons to me just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she were moaning next to my ear.</v>

747
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.780
<v Speaker 1>The citizen chief at the gate house</v>
<v Speaker 1>fires up.</v>

748
00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:41.781
<v Speaker 1>His stove does not answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the gate house of the camp next</v>

749
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:47.271
<v Speaker 1>door to us from which workers came into</v>
<v Speaker 1>our compound to lay water pipes and to</v>

750
00:37:47.461 --> 00:37:50.610
<v Speaker 1>repair the old ramshackle seminary</v>
<v Speaker 1>building</v>

751
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.810
<v Speaker 1>cross for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond the artfully intertwined many</v>

752
00:37:55.811 --> 00:38:00.811
<v Speaker 1>stranded barbed wire barricade and two</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps away from the gate house beneath a</v>

753
00:38:01.481 --> 00:38:06.481
<v Speaker 1>bright lantern stood the punished girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>head hanging the wind tugging at her</v>

754
00:38:07.931 --> 00:38:11.120
<v Speaker 1>gray work skirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her feet growing numb from the cold,</v>

755
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:16.120
<v Speaker 1>a thin scarf over her head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be warm during the day when they</v>

756
00:38:16.121 --> 00:38:20.770
<v Speaker 1>had been digging a ditch on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory and another girl slipping down</v>

757
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.630
<v Speaker 1>into a ravine had crawled her way to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat of Keno highway and escaped.</v>

758
00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:31.410
<v Speaker 1>The guard had bungled and Moscow city</v>
<v Speaker 1>buses ran right along the highway.</v>

759
00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.720
<v Speaker 1>When they caught on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was too late to catch her and they</v>

760
00:38:34.721 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 1>raised the alarm.</v>

761
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

762
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:42.180
<v Speaker 1>amine dark major arrived and shouted</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they failed to catch the girl,</v>

763
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:47.040
<v Speaker 1>the entire camp would be deprived of</v>
<v Speaker 1>visits and the parcels for a whole month</v>

764
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:52.340
<v Speaker 1>because of her escape</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the women brigadiers went into a</v>

765
00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:56.430
<v Speaker 1>rage and they were all shouting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them in particular who kept</v>

766
00:38:56.431 --> 00:38:58.110
<v Speaker 1>viciously rolling her eyes.</v>

767
00:38:59.250 --> 00:38:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

768
00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they catch her.</v>

769
00:39:00.921 --> 00:39:03.830
<v Speaker 1>The bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they take scissors and clip,</v>

770
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:05.143
<v Speaker 1>clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clip,</v>

771
00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.180
<v Speaker 1>take off all her hair in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lineup.</v>

772
00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.090
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't something she had thought of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it herself.</v>

773
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.460
<v Speaker 1>This was the way they punished women in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gulag.</v>

774
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.320
<v Speaker 1>But the girl who was now standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the gate house in the cold had</v>

775
00:39:18.321 --> 00:39:22.920
<v Speaker 1>sighed and said instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadly.</v>

776
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.370
<v Speaker 1>She can have a good time out in freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all of us.</v>

777
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.690
<v Speaker 1>The jailer overheard what she said and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now she was being punished.</v>

778
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else had been taken off to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp,</v>

779
00:39:34.961 --> 00:39:38.390
<v Speaker 1>but she had been said outside there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand at attention in front of the gate</v>

780
00:39:38.391 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This had been at 6:00 PM and it was now</v>

781
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 1>11:00 PM to tried to shift from one foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>to another,</v>

782
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:47.680
<v Speaker 1>but the guards stuck out his hand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouted,</v>

783
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.640
<v Speaker 1>stand at attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whore or else it will be worse for you.</v>

784
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was not moving only weeping.</v>

785
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Forgive me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen chief,</v>

786
00:39:57.521 --> 00:39:59.710
<v Speaker 1>let me into the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it anymore,</v>

787
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.400
<v Speaker 1>but even in the camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one was about to say to her,</v>

788
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.420
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>

789
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.170
<v Speaker 1>come on in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason they were keeping her out</v>

790
00:40:08.171 --> 00:40:11.590
<v Speaker 1>there for so long was it the next day</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Sunday and she would not be needed</v>

791
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:14.950
<v Speaker 1>for work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a straw,</v>

792
00:40:14.951 --> 00:40:16.510
<v Speaker 1>blonde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>naive,</v>

793
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.800
<v Speaker 1>uneducated slip of a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had been in prison for some spool of</v>

794
00:40:20.801 --> 00:40:23.560
<v Speaker 1>thread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a dangerous thought.</v>

795
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:27.370
<v Speaker 1>You express their little sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to teach you a lesson for the</v>

796
00:40:27.371 --> 00:40:31.370
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fire,</v>

797
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.110
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fought the war and we looked into the</v>

798
00:40:36.111 --> 00:40:38.360
<v Speaker 1>bonfires to see what kind of victory</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be</v>

799
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.460
<v Speaker 1>the wind was did a glowing husk from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonfire</v>

800
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:47.670
<v Speaker 1>to that flame and you girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise.</v>

801
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

802
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Whole wide world will read about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

803
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:59.300
<v Speaker 1>This is from Milton Paradise Lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mailgun when he wrote paradise lost.</v>

804
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.430
<v Speaker 1>He was trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to,</v>

805
00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:08.810
<v Speaker 1>you can say that you can think in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that that a huge part of the</v>

806
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:13.870
<v Speaker 1>mythological religious and philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise of the human race over the</v>

807
00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:18.971
<v Speaker 1>last five or 6,000 years and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>long before that has been an attempt to</v>

808
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:25.240
<v Speaker 1>segregate out what is the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good way of existing and what the</v>

809
00:41:25.401 --> 00:41:29.540
<v Speaker 1>evil way of existing now why we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with good and evil is a very</v>

810
00:41:29.541 --> 00:41:32.240
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has something to do with our</v>

811
00:41:32.241 --> 00:41:33.370
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness.</v>

812
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that because I don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're an animal you can be a</v>

813
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:40.310
<v Speaker 2>predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a human being,</v>

814
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:42.830
<v Speaker 2>you can take it past that because if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a self conscious,</v>

815
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 2>you can understand your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability.</v>

816
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.610
<v Speaker 2>You know what will hurt you.</v>

817
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.840
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you know what can hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what can hurt other people.</v>

818
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.140
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you know what can hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and what can hurt other people,</v>

819
00:41:55.141 --> 00:41:58.170
<v Speaker 2>then you can make a choice between good</v>
<v Speaker 2>and evil because you can start to hurt</v>

820
00:41:58.171 --> 00:42:00.120
<v Speaker 2>other people just for the sake of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting them.</v>

821
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.270
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's as close to evil as I think</v>

822
00:42:03.271 --> 00:42:05.340
<v Speaker 2>it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people have been trying to</v>

823
00:42:05.341 --> 00:42:09.660
<v Speaker 2>conceptualize that for it because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are trying to conceptualize it as well.</v>

824
00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.840
<v Speaker 2>How it is that human affairs can go</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreadfully wrong insofar as that can be</v>

825
00:42:14.941 --> 00:42:16.500
<v Speaker 2>laid at human feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

826
00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:18.810
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's earthquakes and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's floods,</v>

827
00:42:18.811 --> 00:42:22.050
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's people causing trouble</v>

828
00:42:22.051 --> 00:42:25.890
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of trouble and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human race has been trying to</v>

829
00:42:25.891 --> 00:42:30.891
<v Speaker 2>understand the personality</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics of that mode of action</v>

830
00:42:30.961 --> 00:42:32.160
<v Speaker 2>for thousands of years.</v>

831
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that's emerged up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology and stories and,</v>

832
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.920
<v Speaker 2>and more than in philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

833
00:42:37.921 --> 00:42:39.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the bad guy.</v>

834
00:42:39.811 --> 00:42:43.110
<v Speaker 2>And in a movie it's like a low key,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

835
00:42:43.111 --> 00:42:45.630
<v Speaker 2>that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good example of that sort of</v>

836
00:42:45.631 --> 00:42:48.420
<v Speaker 2>thing popping up in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in relatively modern culture.</v>

837
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:49.283
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

838
00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:53.010
<v Speaker 2>what's the embodiment of evil?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what Milton was trying to</v>

839
00:42:53.011 --> 00:42:54.990
<v Speaker 2>figure out when he wrote paradise lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

840
00:42:54.991 --> 00:42:58.080
<v Speaker 2>and he was taking all these stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>about say,</v>

841
00:42:58.081 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 2>tannic forces and hell that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>collected in,</v>

842
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.160
<v Speaker 2>in human culture for thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years and trying to sort</v>

843
00:43:05.161 --> 00:43:06.660
<v Speaker 2>them out and make some sense out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

844
00:43:06.661 --> 00:43:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Some narrative sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

845
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.233
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

846
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:10.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

847
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:14.570
<v Speaker 2>he believed that fundamentally evil</v>
<v Speaker 2>impulse,</v>

848
00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:18.020
<v Speaker 2>the most evil impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you could characterize evil as a</v>

849
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Meta personality that exists across</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

850
00:43:20.571 --> 00:43:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Because if you do something evil and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something evil and you do something</v>

851
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:26.000
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's some commonality</v>

852
00:43:26.001 --> 00:43:29.450
<v Speaker 2>across that you can extract out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commonalities and you can say,</v>

853
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:31.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what this personality is like.</v>

854
00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Speaker 2>But then you can also say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

855
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a very powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of personality.</v>

856
00:43:35.361 --> 00:43:37.550
<v Speaker 2>It's something that will never die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's something that can actually</v>

857
00:43:37.551 --> 00:43:39.410
<v Speaker 2>possess people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

858
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:41.990
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't think that you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's possible,</v>

859
00:43:41.991 --> 00:43:44.150
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably don't know that serial</v>

860
00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:45.920
<v Speaker 2>killers tend to compete with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

861
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:47.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of things.</v>

862
00:43:47.451 --> 00:43:49.040
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

863
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.880
<v Speaker 2>they're not fictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people who shoot up high</v>

864
00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:54.110
<v Speaker 2>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty damn</v>

865
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.310
<v Speaker 2>informed about the last person who did</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing in January.</v>

866
00:43:58.311 --> 00:44:01.100
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to do a better job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

867
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:02.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is serious,</v>

868
00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.870
<v Speaker 2>this is serious matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Milton's analysis,</v>

869
00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:07.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote what was considered the</v>

870
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.220
<v Speaker 2>greatest poem in the English language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is roughly speaking,</v>

871
00:44:10.221 --> 00:44:13.220
<v Speaker 2>is paradise lost and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

872
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:18.470
<v Speaker 2>what Milton would milton concluded?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is like a phenomenal logical</v>

873
00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:19.460
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

874
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.260
<v Speaker 2>when we talked about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenologists,</v>

875
00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:24.140
<v Speaker 2>we talked about them trying to wrestle</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

876
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.170
<v Speaker 2>with the question of what constituted</v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

877
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:28.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and human being.</v>

878
00:44:28.761 --> 00:44:31.500
<v Speaker 2>What's the nature of your experience and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

879
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.570
<v Speaker 2>then what's your relationship to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience?</v>

880
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the phenomenologists and the</v>

881
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:38.580
<v Speaker 2>existentialists claimed that the proper</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship was one of truth.</v>

882
00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:43.581
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally mill basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized Satan and that's his</v>

883
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 2>persona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Effication of evil as the,</v>

884
00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:47.550
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

885
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Either the embodiment of or the force</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>

886
00:44:50.341 --> 00:44:51.600
<v Speaker 2>You can read it either way.</v>

887
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

888
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.060
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind that has made its decision,</v>

889
00:44:58.061 --> 00:45:00.580
<v Speaker 2>that being itself is evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be eradicated.</v>

890
00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.610
<v Speaker 2>If you read the Columbine killers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the literary one,</v>

891
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.930
<v Speaker 2>if you read his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his writings,</v>

892
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:12.550
<v Speaker 2>it's exactly what he concluded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He concluded that being as such was</v>

893
00:45:12.551 --> 00:45:14.020
<v Speaker 2>flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

894
00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:19.030
<v Speaker 2>people were contemptible being itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>was unsupportable ethically because</v>

895
00:45:19.031 --> 00:45:21.460
<v Speaker 2>there was too much suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was too flawed in the best thing to</v>

896
00:45:21.461 --> 00:45:23.560
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was to eradicate it</v>

897
00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and conceptualized evil as resentment</v>

898
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:33.050
<v Speaker 2>against big now in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Milton's language that was resentment</v>

899
00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:35.300
<v Speaker 2>against God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it boils down to exactly the same</v>

900
00:45:35.301 --> 00:45:36.200
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

901
00:45:36.201 --> 00:45:38.270
<v Speaker 2>when you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can understand this,</v>

902
00:45:38.271 --> 00:45:40.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would be like the architectural</v>

903
00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.800
<v Speaker 2>roots of resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a way a union would look at it</v>

904
00:45:42.801 --> 00:45:44.180
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see,</v>

905
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:46.850
<v Speaker 2>you'll see in your life that resentment</v>
<v Speaker 2>will emerge.</v>

906
00:45:46.851 --> 00:45:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Like it'll emerge anytime something you</v>
<v Speaker 2>regard is unfair,</v>

907
00:45:49.701 --> 00:45:52.300
<v Speaker 2>happens specifically to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

908
00:45:52.301 --> 00:45:55.940
<v Speaker 2>and if it's bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll not only be irritated and angry</v>

909
00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:59.660
<v Speaker 2>and hostile and self pitying and</v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive,</v>

910
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and looking for revenge because of it.</v>

911
00:46:02.721 --> 00:46:05.870
<v Speaker 2>All those things that will happen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost inevitable.</v>

912
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:11.200
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take that far enough,</v>

913
00:46:12.061 --> 00:46:15.480
<v Speaker 2>then you get to the bottom of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the bottom of it is that it would be</v>

914
00:46:15.481 --> 00:46:19.380
<v Speaker 2>just as well in your estimation if</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that lived ceased to exist.</v>

915
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.620
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because not only did</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milton come to that conclusion,</v>

916
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great German,</v>

917
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:26.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

918
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.480
<v Speaker 2>philosopher and author and poet Girtha</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to exactly the same conclusion.</v>

919
00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:35.410
<v Speaker 2>He believed when he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he wrote Faust and faust started Mo</v>

920
00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Mephistopheles about now there's so</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mephistopheles was a,</v>

921
00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.490
<v Speaker 2>an Avatar of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>

922
00:46:40.491 --> 00:46:45.491
<v Speaker 2>his basic creed was that existence</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself is so terrible in its fundamental</v>

923
00:46:45.801 --> 00:46:48.830
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so tragic and flawed that we'd be better</v>

924
00:46:48.831 --> 00:46:50.480
<v Speaker 2>if we just brought the whole thing to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

925
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Now you think that's a pretty damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful philosophy actually.</v>

926
00:46:54.861 --> 00:46:56.990
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be times in your life where you</v>

927
00:46:56.991 --> 00:46:58.730
<v Speaker 2>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when something really</v>

928
00:46:58.731 --> 00:47:02.120
<v Speaker 2>terrible happens to someone really close</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you in some arbitrary way,</v>

929
00:47:02.121 --> 00:47:03.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'll have a child,</v>

930
00:47:03.641 --> 00:47:06.020
<v Speaker 2>it becomes extremely ill and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>painful manner,</v>

931
00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that'll be enough to make you shake</v>

932
00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.720
<v Speaker 2>your fist at heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that attitude,</v>

933
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:14.360
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've traced it,</v>

934
00:47:14.361 --> 00:47:17.870
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to understand what are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>logical conclusions to adopting that</v>

935
00:47:17.871 --> 00:47:22.760
<v Speaker 2>attitude and a logical conclusion is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you take a bad situation and you</v>

936
00:47:22.761 --> 00:47:26.870
<v Speaker 2>make it worse and that to me that means</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's logically and coherent.</v>

937
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.360
<v Speaker 2>If the problem you're trying to solve is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that being is flawed in a deep</v>

938
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 2>way and it's tragic and that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer and they suffer on justly,</v>

939
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.020
<v Speaker 2>you're making the presupposition that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong,</v>

940
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 2>that it shouldn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that it's happening is what it</v>

941
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:44.950
<v Speaker 2>what undoes the whole project of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

942
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.610
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually believe that in your acting,</v>

943
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.940
<v Speaker 2>in accordance with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the one thing you should not do is</v>

944
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:55.630
<v Speaker 2>make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you the one thing that</v>

945
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:58.780
<v Speaker 2>will make it worse is that is if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>adopt that attitude,</v>

946
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 2>it will get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll get worse,</v>

947
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 2>and at some point you'll be happy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting worse.</v>

948
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:07.420
<v Speaker 2>And at some point after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only will you be happy that it's</v>

949
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:10.900
<v Speaker 2>getting worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll be doing everything that your</v>

950
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:15.490
<v Speaker 2>imagination allows you to conceive to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it worse and worse and worse,</v>

951
00:48:15.491 --> 00:48:17.710
<v Speaker 2>faster and faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

952
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.710
<v Speaker 2>when there's a mythological conception</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hell,</v>

953
00:48:20.711 --> 00:48:23.500
<v Speaker 2>and one of the elements of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological conception is that it's a</v>

954
00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:25.270
<v Speaker 2>bottomless pit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that,</v>

955
00:48:25.271 --> 00:48:27.670
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there is nothing that is so</v>

956
00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:31.090
<v Speaker 2>awful that you can't make it worse if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just try.</v>

957
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.770
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen situations like that a</v>

958
00:48:34.771 --> 00:48:35.550
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen,</v>

959
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:38.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>families locked and absolutely homicidal</v>

960
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:42.660
<v Speaker 2>unconscious battles where every single</v>
<v Speaker 2>person in the family was doing</v>

961
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:47.430
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everything they could to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that no one was going to escape</v>

962
00:48:47.431 --> 00:48:50.580
<v Speaker 2>from that and that it was going to get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell of a lot worse.</v>

963
00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 2>So Milton wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whence,</v>

964
00:48:57.281 --> 00:49:02.281
<v Speaker 2>but from the author of all ill could</v>
<v Speaker 2>spring so deep a malice to confound the</v>

965
00:49:02.901 --> 00:49:07.430
<v Speaker 2>race of mankind in one route and earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>with hell to mingle and involve</v>

966
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:14.130
<v Speaker 2>done all to spite the great creator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Richard the third from</v>

967
00:49:15.541 --> 00:49:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shall despair.</v>

968
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:19.800
<v Speaker 2>There is no creature loves me.</v>

969
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

970
00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And if I die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

971
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:24.520
<v Speaker 2>saul will pity me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nay.</v>

972
00:49:24.521 --> 00:49:29.521
<v Speaker 2>Wherefore should they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since that I myself find in myself,</v>

973
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:35.610
<v Speaker 2>no pity to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is social needs.</v>

974
00:49:35.741 --> 00:49:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn's description of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>staunch party members.</v>

975
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.710
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess part of the contamination issue</v>

976
00:49:45.711 --> 00:49:47.930
<v Speaker 2>with something like this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.560
<v Speaker 2>you might say that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>preconditions for existing as a human</v>

978
00:49:51.561 --> 00:49:54.740
<v Speaker 2>being is the ability to tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 2>contamination and anxiety and</v>

979
00:49:54.741 --> 00:49:55.880
<v Speaker 2>imperfection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

980
00:49:55.881 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly something you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

981
00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:01.220
<v Speaker 2>He believed that in some sense you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make a pact with that in order to</v>

982
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.430
<v Speaker 2>tolerate exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to come to terms with that.</v>

983
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:07.190
<v Speaker 2>But you can fly from that in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

984
00:50:07.191 --> 00:50:11.330
<v Speaker 2>and then then there's nothing about you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's contaminated or strange or</v>

985
00:50:11.331 --> 00:50:14.270
<v Speaker 2>disgusting that's all out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all somewhere else.</v>

986
00:50:14.271 --> 00:50:15.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

987
00:50:15.861 --> 00:50:17.840
<v Speaker 2>And then you build a wall between you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>

988
00:50:17.841 --> 00:50:20.480
<v Speaker 2>And then because that doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in part,</v>

989
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:23.570
<v Speaker 2>there's no way of getting rid of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>contamination that the wall gets higher</v>

990
00:50:23.571 --> 00:50:26.470
<v Speaker 2>and higher and more and more people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the outside and fewer and fewer of</v>

991
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 2>you are on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

992
00:50:28.251 --> 00:50:31.280
<v Speaker 2>the impulse is to burn up everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's contaminated.</v>

993
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

994
00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

995
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:35.790
<v Speaker 2>and part of the problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that this is why you can't</v>

996
00:50:35.791 --> 00:50:38.580
<v Speaker 2>just conceptualize it as discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

997
00:50:38.581 --> 00:50:41.880
<v Speaker 2>cause you can think of that as a natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>territoriality you can think of is</v>

998
00:50:41.881 --> 00:50:43.860
<v Speaker 2>natural and discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think of is natural.</v>

999
00:50:43.861 --> 00:50:46.800
<v Speaker 2>But there's something about people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes just that step further.</v>

1000
00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:49.320
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the intermingling of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1001
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:53.550
<v Speaker 2>of the contamination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgust and fear response with revenge</v>

1002
00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:57.540
<v Speaker 2>and resentment and the desire to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you get those things going</v>

1003
00:50:57.541 --> 00:51:00.180
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you also add in the</v>

1004
00:51:00.181 --> 00:51:03.570
<v Speaker 2>propensity to lie man life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are going to get really,</v>

1005
00:51:03.571 --> 00:51:06.000
<v Speaker 2>really ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to get really bad.</v>

1006
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.000
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to come to terms with the fact</v>

1007
00:51:09.001 --> 00:51:12.230
<v Speaker 2>that you carry the contamination around</v>
<v Speaker 2>in you,</v>

1008
00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.610
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you go.</v>

1009
00:51:14.611 --> 00:51:17.970
<v Speaker 2>And that that's an ineradicable part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of limited being.</v>

1010
00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.980
<v Speaker 2>And then you can't be resentful about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1011
00:51:19.981 --> 00:51:23.640
<v Speaker 2>are hateful about it because if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you act in a manner that will</v>

1012
00:51:23.641 --> 00:51:28.641
<v Speaker 2>definitely make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>

1013
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:33.340
<v Speaker 2>this is social and it's the stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Communist Party loyalists who were</v>

1014
00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:36.610
<v Speaker 2>arrested by the gulag system and thrown</v>
<v Speaker 2>into prison,</v>

1015
00:51:36.611 --> 00:51:38.380
<v Speaker 2>not happening to them all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because no,</v>

1016
00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.920
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like the system was plagued by</v>
<v Speaker 2>any real rules.</v>

1017
00:51:41.921 --> 00:51:44.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact it was probably even better as</v>

1018
00:51:44.441 --> 00:51:47.830
<v Speaker 2>far as the fundamental motives of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system are concerned that you are</v>

1019
00:51:47.831 --> 00:51:51.250
<v Speaker 2>innocent when you got arrested because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that made it even more miserable and it</v>

1020
00:51:51.251 --> 00:51:53.230
<v Speaker 2>would be even funnier if you were</v>

1021
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:57.350
<v Speaker 1>arrested for supporting the system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to arrest you.</v>

1022
00:51:57.351 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like that was the perfect form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious ird.</v>

1023
00:51:59.841 --> 00:52:04.841
<v Speaker 1>And so that happened a lot to say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>things were painful for them is to say</v>

1024
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:09.110
<v Speaker 1>almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were incapable of assimilating such</v>

1025
00:52:09.111 --> 00:52:11.510
<v Speaker 1>a blow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a downfall and from their own</v>

1026
00:52:11.511 --> 00:52:16.511
<v Speaker 1>people to from their own dear party and</v>
<v Speaker 1>from all appearances for nothing at all.</v>

1027
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.120
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had been guilty of nothing as far</v>

1028
00:52:20.121 --> 00:52:22.100
<v Speaker 1>as the party was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing at all.</v>

1029
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:27.820
<v Speaker 1>It was painful for them to such a degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was considered taboo among them.</v>

1030
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm comradely to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were you in prison for?</v>

1031
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.600
<v Speaker 1>The only squeamish generation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners.</v>

1032
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.290
<v Speaker 1>The rest of us with tongues hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't wait to tell the story to every</v>

1033
00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:42.140
<v Speaker 1>chance newcomer we met and to the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell.</v>

1034
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Cause if we're an anecdote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the sort of people they were.</v>

1035
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Olga sleep Oseberg's husband had already</v>
<v Speaker 1>been arrested and they,</v>

1036
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:57.010
<v Speaker 1>which was usually the KGB and usually in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the night and they had</v>

1037
00:52:57.411 --> 00:52:59.330
<v Speaker 1>come to carry out a search and arrest</v>
<v Speaker 1>her too.</v>

1038
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:04.420
<v Speaker 1>The search lasted for hours and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent those four hours sorting out the</v>

1039
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:08.870
<v Speaker 1>minutes of the congress of Staccato</v>
<v Speaker 1>vites of the brush,</v>

1040
00:53:08.871 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 1>low and British bristle and brush</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

1041
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.200
<v Speaker 1>of which she had been the secretary</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the previous day.</v>

1042
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:20.210
<v Speaker 1>The incomplete state of the minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>troubled her more than her children who</v>

1043
00:53:20.211 --> 00:53:23.720
<v Speaker 1>she was now leaving forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the interrogator conducting the</v>

1044
00:53:23.721 --> 00:53:26.670
<v Speaker 1>search could not resist telling her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on now,</v>

1045
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>say goodbye to your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sort of people they were</v>

1046
00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.790
<v Speaker 1>a letter from her 15 year old daughter</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to yellows,</v>

1047
00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Loveta cep cova in the cad sound prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>for long term prisoners.</v>

1048
00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me why.</v>

1049
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:46.603
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

1050
00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.330
<v Speaker 1>are you guilty or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you weren't guilty because then I</v>

1051
00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:53.620
<v Speaker 1>won't join the Komsomol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a Soviet youth groups,</v>

1052
00:53:53.621 --> 00:53:55.670
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the boy scouts or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brownies,</v>

1053
00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:59.740
<v Speaker 1>except it was the communist version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because then I won't join the calm</v>

1054
00:53:59.741 --> 00:54:01.820
<v Speaker 1>softball and I won't forgive them</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of you.</v>

1055
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:06.380
<v Speaker 1>But if you are guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I won't write you anymore and I</v>

1056
00:54:06.381 --> 00:54:08.990
<v Speaker 1>will hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the mother was stricken by remorse</v>

1057
00:54:08.991 --> 00:54:11.750
<v Speaker 1>in her damp grave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sell within its with it's dim</v>

1058
00:54:11.751 --> 00:54:14.270
<v Speaker 1>little lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could her daughter live without the</v>

1059
00:54:14.271 --> 00:54:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Komsomol?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could she be permitted to hate</v>

1060
00:54:16.971 --> 00:54:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Soviet power battery that she should</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate me?</v>

1061
00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And so she wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am guilty.</v>

1062
00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Enter the Komsomol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could it be anything but hard?</v>

1063
00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:31.970
<v Speaker 1>It was more than the human heart could</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear to fall beneath the beloved acts</v>

1064
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.470
<v Speaker 1>and then to have to justify its wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the price of man pays for.</v>

1065
00:54:36.471 --> 00:54:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Interesting is God given sole to human</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogma.</v>

1066
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any orthodox communist will affirm that</v>

1067
00:54:43.371 --> 00:54:47.750
<v Speaker 1>set Cova acted correctly even today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cannot be convinced that this is</v>

1068
00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:51.140
<v Speaker 1>precisely the perversion of small</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces,</v>

1069
00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.590
<v Speaker 1>that the mother perverted her daughter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and harmed her soul.</v>

1070
00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Here's the sort of people they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were yt gave sincere testimony</v>

1071
00:55:00.381 --> 00:55:02.900
<v Speaker 1>against her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to aid the party.</v>

1072
00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how one can pity them if at least now</v>

1073
00:55:07.101 --> 00:55:09.290
<v Speaker 1>they had come to comprehend their former</v>
<v Speaker 1>wretchedness,</v>

1074
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:11.450
<v Speaker 1>the whole chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole chapter could have been</v>

1075
00:55:11.451 --> 00:55:14.750
<v Speaker 1>written quite differently if today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least they had forsaken their earlier</v>

1076
00:55:14.751 --> 00:55:18.460
<v Speaker 1>views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happened the way Maria Daniel and</v>

1077
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.700
<v Speaker 1>had dreamed it would.</v>

1078
00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.330
<v Speaker 1>If I leave here someday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live as if nothing</v>

1079
00:55:23.331 --> 00:55:25.640
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty</v>

1080
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.210
<v Speaker 1>in our view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just plain pigheadedness.</v>

1081
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:31.820
<v Speaker 1>These devote to the theory of</v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

1082
00:55:31.821 --> 00:55:36.140
<v Speaker 1>construed loyalty to that development to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean renunciation of any personal</v>

1083
00:55:36.141 --> 00:55:40.670
<v Speaker 1>development whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Nikolai Adamovich villain,</v>

1084
00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:43.280
<v Speaker 1>chuck said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after serving 17 years,</v>

1085
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:47.000
<v Speaker 1>we believed in the party and we were not</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistaken.</v>

1086
00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Is this loyalty or pigheadedness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1087
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:56.270
<v Speaker 1>it was not for show and not out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocrisy that they argued in the cells</v>

1088
00:55:56.271 --> 00:55:58.070
<v Speaker 1>and defensive all the government's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

1089
00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:02.360
<v Speaker 1>They needed ideological arguments in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to hold on to a sense of their own</v>

1090
00:56:02.361 --> 00:56:04.280
<v Speaker 1>rightness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

1091
00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.330
<v Speaker 1>insanity was not far off.</v>

1092
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:40.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people build memorials now they bowed</v>

1093
00:56:40.941 --> 00:56:43.550
<v Speaker 2>hoke Holocaust memorials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a Holocaust memorial in</v>

1094
00:56:43.551 --> 00:56:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Washington and there's a Holocaust</v>
<v Speaker 2>memorial in Berlin.</v>

1095
00:56:46.081 --> 00:56:47.330
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1096
00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:53.980
<v Speaker 2>the Motif for the slogan of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>memorials is we shall never forget.</v>

1097
00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.370
<v Speaker 2>And I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't remember something you don't</v>

1098
00:57:01.371 --> 00:57:02.204
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1099
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1100
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.120
<v Speaker 2>You can say you're not going to forget</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you want,</v>

1101
00:57:06.121 --> 00:57:09.270
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you understand what happened,</v>

1102
00:57:09.271 --> 00:57:13.440
<v Speaker 2>you can't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't understand what happened,</v>

1103
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.320
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as far as I can tell,</v>

1104
00:57:16.321 --> 00:57:18.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing that happened</v>

1105
00:57:18.241 --> 00:57:21.360
<v Speaker 2>in the entire 20th century with regards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to evidence for,</v>

1106
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:24.090
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1107
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:28.380
<v Speaker 2>absolute existential catastrophes that</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened the human rates at the</v>

1108
00:57:28.381 --> 00:57:31.110
<v Speaker 2>individual level and at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the state level and at the</v>

1109
00:57:31.111 --> 00:57:34.680
<v Speaker 2>international level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all whatever it was that produced</v>

1110
00:57:34.681 --> 00:57:38.710
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis and that produced the Soviets</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the produced the Maoist.</v>

1111
00:57:38.711 --> 00:57:42.300
<v Speaker 2>And that hasn't gone away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly because we don't</v>

1112
00:57:42.301 --> 00:57:43.890
<v Speaker 2>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1113
00:57:43.891 --> 00:57:47.670
<v Speaker 2>And from what I've been able to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is partly why teach you guys</v>

1114
00:57:47.671 --> 00:57:49.770
<v Speaker 2>about the existentialists and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenologists,</v>

1115
00:57:49.771 --> 00:57:52.740
<v Speaker 2>because they're not covered very often</v>
<v Speaker 2>in personality classes anymore.</v>

1116
00:57:52.741 --> 00:57:56.490
<v Speaker 2>It's because I do believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that there's,</v>

1117
00:57:56.491 --> 00:57:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I do believe it was demonstrated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who throw it through most</v>

1118
00:57:59.941 --> 00:58:02.460
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is a direct causal</v>

1119
00:58:02.461 --> 00:58:06.510
<v Speaker 2>relationship between individual ethical</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>

1120
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:11.700
<v Speaker 2>And I can define that the corruption is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the individual does something that</v>

1121
00:58:11.701 --> 00:58:15.750
<v Speaker 2>they know themselves by their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>standards to be wrong.</v>

1122
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not a relativistic claim at all and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really have much to do with</v>

1123
00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:22.080
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to do with false hood cause I</v>

1124
00:58:22.081 --> 00:58:23.940
<v Speaker 2>don't think people can identify the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

1125
00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:27.750
<v Speaker 2>but I know they can identify false hood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1126
00:58:27.751 --> 00:58:32.751
<v Speaker 2>and I think that people become corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they act out actions that they know</v>

1127
00:58:32.911 --> 00:58:35.250
<v Speaker 2>by their own moral standards to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

1128
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.560
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do the same thing in a Piagetian</v>

1129
00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:41.730
<v Speaker 2>sense when they refuse to accommodate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they've assimilated.</v>

1130
00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:46.560
<v Speaker 2>So if I pick up a piece of information</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it contradicts a dearly cherished</v>

1131
00:58:46.561 --> 00:58:51.561
<v Speaker 2>belief and then I refuse to take that</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of information and transform my</v>

1132
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:54.690
<v Speaker 2>perceptual and belief structures to</v>
<v Speaker 2>account for it,</v>

1133
00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:56.460
<v Speaker 2>then I'm doing the same thing.</v>

1134
00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:00.330
<v Speaker 2>That's willful blindness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that makes you smaller and smaller.</v>

1135
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:04.260
<v Speaker 2>And the world more and more out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>control and you weaker and weaker and</v>

1136
00:59:04.261 --> 00:59:06.990
<v Speaker 2>more likely to be paranoid and angry and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt.</v>

1137
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And I also don't think that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>connections between people and the</v>

1138
00:59:11.911 --> 00:59:14.520
<v Speaker 2>society are as abstract and distant as</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think.</v>

1139
00:59:14.521 --> 00:59:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what the hell difference could it</v>

1140
00:59:17.041 --> 00:59:18.120
<v Speaker 2>possibly make?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1141
00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:19.950
<v Speaker 2>the way I behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1142
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:25.430
<v Speaker 2>well you're a node in the network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not an individual connected by a</v>

1143
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:30.800
<v Speaker 2>linear line to another individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to a linear line by another</v>

1144
00:59:30.801 --> 00:59:34.740
<v Speaker 2>individual in line that's 7 billion</v>
<v Speaker 2>people long that would make you nothing.</v>

1145
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:38.060
<v Speaker 2>You can just pull you out and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line would reclose and that would be</v>

1146
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:40.070
<v Speaker 2>the end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a node in the network and the</v>

1147
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 2>networks communicating and we know for</v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1148
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 2>that you know you're roughly going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with in some serious way a</v>

1149
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.170
<v Speaker 2>thousand people in your lifetime.</v>

1150
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:51.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a minimum minimum estimate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.270
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all those people know a thousand</v>

1152
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:55.130
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a million people that are one</v>

1153
00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:59.270
<v Speaker 2>person away from you and two people away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from you is a billion people.</v>

1154
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you get to three,</v>

1155
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:03.170
<v Speaker 2>well that's far more people than there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1156
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.930
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're only three or four or five</v>

1157
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:09.050
<v Speaker 2>connections away from everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's very,</v>

1158
01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:14.051
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to know exactly how your</v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors and misbehaviors echo and</v>

1159
01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:18.170
<v Speaker 2>ripple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1160
01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:20.690
<v Speaker 2>and we know that people can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous forces for good.</v>

1161
01:00:20.691 --> 01:00:23.360
<v Speaker 2>We know that because we do see people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that from time to diamond.</v>

1162
01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:28.361
<v Speaker 2>We certainly know plenty about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse and so god only knows what,</v>

1163
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:31.770
<v Speaker 2>what role you play in determining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1164
01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:35.330
<v Speaker 2>whether the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the part and the whole of mankind goes</v>

1165
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:40.331
<v Speaker 2>seriously wrong or seriously right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wouldn't dismiss it as a fantasy</v>

1166
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.860
<v Speaker 2>from everything I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1167
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 2>what you do definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely affects your family and what</v>

1168
01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:50.840
<v Speaker 2>your family does definitely affects the</v>
<v Speaker 2>community and what the community does</v>

1169
01:00:50.841 --> 01:00:54.800
<v Speaker 2>definitely affects the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't take much rippling for</v>

1170
01:00:54.801 --> 01:00:58.070
<v Speaker 2>these things to start to have the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1171
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:59.210
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1172
01:00:59.211 --> 01:01:02.210
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take that many people in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>country to cheat on their income tax</v>

1173
01:01:02.211 --> 01:01:04.070
<v Speaker 2>before the whole damned economy falls</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

1174
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.790
<v Speaker 2>I doubt if it's more than 10% you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's pretty,</v>

1175
01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:10.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a miraculous that there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries where that doesn't happen.</v>

1176
01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah</v>

1177
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.450
<v Speaker 2>but there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows why.</v>

1178
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:16.183
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1179
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.450
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth thinking about,</v>

1180
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:23.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause people ask questions like,</v>

1181
01:01:23.941 --> 01:01:24.750
<v Speaker 2>well what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1182
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:27.510
<v Speaker 2>does life have any meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you one meaning that it has</v>

1183
01:01:27.511 --> 01:01:31.710
<v Speaker 2>like it's perfectly reasonable for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to devote yourself to not producing any</v>

1184
01:01:31.711 --> 01:01:35.610
<v Speaker 2>more suffering than is absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary because I don't care what you</v>

1185
01:01:35.611 --> 01:01:37.920
<v Speaker 2>think about meaning in the absence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive meeting,</v>

1186
01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.370
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty damn hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tend to die you pain and you know you</v>

1187
01:01:41.371 --> 01:01:46.371
<v Speaker 2>could at minimum live in such a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're least likely to create mayhem in</v>

1188
01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:49.530
<v Speaker 2>misery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1189
01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least it's a start.</v>

1190
01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.290
<v Speaker 2>And I certainly know that if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide to live that way,</v>

1191
01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:59.850
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you can cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious trouble is extraordinarily high.</v>

1192
01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:02.700
<v Speaker 2>And so you got to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what you want?</v>

1193
01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:05.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it is sometimes what people want.</v>

1194
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.480
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's an abdication of</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and I think it's</v>

1195
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.350
<v Speaker 2>resentful and week to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's no,</v>

1196
01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing in it but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and weakness.</v>

1197
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that ends the philosophical part of</v>

1198
01:02:24.301 --> 01:02:29.301
<v Speaker 2>the course roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you can't separate philosophy from</v>

1199
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:32.340
<v Speaker 2>anything because philosophy is about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what things mean.</v>

1200
01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:35.070
<v Speaker 2>And even though we're going to go into</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometrics now and we're going to go</v>

1201
01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:35.940
<v Speaker 2>into biology.</v>

1202
01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:39.163
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1203
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.880
<v Speaker 2>It's all building the same edifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

1204
01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:43.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start to talk to you a</v>

1205
01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:45.570
<v Speaker 2>little bit today about psychometrics</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1206
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1207
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:53.700
<v Speaker 2>I doubt very much that any of you</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to go into psychology because of</v>

1208
01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:55.860
<v Speaker 2>psychometrics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the theory of measurement.</v>

1209
01:02:55.861 --> 01:02:56.521
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1210
01:02:56.521 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of dry.</v>

1211
01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.480
<v Speaker 2>The theory of measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly wasn't something I was</v>

1212
01:03:00.481 --> 01:03:02.300
<v Speaker 2>enamored of when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1213
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:05.850
<v Speaker 2>an undergraduate or a graduate student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1214
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then as I started to dig into things</v>

1215
01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:12.960
<v Speaker 2>and started to try to really understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and you know,</v>

1216
01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.530
<v Speaker 2>and understand means that you can use</v>
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge that you have to do</v>

1217
01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:20.070
<v Speaker 2>something valuable with that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what understanding seems to me to be,</v>

1218
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:24.960
<v Speaker 2>the thing I kept running into was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that measurement is everything in</v>

1219
01:03:24.961 --> 01:03:27.150
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a science it's everything.</v>

1220
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>measuring,</v>

1221
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.510
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it gets worse because it turns</v>

1222
01:03:33.511 --> 01:03:36.030
<v Speaker 2>out that measuring things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially psychological things is</v>

1223
01:03:36.031 --> 01:03:36.631
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1224
01:03:36.631 --> 01:03:37.464
<v Speaker 2>really hard.</v>

1225
01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.370
<v Speaker 2>And so psychologists do it badly all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1226
01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:43.800
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it's because they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what the hell they're doing.</v>

1227
01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:46.800
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's willful blindness and sometimes</v>

1228
01:03:46.801 --> 01:03:49.710
<v Speaker 2>it's blind careerism and it's those two</v>
<v Speaker 2>things a lot.</v>

1229
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:55.220
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things I want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you and for you for the remainder</v>

1230
01:03:55.501 --> 01:03:57.960
<v Speaker 2>of the course is to well teach you some</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>

1231
01:03:57.961 --> 01:04:00.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some neurobiology because actually there</v>

1232
01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:03.840
<v Speaker 2>have been some real biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology geniuses and they've</v>

1233
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:05.130
<v Speaker 2>outlined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1234
01:04:05.131 --> 01:04:06.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1235
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.050
<v Speaker 2>the stigma of brain function quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>nicely and in a way that I think is</v>

1236
01:04:10.051 --> 01:04:13.110
<v Speaker 2>really interesting to know about and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's important and useful.</v>

1237
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:18.560
<v Speaker 2>But also to familiarize you with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic concepts of psychometrics because</v>

1238
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:21.210
<v Speaker 2>you'll be armed against stupidity that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1239
01:04:21.211 --> 01:04:23.460
<v Speaker 2>And it's really useful to be armed</v>
<v Speaker 2>against stupidity.</v>

1240
01:04:23.461 --> 01:04:27.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's especially the case if any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are interested in science or if</v>

1241
01:04:27.661 --> 01:04:29.700
<v Speaker 2>you're interested in psychology as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

1242
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Now how many of you are interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology?</v>

1243
01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Has a science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1244
01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:36.780
<v Speaker 2>so there's a substantial number of you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I presume that some of you are</v>

1245
01:04:36.781 --> 01:04:39.570
<v Speaker 2>interested because maybe you hope to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a career of it or you know,</v>

1246
01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 2>or at least to finish your degree as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1247
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:45.060
<v Speaker 2>a psychologist with biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>orientation.</v>

1248
01:04:45.061 --> 01:04:48.570
<v Speaker 2>So either way you need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to know what we're going to</v>

1249
01:04:48.571 --> 01:04:53.400
<v Speaker 2>learn in the next couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing you have to really</v>

1250
01:04:53.401 --> 01:04:57.930
<v Speaker 2>come to terms with is how the hell do</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know something is real?</v>

1251
01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a measurement problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know now the people that we've been</v>

1252
01:05:01.171 --> 01:05:03.090
<v Speaker 2>talking about have been concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>

1253
01:05:03.091 --> 01:05:07.230
<v Speaker 2>And they argue about it because some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them are more like objective material</v>

1254
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:10.900
<v Speaker 2>scientist and some of them are more like</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenologists and so everybody's sort</v>

1255
01:05:10.901 --> 01:05:13.710
<v Speaker 2>of concerned with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's the nature of the real?</v>

1256
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.660
<v Speaker 2>But scientists have an additional</v>
<v Speaker 2>concern,</v>

1257
01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how do you measure it?</v>

1258
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:22.960
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a secondary concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The measurement is everything.</v>

1259
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.570
<v Speaker 2>It's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get anywhere without the</v>

1260
01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:27.460
<v Speaker 2>measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>

1261
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:31.690
<v Speaker 2>well what are people like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1262
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:34.210
<v Speaker 2>what are people like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have beliefs?</v>

1263
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Do they have attitudes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have values?</v>

1264
01:05:36.071 --> 01:05:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Do they have personalities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have emotions too?</v>

1265
01:05:38.621 --> 01:05:40.930
<v Speaker 2>They have motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have cognitions?</v>

1266
01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Do they have behaviors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you separate those from one</v>

1267
01:05:44.111 --> 01:05:45.040
<v Speaker 2>another?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1268
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like how do you,</v>

1269
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>how do you assess them at micro and</v>
<v Speaker 2>macro levels?</v>

1270
01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.670
<v Speaker 2>How do you conceptualize them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's a unit of behavior?</v>

1271
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:58.510
<v Speaker 2>That's a really difficult thing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out her what's of value and is</v>

1272
01:05:58.511 --> 01:06:01.030
<v Speaker 2>what you value independent of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality?</v>

1273
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your personality or what's a</v>

1274
01:06:03.341 --> 01:06:04.780
<v Speaker 2>trait?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1275
01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:06.370
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a complete mess.</v>

1276
01:06:06.371 --> 01:06:06.881
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1277
01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:09.550
<v Speaker 2>it's something that's chasing its own</v>
<v Speaker 2>tail constantly.</v>

1278
01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:13.060
<v Speaker 2>It's been very difficult for</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists to come to terms about</v>

1279
01:06:13.061 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 2>this now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can tell you something about</v>

1280
01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:19.360
<v Speaker 2>measurement theory first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one thing you might ask yourself is</v>

1281
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:21.970
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you determine what's real</v>

1282
01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:22.804
<v Speaker 2>in the world?</v>

1283
01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing you might think about</v>

1284
01:06:25.821 --> 01:06:29.720
<v Speaker 2>is while this is an empirical idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have census.</v>

1285
01:06:29.721 --> 01:06:34.280
<v Speaker 2>And so a radical in Paris in Paris would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you get all the information about</v>

1286
01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:36.830
<v Speaker 2>the world from your senses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sense data.</v>

1287
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:38.083
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1288
01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:41.480
<v Speaker 2>so then you might notice and you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1289
01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1290
01:06:42.471 --> 01:06:46.760
<v Speaker 2>let's say since data provides you with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture of the world and let's even go</v>

1291
01:06:46.761 --> 01:06:48.320
<v Speaker 2>one step farther and let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1292
01:06:48.321 --> 01:06:50.060
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it provides you with a picture of the</v>

1293
01:06:50.061 --> 01:06:52.850
<v Speaker 2>reality of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you might say,</v>

1294
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:56.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many senses do you need?</v>

1295
01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:02.230
<v Speaker 2>And it's one high enough while we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>two eyes.</v>

1296
01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:04.840
<v Speaker 2>So one eye doesn't seem to have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough for people.</v>

1297
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:06.130
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1298
01:07:06.131 --> 01:07:08.650
<v Speaker 2>it's two eyes and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just two eyes,</v>

1299
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:13.000
<v Speaker 2>it's two eyes in hearing and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just two eyes and hearing it's two</v>

1300
01:07:13.001 --> 01:07:13.834
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hearing,</v>

1301
01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.750
<v Speaker 2>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taste and touch.</v>

1302
01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1303
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So That's interesting.</v>

1304
01:07:19.471 --> 01:07:23.000
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is evolution has</v>
<v Speaker 2>calculated that for a,</v>

1305
01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:27.660
<v Speaker 2>for a beast like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need five dimensions of evaluation</v>

1306
01:07:27.661 --> 01:07:29.880
<v Speaker 2>before you can be certain that something</v>
<v Speaker 2>is real.</v>

1307
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.480
<v Speaker 2>You can't rely on one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1308
01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:38.310
<v Speaker 2>you can't rely on too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you can see something and hear</v>

1309
01:07:38.311 --> 01:07:39.144
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1310
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:42.270
<v Speaker 2>it's much more likely to be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if you can just see it or just hear</v>

1311
01:07:42.271 --> 01:07:44.370
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can see it and hear it and</v>

1312
01:07:44.371 --> 01:07:48.420
<v Speaker 2>touch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like at that point it takes a</v>

1313
01:07:48.421 --> 01:07:52.770
<v Speaker 2>pretty damn sneaky thing to fool you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you add taste and smell to</v>

1314
01:07:52.771 --> 01:07:54.120
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1315
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:56.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we've figured out is that enough?</v>

1316
01:07:56.790 --> 01:07:59.040
<v Speaker 2>If you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get those five things working,</v>

1317
01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you probably won't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good measurement of whether</v>

1318
01:08:03.061 --> 01:08:05.070
<v Speaker 2>that's sufficiently real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1319
01:08:05.071 --> 01:08:06.120
<v Speaker 2>So That's interesting.</v>

1320
01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:10.440
<v Speaker 2>So your your sensory Operandi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our measurement devices,</v>

1321
01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.170
<v Speaker 2>but you don't just need one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need five and then you think,</v>

1322
01:08:13.171 --> 01:08:18.171
<v Speaker 2>well are those the same or different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it turns out that's a complicated</v>

1323
01:08:19.191 --> 01:08:22.130
<v Speaker 2>question because although this may not</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem obvious,</v>

1324
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:27.380
<v Speaker 2>two things can be the same and different</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an infinite number of ways.</v>

1325
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.110
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things you might say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what makes,</v>

1326
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:32.360
<v Speaker 2>why do you put two things in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>category?</v>

1327
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:34.700
<v Speaker 2>And you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well because they're similar.</v>

1328
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually that turns out not to be.</v>

1329
01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they're similar and different in</v>

1330
01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:42.530
<v Speaker 2>an infinite number of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't use that as a basis for</v>

1331
01:08:42.531 --> 01:08:45.140
<v Speaker 2>categorization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus it's just circular.</v>

1332
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:48.830
<v Speaker 2>You put similar things in a category</v>
<v Speaker 2>because categories contains similar</v>

1333
01:08:48.831 --> 01:08:50.240
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not helpful,</v>

1334
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1335
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.810
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to zero in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1336
01:08:56.990 --> 01:09:01.160
<v Speaker 2>not only do you need to sense it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need to use sentences that in</v>

1337
01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:03.740
<v Speaker 2>some sense are qualitatively different</v>
<v Speaker 2>from one another.</v>

1338
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.960
<v Speaker 2>So you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might almost think about them is</v>

1339
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:09.950
<v Speaker 2>uncorrelated isn't exactly the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>phrase,</v>

1340
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.860
<v Speaker 2>but they're different methodological</v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques.</v>

1341
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:14.360
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1342
01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:17.540
<v Speaker 2>your eyes rely on light waves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1343
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:21.410
<v Speaker 2>And then your ears rely on sound waves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are quite different.</v>

1344
01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:23.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't even interfere with each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other to any,</v>

1345
01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:27.830
<v Speaker 2>to any real degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that means what you're getting is</v>

1346
01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:30.590
<v Speaker 2>information from two independent</v>
<v Speaker 2>sources.</v>

1347
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:32.810
<v Speaker 2>So that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then if you,</v>

1348
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:34.880
<v Speaker 2>if you smell something or more</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately,</v>

1349
01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:37.400
<v Speaker 2>if you taste something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this,</v>

1350
01:09:37.401 --> 01:09:42.401
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to be the case that taste</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a molecular phenomena that you know</v>

1351
01:09:43.461 --> 01:09:45.710
<v Speaker 2>that when you taste something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually assessing it.</v>

1352
01:09:45.711 --> 01:09:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm a molecular level and there might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>as many tastes in some sense,</v>

1353
01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:52.730
<v Speaker 2>or at least as many smells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're sensing that at a molecular</v>

1354
01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:56.240
<v Speaker 2>level and smell is more complex as there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are substances.</v>

1355
01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people aren't quite sure about that,</v>

1356
01:09:58.311 --> 01:09:59.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1357
01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:01.820
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it differentiates a lot.</v>

1358
01:10:01.821 --> 01:10:06.620
<v Speaker 2>And so you're detecting molecular</v>
<v Speaker 2>signatures with your nose and then with</v>

1359
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:10.510
<v Speaker 2>your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're detecting the electron shells on</v>

1360
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.090
<v Speaker 2>the outside of your fingertips are</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing against the electron shells of</v>

1361
01:10:14.091 --> 01:10:16.070
<v Speaker 2>solid surfaces and they can't push</v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1362
01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:17.870
<v Speaker 2>And so that's basically what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>detecting.</v>

1363
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:22.250
<v Speaker 2>You're detecting the elect surface of</v>
<v Speaker 2>electrons more,</v>

1364
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.080
<v Speaker 2>more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't push through it.</v>

1365
01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:26.120
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different way of,</v>

1366
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:29.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a different way of determining</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not something is real.</v>

1367
01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And so the reason I'm telling you this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because there,</v>

1368
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.950
<v Speaker 2>there was a famous set of papers</v>
<v Speaker 2>published in the 1950s by a researcher</v>

1369
01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:39.200
<v Speaker 2>named [inaudible] and another researcher</v>
<v Speaker 2>named meal.</v>

1370
01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:42.980
<v Speaker 2>And they were trying to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world should psychologists figure</v>

1371
01:10:42.981 --> 01:10:46.460
<v Speaker 2>out what a phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what phenomena is real.</v>

1372
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same question in some sense</v>

1373
01:10:48.351 --> 01:10:50.870
<v Speaker 2>that the chemists had disordered out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they sorted that out.</v>

1374
01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:53.690
<v Speaker 2>They got the periodic table of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements and that was the end of that.</v>

1375
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.840
<v Speaker 2>That was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a big step forward because they</v>

1376
01:10:56.841 --> 01:11:00.710
<v Speaker 2>got their basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got their idea about what the world</v>

1377
01:11:00.711 --> 01:11:02.840
<v Speaker 2>was made of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nailed down pretty damn tight,</v>

1378
01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 2>and then they could move from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in psychology it's like we have this</v>

1379
01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:07.850
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the basic phenomena?</v>

1380
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what meal and chronback we're trying</v>

1381
01:11:11.121 --> 01:11:13.710
<v Speaker 2>to figure out is not so much what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic where,</v>

1382
01:11:13.711 --> 01:11:17.190
<v Speaker 2>but how it would be that you could go</v>
<v Speaker 2>about figuring out what they were if</v>

1383
01:11:17.191 --> 01:11:22.170
<v Speaker 2>they existed and they basically came up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a strategy that's very similar to</v>

1384
01:11:22.171 --> 01:11:26.580
<v Speaker 2>the sense strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're hypothesis was you can't</v>

1385
01:11:26.581 --> 01:11:31.581
<v Speaker 2>really tell if something is real unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can measure it using a variety of</v>

1386
01:11:31.831 --> 01:11:34.770
<v Speaker 2>different methods and get the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>

1387
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Now the first thing you should remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that every psychologist knows this</v>

1388
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.850
<v Speaker 2>unless they've been trained</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily badly.</v>

1389
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Cause this is a key paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1390
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a key paper of what's called</v>
<v Speaker 2>construct validation.</v>

1391
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.800
<v Speaker 2>And a construct is a measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1392
01:11:52.801 --> 01:11:55.860
<v Speaker 2>And so the issue with construct</v>
<v Speaker 2>measurement is how do you construct your</v>

1393
01:11:55.861 --> 01:11:57.990
<v Speaker 2>measures so that you know they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>measuring something real.</v>

1394
01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:00.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not something peripheral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get this right.</v>

1395
01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:05.810
<v Speaker 2>And the rule from chronback in meal was</v>
<v Speaker 2>multi method multi-method.</v>

1396
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a bit of a problem there</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not exactly clear when</v>

1397
01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:13.050
<v Speaker 2>you're using the same method and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using a different method.</v>

1398
01:12:13.051 --> 01:12:14.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I,</v>

1399
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.510
<v Speaker 2>if I say I filled out a questionnaire</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your personality and then you</v>

1400
01:12:18.511 --> 01:12:20.460
<v Speaker 2>filled out a questionnaire about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>

1401
01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:22.500
<v Speaker 2>is that the same method or a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>method?</v>

1402
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Well there's some similarities and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

1403
01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if I had you fill out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>questionnaire,</v>

1404
01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:30.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I gave you an electric shock and I</v>

1405
01:12:30.871 --> 01:12:34.110
<v Speaker 2>had you fill a questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would about how you felt about that.</v>

1406
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.280
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time I measured changes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your skin conductance cause those</v>

1407
01:12:38.281 --> 01:12:40.650
<v Speaker 2>occur because you sweat a bit if you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been stressed,</v>

1408
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:43.050
<v Speaker 2>maybe I measure your heart rate</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceleration,</v>

1409
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might notice that when you report,</v>

1410
01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:49.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being unhappy or miserable or angry or</v>

1411
01:12:49.321 --> 01:12:53.730
<v Speaker 2>frustrated or disappointed or stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also show us skin conductance</v>

1412
01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:57.000
<v Speaker 2>increase because you're sweating a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and your heart rate goes up.</v>

1413
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:59.790
<v Speaker 2>And then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I've kind of triangulated on the</v>

1414
01:12:59.791 --> 01:13:02.610
<v Speaker 2>phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what the phenomena is but</v>

1415
01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:04.260
<v Speaker 2>at least we can measure it three</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

1416
01:13:04.261 --> 01:13:06.000
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that with heart rate for</v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1417
01:13:06.001 --> 01:13:07.590
<v Speaker 2>it's being damn tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1418
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:09.840
<v Speaker 2>cause you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well heart rates and objective measures</v>

1419
01:13:09.841 --> 01:13:12.420
<v Speaker 2>so you could get at what it index is</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite easily.</v>

1420
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:14.890
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get afraid your heart rate will</v>

1421
01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.100
<v Speaker 2>go up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you get excited,</v>

1422
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:20.280
<v Speaker 2>your heart rate will go up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll go up if you take cocaine and will</v>

1423
01:13:20.281 --> 01:13:21.990
<v Speaker 2>go up if you run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1424
01:13:21.991 --> 01:13:25.800
<v Speaker 2>so it's not exactly clear what heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>rate index is indexing.</v>

1425
01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:29.430
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that from the psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1426
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.970
<v Speaker 2>the theory has developed to the point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we,</v>

1427
01:13:32.971 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we assume that when I measure your heart</v>

1428
01:13:35.731 --> 01:13:39.090
<v Speaker 2>rate increase to a phenomena that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with exercise,</v>

1429
01:13:39.091 --> 01:13:41.760
<v Speaker 2>say that what I'm actually assessing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>your bodies.</v>

1430
01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:43.483
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>

1431
01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:48.150
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intensity of your bodies preparation</v>

1432
01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.980
<v Speaker 2>to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes sense,</v>

1433
01:13:49.981 --> 01:13:51.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does your heart rate go up to get</v>

1434
01:13:51.901 --> 01:13:53.730
<v Speaker 2>more blood to your muscles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1435
01:13:53.731 --> 01:13:56.640
<v Speaker 2>So that you can go and do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if your heart rate goes up,</v>

1436
01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.470
<v Speaker 2>it's because you're preparing to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1437
01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:00.090
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1438
01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.900
<v Speaker 2>it depends on the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that fine grained a tool,</v>

1439
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.711
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's that.</v>

1440
01:14:04.711 --> 01:14:06.780
<v Speaker 2>That's a measurement problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1441
01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:12.670
<v Speaker 2>so you want to measure the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple ways and you want to hope that</v>

1442
01:14:12.671 --> 01:14:13.750
<v Speaker 2>you get the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1443
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:17.950
<v Speaker 2>that's what a real scientist does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A real scientists looks to see that</v>

1444
01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:19.960
<v Speaker 2>they've got the damn thing they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure.</v>

1445
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:24.340
<v Speaker 2>They've identified it and that it will</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest itself across multiple levels</v>

1446
01:14:24.341 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 2>of measurement because then they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of be clear that it's there.</v>

1447
01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Now this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey Gray,</v>

1448
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:32.680
<v Speaker 2>who you're going to read about for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next lecture,</v>

1449
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:36.370
<v Speaker 2>he's a brilliant scientist and gray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love gray because gray,</v>

1450
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:39.160
<v Speaker 2>when gray uses a word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know exactly what it means and he's</v>

1451
01:14:39.161 --> 01:14:41.980
<v Speaker 2>a behaviorist and those people are known</v>
<v Speaker 2>for precision.</v>

1452
01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:44.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the philosophers that we've been talking</v>

1453
01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 2>about in the clinical psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take a broad overview of the world</v>

1454
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:51.820
<v Speaker 2>and that can be really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But gray is a master of the reverse,</v>

1455
01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:53.920
<v Speaker 2>which is zeroing in on what something</v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

1456
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.250
<v Speaker 2>So when he says anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he usually talks about animals.</v>

1457
01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.210
<v Speaker 2>He means something specific about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He means that there's was a particular</v>

1458
01:15:01.211 --> 01:15:04.510
<v Speaker 2>biological circuit that gets activated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can measure that a variety of</v>

1459
01:15:04.511 --> 01:15:08.710
<v Speaker 2>different ways that it will respond to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the administration of barbiturates,</v>

1460
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:10.510
<v Speaker 2>benzodiazepines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or alcohol.</v>

1461
01:15:10.511 --> 01:15:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Cause those are primary anxie lytics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there will be certain behavioral</v>

1462
01:15:14.171 --> 01:15:16.150
<v Speaker 2>concomitance that are associated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1463
01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:19.990
<v Speaker 2>So the theory has to work across</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple levels of analysis,</v>

1464
01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.750
<v Speaker 2>pharmacological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physiological,</v>

1465
01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.880
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral.</v>

1466
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:26.410
<v Speaker 2>And then he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1467
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:30.040
<v Speaker 2>we kind of zeroed in on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can cautiously move forward.</v>

1468
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:31.690
<v Speaker 2>So Britt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>

1469
01:15:31.691 --> 01:15:34.420
<v Speaker 2>beautiful way to proceed and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>results that way.</v>

1470
01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:38.140
<v Speaker 2>When he wrote a book called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychology of anxiety at 1982 and</v>

1471
01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 2>he updated it in 1999 and you know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1472
01:15:41.681 --> 01:15:45.550
<v Speaker 2>that thing stood the test of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was absolutely rigorous in</v>

1473
01:15:45.551 --> 01:15:48.310
<v Speaker 2>his definitions and the behaviors were</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at that.</v>

1474
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.580
<v Speaker 2>When they measured something and defined</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1475
01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you knew what it was very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it turns out that for a lot of the</v>

1476
01:15:57.371 --> 01:15:59.890
<v Speaker 2>things that psychologists study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not so straight forward.</v>

1477
01:15:59.891 --> 01:16:02.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get multiple measures of the</v>

1478
01:16:02.801 --> 01:16:05.050
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to often,</v>

1479
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:08.080
<v Speaker 2>you have to proceed forward with what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got in the hope that you can</v>

1480
01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:12.520
<v Speaker 2>accrue additional evidence later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to talk to you in detail</v>

1481
01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:16.060
<v Speaker 2>about one such approach and that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychometric approach with in</v>

1482
01:16:16.061 --> 01:16:19.810
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the establishment of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic personality traits.</v>

1483
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:25.060
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what happened with the statistical</v>

1484
01:16:25.061 --> 01:16:26.560
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's primarily what we're</v>

1485
01:16:26.561 --> 01:16:31.561
<v Speaker 2>going to talk about is that the initial</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery of the basic traits was done</v>

1486
01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:36.010
<v Speaker 2>only at a statistical level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happened was that as the</v>

1487
01:16:36.011 --> 01:16:39.640
<v Speaker 2>traits were established statistically</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people got more comfortable with the</v>

1488
01:16:39.641 --> 01:16:43.780
<v Speaker 2>idea that they might be real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the way they manifested themselves</v>

1489
01:16:43.781 --> 01:16:46.690
<v Speaker 2>across different levels of analysis</v>
<v Speaker 2>started to become understood.</v>

1490
01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.200
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I knew that there was such a thing</v>

1491
01:16:50.201 --> 01:16:53.230
<v Speaker 2>as extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could start to associate certain kinds</v>

1492
01:16:53.231 --> 01:16:55.000
<v Speaker 2>of behaviors and certain emotions with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1493
01:16:55.001 --> 01:16:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And then I could start to document what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neurological systems where that that</v>

1494
01:16:59.891 --> 01:17:02.110
<v Speaker 2>underpinned it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I could start to understand the</v>

1495
01:17:02.111 --> 01:17:05.260
<v Speaker 2>neuro pharmacology and all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>started to stack up.</v>

1496
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.410
<v Speaker 2>And that's sort of where we are with</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometric personality theory.</v>

1497
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:13.400
<v Speaker 2>And the first element of psychometric</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality theory is a hypothesis.</v>

1498
01:17:13.401 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 2>And here here you think this hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1499
01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:20.510
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine that one of the things that</v>

1500
01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:25.280
<v Speaker 2>human beings communicate about with</v>
<v Speaker 2>their language is personality.</v>

1501
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm really interested in describing what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like to someone else and you're</v>

1502
01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:32.290
<v Speaker 2>interested in describing what I'm like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone else.</v>

1503
01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:36.680
<v Speaker 2>It helps us keep track of our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of everyone's relationships and</v>

1504
01:17:36.681 --> 01:17:39.710
<v Speaker 2>reputations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also helps us understand their</v>

1505
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:42.170
<v Speaker 2>behavior and we're obsessively curious</v>
<v Speaker 2>about each other.</v>

1506
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:46.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's no wonder because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're weird and unpredictable things,</v>

1507
01:17:46.131 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 2>but we're kind of useful too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1508
01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:52.940
<v Speaker 2>so the linguistic hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what started the</v>

1509
01:17:52.941 --> 01:17:56.570
<v Speaker 2>psychometric,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychometric movement forward in the</v>

1510
01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 2>domain of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a linguistic hypothesis and the</v>

1511
01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:04.121
<v Speaker 2>linguistic hypothesis is the important</v>
<v Speaker 2>variation in human personality will be</v>

1512
01:18:05.661 --> 01:18:08.720
<v Speaker 2>captured by the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1513
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:12.140
<v Speaker 2>So that's like a hypothesis that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>language is a good measurement device.</v>

1514
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:15.890
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to use the language to</v>
<v Speaker 2>assess and communicate about each other.</v>

1515
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:19.400
<v Speaker 2>And roughly we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've nailed the structure within that</v>

1516
01:18:19.401 --> 01:18:21.320
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could figure out how to extract</v>

1517
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.900
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now people debate that,</v>

1518
01:18:23.901 --> 01:18:27.380
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not self evident that we</v>

1519
01:18:27.381 --> 01:18:30.590
<v Speaker 2>would have captured all the important</v>
<v Speaker 2>variation in personality in our</v>

1520
01:18:30.591 --> 01:18:33.380
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a bad hypothesis and you</v>

1521
01:18:33.381 --> 01:18:36.230
<v Speaker 2>can test it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way you test it is by deriving</v>

1522
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.970
<v Speaker 2>personality based descriptions from an</v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of natural language and then</v>

1523
01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:45.080
<v Speaker 2>seeing how those derived descriptions do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the real world.</v>

1524
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Do it predicting things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it being correlated with different</v>

1525
01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:52.070
<v Speaker 2>physiological structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do at predicting responses to</v>

1526
01:18:52.071 --> 01:18:54.590
<v Speaker 2>pharmacological interventions and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth and so on.</v>

1527
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:57.050
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that as being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1528
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:59.720
<v Speaker 2>it's done pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1529
01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 2>so the first hypothesis is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>important trait variation is</v>

1530
01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:07.460
<v Speaker 2>encapsulated in the language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's another hypothesis,</v>

1531
01:19:07.461 --> 01:19:10.250
<v Speaker 2>and I'll leave you with this and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>really need to think about this because</v>

1532
01:19:10.251 --> 01:19:13.730
<v Speaker 2>psychologists do not get it right and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should.</v>

1533
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a scientific sin not to get this</v>

1534
01:19:16.821 --> 01:19:19.010
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big five theorists,</v>

1535
01:19:19.011 --> 01:19:21.680
<v Speaker 2>and they're the psychometric guys who</v>
<v Speaker 2>did the language analysis,</v>

1536
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:25.760
<v Speaker 2>they make a claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make a strong claim and a weak</v>

1537
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:30.761
<v Speaker 2>claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The strong claim is you can extract out</v>

1538
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.290
<v Speaker 2>information about personality from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

1539
01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:36.170
<v Speaker 2>It lays itself out in five dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll,</v>

1540
01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.510
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extroversion,</v>

1541
01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.880
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>

1542
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:45.770
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness and openness and that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>where all the important variation in</v>

1543
01:19:45.771 --> 01:19:47.540
<v Speaker 2>personality lies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1544
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:51.650
<v Speaker 2>That's the strong claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weak claim is this.</v>

1545
01:19:51.651 --> 01:19:54.500
<v Speaker 2>We're going to forget about the strong</v>
<v Speaker 2>claim because you guys can evaluate that</v>

1546
01:19:54.501 --> 01:19:59.501
<v Speaker 2>as we go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weak claim is this in so far as you</v>

1547
01:19:59.901 --> 01:20:04.901
<v Speaker 2>can measure personality with language</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that means with words or phrases</v>

1548
01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.470
<v Speaker 2>or sentences in so far as you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure it with language,</v>

1549
01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:17.080
<v Speaker 2>you're going to measure one or more of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big five traits well or badly.</v>

1550
01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I'm stressing this is so many</v>

1551
01:20:22.921 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 2>of you have taken many psychology</v>
<v Speaker 2>courses so far and you may have noticed</v>

1552
01:20:26.581 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 2>that people measure all sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>with questionnaires.</v>

1553
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.140
<v Speaker 2>They measure self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1554
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:33.780
<v Speaker 2>they measure self ethicacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1555
01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:39.390
<v Speaker 2>they measure authoritarian personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they measure any bloody thing you can</v>

1556
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:41.150
<v Speaker 2>think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a questionnaire with</v>

1557
01:20:41.151 --> 01:20:43.980
<v Speaker 2>a name on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the big five theorists say,</v>

1558
01:20:43.981 --> 01:20:44.550
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1559
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:47.520
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a hypothesis going here.</v>

1560
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:51.720
<v Speaker 2>If you're using language and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>measuring traits,</v>

1561
01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:56.040
<v Speaker 2>you're measuring one or more of the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>five traits badly or well,</v>

1562
01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:59.220
<v Speaker 2>and so what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one's challenged this by the way</v>

1563
01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:01.740
<v Speaker 2>that the challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll do five traits,</v>

1564
01:21:01.741 --> 01:21:05.250
<v Speaker 2>completely cover it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or do we need six or seven?</v>

1565
01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:07.740
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe what's the hierarchical</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure?</v>

1566
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:11.100
<v Speaker 2>There's questions about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one seriously questioned the week</v>

1567
01:21:11.101 --> 01:21:12.060
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis.</v>

1568
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.720
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things you read about that are measured</v>

1569
01:21:15.721 --> 01:21:20.370
<v Speaker 2>by questionnaire</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have all sorts of different names</v>

1570
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:24.660
<v Speaker 2>are elements of the big five that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>either been measured well or badly.</v>

1571
01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:28.290
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is whenever you</v>
<v Speaker 2>read a psychological paper,</v>

1572
01:21:28.291 --> 01:21:31.350
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly endemic in social</v>

1573
01:21:31.351 --> 01:21:34.770
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what they named the damn</v>

1574
01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:37.500
<v Speaker 2>measure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a questionnaire,</v>

1575
01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:39.570
<v Speaker 2>it's extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism,</v>

1576
01:21:39.571 --> 01:21:42.330
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness or openness.</v>

1577
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:47.340
<v Speaker 2>And it's incumbent on the researcher to</v>
<v Speaker 2>prove that that's not the case.</v>

1578
01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:49.500
<v Speaker 2>And they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1579
01:21:49.501 --> 01:21:52.710
<v Speaker 2>the reason they don't in parties because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know the psychometric theory.</v>

1580
01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:54.750
<v Speaker 2>And then the next reason is they do know</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1581
01:21:54.751 --> 01:21:58.620
<v Speaker 2>but they ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the next reason is if they know it</v>

1582
01:21:58.621 --> 01:22:01.440
<v Speaker 2>and ignore it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can invent a construct and</v>

1583
01:22:01.441 --> 01:22:04.800
<v Speaker 2>name it something and they can conjure</v>
<v Speaker 2>up a whole career on it.</v>

1584
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:10.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know some things exist in psychology,</v>

1585
01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extroversion,</v>

1586
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.730
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness,</v>

1587
01:22:14.731 --> 01:22:19.731
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They exist in so far as you can</v>

1588
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:24.870
<v Speaker 2>encapsulate personality in language and</v>
<v Speaker 2>use statistical techniques to derive it.</v>

1589
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe other things exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think there's any credible</v>

1590
01:22:31.341 --> 01:22:34.220
<v Speaker 2>evidence that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1591
01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:36.620
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll pick that up on Thursday.</v>
