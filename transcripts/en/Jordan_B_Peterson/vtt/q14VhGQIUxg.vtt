1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I get dry in into a dive.</v>

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I worked for Svenska dog about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a newspaper,</v>

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.903
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second largest with daily </v>

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.763
<v Speaker 1>circulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I ask sometimes on twitter and </v>

5
00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:13.784
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of people you think I should </v>

6
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>interview?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your name has come up a lot.</v>

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I think you've heard this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

8
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

9
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:25.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently I wrote a piece in</v>

10
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>a freedom in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Sweden and,</v>

11
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.710
<v Speaker 1>and you shared it on twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>

12
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:34.544
<v Speaker 1>So then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I may leave because then I </v>

13
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.560
<v Speaker 1>thought that perhaps now I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps now you will respond.</v>

14
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>I can get me into you.</v>

15
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well cool.</v>

16
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Apt is really turned out to be quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite the platform man.</v>

17
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.310
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

18
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>

19
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 2>I did an interview with Claire Lehmann.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed her,</v>

20
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I haven't released yet.</v>

21
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.593
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

22
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Speaker 2>but we'll in the next probably two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>

23
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

24
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's hitting it out of the park is fall</v>

25
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:05.234
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kind of reminds me of what magazine </v>

26
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Leica Harper's used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at the Atlantic before</v>

27
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.390
<v Speaker 2>for mainstream journalism collapsed </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually,</v>

28
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Speaker 2>completely and became so politicized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

29
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.240
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been really impressive.</v>

30
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that,</v>

31
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mother of two or one</v>

32
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.553
<v Speaker 1>and just being fed up with the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctness of her psychology </v>

33
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 1>department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

34
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:41.464
<v Speaker 1>And then she starts quill it and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all like sharing in her project </v>

35
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.880
<v Speaker 1>from all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

37
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 2>It's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she,</v>

38
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has really good editorial sense.</v>

39
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 2>She must be really smart that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that girl.</v>

40
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

41
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I would say so too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

42
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.693
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember,</v>

44
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll just begin by asking you about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden Sweden case.</v>

45
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>article was about,</v>

46
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>but I wrote about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.893
<v Speaker 1>Eric Green Murray is a professor at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political science department and he was </v>

48
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 1>forced to include,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Judith Butler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Butler.</v>

50
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

51
00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Judith Butler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

54
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:28.304
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the course is about modern society and </v>

55
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and its critics.</v>

56
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically about the reactionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces and uh,</v>

57
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>left wing extremist forces during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn of the last century.</v>

58
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.730
<v Speaker 1>So in the early 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late 19th century.</v>

59
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>And then you riff butler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>and actually one of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not Eric,</v>

61
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.630
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

62
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his teaching assistant interviewed</v>

63
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 1>and she said that she disagreed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

64
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.563
<v Speaker 1>so she agreed with the professors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chili Cheese thought that the academic </v>

65
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.290
<v Speaker 1>freedom was more yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Important than,</v>

66
00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:08.124
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being forced to teach about feminist </v>

67
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:13.890
<v Speaker 1>authors and gender science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was actually</v>

68
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gender Science.</v>

69
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

70
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Or is by no means a scientist or even a </v>
<v Speaker 2>credible academic?</v>

71
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 2>As far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's a straight out idealog and</v>

72
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that anybody would be </v>

73
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>forced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

74
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.774
<v Speaker 2>first of all forced to include anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>on their curriculum I think is </v>

75
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.313
<v Speaker 2>absolutely reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's topped down interference with </v>

76
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:35.554
<v Speaker 2>academic freedom and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily dangerous because once </v>

77
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 2>that</v>
<v Speaker 2>precedent is established,</v>

78
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 2>then you open the door for political </v>
<v Speaker 2>interference in the,</v>

79
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.893
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like organized political interference </v>

80
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:53.240
<v Speaker 2>from outside the academy and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse very rapidly under.</v>

81
00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:54.074
<v Speaker 2>Sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw that happening in Germany and </v>

82
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:56.044
<v Speaker 2>also in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It like that can happen so quickly that </v>

83
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.350
<v Speaker 2>people can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

84
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.883
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're in this weird situation where </v>

85
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.453
<v Speaker 2>the same thing seems to be happening to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a large degree within the academy </v>

86
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

87
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 2>and what to do about that is by no means</v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>

88
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:20.281
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that allowing external</v>

89
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:21.214
<v Speaker 2>control of any sort over the contents of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the courses the professor teach </v>

90
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 2>professors teach is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>

91
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 2>very bad idea.</v>

92
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a rule,</v>

93
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.350
<v Speaker 1>rule of thumb they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically,</v>

94
00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:34.184
<v Speaker 1>it's much more a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rule of thumb that at least 40% </v>

95
00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>of all the literature has to be written </v>
<v Speaker 1>by women.</v>

96
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.100
<v Speaker 1>So unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're holding a course,</v>

97
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.143
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about modern society and its critic </v>

98
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.820
<v Speaker 1>critics with a lot of primary literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>from turn of the century,</v>

99
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.730
<v Speaker 1>then you run into a problem because </v>
<v Speaker 1>women weren't,</v>

100
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

101
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we weren't a lot of women who were </v>

102
00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:58.410
<v Speaker 1>authors back them.</v>

103
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 2>So unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say resentful.</v>

104
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.120
<v Speaker 2>I really think that's the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue here.</v>

105
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.620
<v Speaker 2>To push a doctor resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uninformed to push a doctrine like that.</v>

106
00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievably widespread.</v>

107
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.660
<v Speaker 2>So I'll give you an example that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very similar.</v>

108
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.943
<v Speaker 2>Our Prime Minister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that </v>

109
00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:24.080
<v Speaker 2>half the cabinet that he put together </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be women,</v>

110
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that only approximately,</v>

111
00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 20 to 25% of the elected </v>
<v Speaker 2>officials were female.</v>

112
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>And so what he basically admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

113
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.060
<v Speaker 2>it was two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

114
00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:38.894
<v Speaker 2>he was incapable of judging people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their competence because when you put </v>

115
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:45.120
<v Speaker 2>together something like the cabinet for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a country,</v>

116
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.730
<v Speaker 2>what you do is you find the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>competent people,</v>

117
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.840
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because</v>

118
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.173
<v Speaker 2>it's so bizarre that it even has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>said because it actually turns out that </v>

119
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 2>the cabinet is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so to me,</v>

120
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.214
<v Speaker 2>all he did was default on his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said his central moral obligation to </v>

121
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 2>screen every single one of his members </v>
<v Speaker 2>of parliament with exceeding care and to</v>

122
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 2>pick the most qualified people.</v>

123
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 2>And his rationale was that it was 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.263
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we to reduce competence to racial </v>

125
00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:21.090
<v Speaker 2>ethnic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender identity,</v>

126
00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:26.091
<v Speaker 2>something like that is an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>appalling move philosophically as well,</v>

127
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.233
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to assume that diversity is somehow </v>

128
00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:32.520
<v Speaker 2>represented by group membership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence for that.</v>

129
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.550
<v Speaker 2>There's absolutely no scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence for that whatsoever.</v>

130
00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:36.384
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientific evidence suggest quite </v>

131
00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:39.144
<v Speaker 2>the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that there's more variability </v>

132
00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:43.920
<v Speaker 2>within groups than there is between </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>

133
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.520
<v Speaker 2>which is actually an antidote to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>central racist claim,</v>

134
00:06:47.521 --> 00:06:49.440
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the central racist claim is,</v>

135
00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:53.100
<v Speaker 2>there's more difference between groups </v>
<v Speaker 2>than there is difference within them.</v>

136
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you seen one black person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen them all.</v>

138
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Wow,</v>

139
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.293
<v Speaker 1>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually have in Sweden it's called </v>

140
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the procedure is,</v>

141
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender mainstreaming in,</v>

142
00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:13.350
<v Speaker 1>in English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

143
00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:14.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

144
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.610
<v Speaker 1>basically you have to include a gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspectives,</v>

145
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.813
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into all this is happening within all </v>

146
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Swedish universities right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

147
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.180
<v Speaker 1>so you have to include the perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gender,</v>

148
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>

149
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.963
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective in all parts of </v>

150
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:34.994
<v Speaker 1>the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just literature lists of </v>

151
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:37.754
<v Speaker 1>courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the who are you going to </v>

152
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.190
<v Speaker 1>recruit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have a goal in Sweden and,</v>

153
00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:45.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the government.</v>

154
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.710
<v Speaker 1>This is all the government's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

155
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>We have a goal that I think it's 40% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the professors,</v>

156
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by 2020,</v>

157
00:07:56.731 --> 00:07:57.564
<v Speaker 1>they should be women.</v>

158
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.543
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which means that if you're a young man </v>

159
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.430
<v Speaker 2>who's entering academia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you're going to get</v>

160
00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:05.460
<v Speaker 2>a job as zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

162
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing's happening here.</v>

163
00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:08.800
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

164
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.970
<v Speaker 2>they're our minister of science who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the people,</v>

165
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.943
<v Speaker 2>let's say selected because of Trudeau's </v>
<v Speaker 2>insistence upon gender equity in his </v>

166
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 2>cabinet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

167
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could have,</v>

168
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.513
<v Speaker 2>pick a number of women that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportionate to the number of women </v>

169
00:08:26.581 --> 00:08:27.414
<v Speaker 2>elected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even that I wouldn't have agreed </v>

170
00:08:29.431 --> 00:08:31.870
<v Speaker 2>with because I think he should've gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>on street competence and,</v>

171
00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:32.704
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and taken on the heavy moral burden of </v>

172
00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:35.940
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what competence </v>
<v Speaker 2>meant,</v>

173
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.000
<v Speaker 2>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

174
00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:41.520
<v Speaker 2>it had to be 50 50 because I guess that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

175
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a very snide thing to say,</v>

176
00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:44.214
<v Speaker 2>but that seems to be at the level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>arithmetic intelligence that he could </v>

177
00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:47.424
<v Speaker 2>manifest.</v>

178
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.893
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

179
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of his ministers,</v>

180
00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:54.390
<v Speaker 2>our Minister of science has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this program called camp.</v>

181
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.283
<v Speaker 2>The Canada chairs in the Canada research</v>
<v Speaker 2>chairs were set up so that Canadian </v>

182
00:08:59.041 --> 00:08:59.874
<v Speaker 2>universities would have an additional </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money to hire the most </v>

183
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 2>qualified people they possibly could for</v>
<v Speaker 2>senior named chair positions.</v>

184
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 2>And the idea was to attract </v>
<v Speaker 2>international talent,</v>

185
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 2>like high level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what has happened,</v>

186
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.333
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't very well designed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this program was the Canadian </v>

187
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 2>universities mostly ended up poaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>from each other,</v>

188
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.743
<v Speaker 2>relatively counterproductive because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just elevated the salaries of the </v>

190
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:25.434
<v Speaker 2>professors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which maybe they deserve rather than </v>

191
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 2>bringing in a lot of international </v>
<v Speaker 2>talent.</v>

192
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.053
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're radically overrepresented in the </v>

193
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:32.994
<v Speaker 2>Canada research chairs now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The administer of science is very </v>

194
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:36.864
<v Speaker 2>annoyed about this and thinks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a consequence of systemic </v>

195
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 2>misogyny or some some bloody thing.</v>

196
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Failing to note entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

197
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 2>if you look at scientific productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting because,</v>

198
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 2>and gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the median professor,</v>

199
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 2>male and female publish approximately </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same amount.</v>

200
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.710
<v Speaker 2>So the typical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

201
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.340
<v Speaker 2>the exceptional professors are almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>all men who even though the typical male</v>

202
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:07.200
<v Speaker 2>and female can't really be distinguished</v>
<v Speaker 2>in academia,</v>

203
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:10.740
<v Speaker 2>if you take that tiny subset of hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive professors,</v>

204
00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:11.574
<v Speaker 2>they're almost all male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now why that is is my suspicions are </v>

205
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.893
<v Speaker 2>that it's pretty straight forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that the reason it is is </v>

206
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:18.804
<v Speaker 2>because to be a hyper productive in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>given field means you have to be </v>

207
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.483
<v Speaker 2>absolutely single minded and obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it as well as being very </v>

208
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious.</v>

209
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

210
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 2>You have to be intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say 99th percentile,</v>

211
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 2>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>95th percentile.</v>

212
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:38.670
<v Speaker 2>So that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The anybody right there.</v>

213
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.880
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to have the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>available to do nothing whatsoever,</v>

214
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 2>but concentrate on your work.</v>

215
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.760
<v Speaker 2>No family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no friends,</v>

216
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to be at the very top of</v>

217
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:51.084
<v Speaker 2>your profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously you'll get out </v>

218
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:54.894
<v Speaker 2>competed otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's a lot harder for women </v>

219
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well for obvious reasons.</v>

220
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.433
<v Speaker 2>I mean so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the mere fact that most of these </v>

221
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:05.184
<v Speaker 2>people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the other thing people don't </v>

222
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 2>understand is that people can on average</v>
<v Speaker 2>be very similar.</v>

223
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 2>So their distributions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go way out on to the edges of</v>

224
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 2>the distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small differences in the middle can make</v>

225
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:21.270
<v Speaker 2>massive differences at the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

226
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:22.104
<v Speaker 2>and that's the kind of phenomena you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are selecting the highest </v>

227
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:25.850
<v Speaker 2>qualified people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

228
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 2>it's an edge of the distribution </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>

229
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:30.180
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really cool one.</v>

230
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the overlap between </v>
<v Speaker 2>male and female aggression,</v>

231
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.573
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you randomly select a man and a </v>

232
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:38.934
<v Speaker 2>woman from the general population and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you bet that the woman was the more </v>

233
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 2>aggressive of the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be right 40% of the time,</v>

234
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.550
<v Speaker 2>which is actually pretty often.</v>

235
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go way the hell out to where,</v>

236
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.780
<v Speaker 2>let's say only imprisoned the one in 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>most aggressive people,</v>

237
00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.280
<v Speaker 2>they're all men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Even though on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

239
00:12:01.951 --> 00:12:02.940
<v Speaker 2>it's 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

240
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.930
<v Speaker 2>you'd go out to the 99th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all men.</v>

241
00:12:06.931 --> 00:12:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Which is why almost all the people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>prison are men now.</v>

242
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.190
<v Speaker 2>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's,</v>

243
00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

244
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.910
<v Speaker 2>what you're describing in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the death of the universities.</v>

245
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:19.950
<v Speaker 2>It's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another sign of like,</v>

246
00:12:19.951 --> 00:12:20.784
<v Speaker 2>the universities are killing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're hiring adjunct professors and </v>

247
00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:24.414
<v Speaker 2>not faculty members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think it's up to 70% in some </v>

248
00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:29.630
<v Speaker 2>American universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no salary,</v>

249
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.280
<v Speaker 2>no power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no autonomy,</v>

250
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.380
<v Speaker 2>no job security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

251
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.101
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

252
00:12:34.101 --> 00:12:35.360
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:12:35.361 --> 00:12:39.170
<v Speaker 2>some of these adjuncts teach four or </v>
<v Speaker 2>five courses a year and make $25,000.</v>

254
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read about one who lived in her car.</v>

255
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:45.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

256
00:12:45.451 --> 00:12:49.710
<v Speaker 2>so they've jacked up tuition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Proletariat.</v>

257
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

258
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Well there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

259
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.533
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

260
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.720
<v Speaker 1>if jacked up tuition,</v>

261
00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.463
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've jacked up tuition to the point </v>

262
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:00.414
<v Speaker 2>where it's unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've made it impossible for kids who </v>

263
00:13:03.611 --> 00:13:06.280
<v Speaker 2>rack up tuition debt to declare </v>
<v Speaker 2>bankruptcy.</v>

264
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Because they've taken that out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bankruptcy laws.</v>

265
00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Now you can take away their driver's </v>
<v Speaker 2>license if they don't pay their,</v>

266
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.913
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

267
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.450
<v Speaker 2>their tuition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their student loan bills.</v>

268
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically indentured servitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

269
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:21.030
<v Speaker 2>The administration has become completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>top heavy.</v>

270
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.193
<v Speaker 2>The academy is completely infested by </v>
<v Speaker 2>these terrible equity ideas that you're </v>

271
00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:28.560
<v Speaker 2>laying out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

272
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.863
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people who are in the radical </v>

273
00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:35.760
<v Speaker 2>leftists disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which increasingly are spreading there,</v>

274
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 2>influence out through the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities,</v>

275
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.590
<v Speaker 2>are tenured and won't be moved for 25 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

276
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.020
<v Speaker 2>So as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

277
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.433
<v Speaker 2>it's done,</v>

278
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.550
<v Speaker 1>would like to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

279
00:13:49.551 --> 00:13:50.384
<v Speaker 1>you take about on gender science and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sort of like ethnic studies and </v>

280
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.653
<v Speaker 1>theology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was a sociology student back </v>

281
00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:01.380
<v Speaker 1>in 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was 22 years old.</v>

282
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:07.050
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of these perspectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were taught postmodernism and queer,</v>

283
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.320
<v Speaker 1>queer feminism and all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

284
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just starting out as a student,</v>

285
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

286
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I must have been wired for faulty </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he didn't,</v>

287
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:20.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very critical about it.</v>

288
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.370
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all those perspectives was,</v>

289
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was back then was fringe in Sweden.</v>

290
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.220
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

291
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:30.323
<v Speaker 1>like identity politics or everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's now in the mainstream was at the </v>

292
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.190
<v Speaker 1>institution back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the professors,</v>

293
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.520
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the same.</v>

294
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean they are now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their,</v>

295
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.970
<v Speaker 1>their phds and most of the students that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are taking over the public discourse,</v>

296
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even they lost a lot of debate back </v>

297
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:56.230
<v Speaker 1>then and they still do like public </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>

298
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Speaker 1>They're still teaching students year </v>
<v Speaker 1>after year of the year.</v>

299
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 1>The students should ask you about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also about your,</v>

300
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 1>your critique of gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender studies in Swedish,</v>

301
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:15.560
<v Speaker 1>it's called gender science because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn all this into science.</v>

302
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's science here.</v>

303
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 2>That was a good move on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

304
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:24.630
<v Speaker 2>on the ideologues parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

305
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:25.883
<v Speaker 2>Really smart.</v>

306
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's a two pronged question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

307
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.283
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I think,</v>

308
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listed about seven things I think that</v>

309
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.410
<v Speaker 2>are killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Universities.</v>

310
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:40.490
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that I've watched major</v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions collapse and being privy to</v>

311
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 2>the manner in which that occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happens is that as the</v>

312
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 2>enterprise pathologizes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good people leave,</v>

313
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.280
<v Speaker 2>the people who have other things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could do,</v>

314
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:55.720
<v Speaker 2>they leave first knows are the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive and talented people.</v>

315
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.793
<v Speaker 2>As soon as the most productive leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the bloody thing just spirals </v>

316
00:15:59.231 --> 00:16:00.430
<v Speaker 2>downhill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what,</v>

317
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.440
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've,</v>

318
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.770
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:06.130
<v Speaker 2>because the rule is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that within a certain discipline,</v>

320
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:06.964
<v Speaker 2>whatever it happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the square root of the number of people </v>

321
00:16:09.581 --> 00:16:11.800
<v Speaker 2>in the discipline produce half the </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive work.</v>

322
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.170
<v Speaker 2>So if the university has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a thousand professors,</v>

323
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:17.603
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 of them produce half the </v>

324
00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:22.090
<v Speaker 2>publications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

325
00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Which is staggering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

326
00:16:23.171 --> 00:16:24.004
<v Speaker 2>It's staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the pareto distribution or </v>

327
00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:27.304
<v Speaker 2>price's law.</v>

328
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.503
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those people are often have more </v>

329
00:16:31.941 --> 00:16:33.830
<v Speaker 2>opportunities than they know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

330
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.410
<v Speaker 2>And so as soon as whatever they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes unstable,</v>

331
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:39.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like they go off and do other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and then the,</v>

332
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 2>then the institution loses its most </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive people.</v>

333
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>

334
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 2>It can't recover from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

335
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:52.190
<v Speaker 2>and the introduction of these so-called </v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

336
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.103
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines that we call studies </v>

337
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 2>disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

338
00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.663
<v Speaker 2>it was a market lowering of standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It involved in market lowering of </v>

339
00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:03.164
<v Speaker 2>academic standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blurring of what actually constituted </v>

340
00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:06.970
<v Speaker 2>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

341
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.743
<v Speaker 2>refusal whatsoever to consider anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>methodologically rigorous because </v>

342
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:13.394
<v Speaker 2>anything goes including author,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they call that auth no auto </v>

343
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.343
<v Speaker 2>ethnography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where you just write a diary </v>

344
00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:22.690
<v Speaker 2>essentially about your own experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next,</v>

345
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.563
<v Speaker 2>got this fancy name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So auto ethnography as part of gender </v>

346
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

347
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:32.230
<v Speaker 2>it's positively or Wellington and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

348
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:33.963
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that is that what's happened is </v>

349
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:38.074
<v Speaker 2>that the people who have these radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints have been given a permanent </v>

350
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:42.460
<v Speaker 2>sign.</v>

351
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.293
<v Speaker 2>It cure right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there their state and tuition sponsored </v>

352
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.633
<v Speaker 2>activists who spend every single moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their time on what I would consider </v>

353
00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:55.124
<v Speaker 2>their fifth column agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're basically funding a cohort of </v>

354
00:17:59.001 --> 00:18:03.260
<v Speaker 2>people who stated purpose is to demolish</v>
<v Speaker 2>the patriarchy.</v>

355
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.133
<v Speaker 2>one of the things Carl Young said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really liked and haven't talked </v>

357
00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:09.554
<v Speaker 2>about that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the unconscious representation </v>

358
00:18:12.471 --> 00:18:13.304
<v Speaker 2>of men in the female psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he called the animus and the animus was </v>

359
00:18:18.381 --> 00:18:22.040
<v Speaker 2>always in his estimation because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream analysis he did and so forth.</v>

360
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.203
<v Speaker 2>That although the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of a woman in a man's </v>

361
00:18:26.181 --> 00:18:27.014
<v Speaker 2>psyche was an individual woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unconscious representation of the </v>

362
00:18:30.441 --> 00:18:34.490
<v Speaker 2>male psyche in the female unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>was men as a group.</v>

363
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.013
<v Speaker 2>And there's a very large number of women</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and also some men whose conception </v>

364
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:42.294
<v Speaker 2>of male yes is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been damaged very badly by their </v>

365
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:51.840
<v Speaker 2>failure to establish any positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with any male whatsoever in</v>

366
00:18:51.841 --> 00:18:52.674
<v Speaker 2>their developmental history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they project this paranoid </v>

367
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:56.514
<v Speaker 2>representation of what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical masculinity onto the world </v>

368
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.530
<v Speaker 2>and then fight too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it down.</v>

369
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.763
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is they're being </v>

370
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:09.390
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem is this is,</v>

371
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another one when I was actually,</v>

372
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I know that you are very popular with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

373
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.543
<v Speaker 1>a lot of young men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was actually introduced to you by </v>

374
00:19:20.691 --> 00:19:23.490
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mother or two professor in,</v>

375
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in education.</v>

376
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.600
<v Speaker 1>So she's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not in her,</v>

377
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:29.411
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

378
00:19:29.411 --> 00:19:30.700
<v Speaker 1>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

379
00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:33.740
<v Speaker 1>ideologically or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

380
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.420
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

381
00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.050
<v Speaker 1>One thing that's worrying me is</v>

382
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.260
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

383
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.893
<v Speaker 1>there are certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain parts of a certain ideologies </v>

384
00:19:45.561 --> 00:19:49.160
<v Speaker 1>that take on a religious overtones </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

385
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.690
<v Speaker 1>And I think that feminism has some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those characteristics.</v>

386
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Christian,</v>

387
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.370
<v Speaker 1>they were all born sinful or we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to grips with our sinfulness.</v>

388
00:19:58.371 --> 00:19:59.204
<v Speaker 1>And in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only God's grace and forgiveness can </v>

389
00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:01.880
<v Speaker 1>redeem us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

390
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.211
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

391
00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:05.430
<v Speaker 1>in Lutheranism at least a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

392
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:06.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't can,</v>

393
00:20:06.691 --> 00:20:08.970
<v Speaker 1>we can be forgiven by priests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only dog.</v>

394
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doctrine.</v>

395
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.983
<v Speaker 2>There's no escape.</v>

396
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Rob and I totally sympathize with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I don't in a lot of ways,</v>

397
00:20:18.511 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized,</v>

398
00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.513
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but within feminist and the sin is </v>

399
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 1>situated within males instead,</v>

400
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

401
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 2>not only with within nails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but within males as a collective,</v>

402
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.103
<v Speaker 2>which has even see that's the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Christian doctrine that you </v>

403
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:33.954
<v Speaker 2>referred to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it makes each individual </v>

404
00:20:35.731 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 2>responsible for their own darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the Catholics say,</v>

405
00:20:39.661 --> 00:20:40.494
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unbearable and people need to </v>

406
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:44.790
<v Speaker 2>have the slate wiped clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in that and confessional do that,</v>

407
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:48.750
<v Speaker 2>and there's an intermediary and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered that merciful.</v>

408
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.490
<v Speaker 2>And there's some real power in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

409
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:53.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the cynical argument is,</v>

410
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just wipe the slate clean at any</v>

411
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 2>time and you don't have to bear any </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

412
00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 2>But I think that's cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Protestants put themselves in a much</v>

413
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 2>tougher position because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>

414
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the upside of all of that is,</v>

415
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:09.280
<v Speaker 2>is that the darkness is to be regarded </v>
<v Speaker 2>as within,</v>

416
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.220
<v Speaker 2>not without.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

417
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.440
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you move away from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then well,</v>

418
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

419
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:15.813
<v Speaker 2>you're the good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so is everyone that thinks like you </v>

420
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:21.430
<v Speaker 2>and all the evil is wherever you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it.</v>

421
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.930
<v Speaker 2>And then as soon as the thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really dangerous about that,</v>

422
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:30.210
<v Speaker 2>especially if the evil is conceptualized</v>
<v Speaker 2>as contemptible and,</v>

423
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.310
<v Speaker 2>and parasitic and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and using disgust related language,</v>

424
00:21:34.311 --> 00:21:35.144
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of fear related language than </v>

425
00:21:37.131 --> 00:21:42.131
<v Speaker 2>the logical directive is to purify it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

426
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.140
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>

427
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.670
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

428
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I read some,</v>

429
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:57.380
<v Speaker 1>a dissertation about how male feminists </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about themselves and how they go</v>

430
00:21:57.381 --> 00:21:59.030
<v Speaker 1>about having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

431
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.373
<v Speaker 1>every one of the men said that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's way to a approach sex was that he </v>

432
00:22:04.131 --> 00:22:06.290
<v Speaker 1>didn't take any initiative because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

433
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 1>he would foul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

434
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the file,</v>

435
00:22:09.651 --> 00:22:12.200
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole situation and the woman.</v>

436
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:12.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

437
00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:16.240
<v Speaker 2>it's like Andrea to work in a back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 70s that horrible.</v>

438
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.900
<v Speaker 2>She's a horrible creature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrea to work.</v>

439
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.910
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

440
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.920
<v Speaker 2>she said that men engaged in sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior with an erect penis,</v>

441
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 2>that that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

442
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.220
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was equivalent to violence.</v>

443
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was equivalent to rape.</v>

444
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

445
00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:35.983
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what to say about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that that's exactly what Andrea </v>

446
00:22:39.921 --> 00:22:40.754
<v Speaker 2>to work and was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she was a real heroine to the </v>

447
00:22:42.471 --> 00:22:44.090
<v Speaker 2>radical feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know her.</v>

448
00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:46.570
<v Speaker 2>And there was someone else around that </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>

449
00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:47.404
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Catharine Mackinnon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think her name was equally equally </v>

450
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.290
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

451
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I think I read a book.</v>

452
00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you,</v>

453
00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.740
<v Speaker 2>you would've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would've,</v>

454
00:22:58.741 --> 00:22:59.221
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

455
00:22:59.221 --> 00:22:59.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

456
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.870
<v Speaker 2>from my perspective as a clinician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people have clear every indication</v>

457
00:23:03.871 --> 00:23:07.770
<v Speaker 2>of serious personality disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think to some degree that</v>

458
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.160
<v Speaker 2>we've made a haven for people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious personality pathology in these,</v>

459
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.830
<v Speaker 2>in these pseudo disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the universities.</v>

460
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:19.630
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said something interesting,</v>

461
00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:20.464
<v Speaker 2>you said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

462
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you went to,</v>

463
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you took your sociology degree that</v>

464
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:25.714
<v Speaker 2>these were basically fringe views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's center views in the </v>

465
00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:28.534
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also implying that they're </v>

466
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:31.023
<v Speaker 2>increasingly dominant views in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing is that people </v>

467
00:23:35.111 --> 00:23:37.810
<v Speaker 2>think that these are somehow ivory tower</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments.</v>

468
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:38.644
<v Speaker 2>But what happens in the university's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens in society five to 10 years </v>

469
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:43.030
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

470
00:23:43.031 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

471
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.303
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

472
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.590
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>

473
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:54.790
<v Speaker 1>this leads us into the me to a debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them because all you have people in</v>

474
00:23:56.211 --> 00:23:57.044
<v Speaker 1>Sweden right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the me too phenomenon is much </v>

475
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 1>larger in Sweden than in any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

476
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.393
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dominated the media for one month </v>

477
00:24:07.411 --> 00:24:08.071
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

478
00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:11.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every profession has,</v>

479
00:24:11.581 --> 00:24:12.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

480
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collect has an a me too,</v>

481
00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:20.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of article with thousands of women,</v>

482
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signing on to it.</v>

483
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So the teachers and the lawyers and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors.</v>

484
00:24:27.301 --> 00:24:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one,</v>

485
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.890
<v Speaker 1>one thing is interesting about this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the men are,</v>

486
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.930
<v Speaker 1>are handling it because um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of men writing that I as</v>

487
00:24:40.161 --> 00:24:41.330
<v Speaker 1>a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

488
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.470
<v Speaker 1>have a responsibility for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

489
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I as a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a male,</v>

490
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm responsible and I'm guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually it was one.</v>

491
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So there are a lot of articles like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

492
00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:55.200
<v Speaker 1>And then one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the men that was accused of doing</v>

493
00:24:55.201 --> 00:24:58.560
<v Speaker 1>something inappropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the former,</v>

494
00:24:59.100 --> 00:24:59.933
<v Speaker 1>the for the left Radical Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the thing he had done was not so </v>

495
00:25:05.281 --> 00:25:06.114
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible approached the woman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then she had said no and he had </v>

496
00:25:10.441 --> 00:25:13.560
<v Speaker 1>apologized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then she didn't accept that the now,</v>

497
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.423
<v Speaker 1>now he's under investigation police </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation and we have this sort of </v>

498
00:25:18.511 --> 00:25:19.344
<v Speaker 1>witch hunt</v>

499
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:22.723
<v Speaker 2>that almost all all manifestations of </v>
<v Speaker 2>male sexuality are going to be brought </v>

500
00:25:27.621 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 2>under legal control.</v>

501
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.980
<v Speaker 1>And he actually wrote an article that </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

502
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.933
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am responsible because I say I'm </v>

503
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.453
<v Speaker 1>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm better than the majority of men's </v>

504
00:25:38.071 --> 00:25:38.904
<v Speaker 1>reactions to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually he turned the thing that he </v>

505
00:25:40.771 --> 00:25:41.604
<v Speaker 1>was being under investigation into </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he showed that because he </v>

506
00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:46.920
<v Speaker 1>admitted he showed that he was better.</v>

507
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

508
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.300
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very our stay,</v>

509
00:25:51.301 --> 00:25:52.134
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole idea was that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to come to terms with your </v>

510
00:25:54.631 --> 00:25:55.464
<v Speaker 2>class guilt and then confess and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then indicate that you could be </v>

511
00:25:59.371 --> 00:26:01.710
<v Speaker 2>brought back into the ideological fold </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

512
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.780
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of muddy thinking.</v>

513
00:26:03.781 --> 00:26:04.614
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well man should take responsibility for </v>

514
00:26:06.151 --> 00:26:09.810
<v Speaker 2>their aggressive sexuality and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should incorporate it.</v>

515
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you repress it,</v>

516
00:26:11.491 --> 00:26:13.980
<v Speaker 2>it just comes out in the most ugly way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

517
00:26:13.981 --> 00:26:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the ideas that men,</v>

518
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.720
<v Speaker 2>boys should be socialized like little </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>

519
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's complete rubbish.</v>

520
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:21.803
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even little girls perhaps shouldn't be </v>

521
00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:25.110
<v Speaker 2>socialized like little curls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

522
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:25.973
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's beside the point that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive capacity that's associated </v>

523
00:26:30.301 --> 00:26:33.510
<v Speaker 2>with sexuality as well as Freud pointed </v>
<v Speaker 2>out so long ago,</v>

524
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.230
<v Speaker 2>needs to be integrated within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality so that it's under control,</v>

525
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

526
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.453
<v Speaker 2>And then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the hint of darkness and it's the </v>

527
00:26:40.321 --> 00:26:42.270
<v Speaker 2>capacity for malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

528
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.333
<v Speaker 2>but it's brought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's brought under civilized </v>

529
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:46.703
<v Speaker 2>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you get to have your cake </v>

530
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:49.381
<v Speaker 2>and eat it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

531
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:50.214
<v Speaker 2>You can be strong and potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and mysterious and all of </v>

532
00:26:53.281 --> 00:26:55.680
<v Speaker 2>those things that are definitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractive.</v>

533
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.430
<v Speaker 2>That's an attractive features of men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only to women,</v>

534
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:01.420
<v Speaker 2>but also to other men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

535
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.230
<v Speaker 2>so you have to take responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

536
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.093
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>identify yourself as the member of a </v>

537
00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:10.920
<v Speaker 2>guilty group because of a class based </v>
<v Speaker 2>accusation.</v>

538
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

539
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.930
<v Speaker 2>you're not guilty as the member of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

540
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the reason that I've been</v>

541
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:19.074
<v Speaker 2>pushing so hard against these postmodern</v>
<v Speaker 2>neo Marxist ideas because one of their </v>

542
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:27.450
<v Speaker 2>essential predicates is that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty as the member of a class.</v>

543
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:31.180
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's a more dangerous</v>

544
00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:34.390
<v Speaker 2>idea then then that there might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

545
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.330
<v Speaker 2>there's a very large number of extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous ideas,</v>

546
00:27:38.331 --> 00:27:41.000
<v Speaker 2>but that one's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one's up near the top.</v>

547
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.510
<v Speaker 2>It's happening to great degree in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States to lesser so in Canada,</v>

548
00:27:47.511 --> 00:27:50.720
<v Speaker 2>but every day there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

549
00:27:50.721 --> 00:27:51.554
<v Speaker 2>slew of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of influential man who are being outed </v>

550
00:27:56.511 --> 00:27:59.840
<v Speaker 2>for their past sexual misbehavior and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

551
00:27:59.841 --> 00:28:00.710
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

552
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>

553
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.333
<v Speaker 2>I don't have much to say about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>except that to use that as evidence for </v>

554
00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:12.020
<v Speaker 2>the</v>
<v Speaker 2>group based guilt of men as such.</v>

555
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:15.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

556
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

557
00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.190
<v Speaker 2>it's going to get a hell of a lot worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it gets better,</v>

558
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:21.024
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid.</v>

559
00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.163
<v Speaker 1>I think this is also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to ask you about this as </v>

560
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:27.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as a,</v>

561
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.020
<v Speaker 1>as a man growing up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a country like Sweden,</v>

562
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:34.780
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say that.</v>

563
00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.123
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of boys at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are confused what it means to be a </v>

564
00:28:39.911 --> 00:28:40.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

565
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.283
<v Speaker 1>and then you have these public figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adult males admitting to collective </v>

566
00:28:47.501 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 1>guilt and trying to be sort of the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>new mail,</v>

567
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.470
<v Speaker 1>which admits to guilt the feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good man,</v>

568
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

569
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.950
<v Speaker 2>tom of a man resting on top of the warm </v>
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>

570
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

571
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.700
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you say moral virtue consists</v>

572
00:29:05.701 --> 00:29:10.390
<v Speaker 2>in his harmlessness exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

573
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.583
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

574
00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the advice to give to,</v>

575
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.493
<v Speaker 1>because what I find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a lot of men trying to find their </v>

576
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:22.450
<v Speaker 1>way in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what it means to be a man.</v>

577
00:29:22.451 --> 00:29:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a lot of them turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and a,</v>

578
00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:31.240
<v Speaker 1>or a person like Jocko willink and let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let interviewed you.</v>

579
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.840
<v Speaker 1>And because you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

580
00:29:32.841 --> 00:29:35.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why do you think that it's,</v>

581
00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.083
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the because it doesn't seem so </v>

582
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.360
<v Speaker 1>you're sugarcoating</v>

583
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.653
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not giving them the funny thing </v>

584
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:46.481
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

585
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:47.314
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that are different from what </v>

586
00:29:49.001 --> 00:29:50.230
<v Speaker 2>people usually do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

587
00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:51.064
<v Speaker 2>so in the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the constant message to young people is </v>

588
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.220
<v Speaker 2>self esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self esteem,</v>

589
00:29:57.221 --> 00:29:58.870
<v Speaker 2>feel good about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

590
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you look at yourself in the</v>

591
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:03.340
<v Speaker 2>mirror and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

592
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I could be a hell of a lot better than I</v>
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>

593
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.330
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is,</v>

594
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:10.870
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing more complimentary to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell a young person than that.</v>

595
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at you.</v>

596
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:15.970
<v Speaker 2>You're a wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grow the hell up.</v>

597
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.220
<v Speaker 2>There's so much more to you than your </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifesting.</v>

598
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Then you can hardly imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

599
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 2>what you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a criticism.</v>

600
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:22.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

601
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:24.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great compliment.</v>

602
00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:25.384
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at how much more you could bring </v>

603
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:31.240
<v Speaker 2>out into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your aggression under control,</v>

604
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 2>strengthen yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like take on some responsibility.</v>

605
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 2>See if you have enough bloody courage to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell the truth.</v>

606
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Put your life together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop whining.</v>

607
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.633
<v Speaker 2>The man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat that up because no one's ever told </v>

608
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 2>them that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which just makes breaks my heart.</v>

609
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.700
<v Speaker 2>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

610
00:30:51.701 --> 00:30:54.790
<v Speaker 2>the boys are pulling out of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pulling out a university,</v>

611
00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 2>they're pulling out of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pulling out of marriage,</v>

612
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.850
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because of that,</v>

613
00:31:00.851 --> 00:31:01.684
<v Speaker 2>they're more awkward and unsophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they would otherwise be in much </v>

614
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:08.260
<v Speaker 2>more prone to make sexual errors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which are,</v>

615
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory malevolence in a small </v>

616
00:31:12.161 --> 00:31:12.994
<v Speaker 2>proportion of cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's another one of those </v>

617
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:15.250
<v Speaker 2>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

618
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 2>like imagine that one in a hundred men </v>
<v Speaker 2>are sexual predators.</v>

619
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.793
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's one in 50 but let's go with </v>

620
00:31:22.301 --> 00:31:23.950
<v Speaker 2>one in a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

621
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.260
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that small proportion commit all of this</v>

622
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:32.350
<v Speaker 2>sexual predation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at criminals,</v>

623
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.120
<v Speaker 2>it's the parade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

624
00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:34.954
<v Speaker 2>distribution again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>5% of the criminals produce something </v>

625
00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:40.420
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

626
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:43.120
<v Speaker 2>the overwhelming majority of the crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

627
00:31:43.121 --> 00:31:43.954
<v Speaker 2>It's a small coterie of specialized </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are responsible for all the </v>

628
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:48.244
<v Speaker 2>criminality.</v>

629
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Lots of people are in prison because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they did one highness thing.</v>

630
00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:52.354
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they got enraged or drunk and did </v>

631
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:55.684
<v Speaker 2>something violent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's the serial criminal types </v>

632
00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.520
<v Speaker 2>and they're the ones that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do all,</v>

633
00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.393
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like we had one guy in Toronto for </v>

634
00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:04.174
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who ran a bike theft ring and they </v>

635
00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:06.754
<v Speaker 2>finally nailed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like there weren't any bikes stolen </v>

636
00:32:10.151 --> 00:32:10.984
<v Speaker 2>in Toronto after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just him and his little coterie </v>

637
00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:14.680
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

638
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.730
<v Speaker 2>organized bike thieves and these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are being outed,</v>

639
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.320
<v Speaker 2>the serial predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are responsible like one,</v>

640
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:27.640
<v Speaker 2>one spread predatory guy can prey on who</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows,</v>

641
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:30.830
<v Speaker 2>500 females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand females into lifetime,</v>

642
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.350
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

643
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.770
<v Speaker 2>it's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like everyone listens.</v>

644
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

645
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 1>was one of these guys who sort of turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from society for,</v>

646
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.540
<v Speaker 1>for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like into computer games,</v>

647
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.950
<v Speaker 1>like this slacker identity where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of,</v>

648
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's always been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you turn to a,</v>

649
00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.540
<v Speaker 1>like a way from all responsibilities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got reimbursed.</v>

650
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.810
<v Speaker 1>But the opportunities to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much Florida now,</v>

651
00:33:04.811 --> 00:33:05.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

652
00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

653
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.470
<v Speaker 2>it's the lost boys like in Peter Pan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Right there.</v>

654
00:33:08.471 --> 00:33:10.630
<v Speaker 2>It never land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they never grow up.</v>

655
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.930
<v Speaker 2>And Peter Pan is their leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

656
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.823
<v Speaker 2>that's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not surprising because it's </v>

657
00:33:17.411 --> 00:33:20.820
<v Speaker 2>easier to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to occupy yourself trivially</v>

658
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.673
<v Speaker 2>than it is to do something difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a big tendency in that </v>

659
00:33:25.241 --> 00:33:26.074
<v Speaker 2>direction to begin with because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to do nothing than to take </v>

660
00:33:28.691 --> 00:33:29.524
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to play games than to plan </v>

661
00:33:32.051 --> 00:33:32.884
<v Speaker 2>for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier to be resentful and angry </v>

662
00:33:35.831 --> 00:33:38.130
<v Speaker 2>than it is to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

663
00:33:38.131 --> 00:33:40.140
<v Speaker 2>to shoulder you're vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

664
00:33:40.141 --> 00:33:40.974
<v Speaker 2>And then when you add on to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that if you go out into the </v>

665
00:33:44.701 --> 00:33:49.020
<v Speaker 2>world and try to strive forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're nothing but a predatory</v>

666
00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.830
<v Speaker 2>patriarch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then well,</v>

667
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.040
<v Speaker 2>it's just one more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the icing on the cake.</v>

668
00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.173
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who was like that he </v>

669
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.060
<v Speaker 2>pulled back from the world.</v>

670
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.593
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because he believed that active </v>

671
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.260
<v Speaker 2>masculinity was a pathological force </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

672
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.543
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he poisoned himself terribly because of </v>

673
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:13.610
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he committed suicide.</v>

674
00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:14.444
<v Speaker 2>When he was 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hooked an exhaust Noah hose onto his </v>

675
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:21.050
<v Speaker 2>exhaust pipe and gassed himself up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountains in Alberta.</v>

676
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 2>And that was the logical consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his self hatred.</v>

677
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

678
00:34:27.441 --> 00:34:30.650
<v Speaker 2>if you're so pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you just do it yourself in and</v>

679
00:34:30.651 --> 00:34:32.570
<v Speaker 2>hiding like that is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

680
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:33.404
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously not the full fledged </v>

681
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.500
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

682
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:38.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

683
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.770
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on the road.</v>

684
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so.</v>

685
00:34:42.301 --> 00:34:43.134
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking to all these young </v>

686
00:34:44.041 --> 00:34:45.720
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come to my biblical lectures,</v>

687
00:34:45.721 --> 00:34:47.910
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the message is always the same.</v>

688
00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:49.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand the hell up.</v>

689
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Get the hell out there in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take local responsibility.</v>

690
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Put yourself together because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing more dangerous than a weak man.</v>

691
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.690
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we're encouraging men to be weak</v>

692
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.553
<v Speaker 2>because we have this pathological idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's that strength and tyranny </v>

693
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:10.274
<v Speaker 2>or the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's that Animus I was talking </v>

694
00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:15.470
<v Speaker 2>about earlier though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women start only women,</v>

695
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.870
<v Speaker 2>but the feminist types,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

696
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.123
<v Speaker 2>who insist upon the pathology of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchy cannot distinguish between </v>

697
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:24.134
<v Speaker 2>competence and power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see everything because they have </v>

698
00:35:28.641 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 2>this vague and undifferentiated sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>masculinity.</v>

699
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.123
<v Speaker 2>They say they see everything that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with authority as equivalent </v>

700
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:40.044
<v Speaker 2>to tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Failing to understand completely that </v>

701
00:35:42.091 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 2>authority in a properly function society</v>
<v Speaker 2>is based on competence.</v>

702
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.210
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe in competence </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways.</v>

703
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the whole postmodern.</v>

704
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the cost or to keep power.</v>

705
00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:54.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

706
00:35:54.491 --> 00:35:55.324
<v Speaker 2>What everything's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Power for the bloody postmodernists and </v>

707
00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.830
<v Speaker 2>that also excuses their use of power.</v>

708
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

709
00:36:03.431 --> 00:36:05.210
<v Speaker 1>in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a,</v>

710
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.140
<v Speaker 1>girls have always outperform boys in </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

711
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Ever since we started having schools in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19th century,</v>

712
00:36:12.491 --> 00:36:13.324
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls have been outperforming boys and </v>

713
00:36:15.551 --> 00:36:18.340
<v Speaker 1>being better at sitting quietly in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classroom.</v>

714
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.833
<v Speaker 1>But the last 2030 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the divide between rural girls and boys </v>

715
00:36:24.101 --> 00:36:24.934
<v Speaker 1>is widening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Sweden it's a widening in other </v>

716
00:36:27.161 --> 00:36:28.210
<v Speaker 1>countries too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in Sweden,</v>

717
00:36:28.211 --> 00:36:29.070
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

718
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.870
<v Speaker 2>really you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are ahead of the curve.</v>

719
00:36:31.871 --> 00:36:33.550
<v Speaker 2>So congratulations on that.</v>

720
00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Proud about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so proud about that.</v>

721
00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.680
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

722
00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.423
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

723
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.470
<v Speaker 1>actually why don't you talk to people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

724
00:36:43.471 --> 00:36:44.304
<v Speaker 1>they're more worried about bringing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys then bringing up girls nowadays </v>

725
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.073
<v Speaker 1>because girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be girls or they can be like </v>

726
00:36:51.881 --> 00:36:52.290
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>

727
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:53.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

728
00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.560
<v Speaker 2>The boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boys,</v>

729
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.330
<v Speaker 2>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

730
00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

731
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Boys should perhaps be like more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>

732
00:37:05.691 --> 00:37:09.080
<v Speaker 1>but they should most definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may not be like boys,</v>

733
00:37:09.081 --> 00:37:11.570
<v Speaker 1>they should not play war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should not compete so much.</v>

734
00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Well the competition thing is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting because yeah,</v>

735
00:37:14.421 --> 00:37:17.450
<v Speaker 2>the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are hyper cooperative,</v>

736
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:21.670
<v Speaker 2>no regard competition as a positive evil</v>
<v Speaker 2>without understanding,</v>

737
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.060
<v Speaker 2>without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no understanding whatsoever of</v>

738
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:25.920
<v Speaker 2>developmental psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

739
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I really liked Sean </v>
<v Speaker 2>Piaget and you know,</v>

740
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:29.963
<v Speaker 2>one of the most intelligent things he </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever said about children's games </v>

741
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:33.893
<v Speaker 2>competitive games was that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition is nested inside a higher </v>

742
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:40.380
<v Speaker 2>order structure of cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think about a hockey game,</v>

743
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:44.660
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about that cause we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>Swedes and Canadians don't you say,</v>

744
00:37:44.661 --> 00:37:48.350
<v Speaker 2>well are the hockey players competing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are cooperating?</v>

745
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.840
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is what you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with micro analysis.</v>

746
00:37:50.841 --> 00:37:51.674
<v Speaker 2>So fundamentally they're cooperating </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they all agreed to abide by the </v>

747
00:37:55.471 --> 00:37:56.304
<v Speaker 2>same set of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they occupied the same perceptual </v>

748
00:37:59.111 --> 00:37:59.944
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They occupied the same value space </v>

749
00:38:02.231 --> 00:38:04.570
<v Speaker 2>because the value is score goals and win</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game.</v>

750
00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:09.250
<v Speaker 2>So that provides the overarching frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fundamentally they're cooperating now</v>

751
00:38:09.251 --> 00:38:10.084
<v Speaker 2>within that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're competing because it's team </v>

752
00:38:12.361 --> 00:38:14.710
<v Speaker 2>against team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even within a team,</v>

753
00:38:14.711 --> 00:38:17.330
<v Speaker 2>it's individuals vying for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

754
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.520
<v Speaker 2>let's say athletic supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also more complicated than that</v>

755
00:38:22.661 --> 00:38:27.661
<v Speaker 2>because a hockey isn't one game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sequence of iterated games.</v>

756
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.780
<v Speaker 2>And the proper strategy is if you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual athlete,</v>

757
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Speaker 2>is to adopt a strategy that makes you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>victor across iterated games.</v>

758
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.470
<v Speaker 2>And that means you have to cooperate </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your teammates.</v>

759
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And even with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the other team,</v>

760
00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to sustain your career </v>
<v Speaker 2>across time,</v>

761
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get honorable,</v>

762
00:38:48.221 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 2>very honorable hockey players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like Wayne Gretzky,</v>

763
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:55.360
<v Speaker 2>who were unbelievably stellar in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual performance,</v>

764
00:38:55.361 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 2>but also great team players and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspirations to those who played against</v>

765
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:01.150
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

766
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:01.901
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

767
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:02.734
<v Speaker 2>so that's a really good example of well </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed masculinity and that's all </v>

768
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.753
<v Speaker 2>shunted off into pathological </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition by fools who are motivated </v>

769
00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:13.084
<v Speaker 2>by hatred and resentment and who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>willfully blind to the complexities of </v>

770
00:39:16.691 --> 00:39:20.640
<v Speaker 2>the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the rise.</v>

771
00:39:20.641 --> 00:39:23.150
<v Speaker 2>It really is the rise of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like of the,</v>

772
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.610
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goddess of the underworld.</v>

773
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.261
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

774
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:27.740
<v Speaker 2>it's the right way to think about it.</v>

775
00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

776
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

777
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.093
<v Speaker 1>this is also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to move on to discussing </v>

778
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.180
<v Speaker 1>and God a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

779
00:39:37.181 --> 00:39:38.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so interesting.</v>

780
00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:41.170
<v Speaker 1>So I would just say one more as one more</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because I,</v>

781
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.140
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

782
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.820
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to these people about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can reconstruct homosexuals,</v>

783
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you say,</v>

784
00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.580
<v Speaker 1>can you send them to a straight camp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

785
00:39:50.581 --> 00:39:52.140
<v Speaker 1>all of them would say that's horrible.</v>

786
00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

787
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.993
<v Speaker 1>But if you ask about how can you </v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstruct and then reconstruct boys </v>

788
00:39:57.451 --> 00:40:00.440
<v Speaker 1>and their masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them are a board.</v>

789
00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 2>So part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

790
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.753
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

791
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a very inconsistent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

792
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:09.933
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I complained about </v>

793
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.670
<v Speaker 2>last year with regards to this bill cc </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stu [inaudible] legislation in Canada,</v>

794
00:40:15.671 --> 00:40:17.940
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

795
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:23.230
<v Speaker 2>you're instantiating a social </v>
<v Speaker 2>constructionist view of gender,</v>

796
00:40:23.231 --> 00:40:25.960
<v Speaker 2>gender expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual proclivity,</v>

797
00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:27.760
<v Speaker 2>all of these things into the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

798
00:40:27.761 --> 00:40:30.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's socially constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

799
00:40:30.201 --> 00:40:34.170
<v Speaker 2>So wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Conservatives who have been,</v>

800
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:35.643
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposing homosexuality for the last </v>

801
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.100
<v Speaker 2>hundred years have used nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>social constructionist arguments.</v>

802
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.930
<v Speaker 2>They basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

803
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:47.090
<v Speaker 2>if it's socially constructed or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual choice,</v>

804
00:40:47.091 --> 00:40:47.871
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

805
00:40:47.871 --> 00:40:48.704
<v Speaker 2>now it's stantiating into Canadian law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why the hell can't you just be </v>

806
00:40:52.431 --> 00:40:57.100
<v Speaker 2>reeducated out of it or just drop it if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just an individual choice?</v>

807
00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to say you're,</v>

808
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.610
<v Speaker 2>you're playing with fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fire that will consume you.</v>

809
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

810
00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.020
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>

811
00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.160
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say nobody.</v>

812
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.650
<v Speaker 2>These arguments are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these arguments are subtle and,</v>

813
00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:19.140
<v Speaker 2>and they're not easy to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

814
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:20.603
<v Speaker 2>and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the consequences of producing </v>

815
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 2>legislation like that unfold over </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>

816
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Not minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

817
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Did you see what happened at Wilfrid </v>
<v Speaker 2>laurier university in Canada last week,</v>

818
00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 2>two weeks ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay Shepherd?</v>

819
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:36.283
<v Speaker 2>Does that ring a male?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listen to the conversation she </v>

820
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:41.350
<v Speaker 2>recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

821
00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 2>So in Canada now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three things are happening.</v>

822
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:45.163
<v Speaker 2>The first is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that I predicted this </v>

823
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.530
<v Speaker 2>and that the only reason my reputation </v>
<v Speaker 2>was ever,</v>

824
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.393
<v Speaker 2>let's say tarnished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was because I predicted that this was </v>

825
00:41:54.651 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still being vilified by people who,</v>

826
00:41:57.921 --> 00:41:59.560
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

827
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.433
<v Speaker 2>who are admitting nonetheless that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened at Wilfrid laurier was </v>

828
00:42:03.591 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 2>reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

829
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:09.970
<v Speaker 2>So that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is the people at Lauria</v>

830
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.823
<v Speaker 2>who used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who accused Lindsay of breaking the </v>

831
00:42:13.221 --> 00:42:14.054
<v Speaker 2>Canadian federal and provincial laws are</v>
<v Speaker 2>being accused of misinterpreting those </v>

832
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:18.824
<v Speaker 2>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they aren't as far as I'm </v>

833
00:42:20.121 --> 00:42:22.940
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that enables people to save face.</v>

834
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.793
<v Speaker 2>And third and most dreadfully a fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of faculty members and public </v>

835
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 2>commentators are claiming that Ramboo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kana and Pimlott and Joel,</v>

836
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:38.000
<v Speaker 2>who were the interlocutors in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inquisition,</v>

837
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.350
<v Speaker 2>are the true victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

838
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

839
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Because now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that people have been,</v>

840
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:45.591
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

841
00:42:45.591 --> 00:42:49.820
<v Speaker 2>they were only standing up for trans </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights and second while,</v>

842
00:42:49.821 --> 00:42:53.300
<v Speaker 2>because they'd been the target of </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantial criticism,</v>

843
00:42:53.301 --> 00:42:55.430
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like overwhelming,</v>

844
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.000
<v Speaker 2>punishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal criticism,</v>

845
00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.653
<v Speaker 2>unending for weeks while they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're now victims because that's </v>

846
00:43:05.091 --> 00:43:05.924
<v Speaker 2>just not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when the president could Wilfrid </v>

847
00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:12.710
<v Speaker 2>laurier university apologized to Lindsay</v>
<v Speaker 2>shepherd,</v>

848
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 2>she also said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

849
00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:15.824
<v Speaker 2>I also feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also feel that what has happened to </v>

850
00:43:18.201 --> 00:43:19.034
<v Speaker 2>the faculty members in the aftermath of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this faculty members and administrators </v>

851
00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 2>was also raw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

852
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:25.910
<v Speaker 2>it's that typical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 2>you see this when kids get bullied in </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools now is that the idiot,</v>

854
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intervenors and they're,</v>

855
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.173
<v Speaker 2>and they're blind humanitarian impulses </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring the bully and the victim into the </v>

856
00:43:40.311 --> 00:43:43.700
<v Speaker 2>principal's office to discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming equal,</v>

857
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.360
<v Speaker 2>equal causal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

858
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.270
<v Speaker 2>Responsibility on the part of the victim</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the perpetrator.</v>

859
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.320
<v Speaker 2>And they think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

860
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:54.080
<v Speaker 2>if they just had a nice talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

861
00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w we could,</v>

862
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:57.223
<v Speaker 2>could be settled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not understanding at all that the bully </v>

863
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.493
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say one of these one in a hundred </v>

864
00:44:02.301 --> 00:44:03.134
<v Speaker 2>Predator types,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to stand on the outside </v>

865
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:05.864
<v Speaker 2>of the school ground and wait for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>victim to come by and just pound the </v>

866
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:11.720
<v Speaker 2>hell out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's how bullies work.</v>

867
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:12.231
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

868
00:44:12.231 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 2>we could settle it like reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

869
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.350
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

870
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.630
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're so God damn naive that,</v>

871
00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:18.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if evil ever popped out and made a face </v>

872
00:44:21.081 --> 00:44:22.310
<v Speaker 2>at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it likely will,</v>

873
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:25.370
<v Speaker 2>you'd be scared into post traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress disorders so fast,</v>

874
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:28.520
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't know what hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen that plenty of times in my</v>

875
00:44:28.521 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 2>clinical practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

876
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:32.770
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

877
00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these all,</v>

878
00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.080
<v Speaker 1>all this Lindsay shepherd that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

879
00:44:38.081 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're now trans folk.</v>

880
00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:40.923
<v Speaker 1>I've written about these issues in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden as one of the few that's </v>

881
00:44:44.501 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 1>sweetened about two snot an activist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

882
00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:48.594
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently I wrote about how it coincides </v>

883
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:52.314
<v Speaker 1>with the autism diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's the same in the United </v>

884
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.113
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

885
00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of,</v>

886
00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.090
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

887
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:05.090
<v Speaker 1>especially young women who's never had </v>
<v Speaker 1>any doubts about their sexual,</v>

888
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:06.203
<v Speaker 1>about their gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they found find a likeminded </v>

889
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.470
<v Speaker 1>people with problems connecting socially</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet,</v>

890
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.630
<v Speaker 1>and all of the sudden they decide that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

891
00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man.</v>

892
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

893
00:45:18.781 --> 00:45:22.770
<v Speaker 1>most of them have a diagnosis within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>autism spectrum.</v>

894
00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And to even say this and say that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something we need to investigate</v>

895
00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.193
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

896
00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:32.880
<v Speaker 1>sort of transphobic because then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

897
00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you're questioning the motives within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person.</v>

898
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:39.980
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

899
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.833
<v Speaker 1>you're basically saying that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not an gender identity or </v>

900
00:45:43.851 --> 00:45:46.910
<v Speaker 1>feeling full kate's company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

901
00:45:46.911 --> 00:45:49.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like maybe it's going to be worse.</v>

902
00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:52.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's going to get worse because </v>

903
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:55.100
<v Speaker 2>look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

904
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:55.943
<v Speaker 2>here's the logical fallacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all transsexuals have mental </v>

905
00:45:59.151 --> 00:45:59.984
<v Speaker 2>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many people with mental illness are </v>

906
00:46:03.141 --> 00:46:05.240
<v Speaker 2>going to be confused about their </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>

907
00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:07.183
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that the pool of people confused </v>

908
00:46:08.691 --> 00:46:10.850
<v Speaker 2>about their identity is extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>large.</v>

909
00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you produce a social fad,</v>

910
00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.530
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what we're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender transformation,</v>

911
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:19.783
<v Speaker 2>then everyone who's unstable is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>gravitate very rapidly towards that fad </v>

912
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:26.840
<v Speaker 2>that's happened many times with </v>
<v Speaker 2>different forms of pathology.</v>

913
00:46:26.841 --> 00:46:27.674
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a book called the discovery of </v>

914
00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:35.560
<v Speaker 2>the unconscious by an existentialist </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapist named Henri [inaudible],</v>

915
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:37.310
<v Speaker 2>which is a great book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Book,</v>

916
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:38.623
<v Speaker 2>and he tracks the cyclical recurrence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple personality disorder over the </v>

917
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:45.294
<v Speaker 2>last 300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a case will be reported after </v>

918
00:46:48.931 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 2>everyone forgets about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a generation or two,</v>

919
00:46:51.031 --> 00:46:51.864
<v Speaker 2>a case will be reported and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreads like wildfire and there's </v>

920
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.520
<v Speaker 2>multiple personality everywhere.</v>

921
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:57.833
<v Speaker 2>And then people get skeptical about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reports dropoff to zero and it </v>

922
00:47:01.781 --> 00:47:04.660
<v Speaker 2>goes underground again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then three generations again,</v>

923
00:47:04.661 --> 00:47:07.930
<v Speaker 2>somebody reports a case history and poof</v>
<v Speaker 2>up it comes again.</v>

924
00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:10.550
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

925
00:47:10.551 --> 00:47:12.910
<v Speaker 2>there are these in Carl Jung wrote about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this a lot.</v>

926
00:47:12.911 --> 00:47:17.590
<v Speaker 2>There are these psychic epidemics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>occur from time to time.</v>

927
00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:20.290
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing happened for example,</v>

928
00:47:20.291 --> 00:47:21.720
<v Speaker 2>in the 1980s when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

929
00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:25.390
<v Speaker 2>there was a huge outcry in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States in particular about,</v>

930
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>satanic ritual abuse daycares and that,</v>

931
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:34.510
<v Speaker 2>that produced an absolute uproar for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like five years.</v>

932
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.240
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you have that?</v>

933
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the professors here and hope solo</v>

934
00:47:41.051 --> 00:47:43.630
<v Speaker 1>at Umsl University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wrote a book about,</v>

935
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:48.510
<v Speaker 1>and most of them men of power were in on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in a hospital.</v>

936
00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

937
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:50.883
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

938
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it was,</v>

939
00:47:52.861 --> 00:47:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's blatantly,</v>

940
00:47:54.621 --> 00:47:55.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

941
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.360
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

942
00:47:56.390 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 1>But it was gender scientists call </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he would criticize.</v>

943
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.360
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of a,</v>

944
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:05.280
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

945
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:05.960
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

946
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.793
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's actually one of the architects </v>

947
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.070
<v Speaker 1>behind our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

948
00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:13.970
<v Speaker 1>how we view men's violence against </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

949
00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:15.913
<v Speaker 1>But you also wrote about this satanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals that men in power had against </v>

950
00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.300
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they in daycare?</v>

951
00:48:23.301 --> 00:48:26.840
<v Speaker 1>It was just like against children </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

952
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:27.743
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>AH,</v>

953
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

954
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.473
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a great book written in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States called Satan silence by a </v>

955
00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.700
<v Speaker 2>social worker and the lawyer that </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigated that,</v>

956
00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see tannic ritual abuse epidemic and it </v>

957
00:48:39.321 --> 00:48:41.690
<v Speaker 2>makes the Salem witch hunts looked like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

958
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:42.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the longest prison sentences in history </v>

959
00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:45.374
<v Speaker 2>were handed out for the hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetrators of these satanic ritual </v>

960
00:48:48.771 --> 00:48:49.604
<v Speaker 2>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They dug under whole towns in places </v>

961
00:48:51.921 --> 00:48:52.754
<v Speaker 2>looking for the tunnels where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the sacrifices were being </v>

962
00:48:55.731 --> 00:48:56.564
<v Speaker 2>performed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they invented a whole new </v>

963
00:48:58.161 --> 00:48:58.994
<v Speaker 2>categories of clinical diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late onset female sexual Predator of </v>

964
00:49:03.261 --> 00:49:04.760
<v Speaker 2>whom there are zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

965
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 2>That is a category that does not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>

966
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:09.933
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like a great horror horror movie </v>

967
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 1>or something like these satanic circles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to actually believe in it,</v>

968
00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.460
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really crazy.</v>

969
00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to move on to,</v>

970
00:49:20.501 --> 00:49:21.334
<v Speaker 1>if you have time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to move on to a question </v>

971
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:27.380
<v Speaker 1>about the religion because I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>

972
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.210
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in musth and religion and,</v>

973
00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.073
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

974
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:32.683
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

975
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.180
<v Speaker 1>What one thing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

976
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you call something a myth,</v>

977
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.720
<v Speaker 1>then it's probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a not alive anymore.</v>

978
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:44.501
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

979
00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:46.120
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're actually calling it a myth,</v>

980
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:49.390
<v Speaker 1>if you really believe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not believing that it is a myth.</v>

981
00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.030
<v Speaker 1>And so where we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

982
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:54.330
<v Speaker 1>we've been studying the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

983
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:59.250
<v Speaker 1>the Bible like scientifically and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we'd reconstruct the,</v>

984
00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.133
<v Speaker 1>my first subject in university was </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious studies and then you </v>

985
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.473
<v Speaker 1>deconstruct the Bible and you'll learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>about [inaudible] when everything was </v>

986
00:50:07.941 --> 00:50:08.940
<v Speaker 1>great and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

987
00:50:08.941 --> 00:50:10.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you do right now?</v>

988
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:13.370
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of,</v>

989
00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you making the Bible in your Bible </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures,</v>

990
00:50:17.871 --> 00:50:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you making it accessible for people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our,</v>

991
00:50:20.641 --> 00:50:23.730
<v Speaker 1>our age or our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

992
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:26.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

993
00:50:26.191 --> 00:50:27.024
<v Speaker 1>and people who would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think would match or wouldn't </v>

994
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:33.000
<v Speaker 1>have naturally turned to the Bible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts.</v>

995
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.360
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

996
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.673
<v Speaker 2>it's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just an indication of how surreal </v>

997
00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:43.710
<v Speaker 2>the current circumstances really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been selling out the theater that I</v>

998
00:50:43.711 --> 00:50:47.430
<v Speaker 2>booked in Toronto for these biblical </v>
<v Speaker 2>lectures and it's all full of,</v>

999
00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.370
<v Speaker 2>it's almost all young men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not that young,</v>

1000
00:50:50.371 --> 00:50:52.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're between say 18 and 30,</v>

1001
00:50:52.681 --> 00:50:53.840
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although they're,</v>

1002
00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's women in there and there's older</v>

1003
00:50:55.531 --> 00:50:57.330
<v Speaker 2>people too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the main audience.</v>

1004
00:50:57.331 --> 00:50:59.220
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's crazy,</v>

1005
00:50:59.221 --> 00:51:01.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's impossible that that's happening.</v>

1006
00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.130
<v Speaker 2>But it's an attempt to revive a Phi the </v>
<v Speaker 2>myth.</v>

1007
00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1008
00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.420
<v Speaker 1>So what's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your take take on why?</v>

1009
00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Why is</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked,</v>

1010
00:51:15.641 --> 00:51:17.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a Dork is this?</v>

1011
00:51:17.201 --> 00:51:20.230
<v Speaker 1>When I interviewed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there are people there were worried</v>

1012
00:51:20.231 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 1>about the postmodern challenge to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1013
00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like deconstructing everything.</v>

1014
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.620
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look for something from in,</v>

1015
00:51:28.621 --> 00:51:29.061
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1016
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:32.640
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life and what I see you doing,</v>

1017
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Speaker 1>and I would like you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts on that.</v>

1018
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:40.230
<v Speaker 1>You will bring some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from you're trying to bring in sort</v>

1019
00:51:40.231 --> 00:51:41.490
<v Speaker 1>of a firmer foothold.</v>

1020
00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1021
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:47.900
<v Speaker 2>That it's like I'm journeying to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the ocean to rescue the father</v>

1022
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:50.290
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the fire breathing whale.</v>

1023
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.730
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the thing is,</v>

1024
00:51:52.731 --> 00:51:57.680
<v Speaker 2>is that when everything shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you look for the foundation.</v>

1025
00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1026
00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.720
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foundation,</v>

1027
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.843
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing the West got right is the </v>

1028
00:52:03.301 --> 00:52:06.640
<v Speaker 2>divinity of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1029
00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.480
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the myth idea.</v>

1030
00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:14.440
<v Speaker 2>This is partly where I had a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Sam Harris.</v>

1031
00:52:14.441 --> 00:52:16.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was quite a difficult discussion,</v>

1032
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to discussions.</v>

1033
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in the best of physical health </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I had them,</v>

1034
00:52:21.371 --> 00:52:23.020
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's life.</v>

1035
00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:27.250
<v Speaker 2>But you talk when you talk about myths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1036
00:52:27.251 --> 00:52:28.084
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like untruth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think about it sort of as Metta </v>

1037
00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:32.043
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's truer than true in some sense </v>

1038
00:52:34.181 --> 00:52:35.014
<v Speaker 2>because it consists of abstractions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have guided human behavior properly for </v>

1039
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:42.610
<v Speaker 2>forever insofar as human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been successful.</v>

1040
00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:46.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even in so far as we define success,</v>

1041
00:52:46.811 --> 00:52:49.120
<v Speaker 2>it's embedded within these mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

1042
00:52:49.121 --> 00:52:53.470
<v Speaker 2>which are ideas that we act out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially not ideas that we hold or,</v>

1043
00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:56.320
<v Speaker 2>or believe or state their ideas that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>act out.</v>

1044
00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.720
<v Speaker 2>And the idea of the divine individual is</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the center of our law,</v>

1045
00:53:01.721 --> 00:53:02.860
<v Speaker 2>which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1046
00:53:02.861 --> 00:53:03.694
<v Speaker 2>even if you're accused of murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if there's overwhelming evidence </v>

1047
00:53:07.721 --> 00:53:08.554
<v Speaker 2>against you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have value that the state </v>

1048
00:53:11.771 --> 00:53:15.010
<v Speaker 2>cannot nearly trample on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1049
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:15.941
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1050
00:53:15.941 --> 00:53:18.340
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the case because you know,</v>

1051
00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:22.360
<v Speaker 2>the typical barbaric society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1052
00:53:22.361 --> 00:53:24.760
<v Speaker 2>which is what we're trying to reproduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly,</v>

1053
00:53:24.761 --> 00:53:27.870
<v Speaker 2>is the one that assumes that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>accused of something,</v>

1054
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:30.900
<v Speaker 2>we might as well just shoot you on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>off chance that you're guilty.</v>

1055
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a way easier to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to adopt that as a principle.</v>

1056
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:38.800
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it certainly satiates the Ma,</v>

1057
00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:41.950
<v Speaker 2>the blood lust of the mob much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively.</v>

1058
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.543
<v Speaker 2>The idea that we could have constructed </v>
<v Speaker 2>a worldview that put the pathetic week </v>

1059
00:53:48.201 --> 00:53:50.330
<v Speaker 2>malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insufficient,</v>

1060
00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:54.500
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable individual at the center of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the value structure is just,</v>

1061
00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:59.240
<v Speaker 2>it's an accomplishment who's grandier </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot possibly be overstated.</v>

1062
00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:04.040
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are the beneficiaries of that system.</v>

1063
00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.653
<v Speaker 2>We live within its protective conf </v>
<v Speaker 2>confines and we're doing everything we </v>

1064
00:54:08.961 --> 00:54:12.440
<v Speaker 2>possibly can to destroy it as rapidly as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1065
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:13.933
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1066
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:15.653
<v Speaker 1>so if Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it was a one of my idols growing </v>

1067
00:54:21.901 --> 00:54:25.080
<v Speaker 1>up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read the hero with a thousand faces,</v>

1068
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.550
<v Speaker 1>isn't too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a power of myth lectures.</v>

1069
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

1070
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a lot of young men,</v>

1071
00:54:31.161 --> 00:54:35.010
<v Speaker 1>I loved Star Wars and the Lord of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rings and then you sort of,</v>

1072
00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.280
<v Speaker 1>you read his work and you find out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1073
00:54:37.281 --> 00:54:41.810
<v Speaker 1>so your look is he based his storyline </v>
<v Speaker 1>or he changed his story,</v>

1074
00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:46.811
<v Speaker 1>like fit more into the hero where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monument and the,</v>

1075
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:52.370
<v Speaker 1>the Hero's journey story and he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need,</v>

1076
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:57.490
<v Speaker 1>you need sort of a living myth or Ology </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

1077
00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:03.500
<v Speaker 1>to have psychological health and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual health.</v>

1078
00:55:03.501 --> 00:55:07.120
<v Speaker 1>You need to live with him sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>living mythology.</v>

1079
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1080
00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:09.204
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the mythology tells you who you </v>

1081
00:55:10.621 --> 00:55:11.860
<v Speaker 2>really are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1082
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.073
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1083
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:17.250
<v Speaker 2>you really are a divine son of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people,</v>

1084
00:55:17.251 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and and you know,</v>

1085
00:55:19.771 --> 00:55:20.604
<v Speaker 2>you actually know that because you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty about not living up to your </v>

1086
00:55:22.771 --> 00:55:25.850
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world would you possibly feel</v>

1087
00:55:25.851 --> 00:55:28.780
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everyone feels that if they have any</v>

1088
00:55:28.781 --> 00:55:29.614
<v Speaker 2>sense at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they're narcissistic or </v>

1089
00:55:30.761 --> 00:55:31.594
<v Speaker 2>psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone feels that burden of the </v>

1090
00:55:34.121 --> 00:55:34.954
<v Speaker 2>perfection to which they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection to which they have not yet </v>

1091
00:55:37.721 --> 00:55:40.480
<v Speaker 2>aspired nor attained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1092
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:41.463
<v Speaker 2>and that's a testament to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the overwhelming potential that </v>

1093
00:55:44.381 --> 00:55:45.214
<v Speaker 2>characterizes each individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what I'm trying to </v>

1094
00:55:47.081 --> 00:55:47.914
<v Speaker 2>point out in the biblical lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's these continual stories about </v>

1095
00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:52.114
<v Speaker 2>the nature of humanity and the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 2>proper being in the face of the tragedy </v>

1096
00:55:56.291 --> 00:55:57.520
<v Speaker 2>and malevolence of life.</v>

1097
00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:02.950
<v Speaker 2>And the Bible is Western.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Western world's attempt to,</v>

1098
00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:06.670
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to formulate that as a,</v>

1099
00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 2>as a comprehensible set of stories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also a set of principles for behavior.</v>

1100
00:56:13.001 --> 00:56:15.640
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the collective struggle of our,</v>

1101
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:20.820
<v Speaker 2>of our imagination stretched across tens</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thousands of years,</v>

1102
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 2>maybe hundreds of thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even more than that.</v>

1103
00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:25.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause some of these stories,</v>

1104
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:28.830
<v Speaker 2>the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of confronting the malevolence</v>

1105
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:29.673
<v Speaker 2>serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I believe that in one form or </v>

1106
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:34.960
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that story is if you also consider it as</v>

1107
00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:35.794
<v Speaker 2>something that could be acted out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that story is at least 60 million years </v>

1108
00:56:38.951 --> 00:56:43.320
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because Lynn is veiled,</v>

1109
00:56:43.321 --> 00:56:44.154
<v Speaker 2>is anthropologist at Ucla has </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated quite nicely that our tree </v>

1110
00:56:48.841 --> 00:56:53.841
<v Speaker 2>dwelling relatives coevolved with snakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our continual battle with snakes and</v>

1111
00:56:53.971 --> 00:56:57.270
<v Speaker 2>predatory reptiles was part of what gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>us our acute vision.</v>

1112
00:56:58.070 --> 00:56:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate grades.</v>

1113
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1114
00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1115
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:05.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1116
00:57:05.511 --> 00:57:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I know that I have to ask this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the,</v>

1117
00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing you answered this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that do you believe in God?</v>

1118
00:57:12.051 --> 00:57:12.884
<v Speaker 1>And I saw a youtube video with you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that you didn't like that </v>

1119
00:57:16.761 --> 00:57:19.520
<v Speaker 1>question because you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were being boxed in.</v>

1120
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:23.010
<v Speaker 1>And I sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt that because one of the things me</v>

1121
00:57:23.011 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 1>and my wife have been wrestled with is </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked a lot about this.</v>

1122
00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:29.423
<v Speaker 1>What do we mean when we say that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in God because in Sweden to be </v>

1123
00:57:33.031 --> 00:57:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Swedish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be Christian,</v>

1124
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:38.580
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of what it means today to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that you are Swedish.</v>

1125
00:57:38.581 --> 00:57:41.970
<v Speaker 1>So if you said that you a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were sort of a good family father,</v>

1126
00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:43.043
<v Speaker 1>you had a lot of values within that </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like a good Christian man is </v>

1127
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:48.423
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say you're a good Swedish </v>

1128
00:57:49.711 --> 00:57:50.544
<v Speaker 1>brand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps,</v>

1129
00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:53.940
<v Speaker 1>so it used to mean a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you had the,</v>

1130
00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:56.293
<v Speaker 1>the Evangelical Christians criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly this and saying that you are </v>

1131
00:58:00.531 --> 00:58:04.310
<v Speaker 1>lost contact with God and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>meant it in a much smaller sense</v>

1132
00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:10.220
<v Speaker 2>and so they tend to confuse the biblical</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories with lit with empirical history.</v>

1133
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:11.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not surprising they do that </v>

1134
00:58:13.321 --> 00:58:15.780
<v Speaker 2>because they're trying to defend their </v>
<v Speaker 2>faith against,</v>

1135
00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:16.853
<v Speaker 2>let's call it the postmodern assault or </v>
<v Speaker 2>even the modernist assault for that </v>

1136
00:58:19.561 --> 00:58:20.394
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some sympathy with their </v>

1137
00:58:21.391 --> 00:58:22.224
<v Speaker 2>motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is is that they don't </v>

1138
00:58:24.721 --> 00:58:25.554
<v Speaker 2>understand that not all truth is </v>
<v Speaker 2>empirical truths in in fact the </v>

1139
00:58:29.671 --> 00:58:30.504
<v Speaker 2>fundamental truths as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paradoxically enough our Darwinian and </v>

1140
00:58:34.501 --> 00:58:36.690
<v Speaker 2>they actually line up with religious </v>
<v Speaker 2>truths,</v>

1141
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:40.200
<v Speaker 2>which is the point that I've been trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make when I discussed this.</v>

1142
00:58:40.201 --> 00:58:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Such issues with people like Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Sam is a very,</v>

1143
00:58:44.041 --> 00:58:46.980
<v Speaker 2>very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

1144
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.970
<v Speaker 2>he worships the intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing I would say.</v>

1145
00:58:50.971 --> 00:58:55.290
<v Speaker 2>And the second thing is that I was never</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to push him to his solution.</v>

1146
00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.220
<v Speaker 2>He'd never let me go there because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1147
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:59.063
<v Speaker 2>his idea is that we could rationally </v>
<v Speaker 2>order society so that the wellbeing of </v>

1148
00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:04.560
<v Speaker 2>people was maximized.</v>

1149
00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.690
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he even said to,</v>

1150
00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember which interview it was,</v>

1151
00:59:11.391 --> 00:59:14.840
<v Speaker 2>but he said explicitly to the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was interviewing,</v>

1152
00:59:14.841 --> 00:59:18.980
<v Speaker 2>that he could sit down right now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with a religious system that was</v>

1153
00:59:18.981 --> 00:59:19.814
<v Speaker 2>much more rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inappropriate than any the ones that </v>

1154
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:24.020
<v Speaker 2>have that have existed to date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1155
00:59:24.021 --> 00:59:24.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1156
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:28.370
<v Speaker 2>you're falling right into that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalist Utopian pitfall there.</v>

1157
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.130
<v Speaker 2>You're just not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one can do that.</v>

1158
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:34.160
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up where the socialists,</v>

1159
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:39.200
<v Speaker 2>like the radical Soviet socialists or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi utopians ended up,</v>

1160
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.670
<v Speaker 2>we will be speaking as grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Combined.</v>

1161
00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wallet.</v>

1162
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1163
00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the language than,</v>

1164
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:49.380
<v Speaker 2>than Swedish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much more.</v>

1165
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Most languages are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:52.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that it's,</v>

1167
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:54.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1168
00:59:54.711 --> 00:59:55.544
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I really liked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoyevsky is that this was a notes </v>

1169
00:59:58.851 --> 00:59:59.600
<v Speaker 2>from underground.</v>

1170
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just states it very clearly.</v>

1171
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1172
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.463
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that you cannot claim </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the history of the world and he </v>

1173
01:00:05.721 --> 01:00:06.554
<v Speaker 2>meets the history of being is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational and it isn't that he's </v>

1174
01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 2>criticizing the idea that you could use </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

1175
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:14.444
<v Speaker 2>scientific investigation and rationality</v>
<v Speaker 2>to lay out a clear representation of </v>

1176
01:00:18.621 --> 01:00:21.740
<v Speaker 2>objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he's saying is that if you take the</v>

1177
01:00:21.741 --> 01:00:22.574
<v Speaker 2>terrible suffering and malevolence into </v>
<v Speaker 2>account as fundamental realities that </v>

1178
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:27.133
<v Speaker 2>are rationalist perspective is </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely insufficient to tell the </v>

1179
01:00:30.561 --> 01:00:32.150
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1180
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.313
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just rationality just breaks down </v>

1181
01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:37.244
<v Speaker 2>in the face of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hits an obstacle that it cannot </v>

1182
01:00:40.431 --> 01:00:43.910
<v Speaker 2>contend with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need something else.</v>

1183
01:00:43.911 --> 01:00:44.744
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this great image of Christ as </v>

1184
01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:47.601
<v Speaker 2>Patrick Crater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1185
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:48.940
<v Speaker 2>very old image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1186
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:52.490
<v Speaker 2>fortunately can't remember which </v>
<v Speaker 2>cathedral it's represented in,</v>

1187
01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:56.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great image and I'm having </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them carved for me right now.</v>

1188
01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.693
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a medieval image of Christ and his </v>

1189
01:01:00.381 --> 01:01:04.010
<v Speaker 2>face is divided into two halves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very asymmetrical.</v>

1190
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:05.263
<v Speaker 2>And one half the eyes are different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the facial expression is different than </v>

1191
01:01:08.391 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 2>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's also,</v>

1192
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.920
<v Speaker 2>he's on portrayed on the top of the Dome</v>
<v Speaker 2>and holding a book.</v>

1193
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.290
<v Speaker 2>So the book is sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1194
01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:17.540
<v Speaker 2>So that's a great idea that the book is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacred.</v>

1195
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:19.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1196
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:20.293
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that the word is sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the picture also represents </v>

1197
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:26.840
<v Speaker 2>human beings as creatures with one foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1198
01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.273
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the profane and one foot in the </v>

1199
01:01:29.991 --> 01:01:32.960
<v Speaker 2>sacred or one foot in the finite and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot in the infinite.</v>

1200
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:36.770
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's empirically true.</v>

1201
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Like we are these weird creatures that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are both finite and infinite at the same</v>

1202
01:01:41.721 --> 01:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have experiences of that,</v>

1203
01:01:43.881 --> 01:01:48.470
<v Speaker 2>even like deep religious experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experiences for that matter.</v>

1204
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:49.783
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invoke that feeling of that invoke the </v>

1205
01:01:53.271 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1206
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:58.940
<v Speaker 2>of our connection with the infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what that infinite is,</v>

1207
01:01:58.941 --> 01:01:59.774
<v Speaker 2>so let's call that God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Christian ideas that that's </v>

1208
01:02:02.481 --> 01:02:04.730
<v Speaker 2>actually outside of time and space </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

1209
01:02:04.731 --> 01:02:07.880
<v Speaker 2>which is quite a grant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no ship and not the least bit</v>

1210
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.333
<v Speaker 2>unsophisticated bar the way it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendously sophisticated idea that </v>

1211
01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:17.720
<v Speaker 2>something actually exists outside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fabric of time and space that transcends</v>

1212
01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:18.554
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are at the beginning and at </v>

1213
01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:21.444
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an unbelievably sophisticated </v>

1214
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>idea and I think that people can </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that and do quite commonly,</v>

1215
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.560
<v Speaker 2>which was why the psychedelic revolution</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 60s was so absolutely potent.</v>

1216
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.113
<v Speaker 2>So these sorts of things can't just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dismissed with some rationalist sleight </v>

1217
01:02:37.141 --> 01:02:38.490
<v Speaker 2>of hand and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1218
01:02:38.491 --> 01:02:42.210
<v Speaker 2>and some discussion of the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity Judeo Christianity,</v>

1219
01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:43.044
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's some like primitive set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of wish fulfillment superstitions or </v>

1220
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:47.634
<v Speaker 2>some power game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you just have no depth of </v>

1221
01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:53.520
<v Speaker 2>scholarship whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's what your criticisms are.</v>

1222
01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.320
<v Speaker 1>And also I would say when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when uh,</v>

1223
01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>when you your ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you ask someone,</v>

1224
01:02:59.711 --> 01:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

1225
01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I ask myself if I say that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in God what within me,</v>

1226
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.533
<v Speaker 1>when I say what is different within me </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say that I don't believe in God </v>

1227
01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>compared to a person that says that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does believe in God.</v>

1228
01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean is if I feel sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational,</v>

1229
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:21.543
<v Speaker 1>I wake up or I take a glass of wine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then suddenly I'm overwhelmed with love </v>

1230
01:03:25.961 --> 01:03:26.794
<v Speaker 1>for humankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my fellow man or something like </v>

1231
01:03:28.751 --> 01:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>

1232
01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>if I was a person who will say that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed in God,</v>

1233
01:03:33.251 --> 01:03:34.084
<v Speaker 1>would that be something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it something qualitatively different </v>

1234
01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:43.030
<v Speaker 1>between the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between me compared to that person?</v>

1235
01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.433
<v Speaker 1>You understand what I'm [inaudible]</v>

1236
01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.350
<v Speaker 2>I haven't quite got that yet.</v>

1237
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.053
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the experience of believing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in God and how is that qualitatively </v>

1238
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:56.390
<v Speaker 1>qualitatively different from a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who says that he doesn't?</v>

1239
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you mean.</v>

1240
01:03:57.841 --> 01:03:59.550
<v Speaker 2>While that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is part of the question.</v>

1241
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.490
<v Speaker 2>The question is here while the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone says,</v>

1242
01:04:02.491 --> 01:04:06.790
<v Speaker 2>do you believe in God?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's three parts to that question.</v>

1243
01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:11.160
<v Speaker 2>The first question is who is the you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>which they are referring?</v>

1244
01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.260
<v Speaker 2>And that turns out to not be a simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

1245
01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean Neesha did a very good job of </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking apart the idea of the eye,</v>

1246
01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he was,</v>

1247
01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.450
<v Speaker 2>he was critiquing descartes' I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore I am.</v>

1248
01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:26.690
<v Speaker 2>And and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first question is,</v>

1249
01:04:26.691 --> 01:04:28.880
<v Speaker 2>well who is the you to which you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>referring.</v>

1250
01:04:28.881 --> 01:04:30.950
<v Speaker 2>The second is what do you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief?</v>

1251
01:04:30.951 --> 01:04:31.784
<v Speaker 2>The third is what do you mean by God?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't just leap to the </v>

1252
01:04:35.421 --> 01:04:36.254
<v Speaker 2>assumption that the person asking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question and the person answering the </v>

1253
01:04:39.201 --> 01:04:43.050
<v Speaker 2>question have the same views on those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's,</v>

1254
01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.460
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the reason why I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the question.</v>

1255
01:04:46.461 --> 01:04:47.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1256
01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:52.250
<v Speaker 2>well I act as if I believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say that's the more,</v>

1257
01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:55.400
<v Speaker 2>that's the most fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of faith.</v>

1258
01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.330
<v Speaker 2>But I could also say I believe and don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in God.</v>

1259
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.920
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can't,</v>

1260
01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.450
<v Speaker 2>you can't think both of those things at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

1261
01:05:04.451 --> 01:05:06.250
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

1262
01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Speaker 2>that's what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1263
01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:11.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in,</v>

1264
01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.410
<v Speaker 2>when you were asking something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated,</v>

1265
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.043
<v Speaker 2>then there's absolutely no reason to so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't have paradoxical </v>

1266
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:21.770
<v Speaker 2>responses to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could,</v>

1267
01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:22.663
<v Speaker 2>you could even say maybe that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>injunction in the old testament is </v>

1268
01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:25.754
<v Speaker 2>something like you should believe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not believe in God cause it's very </v>

1269
01:05:29.071 --> 01:05:30.600
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1270
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:34.810
<v Speaker 2>it's not by any means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A simple a question.</v>

1271
01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember his name though,</v>

1272
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>but I think perhaps it was a burger or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1273
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:47.250
<v Speaker 1>He said that myth is about reconciling </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions within the union.</v>

1274
01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:49.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1275
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.340
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly,</v>

1276
01:05:50.341 --> 01:05:51.174
<v Speaker 2>well that's what a successful myth does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of the reason that these </v>

1277
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.033
<v Speaker 2>etiologies that we'd be discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like feminism have so much power is </v>

1278
01:05:59.951 --> 01:06:00.784
<v Speaker 2>because they actually draw their motive </v>
<v Speaker 2>force from an underlying religious </v>

1279
01:06:04.091 --> 01:06:06.250
<v Speaker 2>substrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they only tell half the story.</v>

1280
01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:10.720
<v Speaker 2>That's what an ideology is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when the feminists say culture is the</v>

1281
01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:12.300
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical patriarch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1282
01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:13.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

1283
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:18.450
<v Speaker 2>But it's also the benevolent wise king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1284
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:22.060
<v Speaker 2>well then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can't be one and the other at the</v>

1285
01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:23.410
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is,</v>

1286
01:06:23.411 --> 01:06:24.244
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a multidimensional phenomena that </v>

1287
01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:28.330
<v Speaker 2>you're encapsulating within a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>

1288
01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:31.150
<v Speaker 2>It can contain contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1289
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:36.151
<v Speaker 2>it does because society obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>constraints and and kills you.</v>

1290
01:06:37.631 --> 01:06:38.464
<v Speaker 2>Even like you dye into your neural </v>
<v Speaker 2>configuration cause that when you're </v>

1291
01:06:41.461 --> 01:06:42.294
<v Speaker 2>first born you have more neural </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections than you will ever in your </v>

1292
01:06:45.781 --> 01:06:46.614
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1293
01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:49.310
<v Speaker 2>And most of them die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1294
01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:50.383
<v Speaker 2>so you dye into your four year old self </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then between the ages of 16 and 20 </v>

1295
01:06:55.461 --> 01:06:56.294
<v Speaker 2>you dye into your adult self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that that the society </v>

1296
01:07:00.191 --> 01:07:05.191
<v Speaker 2>that you're in is a terrible tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shapes you by death is exactly true.</v>

1297
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.050
<v Speaker 2>But Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the same token,</v>

1298
01:07:07.051 --> 01:07:11.190
<v Speaker 2>it's also almost everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ennobles you and enables you to function</v>

1299
01:07:11.191 --> 01:07:14.400
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the critic,</v>

1300
01:07:14.401 --> 01:07:16.770
<v Speaker 2>critics of the Patriarchy say tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tyranny,</v>

1301
01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:17.670
<v Speaker 2>tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1302
01:07:17.671 --> 01:07:18.151
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1303
01:07:18.151 --> 01:07:21.060
<v Speaker 2>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not only tyranny.</v>

1304
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:24.410
<v Speaker 2>And they say evil man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil man.</v>

1305
01:07:24.411 --> 01:07:25.011
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1306
01:07:25.011 --> 01:07:27.620
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not only evil men.</v>

1307
01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why a genuine mythologies,</v>

1308
01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:33.493
<v Speaker 2>and I would put Freudian psychoanalysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that category because Freud had a </v>

1309
01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:39.780
<v Speaker 2>very balanced view of the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being</v>

1310
01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:45.090
<v Speaker 2>talks about both parts of the paradox at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

1311
01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:47.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the dragon and the gold.</v>

1312
01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:50.370
<v Speaker 2>It's the terrible devouring mother and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1313
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:53.790
<v Speaker 2>and the Virgin Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the tyrant and the wise king.</v>

1314
01:07:53.791 --> 01:07:54.624
<v Speaker 2>It's Christ and Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all of those paradoxes stacked on </v>

1315
01:07:58.811 --> 01:07:59.644
<v Speaker 2>top of one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the story about how you go </v>

1316
01:08:01.691 --> 01:08:04.570
<v Speaker 2>about dealing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a true religious myth.</v>

1317
01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:06.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.260
<v Speaker 2>And an ideology just takes a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and says,</v>

1319
01:08:09.261 --> 01:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>this is the whole,</v>

1320
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:12.933
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1321
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:13.833
<v Speaker 1>in early Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a large battle between many </v>

1322
01:08:16.221 --> 01:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>keystrokes and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1323
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1324
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>gnostics and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1325
01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:22.763
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would turn out to be the Catholic </v>

1326
01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Church and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mainstream church.</v>

1327
01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.690
<v Speaker 1>And they said that the evil evil was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1328
01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:32.830
<v Speaker 1>the world we live in is created by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other force,</v>

1329
01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>the demiurge so that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a very split vision of,</v>

1330
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of good and evil.</v>

1331
01:08:41.331 --> 01:08:42.164
<v Speaker 1>But what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you were saying about these </v>

1332
01:08:44.931 --> 01:08:45.764
<v Speaker 1>ideologies is that basically it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it's a new formal theological </v>

1333
01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>battle between glowsticks and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people that say that this is,</v>

1334
01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:56.150
<v Speaker 1>we have both sides,</v>

1335
01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.313
<v Speaker 2>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a perfectly reasonable way of </v>

1336
01:08:58.971 --> 01:08:59.900
<v Speaker 2>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
01:08:59.901 --> 01:09:02.410
<v Speaker 2>and like young tended towards manic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He as a,</v>

1338
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:05.750
<v Speaker 2>to some degree because he was so struck </v>
<v Speaker 2>by say the evils of,</v>

1339
01:09:05.751 --> 01:09:06.584
<v Speaker 2>of Nazi-ism and he had a hard time with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that evil was only the absence </v>

1340
01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:13.700
<v Speaker 2>of good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1341
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:16.870
<v Speaker 2>and I've thought about that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a great admirer of yoga.</v>

1342
01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.580
<v Speaker 2>You criticize anything he said at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>peril,</v>

1343
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:21.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was a great genius.</v>

1344
01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:25.220
<v Speaker 2>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Manichaean view is wrong.</v>

1345
01:09:25.221 --> 01:09:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I think that what evil is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the absence of good and then it takes</v>

1346
01:09:29.901 --> 01:09:31.700
<v Speaker 2>on its own life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1347
01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:33.003
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written about this in my new book </v>

1348
01:09:34.601 --> 01:09:35.434
<v Speaker 2>quite extensively because I have a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out in January called 12 rules </v>

1349
01:09:38.231 --> 01:09:40.120
<v Speaker 2>for life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an antidote to chaos.</v>

1350
01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.433
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be trying to take those ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart and to grapple with the well with </v>

1351
01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:46.784
<v Speaker 2>the fact that human beings hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves because they're vulnerable </v>

1352
01:09:49.011 --> 01:09:50.120
<v Speaker 2>and malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1353
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:52.030
<v Speaker 2>which is original sin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1354
01:09:52.031 --> 01:09:54.370
<v Speaker 2>which is something I'm a great believer </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1355
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1356
01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:58.503
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated way of looking at the </v>

1357
01:10:00.371 --> 01:10:00.851
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1358
01:10:00.851 --> 01:10:01.684
<v Speaker 2>that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was something damaged in the </v>

1359
01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:08.070
<v Speaker 2>fabric of being itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that to be the case.</v>

1360
01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:08.904
<v Speaker 2>I think we experienced that as human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings and that our ethical obligation </v>

1361
01:10:12.961 --> 01:10:17.880
<v Speaker 2>is to rectify that and to determine how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to rectify that,</v>

1362
01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:18.714
<v Speaker 2>to overcome the vulnerability and </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolence that like the terror of </v>

1363
01:10:21.991 --> 01:10:22.824
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability and the subjection to </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolence that characterizes our day </v>

1364
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.940
<v Speaker 2>to day existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our,</v>

1365
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:31.170
<v Speaker 2>that's our primary mode of proper being </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

1366
01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:34.470
<v Speaker 2>That seems to me to be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1367
01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.393
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of thing that I've been </v>

1368
01:10:36.271 --> 01:10:37.104
<v Speaker 2>trying to tell.</v>

1369
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Well those who will listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1370
01:10:39.831 --> 01:10:43.220
<v Speaker 2>but it's so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mostly been young men who are dying</v>

1371
01:10:43.221 --> 01:10:44.510
<v Speaker 2>for this message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're,</v>

1372
01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.040
<v Speaker 2>they're dying for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1373
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:50.220
<v Speaker 2>it's really copies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to these talks now,</v>

1374
01:10:50.221 --> 01:10:51.054
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public talks and where I speak about </v>

1375
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:58.160
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like after the talks there are like</v>

1376
01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:04.090
<v Speaker 2>crowds of mostly young men who line up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

1377
01:11:04.091 --> 01:11:05.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was nihilistic.</v>

1378
01:11:05.531 --> 01:11:07.390
<v Speaker 2>I was desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was suicidal,</v>

1379
01:11:07.391 --> 01:11:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I was malevolent and resentful and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>going bad places.</v>

1380
01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:12.934
<v Speaker 2>And I've started to what you've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying about myth and it's like brought </v>

1381
01:11:17.911 --> 01:11:21.870
<v Speaker 2>me out of that horrible hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just one person after another</v>

1382
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:23.220
<v Speaker 2>says the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1383
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:24.054
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've had thousands of letters like </v>

1384
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:31.590
<v Speaker 2>that and maybe tens of thousands now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even begin to keep up with them.</v>

1385
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:34.860
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God for that.</v>

1386
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:39.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally or turning to you for,</v>

1387
01:11:40.551 --> 01:11:41.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this,</v>

1388
01:11:41.701 --> 01:11:44.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>counselor for guidance.</v>

1389
01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1390
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:46.853
<v Speaker 2>I read this paper along time ago called </v>
<v Speaker 2>relations between the ego and the </v>

1391
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:51.720
<v Speaker 2>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of umes.</v>

1392
01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's his most stellar work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1393
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.950
<v Speaker 2>and it's not a paper you can understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you know what it's about.</v>

1394
01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:02.730
<v Speaker 2>And cause he talked about the danger of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ego inflation.</v>

1395
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:04.403
<v Speaker 2>That's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine that you're dealing with </v>

1396
01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:10.821
<v Speaker 2>archetipal ideas and that you can fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>prey to the temptation to assume,</v>

1397
01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:15.054
<v Speaker 2>because you started to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and maybe communicate about them </v>

1398
01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:22.250
<v Speaker 2>that they are somehow yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens is,</v>

1399
01:12:22.251 --> 01:12:24.600
<v Speaker 2>is that can produce a mess cyanic </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflation.</v>

1400
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.140
<v Speaker 2>And so that would characterize someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Hitler for example.</v>

1401
01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1402
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:36.210
<v Speaker 2>it's tantamount to a form of mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness because what happens is that you</v>

1403
01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:37.044
<v Speaker 2>take on the grandeur of the mythological</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and the archetypal ideas and the </v>

1404
01:12:44.371 --> 01:12:47.900
<v Speaker 2>power of those ideas as if they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own creations.</v>

1405
01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very bad idea.</v>

1406
01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.590
<v Speaker 2>And so I read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read those,</v>

1407
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:59.630
<v Speaker 2>that paper after I had a dream where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was blown by a wind into the,</v>

1408
01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.013
<v Speaker 2>the top of a cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the chandelier in this huge </v>

1409
01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:05.634
<v Speaker 2>cathedral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say 20 times bigger than Saint </v>

1410
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Peter's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could hardly even see the walls.</v>

1411
01:13:11.341 --> 01:13:15.870
<v Speaker 2>And I was put up in this at the center </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this cathedral,</v>

1412
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.733
<v Speaker 2>right way above the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got down somehow because I </v>

1413
01:13:21.031 --> 01:13:24.720
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the wind dissolve me.</v>

1414
01:13:24.721 --> 01:13:27.090
<v Speaker 2>And blew me back there and I woke up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1415
01:13:27.091 --> 01:13:28.050
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1416
01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.300
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1417
01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.860
<v Speaker 2>the dream put me at the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross at the center of being,</v>

1418
01:13:34.861 --> 01:13:35.910
<v Speaker 2>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

1419
01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:36.744
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I supposed to make of a dream </v>

1420
01:13:38.221 --> 01:13:39.210
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1421
01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:42.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's delusional,</v>

1422
01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.600
<v Speaker 2>let's say orders on delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a very powerful dream.</v>

1423
01:13:45.601 --> 01:13:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I can still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can still see it.</v>

1424
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:48.413
<v Speaker 2>And I read the relations between the ego</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the unconscious at that time and </v>

1425
01:13:51.391 --> 01:13:52.224
<v Speaker 2>started to understand what was happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I was starting to understand </v>

1426
01:13:55.171 --> 01:13:56.004
<v Speaker 2>what these archetypal ideas meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the place of the individual is </v>

1427
01:13:59.191 --> 01:14:03.180
<v Speaker 2>actually at the crucifix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Center of reality.</v>

1428
01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:06.330
<v Speaker 2>The point of maximal suffering and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptance of that.</v>

1429
01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 2>That's all true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not true of me.</v>

1430
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is a center of the cosmos.</v>

1431
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:17.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1432
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.633
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have to detach yourself as </v>

1433
01:14:21.071 --> 01:14:21.904
<v Speaker 2>carefully as you can from the archetypal</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas themselves because otherwise you </v>

1434
01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:25.714
<v Speaker 2>end up identifying with them personally </v>
<v Speaker 2>or people identify you with them and </v>

1435
01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:35.300
<v Speaker 2>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the ultimate,</v>

1436
01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:39.540
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate temptation of pride.</v>

1437
01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.170
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1438
01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.350
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

1439
01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:46.610
<v Speaker 2>I try to be very careful of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very cognizant of that and,</v>

1440
01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:50.130
<v Speaker 2>and to keep a good eye on my,</v>

1441
01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:53.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1442
01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.560
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like these,</v>

1443
01:14:55.561 --> 01:14:56.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1444
01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.660
<v Speaker 1>when the emperors in the Roman Empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they wrote in their trials,</v>

1445
01:15:00.661 --> 01:15:04.290
<v Speaker 1>they had a slave behind them telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a mental moray.</v>

1446
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.491
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1447
01:15:05.491 --> 01:15:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1448
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:10.291
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1449
01:15:10.291 --> 01:15:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that idea and I liked the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of reminding yourself about,</v>

1450
01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:18.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death to keep humble,</v>

1451
01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:19.040
<v Speaker 2>keep yourself humble.</v>

1452
01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It sounds a little</v>

1453
01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.453
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death and sin because the other thing </v>

1454
01:15:25.981 --> 01:15:28.380
<v Speaker 2>that you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe this is the advantage that the</v>

1455
01:15:28.381 --> 01:15:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Catholics have over the Protestants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the Catholics at least put their</v>

1456
01:15:32.451 --> 01:15:37.220
<v Speaker 2>sins in front of them constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very analogous to what you just</v>

1457
01:15:37.221 --> 01:15:38.210
<v Speaker 2>described.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it,</v>

1458
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:39.710
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1459
01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:40.543
<v Speaker 2>I try to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very careful about paying attention to </v>

1460
01:15:45.381 --> 01:15:47.990
<v Speaker 2>all the things that I'm doing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have people,</v>

1461
01:15:47.991 --> 01:15:50.870
<v Speaker 2>my family and friends who are helping me</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1462
01:15:50.871 --> 01:15:51.704
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and cause it's a strange to call it a </v>

1463
01:15:55.231 --> 01:15:59.070
<v Speaker 2>strange situation to be in is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely scraping the surface.</v>

1464
01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:00.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1465
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to ask you,</v>

1466
01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:04.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1467
01:16:04.111 --> 01:16:05.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least one more.</v>

1468
01:16:05.581 --> 01:16:05.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1469
01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1470
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.433
<v Speaker 1>ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1471
01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.340
<v Speaker 1>talk to you for four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know you are a busy man.</v>

1472
01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>

1473
01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.870
<v Speaker 2>let's do one more question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can always talk again.</v>

1474
01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:15.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

1475
01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.760
<v Speaker 1>The Church of Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1476
01:16:18.761 --> 01:16:22.460
<v Speaker 1>it's our old a state church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1477
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:23.423
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's contemplating replacing the </v>

1478
01:16:25.441 --> 01:16:26.274
<v Speaker 1>gendered pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other guide for Church services and </v>

1479
01:16:28.531 --> 01:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>they've already starting to replace the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord.</v>

1480
01:16:31.671 --> 01:16:36.290
<v Speaker 1>And he and him with God in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>places are more inclusive.</v>

1481
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1482
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:38.770
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1483
01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:42.123
<v Speaker 2>the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the people who were running the </v>

1484
01:16:43.341 --> 01:16:46.790
<v Speaker 2>church have absolutely no idea about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what any of its doctrines meet.</v>

1485
01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that.</v>

1486
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:50.143
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is insistence in </v>

1487
01:16:51.171 --> 01:16:52.004
<v Speaker 2>Christianity on the Androgyny of Christ </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are elements of God that have </v>

1488
01:16:55.731 --> 01:16:59.000
<v Speaker 2>been portrayed as feminine like Sophia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is wisdom,</v>

1489
01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:04.530
<v Speaker 2>but you don't mess with those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't rewrite them like that.</v>

1490
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:09.090
<v Speaker 2>Not Not without having your soul tremble</v>
<v Speaker 2>and quake at your presumption</v>

1491
01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:14.940
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that you can just casually </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewrite these ancient texts.</v>

1492
01:17:14.941 --> 01:17:15.774
<v Speaker 2>It's like these people who rewrite </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairytales so that they're more in </v>

1493
01:17:18.761 --> 01:17:19.594
<v Speaker 2>keeping with modern sensibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like their soul unbelievably </v>

1494
01:17:24.131 --> 01:17:26.650
<v Speaker 2>intellectually narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that while it's,</v>

1495
01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:27.603
<v Speaker 2>it's positively say titanic in its,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in its overreach and I mean that in the </v>

1496
01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:33.460
<v Speaker 2>most technical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

1497
01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 2>it's they say titanic temptation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>untrammeled and unbound intellect.</v>

1498
01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:43.410
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what Milton warned against </v>
<v Speaker 2>in paradise lost.</v>

1499
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:45.303
<v Speaker 2>So it's a complete catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All it will do is speed the demolition </v>

1500
01:17:48.491 --> 01:17:50.420
<v Speaker 2>of the church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1501
01:17:50.421 --> 01:17:54.040
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's what it's aimed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually because of course the church is</v>

1502
01:17:54.041 --> 01:17:54.874
<v Speaker 2>just a patriarchal construct anyways and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's oppressive and so oppressed women </v>

1503
01:17:58.271 --> 01:17:59.104
<v Speaker 2>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite its assistant insistence that </v>

1504
01:18:00.941 --> 01:18:03.280
<v Speaker 2>men and women were both made in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>image of God.</v>

1505
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>churches pretty much do when it comes to</v>

1506
01:18:13.231 --> 01:18:14.400
<v Speaker 1>these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

1507
01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:17.350
<v Speaker 1>it's more political than a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>

1508
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's it.</v>

1509
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:20.910
<v Speaker 2>It's that when the church becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>

1510
01:18:20.911 --> 01:18:21.744

1512
01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:26.530
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

1513
01:18:26.531 --> 01:18:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I think I've got the most out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

1514
01:18:28.961 --> 01:18:29.794

<v Speaker 1>I could ask you a couple of followup </v>

1521

<v Speaker 1>questions to your book or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
