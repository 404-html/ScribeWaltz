1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 2>so today I'm going to tell you the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>three stories that I know.</v>

3
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.473
<v Speaker 2>I think these stories are absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenally potent and the reason for </v>

4
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:47.851
<v Speaker 2>that is that I think they illustrate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an extraordinarily powerful way</v>

5
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.593
<v Speaker 2>the nature of the processes that lead to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the establishment of Western democratic </v>

6
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:57.904
<v Speaker 2>ideals received whose work I rely on </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantially substantially to make the </v>

7
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:05.194
<v Speaker 2>following argument has taken Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>academic culture to task in a manner </v>

8
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:17.071
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't fully been revealed yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that like all human cultures,</v>

9
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 2>the West is parochial and narrow in its </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint,</v>

10
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.543
<v Speaker 2>and although over the last 300 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a substantial amount of </v>

11
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.413
<v Speaker 2>cross cultural intermingling and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential broadening of philosophical </v>

12
00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 2>and religious horizon broadening has not</v>
<v Speaker 2>been sufficiently complete.</v>

13
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.623
<v Speaker 2>If we build on the viewpoint that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been developing with you over the last </v>

14
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.913
<v Speaker 2>few courses and make the presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 2>that religious modes of thinking are </v>

15
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:50.560
<v Speaker 2>more phenomenological than they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational,</v>

16
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 2>which means that they deal more with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you experience say.</v>

17
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:54.724
<v Speaker 2>Then with the objective world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we look at archaic religious stories </v>

18
00:01:58.061 --> 00:01:58.894
<v Speaker 2>through that Lens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can start to open up and so </v>

19
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.160
<v Speaker 2>given that I want to open up three </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious stories to you today too,</v>

20
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 2>in depth and one only in passing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll return to it later.</v>

21
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll start with a Judaeo Christian myth </v>
<v Speaker 2>of genesis.</v>

22
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 2>When I say myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean untruth.</v>

23
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.173
<v Speaker 2>I mean a form of knowledge that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative instructor and predicated on </v>

24
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.983
<v Speaker 2>presumptions that aren't empirical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A myth describes processes of </v>

25
00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:33.904
<v Speaker 2>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A myth describes the process whereby </v>

26
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 2>elements of experience come into being </v>
<v Speaker 2>and transform.</v>

27
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.623
<v Speaker 2>The fundamental structural</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of genesis are the word of God </v>

28
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.610
<v Speaker 2>and chaos</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hebrew,</v>

29
00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:52.444
<v Speaker 2>words for chaos and waste our tail for </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and Tau who for waste and Tom in </v>

30
00:02:58.691 --> 00:02:59.524
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tohu who as well are very interesting </v>

31
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 2>words because you can track their </v>
<v Speaker 2>derivation historically and sometimes if</v>

32
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 2>you can track the derivation of words </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically,</v>

33
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>you can get some sense of the culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>mill you out of which the word sprang,</v>

34
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.343
<v Speaker 2>and we know what time at means because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have written records of a story that </v>

35
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.114
<v Speaker 2>involves a character named ty Matt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>time out as a dragon who lives at the </v>

36
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the ocean.</v>

37
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>In the oldest creation myth we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the Enuma Elish,</v>

38
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 2>the Sumerian creation myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sumeria,</v>

39
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.183
<v Speaker 2>Babylon acadia rightly regarded as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>birthplace of modern western </v>

40
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

41
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.520
<v Speaker 2>In Genesis two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>processes unite to produce being</v>

42
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.920
<v Speaker 2>the first of those processes are states </v>
<v Speaker 2>is chaos represented by tail Marto,</v>

43
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.913
<v Speaker 2>who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second of those processes is logos </v>

44
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.960
<v Speaker 2>and logos is another word that has an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily broad range of meaning.</v>

45
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.710
<v Speaker 2>It's generally transcribed in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian tradition has the word,</v>

46
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:13.764
<v Speaker 2>and it's identified with Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very peculiar identification </v>

47
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:20.430
<v Speaker 2>because it's the word of God that </v>
<v Speaker 2>creates order out of chaos,</v>

48
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.593
<v Speaker 2>and of course the word of God in Genesis</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a phenomena that predates the birth </v>

49
00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:29.040
<v Speaker 2>of Christ infinitely from a classical </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious perspective,</v>

50
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.003
<v Speaker 2>so the fact that the two beings are </v>
<v Speaker 2>identified as a great peculiarity and </v>

51
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:37.584
<v Speaker 2>also of great interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental story of genesis as </v>

52
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:41.814
<v Speaker 2>something like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's perhaps the most brilliant </v>

53
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:49.320
<v Speaker 2>contribution of Judeo Christian thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>to world history,</v>

54
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.513
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's total impact is virtually </v>

55
00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 2>incalculable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is this,</v>

56
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:57.454
<v Speaker 2>that chaos can be conceptualized as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that has an essentially </v>

57
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:01.104
<v Speaker 2>feminine aspect as a matrix and a matrix</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a structure from which other </v>

58
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:09.471
<v Speaker 2>structures emerge and the story in </v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis makes the hypothesis that logos,</v>

59
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.853
<v Speaker 2>which is the word of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a phenomena associated with speech and </v>

60
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:18.150
<v Speaker 2>communication and logic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logos,</v>

61
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.310
<v Speaker 2>logic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rationality,</v>

62
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.040
<v Speaker 2>courage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploration,</v>

63
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.420
<v Speaker 2>all combined into a single entity or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trait logos.</v>

64
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.660
<v Speaker 2>The combination of logos and chaos is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what brings order into being.</v>

65
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what the story in genesis means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an empirical description of the</v>

66
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:37.584
<v Speaker 2>origin of objects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a phenomenological description of </v>

67
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:45.591
<v Speaker 2>the origin of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea being that without the piercing</v>

68
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.333
<v Speaker 2>glance of whatever consciousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the background of experience </v>

69
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:53.880
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Matrix,</v>

70
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.743
<v Speaker 2>chaos cannot be conceptualized as real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes the interplay between the </v>

71
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.684
<v Speaker 2>feminine principle chaos and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine principle logos in order to </v>

72
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.004
<v Speaker 2>produce being</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that's of substantial importance </v>

73
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 2>when you give some consideration to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that immediately in genesis,</v>

74
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 2>after the establishment of livable </v>
<v Speaker 2>order,</v>

75
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.173
<v Speaker 2>the data Yahuah identifies as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual human being with logos right </v>

76
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.573
<v Speaker 2>made in God's image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the essential characteristic of </v>

77
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:28.484
<v Speaker 2>the human being and what that means is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the logo is that operates in human </v>

78
00:06:32.781 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this capacity to make order out</v>

79
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:36.074
<v Speaker 2>of chaos is identical to the principal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gives rise to the cosmos from a </v>

80
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:39.944
<v Speaker 2>mythological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it partakes of the daddy in a very </v>

81
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.024
<v Speaker 2>direct sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In so far as being itself is dependent </v>

82
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 2>on its operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

83
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.543
<v Speaker 2>it's still possible to claim given that </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective that a story with that sort </v>

84
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:01.610
<v Speaker 2>of structure is superstitious and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't bear any relationship.</v>

85
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:02.444
<v Speaker 2>To what actually constitutes reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to understand that that </v>

86
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:07.500
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old as it is,</v>

87
00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:08.334
<v Speaker 2>is predicated on older stories and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground that those older stories </v>

88
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 2>established that our entire concept of </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural rights rests.</v>

89
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.353
<v Speaker 2>So if you believe that natural rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an existence that's more than </v>

90
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 2>merely arbitrary,</v>

91
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.490
<v Speaker 2>the reason you believe that is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're predicate,</v>

92
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.490
<v Speaker 2>those rights are predicated on the ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are expressed in these myths.</v>

93
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we're going to go back in time to</v>

94
00:07:37.261 --> 00:07:38.094
<v Speaker 2>Sumeria and I'm going to show you how </v>
<v Speaker 2>this Sumerian creation myth lays itself </v>

95
00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:42.480
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

96
00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:47.481
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to describe to you the direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>political implications of the enumerated</v>

97
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.010
<v Speaker 2>list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sumerian creation myth,</v>

98
00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:50.844
<v Speaker 2>because the political implications of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that myth are well understood because </v>

99
00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:54.714
<v Speaker 2>the political structure of Sumeria was </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly associated with the structure </v>

100
00:07:58.411 --> 00:07:59.244
<v Speaker 2>of the myth because the Sumerian emperor</v>
<v Speaker 2>was regarded as the earthly </v>

101
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:08.400
<v Speaker 2>representative of the highest God in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian Pantheon,</v>

102
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.150
<v Speaker 2>whose name was Marta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in so far as you were emperor,</v>

103
00:08:12.151 --> 00:08:16.410
<v Speaker 2>the reason that you were emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what gave your sovereignty</v>

104
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.320
<v Speaker 2>legitimacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

105
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Because sovereignty has to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>legitimacy,</v>

106
00:08:21.031 --> 00:08:21.864
<v Speaker 2>otherwise there's constant revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What gave sovereignty legitimacy in </v>

107
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamia was the identification of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the emperor with Marta and that has,</v>

108
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.230
<v Speaker 2>that has certain implications for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emperor,</v>

109
00:08:31.231 --> 00:08:34.830
<v Speaker 2>which we'll discuss in some detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story starts like this,</v>

110
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.780
<v Speaker 2>you've got this dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talia,</v>

111
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tie them out is a great primordial</v>

112
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.773
<v Speaker 2>beast who lives at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean and the ocean is water and water </v>

113
00:08:51.421 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 2>is associated with the primal element in</v>
<v Speaker 2>archaic thinking,</v>

114
00:08:54.421 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 2>and I you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's reasons for that already.</v>

115
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.563
<v Speaker 2>If you viewed the transformation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>deserts as a consequence of rain can </v>

116
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 2>understand why water would be considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>the element that gives life,</v>

117
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:05.244
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the element that that brings life </v>

118
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:07.464
<v Speaker 2>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know from an evolutionary </v>

119
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:09.174
<v Speaker 2>perspective that that's accurate and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that we're 90 percent water and so </v>

120
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 2>to consider water.</v>

121
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 2>The primal element is no trivial </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>

122
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.813
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no less than presuming that the sun is </v>

123
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate source of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate God,</v>

124
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:22.764
<v Speaker 2>because the sun is the ultimate source </v>
<v Speaker 2>of life as far as we're concerned on </v>

125
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:26.071
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

126
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Because it's the source of all our </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

127
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 2>These aren't stupid concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

128
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:30.444
<v Speaker 2>so timeout is this horrible creature </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lurks at the bottom of the primal </v>

129
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.450
<v Speaker 2>element right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has a husband app suit.</v>

130
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.363
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the massive Batavia and creation myth </v>

131
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:40.284
<v Speaker 2>doesn't say much about Appsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only know that he's the male consort </v>

132
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.003
<v Speaker 2>of the dragon of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know from reading other sources </v>

133
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:52.551
<v Speaker 2>of mythology that the male consort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dragon of chaos generally represents</v>

134
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.613
<v Speaker 2>either logos or culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're gonna make the presupposition </v>

135
00:09:56.341 --> 00:10:01.341
<v Speaker 2>in this particular case that the husband</v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaos is order or culture.</v>

136
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.423
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the Mesopotamians don't say </v>

137
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:04.140
<v Speaker 2>much about that.</v>

138
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:04.973
<v Speaker 2>That that doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The development of the idea of apps who </v>

139
00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:08.144
<v Speaker 2>are order or culture doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't take new force until the </v>

140
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 2>ancient Egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about them today too.</v>

141
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:15.024
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so timeout naps who are locked into a </v>

142
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:21.310
<v Speaker 2>kind of sexual embrace according to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian creation,</v>

143
00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does that mean?</v>

144
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.963
<v Speaker 2>It kind of means two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that they're not really </v>

145
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 2>distinguishable because they're locked </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this embrace and it also means that</v>

146
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:31.254
<v Speaker 2>they're up to something creative because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the act of sexual congress in mythology </v>

147
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:36.144
<v Speaker 2>is most usefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is most frequently utilized as </v>

148
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:40.404
<v Speaker 2>representation of something creative or </v>
<v Speaker 2>as representation of the probability of </v>

149
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 2>some new form coming to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

150
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:48.564
<v Speaker 2>so cop suit and tie them out are locked </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this embrace in a state that other </v>

151
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 2>creation myths describe as egg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the pre cosmo Gonek egg,</v>

152
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:03.723
<v Speaker 2>there are intermingling gives rise to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the initial state of being according to </v>

153
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:09.710
<v Speaker 2>the Sumerians and the initial state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

154
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.323
<v Speaker 2>According to the Sumerians is </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized by the dominion of the </v>

155
00:11:13.731 --> 00:11:18.731
<v Speaker 2>elder gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These gods feeding none to bright make a</v>

156
00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:24.340
<v Speaker 2>tremendous amount of racket doing things</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

157
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.700
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean exactly?</v>

158
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.163
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

159
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 2>it means something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make a lot of racket and they cause</v>

160
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:35.450
<v Speaker 2>a lot of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make a lot of wind and all of their</v>

161
00:11:35.451 --> 00:11:37.790
<v Speaker 2>racket and trouble and wind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

162
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Rouses tire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

163
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.113
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

164
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means if you do things,</v>

165
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:45.834
<v Speaker 2>you get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means even if you're trying to solve </v>

166
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:48.924
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get into trouble because the </v>

167
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:51.144
<v Speaker 2>solution to a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chin tends to generate a whole bunch of </v>

168
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 2>new problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

169
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:55.084
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Hydra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what it means is that it's more or </v>

170
00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:02.521
<v Speaker 2>less fainted that any form of activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever</v>

171
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 2>is likely to produce the threat of </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe,</v>

172
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.853
<v Speaker 2>and of course we're absolutely keenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of that in the modern world </v>

173
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:18.901
<v Speaker 2>because were possessed by this sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all of our frenetic activity,</v>

174
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.104
<v Speaker 2>all of our frenetic motivated activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>is producing alterations in the world </v>

175
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:29.131
<v Speaker 2>order such that nature itself is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be destroyed and eliminate us,</v>

176
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.263
<v Speaker 2>and of course we're absolutely keenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of that in the modern world </v>

177
00:12:40.281 --> 00:12:45.281
<v Speaker 2>because were possessed by this sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all of our frenetic activity,</v>

178
00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:46.514
<v Speaker 2>all of our frenetic motivated activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>is producing alterations in the world </v>

179
00:12:50.511 --> 00:12:55.511
<v Speaker 2>order such that nature itself is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be destroyed and eliminate us.</v>

180
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.303
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's classic Sumerian fear and </v>

181
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.020
<v Speaker 2>nothing's changed in the last 5,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

182
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.123
<v Speaker 2>The Sumerians presumed that once the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elder gods were constructed and started </v>

183
00:13:07.701 --> 00:13:10.670
<v Speaker 2>moving around on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that their activity,</v>

184
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.760
<v Speaker 2>they're mindless activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because remember,</v>

185
00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:16.070
<v Speaker 2>these aren't well integrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational forces.</v>

186
00:13:16.071 --> 00:13:16.904
<v Speaker 2>They're more like primordial beasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>right there on the integrated activity </v>

187
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.400
<v Speaker 2>risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plunging everything back in chaos.</v>

188
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Well Tire Max,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the representative of chaos,</v>

189
00:13:27.861 --> 00:13:29.400
<v Speaker 2>this generative chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so what?</v>

190
00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:30.860
<v Speaker 2>At the Sumerian say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

191
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.753
<v Speaker 2>the elder gods caused a lot of racket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They move around the planet and they </v>

192
00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:40.601
<v Speaker 2>upset time at and she decides that </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough is enough and she's going to wipe</v>

193
00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:42.704
<v Speaker 2>them out.</v>

194
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.560
<v Speaker 2>So she's sitting at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean,</v>

195
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 2>fuming away as the elder gods go about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their business,</v>

196
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.750
<v Speaker 2>and then they take one step too many and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kill Appsu.</v>

197
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:57.763
<v Speaker 2>Who's her husband.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the Sumerian creation myth doesn't </v>

198
00:14:00.261 --> 00:14:01.094
<v Speaker 2>say much about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know that aps who is the male </v>

199
00:14:03.441 --> 00:14:05.840
<v Speaker 2>consort of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes it harder.</v>

200
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:10.460
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is the elder gods </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy order itself.</v>

201
00:14:10.461 --> 00:14:13.130
<v Speaker 2>They destroyed culture itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as you've destroyed culture,</v>

202
00:14:13.131 --> 00:14:13.964
<v Speaker 2>all hell breaks loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly what happens in the </v>

203
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:16.124
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian creation myths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tye Maddie merges just going to wipe </v>

204
00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:20.624
<v Speaker 2>everything out and the world will revert</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to its primordial non-existent </v>

205
00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:27.860
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the elder gods get wind of this,</v>

206
00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:28.694
<v Speaker 2>and of course they're just terrified </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they know that this thing that </v>

207
00:14:30.741 --> 00:14:32.840
<v Speaker 2>gave rise to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

208
00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:36.350
<v Speaker 2>the matrix of being can easily wipe them</v>
<v Speaker 2>out at a moment's notice,</v>

209
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.393
<v Speaker 2>and so despite the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>transpersonal and immortal and </v>

210
00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:43.550
<v Speaker 2>characterized by a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power in the face of absolute chaos,</v>

211
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.810
<v Speaker 2>they're insufficient.</v>

212
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Now this occurrence is extending over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>protracted period of time,</v>

213
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.343
<v Speaker 2>and as elder gods are threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also breeding and mating and </v>

214
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.810
<v Speaker 2>producing new forms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they produce a great,</v>

215
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 2>great grand son whose name is Marta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

216
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:02.090
<v Speaker 2>mark has a lot of very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes.</v>

217
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.750
<v Speaker 2>The attributes are described in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Enuma elish in the following manner.</v>

218
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:06.584
<v Speaker 2>So this is what [inaudible] father sees </v>
<v Speaker 2>when his wife Damn Kina gives birth to </v>

219
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he who's murdered,</v>

220
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 2>his father saw his son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he rejoiced.</v>

221
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 2>He beamed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His heart was filled with joy.</v>

222
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.500
<v Speaker 2>He distinguished him and conferred upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>him double equality with the gods.</v>

223
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:25.334
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the first indication that </v>

224
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 2>whatever Martik represents is something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's elevated beyond the normal status</v>

225
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:31.694
<v Speaker 2>of a primordial daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that he was highly exalted and </v>

226
00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:38.780
<v Speaker 2>surpassed them in everything artfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>arranged beyond comprehension,</v>

227
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 2>where his members not fit for human </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>

228
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 2>hard to look upon for where his eyes </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>

229
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:47.090
<v Speaker 2>his ears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when his lips move,</v>

230
00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:48.500
<v Speaker 2>fire blazed forth.</v>

231
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:49.543
<v Speaker 2>Each of his four years grew large and </v>
<v Speaker 2>likewise his eyes to see everything he </v>

232
00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:56.420
<v Speaker 2>was exalted among God's surpassing was </v>
<v Speaker 2>his form.</v>

233
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 2>His members were gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was surpassing in height.</v>

234
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Mary Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mary Youtube,</v>

235
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.860
<v Speaker 2>one of his names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son of the son,</v>

236
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:06.200
<v Speaker 2>God the son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God of the Gods.</v>

237
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Complex bit of poetry.</v>

238
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.540
<v Speaker 2>It says a bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

239
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:12.374
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever Martech is is the offspring of </v>

240
00:16:14.631 --> 00:16:17.690
<v Speaker 2>the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever Marta is,</v>

241
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 2>is characterized by high heightened </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness,</v>

242
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:20.894
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he has four years and four eyes </v>

243
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:22.454
<v Speaker 2>and they're large.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever Martech is characterized by as </v>

244
00:16:25.031 --> 00:16:28.490
<v Speaker 2>the status that surpasses that of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>father's.</v>

245
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Whatever he's characterized by is </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with the power of speech.</v>

246
00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Real power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when he speaks fire spurts.</v>

247
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Fourth Marta is also huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>

248
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:42.830
<v Speaker 2>he's associated in this particular poem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a Sun.</v>

249
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

250
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 2>the sun dominates consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

251
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Because we're conscious during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of our brain is visual Cortex,</v>

252
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:51.763
<v Speaker 2>so we're visual creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when the sunrises is when the day </v>

253
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:56.294
<v Speaker 2>begins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Martin is also associated with </v>

254
00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:58.934
<v Speaker 2>whatever dandy dominates the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the daddy of consciousness </v>

255
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.920
<v Speaker 2>and there's more to the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sun,</v>

256
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.783
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the sun is also something that </v>

257
00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:06.764
<v Speaker 2>rises and sets repeatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means that the dandy that </v>

258
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:13.820
<v Speaker 2>dominates consciousness is characterized</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a cyclical nature.</v>

259
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.020
<v Speaker 2>That's a son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Myth,</v>

260
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:16.183
<v Speaker 2>sunrises in the morning renewed as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of fighting a terrible </v>

261
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:20.534
<v Speaker 2>battle in the night with the enemies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's associated with </v>

262
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Classic Solar Myth,</v>

263
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.170
<v Speaker 2>so absolutely entire Matt give rise to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world of the gods,</v>

264
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.430
<v Speaker 2>the activity of the world of Gods </v>
<v Speaker 2>reawakens timeout.</v>

265
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.713
<v Speaker 2>She decides to destroy everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at that moment the gods give birth </v>

266
00:17:45.881 --> 00:17:46.960
<v Speaker 2>to mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

267
00:17:46.961 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 2>that's a typical motif which is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>is born at the time of maximal crisis,</v>

268
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.600
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is in part it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

269
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your culture is dealing well with the</v>

270
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:01.080
<v Speaker 2>forces of the unknown so that everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>is static,</v>

271
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.430
<v Speaker 2>static but productive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the problems themselves don't arise.</v>

272
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.140
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

273
00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to confront the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>

274
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It's only when crisis beckons that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth of the hero is necessary.</v>

275
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Marta constitutes the birth of the hero </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they say,</v>

276
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:19.314
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

277
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.153
<v Speaker 2>we're in real trouble unless someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes out there and confronts tire Matt </v>

278
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Straight on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to wipe everything out.</v>

279
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a dangerous and terrifying job,</v>

280
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 2>but somebody has to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mark says,</v>

281
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's no problem,</v>

282
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.444
<v Speaker 2>but I got a few rules here and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first rule I'm in charge from here </v>

283
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:41.640
<v Speaker 2>on forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean exactly?</v>

284
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.143
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

285
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 2>these archaic stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our policy in our policy mic in Northrup</v>

286
00:18:51.101 --> 00:18:51.934
<v Speaker 2>fries terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that means is that they can be </v>

287
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.670
<v Speaker 2>misread validly had multiple levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis simultaneously.</v>

288
00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:58.683
<v Speaker 2>And so one thing it means is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the two year old child who's </v>

289
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:07.720
<v Speaker 2>essentially under the dominion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>assorted primordial Gods and Goddesses,</v>

290
00:19:07.721 --> 00:19:09.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aggression,</v>

291
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.310
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>panic,</v>

292
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.430
<v Speaker 2>and according to Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain degree of sexual aggression,</v>

293
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.073
<v Speaker 2>the child moves from domination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from motivated state to domination for </v>

294
00:19:23.041 --> 00:19:23.874
<v Speaker 2>motivated state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it isn't until the age of three and </v>

295
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:30.681
<v Speaker 2>four when under the pressure applied by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social world and as a consequence of</v>

296
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:31.704
<v Speaker 2>the maturation of the prefrontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which matures throughout childhood and </v>

297
00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:36.594
<v Speaker 2>adolescence and doesn't reach its final </v>
<v Speaker 2>form until perhaps into the early </v>

298
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 2>twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of those fundamental motivational us</v>

299
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:46.740
<v Speaker 2>to start taking on a structured </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to one another,</v>

300
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:52.010
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that once your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as your personality becomes integrated,</v>

301
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.053
<v Speaker 2>a single motive force forward has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring all of these underlying </v>

302
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:01.080
<v Speaker 2>motivational systems into some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>harmonious arrangement.</v>

303
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's,</v>

304
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.230
<v Speaker 2>let's see what the Sumerians are doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

305
00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:05.011
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

306
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing psychology.</v>

307
00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:11.550
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given the dominion of the elder gods,</v>

308
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 2>the indisputable dominion of the elder </v>
<v Speaker 2>gods instincts.</v>

309
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Who should rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

310
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.293
<v Speaker 2>What should be in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you construct the hierarchy of </v>

311
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 2>values and then more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee,</v>

312
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 2>when you integrate a state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what?</v>

313
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:28.980
<v Speaker 2>The mesopotamians dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

314
00:20:28.981 --> 00:20:31.170
<v Speaker 2>The first great civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

315
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.333
<v Speaker 2>The first time hundreds of tribes were </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammered into some sort of stable </v>

316
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:40.500
<v Speaker 2>hierarchical order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you represent that order?</v>

317
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.240
<v Speaker 2>So Marta gets his act together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gods all meet in a huge chamber.</v>

318
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 2>They elect him king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they prepare them for battle.</v>

319
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.233
<v Speaker 2>When the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the father's beheld the power of his </v>

320
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:57.364
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were glad and then homage saying </v>

321
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Martin is king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bestowed upon them a sceptre,</v>

322
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.733
<v Speaker 2>a throne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a royal robe that gave him an </v>

323
00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:05.194
<v Speaker 2>irresistible weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fighting the enemy saying Golan cutoff </v>

324
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.650
<v Speaker 2>the life of Tire Matt may the winds </v>
<v Speaker 2>carry her blood out of the way.</v>

325
00:21:11.651 --> 00:21:12.484
<v Speaker 2>Places after the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father's had determined the destiny </v>

326
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:16.864
<v Speaker 2>of Martech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They set them on the road the way to </v>

327
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:19.840
<v Speaker 2>success and attainment.</v>

328
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.820
<v Speaker 2>So then he goes to the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness,</v>

329
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and confronts tire.</v>

330
00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:27.304
<v Speaker 2>Matt</v>
<v Speaker 2>accuses her of treachery and challenges </v>

331
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:32.950
<v Speaker 2>are to battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When ty Imad heard this,</v>

332
00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:35.680
<v Speaker 2>she became like one in a frenzy and lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>her reason.</v>

333
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 2>She cried out loud and furiously to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very roots or two legs,</v>

334
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:40.504
<v Speaker 2>shook back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She recited an incantation repeatedly </v>

335
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.510
<v Speaker 2>casting her spell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As for the gods of battle,</v>

336
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 2>they sharpen their weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiamat and Marduk the wisest of the gods</v>

337
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.053
<v Speaker 2>advanced against one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pressed onto single combat and </v>

338
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:57.910
<v Speaker 2>approached for battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

339
00:21:57.911 --> 00:21:58.744
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things don't go out so well with </v>

340
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.630
<v Speaker 2>timeout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From this point forward,</v>

341
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:05.510
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that Martech does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it encapsulate her and then net,</v>

342
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphor because that's essentially what</v>

343
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 2>human beings do when they encounter the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown,</v>

344
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:12.664
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They encapsulated in an explanatory </v>

345
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:15.634
<v Speaker 2>network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a way of binding up the the </v>

346
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.680
<v Speaker 2>anomaly or the unknown and giving it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantive form.</v>

347
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Then he cuts her into pieces and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes the world out of her pieces.</v>

348
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.693
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of Martin's names is he who makes </v>

349
00:22:34.361 --> 00:22:37.770
<v Speaker 2>ingenious things as a consequence of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>combat with tire mapped.</v>

350
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>

351
00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 2>very interesting because what it means </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the Samaritans are presenting in</v>

352
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical forum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The notion that when the chips are down,</v>

353
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:48.034
<v Speaker 2>the survival of being depends on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity of whatever Martech represents </v>

354
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:55.720
<v Speaker 2>the solar God to encounter the Matrix of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

355
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.300
<v Speaker 2>to cut it into pieces and to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

356
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.190
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it in those terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very,</v>

357
00:23:00.191 --> 00:23:01.720
<v Speaker 2>very straightforward story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

358
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:03.520
<v Speaker 2>It's basically the story of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

359
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.953
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally the story of human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we in the words of a famous </v>

360
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary psychologist whose name </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely escapes me.</v>

361
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.280
<v Speaker 2>We occupied the cognitive niche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

362
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.293
<v Speaker 2>Our motive being his creativity and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face of the unknown and when </v>

363
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:24.691
<v Speaker 2>chaos threatens the established motive </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

364
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.283
<v Speaker 2>It's necessary for us to put our </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity into action and to carve out </v>

365
00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:30.154
<v Speaker 2>new territory or territory as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of encounter with the </v>

366
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:34.660
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

367
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we can take the world apart with</v>

368
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:38.134
<v Speaker 2>our hands and put it together in new </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways and then we can scold what we've </v>

369
00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:42.034
<v Speaker 2>done verbally and we can transmit it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another person and then they can do the </v>

370
00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:45.694
<v Speaker 2>same thing and we're all doing this all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and we're all telling each </v>

371
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:49.124
<v Speaker 2>other how we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how the embodiment of logos </v>

372
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.693
<v Speaker 2>in the human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is precisely equivalent to the </v>

373
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:55.094
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian notion of Martech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's precisely how it is that we're </v>

374
00:23:57.861 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Speaker 2>constantly capable of redeeming the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

375
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.353
<v Speaker 2>And that's why you make resolutions at </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Year's because the new you is </v>

376
00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:11.860
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be born at the new year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

377
00:24:11.861 --> 00:24:14.080
<v Speaker 2>So what are the Mesopotamians do it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>new year,</v>

378
00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.490
<v Speaker 2>they take their king and they bring them</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the city.</v>

379
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to understand that outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city is chaos,</v>

380
00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because these are city states.</v>

381
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.590
<v Speaker 2>When you go outside the dominion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>

382
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.543
<v Speaker 2>you're in chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the priest makes the Emperor </v>

383
00:24:34.271 --> 00:24:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Neil and takes all his marks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have status off him.</v>

384
00:24:37.781 --> 00:24:38.614
<v Speaker 2>So He's reduced to his assets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally bereft of his social </v>

385
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:43.983
<v Speaker 2>persona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he slaps him with a glove and </v>

386
00:24:46.481 --> 00:24:50.530
<v Speaker 2>humiliates him and the king is reform </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest to recount his since right?</v>

387
00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Everything he did in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't up to standard so to speak.</v>

388
00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:55.323
<v Speaker 2>And you can see how that'd be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful thing to have somebody who's in </v>

389
00:24:57.641 --> 00:24:59.380
<v Speaker 2>power do on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

390
00:24:59.381 --> 00:25:00.214
<v Speaker 2>Because it reminds them that they're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact subject to a transpersonal </v>

391
00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:06.970
<v Speaker 2>structure who's nature isn't precisely </v>
<v Speaker 2>evident,</v>

392
00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:11.740
<v Speaker 2>but is nonetheless there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the case act like Marduk or all</v>

393
00:25:11.741 --> 00:25:14.080
<v Speaker 2>hell will break loose and demolish your </v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom,</v>

394
00:25:14.081 --> 00:25:16.570
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it's true now as it was then.</v>

395
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:21.100
<v Speaker 2>So the emperor gets humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He asked to recount his sins,</v>

396
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:22.840
<v Speaker 2>then he's locked up.</v>

397
00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Then he reenacts the battle with Tire </v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

398
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.500
<v Speaker 2>and when he emerges victorious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's locked up with a ritual prostitute,</v>

399
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.780
<v Speaker 2>a higher duel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they mate.</v>

400
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

401
00:25:39.881 --> 00:25:40.714
<v Speaker 2>the higher duel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ritual prostitute represents tire </v>

402
00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:44.021
<v Speaker 2>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

403
00:25:44.021 --> 00:25:46.840
<v Speaker 2>why the hell would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because timeouts a dragon,</v>

404
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:47.703
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A horrible man eating dragon that lives </v>

405
00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:50.314
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is to say that in any encounter </v>

406
00:25:53.201 --> 00:25:55.810
<v Speaker 2>with the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as difficult,</v>

407
00:25:55.811 --> 00:25:56.644
<v Speaker 2>traumatic and violent as that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also the possibility for </v>

408
00:25:59.651 --> 00:26:02.770
<v Speaker 2>something creative to emerge as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>

409
00:26:02.771 --> 00:26:03.604
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's out of the unknown that we </v>

410
00:26:04.721 --> 00:26:05.950
<v Speaker 2>mind new information.</v>

411
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:09.933
<v Speaker 2>So in so far as the Mesopotamian emperor</v>
<v Speaker 2>acted out the role of Marta than he was </v>

412
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.543
<v Speaker 2>a good emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he deserved his sovereignty and </v>

413
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.580
<v Speaker 2>literally as well as figuratively in so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as he did play that role,</v>

414
00:26:21.581 --> 00:26:23.950
<v Speaker 2>then the society was going through </v>
<v Speaker 2>remain not only stable,</v>

415
00:26:23.951 --> 00:26:24.784
<v Speaker 2>but constantly updated because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in this constant creative </v>

416
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.793
<v Speaker 2>contact with the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aided and abetted by his attempts to </v>

417
00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:34.774
<v Speaker 2>remember his own inadequacies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses and to do something about </v>

418
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:38.800
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

419
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:39.643
<v Speaker 2>So that's a pretty interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it gets even more interesting when </v>

420
00:26:41.831 --> 00:26:42.664
<v Speaker 2>you start to understand the Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian creation myth is assimilated </v>

421
00:26:46.441 --> 00:26:47.274
<v Speaker 2>to the Sumerian creation myth by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>union of the notions of chaos and tire </v>

422
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.423
<v Speaker 2>matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the logo's in Judeo Christian </v>

423
00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:55.644
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the word of God that produces order out </v>

424
00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:02.121
<v Speaker 2>of chaos is also essentially equivalent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least metaphorically speaking,</v>

425
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.790
<v Speaker 2>to whatever Martech represents in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sumerian creation myth.</v>

426
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 2>And we know that our relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Enuma elish is obscured by time,</v>

427
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:11.694
<v Speaker 2>but our relationship with the stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lay out the fundamental </v>

428
00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 2>substructure of Western culture is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>so ameliorated.</v>

429
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Even though we may not believe them </v>
<v Speaker 2>explicitly anymore,</v>

430
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 2>they still sit at the basis of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
