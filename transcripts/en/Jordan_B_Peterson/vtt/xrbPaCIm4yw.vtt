1
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.583
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that people are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much confused by in the modern world is </v>

2
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.903
<v Speaker 1>what our tech people meant by Gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because whatever the day </v>

3
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.313
<v Speaker 1>these were that had the motive force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that archaic people attributed to the </v>

4
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Gods seem to have disappeared in modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

5
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.993
<v Speaker 1>Now the young end hypothesis is that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they turned into psychological </v>

6
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>traits fundamentally or motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

7
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>So what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what archaic societies would describe as</v>

8
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:17.494
<v Speaker 1>Gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would describe as motivational </v>

9
00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

10
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Venus is a goddess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goddess of love,</v>

11
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:27.811
<v Speaker 1>and we would associate her power with </v>
<v Speaker 1>love and sex fundamentally.</v>

12
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.373
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that that's an reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>association from the archaic standpoint </v>

13
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.773
<v Speaker 1>is because the mode of quality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes up what Venus represents is </v>

14
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:40.084
<v Speaker 1>transpersonal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means it's not limited to one </v>

15
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:43.024
<v Speaker 1>person and it's immortal in that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motive force that characterizes sexual </v>

16
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:49.324
<v Speaker 1>affiliation exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not a single individual </v>

17
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:52.174
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>

18
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's transpersonal has the force of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality because if you fall in love,</v>

19
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you're motivated by a certain set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards and perspectives,</v>

20
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:03.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're gripped by beauty,</v>

21
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:04.384
<v Speaker 1>say or if you're gripped by lust that </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposes a particular view of the world </v>

22
00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>on you and impels your action sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite your will.</v>

23
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be equivalent from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic perspective to possession.</v>

24
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.703
<v Speaker 1>And it's clearly the case that archaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies who were engaged in warfare </v>

25
00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:24.400
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would conduct rituals to ensure that the</v>

26
00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:25.234
<v Speaker 1>warriors that made up their societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in fact possessed by the correct </v>

27
00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:29.740
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So might be Mars,</v>

28
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Roman God of war,</v>

29
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.283
<v Speaker 1>so that on the battlefield they </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibited the proper characteristics of </v>

30
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 1>somebody who was in a battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

31
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think rage,</v>

32
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.143
<v Speaker 1>sole possession by the god of war would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be equivalent to this possession by a </v>

33
00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:43.870
<v Speaker 1>state of rage.</v>

34
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite that simple.</v>

35
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It isn't the only that archaic people </v>
<v Speaker 1>externalized motive forces and gave them</v>

36
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 1>the status of Daddy's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they did was more complex than not.</v>

37
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can understand that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit better if you start to,</v>

38
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.890
<v Speaker 1>if you start to give some thought to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern behavioral notion of the stimulus</v>

39
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.393
<v Speaker 1>and the stimulus is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very weird concept because the behavior </v>

40
00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:07.464
<v Speaker 1>is who weren't interested in taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart what was inside the brain would </v>

41
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>attribute motive force to the stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>They'd say if you present an animal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stimulus,</v>

43
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.843
<v Speaker 1>he will therefore act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that meant that the behaviors were </v>

44
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:19.354
<v Speaker 1>making the presupposition that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motive power resided in some manner in </v>

45
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>the stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would they think like that?</v>

47
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:27.094
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an archaic mode of thought in a </v>

48
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine a child saying,</v>

49
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.553
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my friends today made me really </v>

50
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

51
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.793
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which means that the child is </v>

52
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:37.264
<v Speaker 1>essentially conflating his or her own </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal emotional state with the </v>

53
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>proximal stimulus that gave rise to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

54
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:44.194
<v Speaker 1>And you see complex associations like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that taking place with regards to the </v>

55
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>apprehension of beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

56
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:49.744
<v Speaker 1>because beauty is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex and difficult to localize </v>

57
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're very attracted to someone,</v>

58
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>are you attracted by them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:58.624
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you are because they are the </v>

60
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in another sense you're not at all.</v>

61
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.104
<v Speaker 1>Because what's happening is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged as much in the attraction as </v>

62
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>anything that's motivating you from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside world.</v>

63
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>And I think that partly accounts for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your sense of foolishness,</v>

64
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:13.294
<v Speaker 1>especially if the person that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to doesn't return your </v>

65
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

66
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you know that from your perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

67
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>you're attracted and dominated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>

68
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:25.324
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know entirely that easy as it is to </v>

69
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 1>presume it's them and their faults say </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much it all has to do with you.</v>

70
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.873
<v Speaker 1>So in the modern world where we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to separate out the object and the </v>

71
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>motive force of the object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daddies have sort of moved inside of</v>

72
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:42.724
<v Speaker 1>us and becomes psychological forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can understand if you think </v>

73
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:46.084
<v Speaker 1>about it in this manner that things </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't so clear prior to the dawn of </v>

74
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>the empirical age.</v>

75
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.973
<v Speaker 1>That gives you a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>background with regards to what the </v>

76
00:04:58.501 --> 00:04:59.334
<v Speaker 1>notion of Daddy meant to archaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies who still utilize those </v>

77
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>notions as explore explanatory terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:10.890
<v Speaker 1>So we know that if you're caught up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these little,</v>

79
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world games that you may be motivated by</v>

80
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:16.290
<v Speaker 1>something very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fundamental,</v>

81
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tendency that transcends you,</v>

82
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:19.494
<v Speaker 1>the tendency to propagate yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Freud's fundamental motivational </v>

83
00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>level sexual affiliation or the tendency</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain yourself.</v>

84
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Those you could say are the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>gods of existence,</v>

85
00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:34.950
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental driving force has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's there.</v>

86
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It's the interaction of those two forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>over great periods of time that produced</v>

87
00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>the great diversity of life and human </v>
<v Speaker 1>life that we see before us.</v>

88
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And each of those fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most fundamental of gods have their</v>

89
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.460
<v Speaker 1>differentiated many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to speak.</v>

90
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:54.420
<v Speaker 1>So that well engaged in the met had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal of self preservation.</v>

91
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>You Act out plots of hunger and plots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirst,</v>

92
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.274
<v Speaker 1>and he moved from cold to hot or from </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart to call depending on your </v>

93
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:03.690
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.233
<v Speaker 1>on your particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the particular temperature of your </v>

95
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>surroundings or with regards to self </v>
<v Speaker 1>propagation.</v>

96
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.623
<v Speaker 1>You're attracted to people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>repelled by them for reasons that are </v>

97
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>frequently absolutely beyond your </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension,</v>

98
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just found out this week,</v>

99
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>and this is absolutely staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you,</v>

100
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.783
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you run an experiment on a group of </v>

101
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:25.304
<v Speaker 1>women and you track their menstrual </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle and then you give them t shirts </v>

102
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:29.444
<v Speaker 1>that men have worn to smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that women who are operating like the </v>

103
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>smell of symmetrical men better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>asymmetrical men.</v>

104
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.333
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because symmetrical </v>

105
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:39.194
<v Speaker 1>men are probably more healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a good example of how the </v>

106
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>motive forces that configure your world </v>
<v Speaker 1>are dependent on instinctual forces that</v>

107
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:48.404
<v Speaker 1>are not only beyond your consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're beyond even at the moment </v>

108
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>any of our explicit explanations.</v>

109
00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.401
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:00.234
<v Speaker 1>another finding that's very similar that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came across recently turns out that </v>

111
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.773
<v Speaker 1>mice will not mate with mice that has rh</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood factors that are likely to </v>

112
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:11.180
<v Speaker 1>produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

113
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 1>unfit offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

114
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.800
<v Speaker 1>the more closely genetically related the</v>
<v Speaker 1>RH factors,</v>

115
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.600
<v Speaker 1>the more likely there is to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a catastrophe with regards to offspring.</v>

117
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And the mice seem to detect the rh </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor by smell.</v>

118
00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:26.664
<v Speaker 1>So recently this was run by with women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is also the case that women </v>

119
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:30.644
<v Speaker 1>prefer man who's rh factors are at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal distance from them in terms of </v>

120
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:34.274
<v Speaker 1>smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is some example of how these </v>

121
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:36.854
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably archaic systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause like the olfactory systems are </v>

122
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:40.184
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce alterations in Worldview at a </v>

123
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 1>level that's massively below </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

124
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.533
<v Speaker 1>So underneath your cortical shell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is tonically inhibiting all your </v>

125
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.474
<v Speaker 1>emotional and motivational systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies all these motivational and </v>

126
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:00.374
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems and they have branches</v>
<v Speaker 1>that grow up into the cortex and they </v>

127
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 1>have the capacity to control your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior completely involuntary.</v>

128
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're gripped by fear,</v>

129
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're gripped by fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

130
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to overcome that </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily.</v>

131
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.650
<v Speaker 1>And at least initially you won't be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

132
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.780
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that when the chips are </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

133
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 1>the underlying motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when emotional systems have control.</v>

134
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then what happens from that </v>

135
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:25.514
<v Speaker 1>perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what happens when you encounter </v>

136
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:29.770
<v Speaker 1>something you don't understand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the best way to explain it,</v>

137
00:08:29.771 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 1>it's something like generalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>disinhibition,</v>

138
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.463
<v Speaker 1>which is that all your underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational and emotional systems are </v>

139
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 1>more or less disinhibited </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

140
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.303
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be maximally prepared to do </v>

141
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:43.484
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell is necessary to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're somewhere that you don't </v>

142
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 1>understand and because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that thing is going to be,</v>

143
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.113
<v Speaker 1>all your systems go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when psychologists talk about </v>

144
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an abysmal word,</v>

145
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 1>it means everything and nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When psychologists talk about stress,</v>

146
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:02.720
<v Speaker 1>what they mean is generalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>disinhibition of emotion and motivation.</v>

147
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Then you come to the case of ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

148
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.450
<v Speaker 1>What are the things Lee Outta points </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

149
00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:14.210
<v Speaker 1>which I think is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really phenomenal.</v>

150
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.420
<v Speaker 1>The story I'm going to tell you right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now was essentially revealed in Egyptian</v>

151
00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:20.384
<v Speaker 1>culture at the dawn of the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than developing over the course </v>

152
00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:24.434
<v Speaker 1>of the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Egyptians had a revelation right </v>

153
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.853
<v Speaker 1>immediately that the most fundamental of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gods was the one who created as a </v>

154
00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:35.780
<v Speaker 1>consequence of his tongue and his speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much akin to the</v>

155
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.443
<v Speaker 1>Sumerian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With regards to Marta can also till </v>

156
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.220
<v Speaker 1>later Judeo Christian ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the story.</v>

157
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 1>There's four players in this tram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

158
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.230
<v Speaker 1>There's Ocirus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

159
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.213
<v Speaker 1>Isis.</v>

160
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

161
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 1>horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their son and Seth.</v>

162
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>And Seth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

163
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Sarah says evil brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

164
00:09:57.751 --> 00:09:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

165
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.300
<v Speaker 1>cirrus was a remarkable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the founder of the Egyptian state</v>

166
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:04.884
<v Speaker 1>from the mythological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So kind of like Romulus and Remus for </v>

167
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a myth or like George Washington for the</v>

168
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.583
<v Speaker 1>u s right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mythologized figure who represented </v>

169
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.590
<v Speaker 1>all of the Pharaohs and people for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

170
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 1>who'd actually constructed the Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

171
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cirrus farther of Egypt,</v>

172
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

173
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's is Kinda old and little archaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe a little bit see now,</v>

174
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 1>and even possibly a little bit naive in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

175
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even no matter how great you were in </v>

176
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>your youth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as time goes on,</v>

177
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:32.634
<v Speaker 1>you lose contact with environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations and the old rules that </v>

178
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 1>you live by or not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicable to the present.</v>

179
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 1>And some of those things that you ignore</v>
<v Speaker 1>become paramount of importance,</v>

180
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 1>importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that ocirus has an evil</v>

181
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:46.764
<v Speaker 1>brother Seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Seth eventually turns into Satan as </v>

182
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:51.060
<v Speaker 1>mythology develops through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>

183
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 1>And Seth is a nasty guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

184
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:54.384
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

185
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

186
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.213
<v Speaker 1>What he wants more than anything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeserved dominion over the Egyptian </v>

187
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

188
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's because he's not paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

189
00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 1>And because he isn't sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognizant any more of the power of evil,</v>

190
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.383
<v Speaker 1>more or less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignores his evil brother who in turn </v>

191
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.413
<v Speaker 1>chop some into pieces and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributes his pieces all over the </v>

192
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

193
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't he just kill up?</v>

194
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.471
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

195
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>you'd think chopping them up would kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

196
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:28.560
<v Speaker 1>but he's a god and you can't just kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

197
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.550
<v Speaker 1>The reason in mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see this in movies as well,</v>

198
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:33.384
<v Speaker 1>where the villain never quite die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the hero never quite dies is because </v>

199
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.103
<v Speaker 1>even if you eliminate individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiments of what those figures </v>

200
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:40.614
<v Speaker 1>represent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new embodiments manifest themselves </v>

201
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:43.104
<v Speaker 1>virtually immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things mythology is quite </v>

202
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:47.550
<v Speaker 1>clear about is that you never win a </v>
<v Speaker 1>final battle with evil.</v>

203
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a prominent property of the world.</v>

204
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.380
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seth hacks up.</v>

205
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's spreads them all over the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh Oh,</v>

206
00:12:01.441 --> 00:12:02.274
<v Speaker 1>Sarah sends up living a kind of shadowy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nebulous ghostlike existence down in </v>

207
00:12:06.231 --> 00:12:09.500
<v Speaker 1>the underworld and seth becomes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruler of the state.</v>

208
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.750
<v Speaker 1>A nasty story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

209
00:12:12.751 --> 00:12:13.241
<v Speaker 1>bud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

210
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:17.150
<v Speaker 1>cirrus has isis as a wife now isis had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge cult.</v>

211
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.613
<v Speaker 1>She was a powerful goddess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddess of the underworld are kind of </v>

212
00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:25.460
<v Speaker 1>combination of Kelly and Diana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

213
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:30.080
<v Speaker 1>capable of tremendous destructive power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the source of all good things.</v>

214
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.943
<v Speaker 1>Something very much like tire map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Isis got wind of her husband's </v>

215
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.080
<v Speaker 1>disintegration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

216
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.093
<v Speaker 1>and she went searching around Egypt till</v>
<v Speaker 1>she found his fellas and with that she </v>

217
00:12:44.211 --> 00:12:46.640
<v Speaker 1>makes herself pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

218
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.760
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means something like this.</v>

219
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 1>The collapse of any great order</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings with it new potential.</v>

220
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.363
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism has way over forms of </v>

221
00:13:02.001 --> 00:13:03.380
<v Speaker 1>government like communism.</v>

222
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.353
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism has mechanisms in place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow large structures that are no </v>

223
00:13:09.681 --> 00:13:12.260
<v Speaker 1>longer needing their function to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse,</v>

224
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.333
<v Speaker 1>but frequently when they collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they disintegrate into </v>

225
00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:16.161
<v Speaker 1>dust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

226
00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:19.940
<v Speaker 1>They disintegrate into sub components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

227
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.983
<v Speaker 1>many of which then come to terms with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the order has collapsed </v>

228
00:13:25.401 --> 00:13:26.234
<v Speaker 1>and build something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't get rid of culture so </v>

229
00:13:28.701 --> 00:13:30.230
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can hack it up into bits.</v>

230
00:13:30.231 --> 00:13:31.790
<v Speaker 1>You could disembody it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

231
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.180
<v Speaker 1>You can spread it all over the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could introduce chaos into it,</v>

232
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.223
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that has the potential </v>

233
00:13:39.831 --> 00:13:42.560
<v Speaker 1>of new birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Phoenix rising from the ashes.</v>

234
00:13:42.561 --> 00:13:43.730
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>

235
00:13:43.731 --> 00:13:46.610
<v Speaker 1>who's the matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's tire Matt Gets,</v>

236
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah says fellas,</v>

237
00:13:47.931 --> 00:13:51.950
<v Speaker 1>which is the container of the germ of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of culture,</v>

238
00:13:51.951 --> 00:13:52.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the,</v>

239
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.863
<v Speaker 1>the phenomena that's capable of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seminal idea and she makes herself </v>

240
00:13:57.291 --> 00:13:58.124
<v Speaker 1>pregnant and she gives birth to horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the long lost son of the rightful </v>

241
00:14:02.781 --> 00:14:03.380
<v Speaker 1>king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

242
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.560
<v Speaker 1>A very typical mythological motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

243
00:14:06.561 --> 00:14:07.394
<v Speaker 1>so porous is alienated from the kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another very common </v>

244
00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:12.950
<v Speaker 1>mythological motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

245
00:14:12.951 --> 00:14:16.160
<v Speaker 1>like how King Arthur for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is raised by commoners.</v>

246
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.650
<v Speaker 1>This same story pops up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

247
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the story of Christ,</v>

248
00:14:20.331 --> 00:14:22.670
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Christ has heavenly parents.</v>

249
00:14:22.671 --> 00:14:23.504
<v Speaker 1>But then he also has his kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary parents and it's a very common </v>

250
00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:27.331
<v Speaker 1>motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

251
00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:28.164
<v Speaker 1>so horace grows out outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical structure of the Egyptian </v>

252
00:14:33.621 --> 00:14:34.454
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is tilted terribly towards evil </v>

253
00:14:36.921 --> 00:14:39.380
<v Speaker 1>because seth is dominated because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>

254
00:14:39.381 --> 00:14:40.214
<v Speaker 1>was too blind to his evil brother to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take appropriate defensive actions and </v>

255
00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:44.354
<v Speaker 1>he grows to maturity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he decides like all rightful </v>

256
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.900
<v Speaker 1>sons of the long lost king to reclaim </v>
<v Speaker 1>his heritage.</v>

257
00:14:50.901 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 1>So he goes back to Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

258
00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And he has this vicious battle with seth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the process,</v>

259
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.360
<v Speaker 1>SEF tares out one of his eyes.</v>

260
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:00.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

261
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's an indication of just exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>how devastating a battle with the forces</v>

262
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 1>of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

263
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:06.764
<v Speaker 1>precisely are they represent a critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat to the integrity of </v>

264
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:11.690
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

265
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 1>That's why he loses an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

266
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:14.594
<v Speaker 1>luckily enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horace has got his act together and he </v>

267
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 1>does defeat seth and he banishes him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets the eye back and then you think,</v>

268
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

269
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Pop the eye back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become emperor,</v>

270
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:26.594
<v Speaker 1>everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's backtrack a little bit and </v>

271
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:30.260
<v Speaker 1>think about this politically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

272
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians had this really weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

273
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.583
<v Speaker 1>They had the idea that the living </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharaoh was the living pharaoh and the </v>

274
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 1>dead pharaoh at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes no sense rationally,</v>

275
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:42.104
<v Speaker 1>but it makes a lot of sense from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative perspective because what they </v>

276
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:46.490
<v Speaker 1>were saying is something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

277
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you got to think that when you become </v>
<v Speaker 1>king or when you become president,</v>

278
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:50.834
<v Speaker 1>or when you take on a role of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute magnitude that then you're </v>

279
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:55.214
<v Speaker 1>partly you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also partly this role and </v>

280
00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 1>there's really no way out of that.</v>

281
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.083
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the role is composed of the </v>

282
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable weight of the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition that you're representing.</v>

283
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:05.624
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's true for being king and for </v>

284
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:08.234
<v Speaker 1>being president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also true if you become a </v>

285
00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 1>doctor or a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of specialized occupation,</v>

286
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 1>it's partly you cause you're embodying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the role.</v>

287
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's partly the role too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the pharaohs,</v>

288
00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:18.764
<v Speaker 1>the live Pharaoh and the dead feral </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the dead feral represents </v>

289
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

290
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>The king is dead long live the king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

291
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.343
<v Speaker 1>But paralleling that idea was the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the pharaoh was not only the dead </v>

292
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Pharaoh and the live pharaoh at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

293
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.330
<v Speaker 1>but that he was ocirus and horace at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

294
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 1>But then you think in this story horace </v>
<v Speaker 1>has taken over,</v>

295
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Seth is God as I back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can be king,</v>

296
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:42.853
<v Speaker 1>but he isn't king yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where the Egyptians really </v>

297
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 1>get their act together.</v>

298
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.543
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think of the two stories that I'm </v>

299
00:16:48.981 --> 00:16:49.814
<v Speaker 1>telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the one that has the most </v>

300
00:16:50.541 --> 00:16:51.374
<v Speaker 1>significance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for modern people because we're </v>

301
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:56.480
<v Speaker 1>so likely to sidestep our obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture,</v>

302
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.640
<v Speaker 1>whatever that happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of popping this I back in his</v>

303
00:17:01.641 --> 00:17:02.474
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the first thing you'd think he </v>

304
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:03.914
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he decides he's going to go back to the </v>

305
00:17:04.971 --> 00:17:05.804
<v Speaker 1>underworld where ocirus is living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this ghostlike and dead manners since </v>

306
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:12.740
<v Speaker 1>he's been chopped up by seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes down into the underworld,</v>

307
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.140
<v Speaker 1>which is no piece of cake and he finds </v>
<v Speaker 1>those serious,</v>

308
00:17:15.141 --> 00:17:18.320
<v Speaker 1>they're in this kind of half dead state </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gives him his eye</v>

309
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.810
<v Speaker 1>and that enlightens ocirus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

310
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:24.644
<v Speaker 1>It gives him vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then he takes so serious back to </v>

311
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm in arm,</v>

312
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:30.584
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the conjunction of ocirus and </v>

313
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Hori Horis that constitutes the basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Egyptian sovereignty.</v>

314
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 1>And that is bloody brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

315
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Because the Egyptians figured out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so horace,</v>

316
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:44.180
<v Speaker 1>his tongue is Marduk for all intents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>

317
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:45.014
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's this avenging hero in the Egyptian </v>

318
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:48.824
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fights political corruption rather </v>

319
00:17:50.851 --> 00:17:51.684
<v Speaker 1>than chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can understand that those are </v>

320
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:55.120
<v Speaker 1>two flip sides of the hero archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

321
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.013
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero archetype has two basic </v>

322
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the confrontation of the terrible</v>

323
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:05.010
<v Speaker 1>aspect of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos in its most brutal form.</v>

324
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 1>And the other is the confrontation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the archaic aspect of culture.</v>

325
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways those aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishable because if culture isn't</v>

326
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 1>archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos never makes itself present.</v>

327
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:16.853
<v Speaker 1>So which is to say you can't separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>out political degradation from </v>

328
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 1>environmental degradation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it's the same idea.</v>

329
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.970
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horace has this great idea.</v>

330
00:18:30.971 --> 00:18:32.260
<v Speaker 1>He needs his father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

331
00:18:32.261 --> 00:18:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And I told you about the same motif </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging in Pinocchio.</v>

332
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.180
<v Speaker 1>We already locked at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

333
00:18:37.181 --> 00:18:42.181
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio doesn't become genuine until </v>
<v Speaker 1>he risks his life saving is farther.</v>

334
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.143
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the same thing is happening in this </v>

335
00:18:44.141 --> 00:18:46.720
<v Speaker 1>particular situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>

336
00:18:46.721 --> 00:18:47.554
<v Speaker 1>So then you get this situation where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians characterize sovereignty as </v>

337
00:18:51.671 --> 00:18:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the capability to overcome evil in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political domain combined with,</v>

338
00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.690
<v Speaker 1>and that's a youthful capability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

339
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Combined with the wisdom of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

340
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.553
<v Speaker 1>Then you look at that from a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective and you find out already </v>

341
00:19:05.381 --> 00:19:06.214
<v Speaker 1>that the Egyptians viewed the Pharaoh as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the live pharaoh and the dead pharaoh </v>

342
00:19:10.001 --> 00:19:10.834
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you find out something else </v>

343
00:19:12.221 --> 00:19:13.054
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting and it gives you some</v>
<v Speaker 1>really real insight into just exactly </v>

344
00:19:15.671 --> 00:19:17.650
<v Speaker 1>how bloody powerful these ideas were.</v>

345
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.753
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did the Egyptians do with their </v>

346
00:19:20.411 --> 00:19:22.300
<v Speaker 1>spare time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

347
00:19:22.301 --> 00:19:23.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they built the pyramids,</v>

348
00:19:23.771 --> 00:19:24.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

349
00:19:24.341 --> 00:19:27.160
<v Speaker 1>and that was no trivial undertaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of the,</v>

350
00:19:27.161 --> 00:19:31.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000 BC equivalent of flying to Mars.</v>

351
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.940
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pyramids are pretty impressive now,</v>

352
00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:34.774
<v Speaker 1>but they were a hell of a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive in their original form </v>

353
00:19:36.671 --> 00:19:39.550
<v Speaker 1>because they were in the middle of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>immense complex.</v>

354
00:19:39.551 --> 00:19:43.930
<v Speaker 1>And the pyramids were dedicated to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immortality of the Pharaoh.</v>

355
00:19:43.931 --> 00:19:47.350
<v Speaker 1>And the Pharaoh was possessed by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit called car.</v>

356
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.110
<v Speaker 1>And car was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his immortal spirit.</v>

357
00:19:50.111 --> 00:19:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And it was the union of Horace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocirus.</v>

358
00:19:52.421 --> 00:19:53.254
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Egyptian society was dedicated to a </v>

359
00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.240
<v Speaker 1>day of flying the immortal spirit of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pharaoh,</v>

360
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:03.790
<v Speaker 1>the Union of Horace and ocirus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

361
00:20:03.791 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was this union that gave the f,</v>

362
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:11.010
<v Speaker 1>it was this identification with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>union that gave the Pharaoh a phenomena.</v>

363
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.520
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians called Matt and not was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like truth or good order.</v>

364
00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about it as conscience</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a census,</v>

365
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:23.460
<v Speaker 1>if the Pharaoh was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was utilizing the union of horizontals,</v>

366
00:20:23.651 --> 00:20:24.484
<v Speaker 1>or I know serious than he would have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intuitive ability to decide what the </v>

367
00:20:27.731 --> 00:20:32.650
<v Speaker 1>appropriate course of order was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Egyptians would say,</v>

368
00:20:32.651 --> 00:20:34.510
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Pharaoh came into the court,</v>

369
00:20:34.511 --> 00:20:35.344
<v Speaker 1>they'd say the sun has risen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that they meant that the power </v>

370
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.660
<v Speaker 1>that reigned over the dominion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night had arrived.</v>

371
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.213
<v Speaker 1>They conceptualized Matt has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to put order in the place of </v>

372
00:20:46.241 --> 00:20:47.620
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>

373
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.500
<v Speaker 1>formally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they assimilated the Union of Horace.</v>

374
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>And ocirus with the capability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting order in the face of chaos.</v>

375
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:54.783
<v Speaker 1>They regarded that as a mortal and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent all of the excess resources of </v>

376
00:20:58.781 --> 00:20:59.614
<v Speaker 1>their society glorifying that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think you don't produce </v>

377
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:06.730
<v Speaker 1>something like the pyramids without </v>
<v Speaker 1>really being possessed by an idea,</v>

378
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

379
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.833
<v Speaker 1>This is no trivial undertaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going over a period of several </v>

380
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.500
<v Speaker 1>hundred if not several thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it takes an awful lot of work.</v>

381
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.483
<v Speaker 1>So this idea of the mortality of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union of Horace and Ocirus and its </v>

382
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:19.594
<v Speaker 1>association with sovereignty was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely potent idea for the </v>

383
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:23.344
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gave their whole culture motive </v>

384
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

385
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.220
<v Speaker 1>so the Egyptians thought Pharaohs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortal and not the reason why,</v>

386
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.210
<v Speaker 1>and we more or less partake in his and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality by being his subject.</v>

387
00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:35.044
<v Speaker 1>So that was a pretty good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then Eliod of points out something </v>

388
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:38.344
<v Speaker 1>very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is called the democratization </v>

389
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:40.894
<v Speaker 1>of ocirus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you found was that initially </v>

390
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:43.923
<v Speaker 1>there were certain symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations representing the </v>

391
00:21:46.511 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 1>immortality of the Pharaoh that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>only be used by the Pharaoh.</v>

392
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.810
<v Speaker 1>But as Egyptian culture continued to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop,</v>

393
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.943
<v Speaker 1>then the symbolic representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a mortality started to be adopted by </v>

394
00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 1>the aristocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what did that mean?</v>

395
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:01.923
<v Speaker 1>It meant that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this process that the Egyptians had </v>

396
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.563
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as integral to the order </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the state was no longer solely </v>

397
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:15.130
<v Speaker 1>embodied in the hands of the Pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

398
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.420
<v Speaker 1>It had started to drift down the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy into the aristocracy.</v>

399
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.943
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you think what happens after </v>

400
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:24.100
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the end of Egyptian society,</v>

401
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.280
<v Speaker 1>the aristocrats were characterized by</v>
<v Speaker 1>an identity with the union of Horace and</v>

402
00:22:30.571 --> 00:22:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Ocirus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

403
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Sovereignty had started to spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

404
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.113
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think what starts to happen </v>

405
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 1>with the greats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

406
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:40.210
<v Speaker 1>The Greeks attribute to sovereignty to </v>
<v Speaker 1>every male,</v>

407
00:22:40.211 --> 00:22:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Greek barbarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no women,</v>

408
00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:44.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least all males,</v>

409
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:44.944
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a beginning of a democratic </v>

410
00:22:46.271 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 1>notion there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

411
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.760
<v Speaker 1>the Jews developing ideas that if not </v>
<v Speaker 1>derived from Egypt,</v>

412
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:59.800
<v Speaker 1>where at least similar in structure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian ideas,</v>

413
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 1>say not the aristocracy knock the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharaoh,</v>

414
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.493
<v Speaker 1>but every individual has the capacity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing a direct relationship with </v>

415
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the form of the Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

416
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.473
<v Speaker 1>Then you have a Christian revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>that follows that where the idea that </v>

417
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.493
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty and Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual is distributed to </v>

418
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.620
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

419
00:23:20.621 --> 00:23:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>

420
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:22.660
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal,</v>

421
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:24.240
<v Speaker 1>dawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal murderer,</v>

422
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 1>rapist tax man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it,</v>

423
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.353
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty and here is within them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on that soil that our whole </v>

424
00:23:30.731 --> 00:23:31.564
<v Speaker 1>democratic culture emerges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These unbelievably archaic ideas first </v>

425
00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 1>acted out right first embodied in ritual</v>
<v Speaker 1>first dramatized,</v>

426
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:40.893
<v Speaker 1>then only told his stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing more and more coherence over </v>

427
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.630
<v Speaker 1>over stretches of time of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

428
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:51.820
<v Speaker 1>not hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thousands of years becoming more,</v>

429
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.990
<v Speaker 1>more coherent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming more pointed,</v>

430
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.810
<v Speaker 1>becoming more relevant with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their embodiment.</v>

431
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.673
<v Speaker 1>Then starting to become understood </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly and distributed through the </v>

432
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:00.944
<v Speaker 1>entire society</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's on that ground that our world </v>

433
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.463
<v Speaker 1>rests not on the ground of rationality </v>
<v Speaker 1>as established in say Europe in 1500 </v>

434
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:19.340
<v Speaker 1>what we have is much more profound and </v>
<v Speaker 1>solid and deep.</v>

435
00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Then any mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational construction,</v>

436
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.713
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of government and the </v>

437
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 1>calibrated state so to speak.</v>

438
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a consequence of an emergent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not evolutionary,</v>

439
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:33.584
<v Speaker 1>at least social evolutionary process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that it stems much </v>

440
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:41.240
<v Speaker 1>farther back than that because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine something like this,</v>

441
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.920
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this ideal personality that should be</v>

442
00:24:45.921 --> 00:24:46.754
<v Speaker 1>sovereign is represented by the optimal </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of creativity and </v>

443
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:50.684
<v Speaker 1>traditionalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if that's the optimal combination </v>

444
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:58.220
<v Speaker 1>and if we're prepared to regard that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal,</v>

445
00:24:58.221 --> 00:24:59.054
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you perceive when you </v>

446
00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:03.470
<v Speaker 1>perceive someone that you respect and </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire her,</v>

447
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:04.873
<v Speaker 1>then you could say that success in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>social hierarchies is predicated on the </v>

448
00:25:08.991 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 1>degree to which you actually embody that</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination.</v>

449
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:12.854
<v Speaker 1>And then you see an interaction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual success and this social </v>

450
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:19.274
<v Speaker 1>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be an interaction that </v>

451
00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:21.374
<v Speaker 1>extends over the centuries or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of century so that as these </v>

452
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:25.880
<v Speaker 1>ideas become more and more developed,</v>

453
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.363
<v Speaker 1>we become more and more adapted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodying them as a consequence of </v>

454
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:35.000
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just cultural,</v>

455
00:25:35.001 --> 00:25:39.650
<v Speaker 1>it's also biological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our political presuppositions rest on</v>

456
00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:43.040
<v Speaker 1>a cultural basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is unbelievably archaic,</v>

457
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 1>resting in turn on something even lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

458
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:46.994
<v Speaker 1>And I think examples of that or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>those that I've provided you with </v>

459
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:51.170
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know for example,</v>

460
00:25:51.171 --> 00:25:54.360
<v Speaker 1>that chimps who have to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

461
00:25:54.361 --> 00:25:56.150
<v Speaker 1>a very aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the males,</v>

462
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:57.163
<v Speaker 1>but they're also very cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the males who are aggressive spend a </v>

463
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:00.404
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of time repairing </v>
<v Speaker 1>social boundaries in the aftermath of a </v>

464
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:05.743
<v Speaker 1>aggressive incident because they're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>as concerned with keeping the bloody </v>

465
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:11.750
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy intact as they are in climbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

466
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:12.584
<v Speaker 1>They have to be.</v>

467
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

468
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.580
<v Speaker 1>and we know that even wolves won't kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>a subordinate wolf once they've defeated</v>

469
00:26:18.581 --> 00:26:19.414
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they allow the subordinate wolf to </v>

470
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:21.980
<v Speaker 1>maintain its own existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

471
00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:22.814
<v Speaker 1>They have this notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this procedural notion that even those </v>

472
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:31.991
<v Speaker 1>entities that appear insignificant may </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some manner that's beyond speech,</v>

473
00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:35.300
<v Speaker 1>still contribute to the integrity of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>

474
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.343
<v Speaker 1>and that's an idea that's very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to our notion that sovereignty </v>

475
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:39.740
<v Speaker 1>in Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual,</v>

476
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:41.600
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've taken further.</v>

477
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're in clear violation of the</v>

478
00:26:44.371 --> 00:26:45.204
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your rights remain in tact because no </v>

479
00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:50.160
<v Speaker 1>matter how outcast you are and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently beyond redemption,</v>

480
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 1>your existence may still contribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to the integrity of the hall.</v>

481
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't appear to be a metaphorical</v>

482
00:26:57.331 --> 00:26:59.340
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you dismiss it,</v>

483
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:00.803
<v Speaker 1>you cannot dismiss it without </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously dismissing the ground on </v>

484
00:27:03.631 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 1>which our state's rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to ask yourself,</v>

485
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.080
<v Speaker 1>are you willing to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is no,</v>

486
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:13.770
<v Speaker 1>well then you have to start doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to start to question what it is</v>

487
00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:14.604
<v Speaker 1>that you actually believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you buy the doctrine of </v>

488
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:18.300
<v Speaker 1>natural rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you do,</v>

489
00:27:18.301 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 1>you act it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of this follows in its wake,</v>

490
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 1>or it rests on sand and it bloody well </v>
<v Speaker 1>better not rest on sound.</v>

491
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.073
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

492
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
