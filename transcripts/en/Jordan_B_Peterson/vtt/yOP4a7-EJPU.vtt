1
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.913
<v Speaker 1>We know that the snake is</v>
<v Speaker 1>utilized conceptually in metaphorically </v>

2
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.550
<v Speaker 1>as representation of transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3
00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:43.660
<v Speaker 1>because the snake is something that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>shed its skin and be reborn.</v>

4
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>We know that a snake is something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>innately attractive and terrifying human</v>

5
00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>beings and other primates so that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>come across a snake,</v>

6
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.140
<v Speaker 1>you're likely to be at least startled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not horrified by it,</v>

7
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:56.974
<v Speaker 1>but also attracted to it in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is underneath your voluntary </v>

8
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:02.584
<v Speaker 1>Because snakes attract orienting reflex </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't they activate the systems </v>

10
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:06.874
<v Speaker 1>underneath your consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually governed the structure of that </v>

11
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:09.904
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that the snake can be well </v>

12
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 1>represented as well as internal chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine this,</v>

13
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:21.421
<v Speaker 1>imagine that it's not unreasonable for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious mind searching for a mode</v>

14
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:23.344
<v Speaker 1>of self representation to remark on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parallels between the structure of the </v>

15
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:27.904
<v Speaker 1>snake and the spine and the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given that a snake is essentially a </v>

16
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:32.014
<v Speaker 1>spine with a brain and then imagine as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well that the most archaic aspects of </v>

17
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:37.354
<v Speaker 1>our nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those that govern novelty and orienting </v>

18
00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:41.104
<v Speaker 1>and anxiety responses are in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely those that were described by </v>

19
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:45.154
<v Speaker 1>Mclean as nested inside the reptilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and then imagine along with the </v>

20
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Hindu Yogis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the purpose of Kundalini Yoga is to</v>

21
00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:56.860
<v Speaker 1>activate the circuitry that's associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that snake,</v>

22
00:01:56.861 --> 00:01:57.694
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to produce a permanent state of alert </v>

23
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.580
<v Speaker 1>wakefulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with consciousness.</v>

24
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.293
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine an animal like like a zebra </v>

25
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>grazing mindlessly in the herd with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness whatsoever,</v>

26
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.293
<v Speaker 1>and then imagine it's relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeveloped cortical structures </v>

27
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:22.764
<v Speaker 1>activated suddenly by the movement of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lion off in the perimeter and then </v>

28
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>imagine for that brief moment that Zebra</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually conscious state.</v>

29
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>That requires a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and difficult to maintain,</v>

30
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:35.604
<v Speaker 1>but because the threat and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty manifest itself within the </v>

31
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:41.124
<v Speaker 1>zebras mode of consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wakes momentarily and then imagine </v>

32
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.564
<v Speaker 1>that human beings are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zebra always because we've become self </v>

33
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>conscious because we know that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown is around us all the time.</v>

34
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Even when we think we're safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're never safe.</v>

35
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.953
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that the reason we're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious because as a consequence of </v>

36
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>our discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the possibility of our own mortality,</v>

37
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.403
<v Speaker 1>all this underlying circuitry that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals is only apparent when </v>

38
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>they're startled or afraid or interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>or curious.</v>

39
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.233
<v Speaker 1>In human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on all the time and that's what </v>

40
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.694
<v Speaker 1>makes us conscious and the reason for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is because we developed enough </v>

41
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.114
<v Speaker 1>cortical elaboration to note that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always threatened by everything that's </v>

42
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 1>around us and then imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

44
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Because it's at the basis of all our </v>
<v Speaker 1>innate existential terror,</v>

45
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.403
<v Speaker 1>but then imagine as well that without </v>
<v Speaker 1>that terror pushing us forward and and </v>

46
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>our constant reference to the dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the unknown,</v>

47
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>we would have never been motivated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce the kind of societies that we've</v>

48
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.603
<v Speaker 1>produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are essentially very remarkably </v>

49
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.324
<v Speaker 1>elaborated devices that enable us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find some protection from that unknown </v>

50
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>and to manipulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate it effectively,</v>

51
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.710
<v Speaker 1>and then remembering that Surrey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will return to genesis young says,</v>

52
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.303
<v Speaker 1>snake is was regarded by early gnostic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians as a kind of daddy who's </v>

53
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:10.974
<v Speaker 1>faculties were more developed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced than the original daddy that </v>

54
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:15.660
<v Speaker 1>actually structured the world.</v>

55
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.190
<v Speaker 1>The idea there being that the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>initially was a pretty dismal place.</v>

56
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.263
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wasn't conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all existed at the level of the </v>

57
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:26.790
<v Speaker 1>animal and then the snake came along and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

58
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.100
<v Speaker 1>wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wake up.</v>

59
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.113
<v Speaker 1>And the movement from that state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsolved consciousness paradise to this </v>

60
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.990
<v Speaker 1>profane state of awakening can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded not so much as a descent but as</v>

61
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.470
<v Speaker 1>an asset of sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though a painful one.</v>

62
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And then you have Gareth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this commentary from Mephistopheles,</v>

63
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.120
<v Speaker 1>his representation of Satan and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for temptation,</v>

64
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.133
<v Speaker 1>who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the adage of my cousins snake </v>

65
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.090
<v Speaker 1>from dreams of godlike knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will wake to fear in which your very</v>

66
00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:02.924
<v Speaker 1>soul shall quake a statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>associating the human tendency to </v>

67
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.880
<v Speaker 1>attribute to all revolutionary sources </v>
<v Speaker 1>of new information,</v>

68
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.973
<v Speaker 1>a kind of demonic being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the problem of the </v>

69
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:20.294
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know that within the context of </v>

70
00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:23.564
<v Speaker 1>the Judeo Christian tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women have unduly suffered for their </v>

71
00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:27.374
<v Speaker 1>role in tempting humanity in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied form of Adam towards higher </v>

72
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.250
<v Speaker 1>order self consciousness.</v>

73
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.083
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

74
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.193
<v Speaker 1>let's just take a look at how human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and their mating relationships </v>

75
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.214
<v Speaker 1>differ from those of other animals like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees to whom we are very closely </v>

76
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.820
<v Speaker 1>genetically related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the mating strategies</v>

77
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:47.654
<v Speaker 1>of female chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that they really don't care who </v>

78
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:52.340
<v Speaker 1>they sleep with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

79
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.353
<v Speaker 1>Any old chimpanzee will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the last dominant male chimps to be </v>

80
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 1>chased away by the more dominant male </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps.</v>

81
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:00.764
<v Speaker 1>But if a female than less dominant chip </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get the hell away from the watchful </v>

82
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:07.300
<v Speaker 1>gaze of the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're perfectly happy to mate.</v>

83
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.383
<v Speaker 1>Human females are not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is selective maters and there's a </v>

84
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:13.334
<v Speaker 1>tremendous body of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological information that suggests </v>

85
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:17.774
<v Speaker 1>that although both genders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>value intelligence and physical </v>

86
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:22.094
<v Speaker 1>appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>females value the ability to attain </v>

87
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:26.744
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy status in men far more than </v>

88
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.190
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

89
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I admire the ability to attain dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>status in women,</v>

90
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.873
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that men don't care for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a woman has with regards to </v>

91
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 1>potential for attaining status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with women,</v>

92
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the strong determinant of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mating preference.</v>

93
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>So then let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

94
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>we don't know why the hell are cortex </v>
<v Speaker 1>has expanded so rapidly,</v>

95
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between five and 3 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

96
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.443
<v Speaker 1>Let's offer this as a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women started to get choosy and </v>

97
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:57.884
<v Speaker 1>because they were so damn complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole human species had to </v>

98
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 1>exaggerate it's cortical growth prior to</v>
<v Speaker 1>any even use for that critical growth,</v>

99
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>just so that the men had an even hand in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the competition.</v>

100
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women put tremendous selection,</v>

101
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 1>pressure on the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To develop tremendous,</v>

102
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.233
<v Speaker 1>tremendous cortical expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we already know that from a </v>

103
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>mythological perspective that women are </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently cast into the same conceptual</v>

104
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:26.414
<v Speaker 1>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temptress domain as the benevolent </v>

105
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know as well from representations</v>

106
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:33.164
<v Speaker 1>of hero mythology that it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual who goes out to confront </v>

107
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:36.914
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's most likely to free from the </v>

108
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.380
<v Speaker 1>dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only treasured,</v>

109
00:07:40.381 --> 00:07:41.214
<v Speaker 1>but a virgin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in the case of mythological </v>

110
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>representations like St George and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon</v>

111
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.730
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament in genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

112
00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:54.564
<v Speaker 1>There's this notion that not only did </v>
<v Speaker 1>people become self conscious because </v>

113
00:07:58.291 --> 00:08:00.960
<v Speaker 1>they did something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did this voluntarily,</v>

114
00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:01.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

115
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.050
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made this decision on their own.</v>

116
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.160
<v Speaker 1>So Milton puts words into God's mouth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

117
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.233
<v Speaker 1>so will fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He meaning the human being and his </v>

118
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:18.820
<v Speaker 1>faithless progeny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whose fault,</v>

119
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 1>whose about his own ingrained he had of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

120
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could have I made him justin,</v>

121
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's efficient to have stood though free</v>

122
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.620
<v Speaker 1>to fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>

123
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:32.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the notion of the heritable sin of</v>

124
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Adam characterizing human beings in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fallen existential condition isn't</v>

125
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:38.044
<v Speaker 1>just the black heart ravings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist southern Baptist </v>

126
00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:41.710
<v Speaker 1>lunatics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

127
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.400
<v Speaker 1>There's something to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are the only creatures that</v>

128
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:46.234
<v Speaker 1>seem to live at odds with their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and it's not so unreasonable </v>

129
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:54.130
<v Speaker 1>to suppose that it's hard dawning </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for self consciousness that put</v>

130
00:08:54.131 --> 00:08:54.964
<v Speaker 1>us in that uncomfortable position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do I associate the eating of the </v>

131
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:02.630
<v Speaker 1>apple with self consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

132
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's how the story lays itself</v>

133
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:05.484
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the collateral evidence of the </v>

134
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist story of enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

135
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>His contact with death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have multiple media,</v>

136
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>medieval representations of Eve offering</v>
<v Speaker 1>to animal to Adam.</v>

137
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Not An apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a skull.</v>

138
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 1>You have multiple representations of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>

139
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:23.154
<v Speaker 1>of the knowledge of good and evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval iconography as not containing </v>

140
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:26.934
<v Speaker 1>apples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but containing skulls and you have the </v>

141
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>statements that are within the context </v>
<v Speaker 1>of genesis itself</v>

142
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.123
<v Speaker 1>and the eyes of both of them were opened</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they knew that they were naked and </v>

143
00:09:40.931 --> 00:09:44.110
<v Speaker 1>they sewed fig leaves together and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves aprons.</v>

144
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of information packed into</v>

145
00:09:46.991 --> 00:09:48.190
<v Speaker 1>those two lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

146
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.500
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to have your eyes open</v>
<v Speaker 1>or half?</v>

147
00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is visual cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not unreal.</v>

148
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not unreasonable to presume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means a quick</v>

149
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I quit magnification of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your conscious during the day,</v>

150
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 1>that's when your eyes are open or what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when your eyes are open?</v>

151
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're naked.</v>

152
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

153
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:10.210
<v Speaker 1>you're vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

155
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.570
<v Speaker 1>To social comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to social judgment,</v>

156
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.950
<v Speaker 1>to dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

157
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:14.784
<v Speaker 1>status maneuvering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to all the terrible things that the </v>

158
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 1>unknown world can can wreak upon you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what do you do?</v>

159
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you create culture,</v>

160
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.533
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this little sentence </v>

161
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 1>says and they sewed fig leaves together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and made themselves aprons.</v>

162
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty eventful sequence all </v>
<v Speaker 1>crammed up in two little sentences.</v>

163
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.040
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's extremely interesting.</v>

164
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.370
<v Speaker 1>So before Adam and eve figure out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're naked,</v>

165
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.323
<v Speaker 1>they're cruising around the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a fine time doing whatever they </v>

166
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:50.024
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't take any thoughts for the </v>

167
00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:51.770
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>

168
00:10:51.771 --> 00:10:52.604
<v Speaker 1>Don't have a prefrontal cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're living in a in a paradox lists </v>

169
00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>environment like an animal lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

170
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:02.620
<v Speaker 1>what happens after they become self </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious?</v>

171
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to this,</v>

172
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Adam's walking around with God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

173
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.990
<v Speaker 1>and you think about what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means something like this.</v>

174
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.153
<v Speaker 1>An animal isn't in the world of good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil and animal nature points out is </v>

175
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 1>beyond good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

176
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Enraptured in entirely by the actions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>automatic instinct governed by processes</v>

177
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 1>that are completely transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animals,</v>

178
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:26.423
<v Speaker 1>nothing but a force of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There no opposition between the animal </v>

179
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:31.470
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The animal is the world,</v>

180
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 1>and just as in the case of the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to the eating of the apple,</v>

181
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.483
<v Speaker 1>Adam walks around the garden with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There no discontinuity between him and </v>

182
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:49.191
<v Speaker 1>the and the transcendent world as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as he becomes naked yards,</v>

183
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>well why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't need to be answered.</v>

184
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:55.114
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you hide if you know you're </v>

185
00:11:58.001 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 1>naked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's simple.</v>

186
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>You hired because you think you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

187
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.783
<v Speaker 1>You think that whatever you are is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable that if it shows itself to </v>

188
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 1>the transcendent to others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the natural world,</v>

189
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 1>that something terrible will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

190
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty logical presupposition,</v>

191
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at us.</v>

192
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.330
<v Speaker 1>So God comes cruising around the garden </v>
<v Speaker 1>after Adam and Eve,</v>

193
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.193
<v Speaker 1>the apple in the cool of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Adam and Eve hide themselves among </v>

194
00:12:33.781 --> 00:12:36.540
<v Speaker 1>the trees of the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God says to Adam,</v>

195
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you?</v>

196
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.170
<v Speaker 1>And Adam says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard your voice.</v>

197
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.920
<v Speaker 1>And I was afraid because I was naked and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hid myself.</v>

198
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:47.963
<v Speaker 1>And that story has bottomless depth </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it means something like this at </v>

199
00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:55.134
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this notion that there is a </v>

200
00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:00.060
<v Speaker 1>transcendent relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and God,</v>

201
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:00.894
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The identity of logo send the </v>

202
00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:04.130
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

203
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:04.973
<v Speaker 1>I know it shouldn't by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that our entire idea of intrinsic human </v>

204
00:13:08.731 --> 00:13:11.040
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on is we've been at some</v>

205
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:16.041
<v Speaker 1>pains to demonstrate a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the limited and the limitless,</v>

206
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.820
<v Speaker 1>eradicated by the dawn of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

207
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.840
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

208
00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:25.080
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a destiny just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sake of argument,</v>

209
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:25.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

210
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.483
<v Speaker 1>Because you are a being with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous history and an unbelievable </v>

211
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:32.220
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you have a destiny just for</v>

212
00:13:32.221 --> 00:13:33.054
<v Speaker 1>the sake of argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would cause you to hide from that </v>

213
00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:38.280
<v Speaker 1>destiny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

214
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.173
<v Speaker 1>obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own reflections on your mortal </v>

215
00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:43.710
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

216
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.663
<v Speaker 1>How could I be characterized by any </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent power whatsoever when I'm </v>

217
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.570
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to social alienation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

218
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.583
<v Speaker 1>When I have this body which is capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of terrifying degeneration that will </v>

219
00:14:00.751 --> 00:14:04.470
<v Speaker 1>eventually decay into old age and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is bounded by death.</v>

220
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.513
<v Speaker 1>How could I be good for anything which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is precisely what this little story </v>

221
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.190
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so God figures out that Adam and eve</v>

222
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.450
<v Speaker 1>ate the fruit and that's pretty decisive</v>
<v Speaker 1>move because once you wake up,</v>

223
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.070
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're awake,</v>

224
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.070
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not an injunction,</v>

225
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.080
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a description.</v>

226
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.860
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done it now unto the woman.</v>

227
00:14:28.861 --> 00:14:29.694
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will greatly multiply the Isaura Nih </v>

228
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.290
<v Speaker 1>conception in sorrow shall bring forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

229
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

230
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a big CORTEX,</v>

231
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really big.</v>

232
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.010
<v Speaker 1>It grew fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that meant is that there was an</v>

233
00:14:44.011 --> 00:14:47.610
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary arms race between skull </v>
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>

234
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.370
<v Speaker 1>date of birth,</v>

235
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:56.250
<v Speaker 1>and pelvic diameter girth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wider the pelvis,</v>

236
00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.540
<v Speaker 1>the less effectively you can walk a </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger the skull.</v>

237
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.300
<v Speaker 1>The bigger the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the younger the baby,</v>

238
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.090
<v Speaker 1>the more dependent and vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do we have?</v>

239
00:15:06.091 --> 00:15:06.924
<v Speaker 1>In the case of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the female human pelvis has already </v>

240
00:15:10.441 --> 00:15:13.140
<v Speaker 1>stretched to the limits of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>structural capacity.</v>

241
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.123
<v Speaker 1>So the hole in its center is as big as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it can get without compromising the </v>

242
00:15:17.941 --> 00:15:22.320
<v Speaker 1>structural integrity of the pelvis while</v>
<v Speaker 1>still allowing women to walk and run.</v>

243
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.470
<v Speaker 1>So how have babies adapted to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

244
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.313
<v Speaker 1>that's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A mammal of our size should have a </v>

245
00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:29.094
<v Speaker 1>gestation period of two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a gestation period of nine </v>

246
00:15:31.651 --> 00:15:32.484
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you got to get the damn baby out </v>

247
00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:36.810
<v Speaker 1>before it's head gets too big?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

248
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means it's vulnerable,</v>

249
00:15:38.461 --> 00:15:39.294
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing more vulnerable than a baby </v>

250
00:15:40.441 --> 00:15:42.960
<v Speaker 1>human being except maybe a baby kitten </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

251
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.823
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's got a pouch to hide in at </v>

252
00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:47.190
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're born vulnerable,</v>

253
00:15:47.191 --> 00:15:51.240
<v Speaker 1>right characteristic of the birth of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero who suffers in childbirth.</v>

254
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

255
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:53.821
<v Speaker 1>Baby?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skulls?</v>

256
00:15:53.821 --> 00:15:54.654
<v Speaker 1>Just a little bit too big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be crunched and compacted during </v>

257
00:15:57.691 --> 00:15:58.524
<v Speaker 1>birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

258
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.393
<v Speaker 1>The skull bones aren't joined together </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the baby's head can be squashed </v>

259
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.190
<v Speaker 1>and visibly deformed during the process </v>
<v Speaker 1>of birth.</v>

260
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.203
<v Speaker 1>Prior to the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the death rate among women </v>

261
00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:10.290
<v Speaker 1>giving birth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One in three,</v>

262
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.390
<v Speaker 1>one in five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>

263
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.283
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the price you pay for </v>

264
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720
<v Speaker 1>consciousness</v>

265
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.190
<v Speaker 1>and I desire shall be to thy husband and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he shall rule over thee.</v>

266
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.100
<v Speaker 1>This is not an injunction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a description.</v>

267
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.350
<v Speaker 1>The additional burden that dependent </v>
<v Speaker 1>offspring place on women place them at a</v>

268
00:16:31.351 --> 00:16:32.184
<v Speaker 1>disadvantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the consequence of that from a </v>

269
00:16:33.721 --> 00:16:35.310
<v Speaker 1>historical perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

270
00:16:35.311 --> 00:16:38.130
<v Speaker 1>any feminist can answer that question </v>
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

271
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 1>and unto Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

272
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 1>because you listened to your wife and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have eaten the tree of which I commanded</v>

273
00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:46.761
<v Speaker 1>thee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

274
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:47.594
<v Speaker 1>don't eat that cursed is the ground for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sake in sorrow shall thou eat of it </v>

275
00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 1>for all the days of thy life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough,</v>

276
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:55.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're self conscious,</v>

277
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.780
<v Speaker 1>you work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

278
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals don't work.</v>

279
00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.450
<v Speaker 1>Why do people work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well?</v>

280
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Because we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

281
00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:03.590
<v Speaker 1>We know that if it isn't gonna happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

282
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.110
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen tomorrow and if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to happen tomorrow,</v>

283
00:17:06.111 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen next week or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>week after?</v>

284
00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 1>The month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the year after,</v>

285
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.190
<v Speaker 1>and we bloody well better prepare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we do.</v>

286
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Constantly prepare and prepare and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare.</v>

287
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.503
<v Speaker 1>So we're not bounded and motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening from second to second </v>

288
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 1>like the animal is in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still paradisical state.</v>

289
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:28.430
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly tormented by an endless</v>
<v Speaker 1>string of what if questions,</v>

290
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.443
<v Speaker 1>because when we look at the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see the possibility for </v>

291
00:17:32.631 --> 00:17:36.160
<v Speaker 1>everything including our own punishment </v>
<v Speaker 1>or own tournament,</v>

292
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.213
<v Speaker 1>our own demise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we're motivated like no other </v>

293
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:40.424
<v Speaker 1>animal to work and so we work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is another aspect that </v>

294
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:45.400
<v Speaker 1>alienates us from paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing,</v>

295
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.100
<v Speaker 1>being</v>
<v Speaker 1>thorns and thistles shall it bring forth</v>

296
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.840
<v Speaker 1>for the analysis.</v>

297
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.673
<v Speaker 1>You'll eat the herb of the field in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread </v>

298
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 1>til thou return unto the ground for Dust</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thou art and unto dust shall thou return</v>

299
00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.603
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore the Lord God sent him forth </v>

300
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 1>from the garden of Eden to till the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground from whence he was taken.</v>

301
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.210
<v Speaker 1>So we drove out the man and he placed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims</v>

302
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:13.980
<v Speaker 1>and a flaming sword which turned every </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to keep the way of the tree of life.</v>

303
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

304
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 1>The mother and father of all humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can give them a mythological slot</v>

305
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:26.574
<v Speaker 1>and you can say Adam is culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say and Eve is nature because they're </v>

306
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:30.863
<v Speaker 1>the archetipal parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfectly reasonable </v>

307
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:35.460
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have twin sons,</v>

308
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's read first born creatures,</v>

309
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.183
<v Speaker 1>firstborn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human creatures in the new self </v>

310
00:18:42.951 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Speaker 1>conscious world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what are the first two individuals in</v>

311
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:50.460
<v Speaker 1>the new self conscious world like and </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's find out,</v>

312
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.660
<v Speaker 1>and Adam knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eve,</v>

313
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:54.510
<v Speaker 1>his wife and she conceived and Bare Cain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

314
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I have gotten a man from the Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

315
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:58.374
<v Speaker 1>she bare his brother Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the younger brother and Abel was a </v>

316
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:01.944
<v Speaker 1>keeper of sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Cain was a tiller of the ground and </v>

317
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.753
<v Speaker 1>in the process of time it came to pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>that cain brought of the fruit of the </v>

318
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.630
<v Speaker 1>ground and offering unto the Lord.</v>

319
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to remove this from its</v>

320
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.713
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from its entrapment in a particular </v>

321
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:21.090
<v Speaker 1>temporal domain and within attempt or </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture when to say something like this.</v>

322
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you work,</v>

323
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.020
<v Speaker 1>you make sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

324
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.123
<v Speaker 1>That's what works all about and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason you make sacrifices is because </v>

325
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.363
<v Speaker 1>you're offering up to the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fruits of your labor in the hope </v>

326
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 1>that as a consequence of your diligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>

327
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be favored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

328
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:37.584
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why were the point of working is to </v>

329
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 1>transform the transcendent into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something benevolent,</v>

330
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.130
<v Speaker 1>so your work and your work and you work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>

331
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.233
<v Speaker 1>is that sufficient?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer you get from the </v>

332
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:50.160
<v Speaker 1>transcendent is the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

333
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:53.730
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly true that lots of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and doesn't go all that well,</v>

334
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:54.564
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make sacrifices and they do what </v>

335
00:19:56.971 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 1>they think they have to do and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is one string of catastrophes after</v>

336
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:01.170
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

337
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have this situation in the process</v>

338
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:06.060
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came to pass that cain brought of the</v>

339
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:09.420
<v Speaker 1>fruit of the ground and offering unto </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lord and Abel.</v>

340
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.560
<v Speaker 1>He also brought of the firstlings of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>flock and of the fat thereof.</v>

341
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord had respect unto Abel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his offering.</v>

342
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

343
00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:21.690
<v Speaker 1>they able working away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn things are going great for him,</v>

344
00:20:21.691 --> 00:20:23.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortune smiles on him.</v>

345
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.240
<v Speaker 1>He's doing wonderfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got everything he needs.</v>

346
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.133
<v Speaker 1>Well old cane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's scrounging away in the ground and </v>

347
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.860
<v Speaker 1>things aren't going as well for him at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

348
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plagues locusts.</v>

349
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:35.730
<v Speaker 1>You name it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Farm life isn't going well.</v>

350
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

351
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:44.481
<v Speaker 1>Cain was very wroth and his countenance </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell precisely right,</v>

352
00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:49.550
<v Speaker 1>because if you work diligently towards a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain end and you don't get there,</v>

353
00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 1>then your current spouse falls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

354
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated,</v>

355
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Speaker 1>disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt,</v>

356
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened,</v>

357
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.040
<v Speaker 1>ashamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty.</v>

358
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.690
<v Speaker 1>The whole panoply of negative emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's fair enough because of course</v>

359
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:02.524
<v Speaker 1>if you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going to be the </v>

360
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:04.504
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's this little twist on </v>

361
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:06.161
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

362
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:06.994
<v Speaker 1>This specifically human twists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like that kind of moral of the </v>

363
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:11.920
<v Speaker 1>whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you find</v>

364
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>the Lord saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>

365
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

366
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:18.130
<v Speaker 1>what's up with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so unhappy?</v>

367
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.320
<v Speaker 1>If you just got your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be accepted.</v>

368
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.290
<v Speaker 1>If you really got your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a statement,</v>

369
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:27.124
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you keep making sacrifices and the </v>

370
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:31.294
<v Speaker 1>same terrible thing keeps happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that </v>

371
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you're just actually not doing it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right way.</v>

372
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 1>And if you just get yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightened up,</v>

373
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.680
<v Speaker 1>tap together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

374
00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:42.514
<v Speaker 1>And drop the preconceptions that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really need an adjust your </v>

375
00:21:45.491 --> 00:21:48.460
<v Speaker 1>behavior accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then fortune would smile on you.</v>

376
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what the Lord says to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain,</v>

377
00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:54.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't walk around with such a crabby</v>

378
00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:56.020
<v Speaker 1>look on your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you did well,</v>

379
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 1>you'll be accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do well,</v>

380
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.060
<v Speaker 1>sin lies at the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

381
00:22:01.061 --> 00:22:01.894
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a deep motif in ancient Hebrew </v>

382
00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:05.434
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the world isn't laying itself out in </v>

383
00:22:08.551 --> 00:22:12.000
<v Speaker 1>a manner that you find acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're faced with a tough choice.</v>

384
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Either the world is a terrible place </v>
<v Speaker 1>bent on destruction,</v>

385
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.033
<v Speaker 1>or you're doing something wrong and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody well better be that you're doing </v>

386
00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:23.730
<v Speaker 1>something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if the world is a terrible place</v>

387
00:22:23.731 --> 00:22:27.390
<v Speaker 1>bent on destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got absolutely no hope.</v>

388
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And cain talked with Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>

389
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.163
<v Speaker 1>and it came to pass when they were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the field that Cain rose up against </v>

390
00:22:37.261 --> 00:22:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother and killed him.</v>

391
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

392
00:22:41.221 --> 00:22:43.140
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's simple.</v>

393
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.530
<v Speaker 1>It means this will say things aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going that well for you.</v>

394
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.603
<v Speaker 1>And it's really not because life's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfair and everything stacked against </v>

395
00:22:51.301 --> 00:22:53.580
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're kind of a arrogant,</v>

396
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:56.010
<v Speaker 1>stubborn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian,</v>

397
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.760
<v Speaker 1>cowardly idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that,</v>

398
00:22:59.761 --> 00:23:00.594
<v Speaker 1>the world is turning into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>resembling a wasteland around you and </v>

399
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.060
<v Speaker 1>you have this option change</v>
<v Speaker 1>or continue,</v>

400
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.470
<v Speaker 1>or you have another option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

401
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.350
<v Speaker 1>look around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all those people doing well.</v>

402
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>The world's a terrible place bent on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>

403
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.020
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be just the most interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

404
00:23:20.021 --> 00:23:25.021
<v Speaker 1>If as things are going to hell for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could take along just for the ride.</v>

405
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.133
<v Speaker 1>Some of those successful people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful just for unfair reasons </v>

406
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.930
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

407
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.340
<v Speaker 1>So instead of using all that negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion has a cue that there's something</v>

408
00:23:36.341 --> 00:23:38.440
<v Speaker 1>about me that might need to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed.</v>

409
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

410
00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.650
<v Speaker 1>why not just eradicate the target of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment?</v>

411
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.513
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only because that sort of removes </v>

412
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Speaker 1>the problem of comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more profoundly.</v>

413
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

414
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:53.863
<v Speaker 1>eliminate Leslie profoundly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but say you made the decision that the </v>

415
00:23:56.781 --> 00:24:00.050
<v Speaker 1>world's a terrible place and it's based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your destruction.</v>

416
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.071
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

417
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:04.730
<v Speaker 1>what's the logical response to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think something like this</v>

418
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Girtha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fouse,</v>

419
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.913
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles Credo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit I that endlessly denies and </v>

420
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:23.690
<v Speaker 1>rightly to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all of it,</v>

421
00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:24.524
<v Speaker 1>comes to birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fit for overthrow as nothing worth </v>

422
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 1>wherefore for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're better sterilized.</v>

423
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.200
<v Speaker 1>That's all the tear is evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized is gained to me and downfall,</v>

424
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 1>rune and sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very element I prosper in</v>

425
00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:43.683
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

426
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.130
<v Speaker 1>draws our attention to this credo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not once,</v>

427
00:24:47.131 --> 00:24:52.131
<v Speaker 1>but twice in his writing a file.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin has mephistopheles say right once</v>

428
00:24:52.921 --> 00:24:55.620
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone to share,</v>

429
00:24:55.621 --> 00:25:00.621
<v Speaker 1>nothing passed with no made one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What matters are creative,</v>

430
00:25:00.631 --> 00:25:03.270
<v Speaker 1>endless toil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When out of snatch oblivion ends,</v>

431
00:25:03.271 --> 00:25:05.340
<v Speaker 1>the coil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is by gone.</v>

432
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.990
<v Speaker 1>How shall this riddle run?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As good as if things never had begun yet</v>

433
00:25:09.991 --> 00:25:14.340
<v Speaker 1>circle back existence to possess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have eternal emptiness.</v>

434
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think about cane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like figures like Stella and you think,</v>

435
00:25:20.581 --> 00:25:22.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly was he motivated by?</v>

436
00:25:22.891 --> 00:25:24.270
<v Speaker 1>And on the one hand you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

437
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.060
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to extend his cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominion right?</v>

438
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Played by his own self conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

439
00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.510
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to extend the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

440
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:39.410
<v Speaker 1>the borders of his totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty to every corner just to not be</v>

441
00:25:40.621 --> 00:25:43.380
<v Speaker 1>plagued by the unknown and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

442
00:25:43.381 --> 00:25:44.214
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're all pretty nervous and a </v>

443
00:25:45.331 --> 00:25:46.680
<v Speaker 1>little stability is a good thing.</v>

444
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.753
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they make a fundamental </v>

445
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.890
<v Speaker 1>judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the judgment of Mephistopheles.</v>

446
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is terrible,</v>

447
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.410
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

448
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Were self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get sick.</v>

449
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.360
<v Speaker 1>We go insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to die.</v>

450
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent children suffer everywhere.</v>

451
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:12.410
<v Speaker 1>How in the world is it right to let such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a state continue?</v>

452
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:14.543
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All things considered just to bring the </v>

453
00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:18.744
<v Speaker 1>whole game to an end and so then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think again with Eliana that the reason </v>

454
00:26:24.421 --> 00:26:26.970
<v Speaker 1>that humans societies fall apart is </v>
<v Speaker 1>twofold.</v>

455
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.110
<v Speaker 1>One is things go from bad to worse of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own accord,</v>

456
00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:33.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thermodynamic reality,</v>

457
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.340
<v Speaker 1>pure entropy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>structured entities decay,</v>

458
00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:39.683
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a twist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Structured entities constructed by are </v>

459
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:44.934
<v Speaker 1>sped in their process of decay by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>participants of the individuals within </v>

460
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:50.334
<v Speaker 1>that society who have essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided that the game is not worth the </v>

461
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.364
<v Speaker 1>price and that under such conditions the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only reasonable thing for a self </v>

462
00:27:01.131 --> 00:27:01.964
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painfully self conscious individual to </v>
