1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.590
<v Speaker 1>So here's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another proposition.</v>

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>You can think about what we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so far in some way.</v>

3
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.273
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

4
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.373
<v Speaker 1>you can think about what we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so far in some way is trying to </v>

5
00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>figure out what the world is made of and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to answer that,</v>

6
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:24.644
<v Speaker 1>we have to think about what do you mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the world and what do you mean by </v>

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Meda?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because those,</v>

8
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>when you're asking a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>question like that,</v>

9
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.250
<v Speaker 1>the terms in the question have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>specified with a high degree of accuracy</v>

10
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 1>or you're just chasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just chasing ghosts around.</v>

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>So we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 1>at one level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one level of resolutions,</v>

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>pretty obvious that the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objective world,</v>

14
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:49.034
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is made out of atoms and democracy has </v>

15
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>said that a long time ago in Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>He was the first guy that came up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the atomic theory,</v>

17
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't say that the world was </v>
<v Speaker 1>made out of atoms.</v>

18
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>He said that it was made out of atoms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and space and you think,</v>

19
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:02.900
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

21
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.981
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

22
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:04.521
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

23
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:07.640
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that obvious because as soon as</v>

24
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:11.240
<v Speaker 1>you have fundamental particles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

25
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.373
<v Speaker 1>you can array those particles in space </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can arrange them in patterned </v>

26
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:20.801
<v Speaker 1>ways and the patterned ways are real to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The patterns are real too,</v>

27
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>so and without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without the space,</v>

28
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:25.904
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Adam's plus space gives rise to </v>

29
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.010
<v Speaker 1>something else and really what it gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>rise to as far as I can tell,</v>

30
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>it's something very much like </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

31
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation is a very complicated idea.</v>

32
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>What information is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

33
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>We won't go into that at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think about music?</v>

34
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music is like Adams of sound,</v>

35
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're,</v>

36
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 1>they're discreet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quanta of sound,</v>

37
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>essentially their raid out in patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>

38
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>and obviously the pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music is not just the note,</v>

39
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>it's the pattern across time.</v>

40
00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.743
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what are the things we might say is </v>

41
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:01.844
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

42
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>there's Adams in their space and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>

43
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so patterns.</v>

44
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most fundamental patterns.</v>

45
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's put it this way.</v>

46
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.631
<v Speaker 1>We're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.760
<v Speaker 1>what's your problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to live in the world?</v>

48
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>What's the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.553
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is how to live as an </v>

50
00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:28.481
<v Speaker 1>individual in society and nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

51
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then we're going to say,</v>

52
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the actual problem,</v>

53
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.333
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you have to do to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is to conceptualize society and </v>

54
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:42.950
<v Speaker 1>nature and conceptualize the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to represent them somehow.</v>

55
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.443
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how should you represent society and </v>

56
00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:47.534
<v Speaker 1>nature and the individual?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is that's </v>

57
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious.</v>

58
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Now we kinda know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

59
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 1>that one way of representing society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy.</v>

60
00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.523
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not only a way of representing </v>

61
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's a way of being in this society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.053
<v Speaker 1>To talk about the dominance hierarchy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent it to be in a dominant </v>

63
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>turkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live it.</v>

64
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>So we can take about a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

65
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Society is more than a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

66
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a bad first approximation.</v>

67
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.060
<v Speaker 1>And then we can think of the place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which those dominance hierarchies exist.</v>

68
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.353
<v Speaker 1>We might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's for lack of a better way of </v>

69
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:25.384
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing it's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's complicated because he can't </v>

70
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>actually some these concepts up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>single words as far as I can tell,</v>

71
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:33.964
<v Speaker 1>you have to use an array of words and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>array of images because the categories </v>

72
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>are so broad that you just can't sum </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up in a single concept.</v>

73
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.233
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can sum them up with words and </v>

74
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>you can sum them up with images and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can sum them up with stories and,</v>

75
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do as people.</v>

76
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>So the quest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

77
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the fundamental question?</v>

79
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>How to live as an individual in society </v>
<v Speaker 1>and nature?</v>

80
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

81
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

82
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's af fundamental question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>

83
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.984
<v Speaker 1>We'll go with that.</v>

84
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll go back over this a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

85
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.390
<v Speaker 1>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with this story.</v>

86
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>So go back to the birthplace of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

88
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.433
<v Speaker 1>Then we're going to tell the variant of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this story that was discovered in the </v>

89
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:32.794
<v Speaker 1>late 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a story about this God called Matt </v>

90
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.103
<v Speaker 1>or Martech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the basic structure of the </v>

91
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:42.604
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

92
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>You got to primordial gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the way that must have been Damien's</v>

93
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize the world is they kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about it.</v>

94
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.233
<v Speaker 1>You know how if you're out on the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's flat and he kind of looked at the </v>

95
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world looks like a dome,</v>

96
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sky on a disk.</v>

97
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.803
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Mesopotamian world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the world as </v>

98
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized by the people who wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>genesis as well.</v>

99
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a dome on a disk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

100
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>So the disc is land and underneath the </v>
<v Speaker 1>land is water.</v>

101
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Fresh water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

102
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you dig down in the land,</v>

103
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you hit freshwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then underneath that is salt water.</v>

104
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>And how do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:19.114
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go out to the edges of the land </v>

106
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 1>and you find an ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's salt water.</v>

107
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

108
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>so now as far as the Mesopotamians were </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

109
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>the salt water in the fresh water were </v>
<v Speaker 1>two gods.</v>

110
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Now what did they represent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

111
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.163
<v Speaker 1>one of them was male and one of them was</v>
<v Speaker 1>female and the female one was the salt </v>

112
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The male one was the,</v>

113
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>was the freshwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

114
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 1>So now they kind of conceptualize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a kind of a formless chaos,</v>

115
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:47.014
<v Speaker 1>so you can kinda think of that water </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixture as the chaos from which life </v>

116
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

117
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.043
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the case and we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that w that life did merged </v>

118
00:05:56.861 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>from water and that without water you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't live.</v>

119
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:00.914
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

120
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not a stupid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of low resolution idea.</v>

121
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>So is this chaotic intermingling of salt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and freshwater.</v>

122
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.123
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a chaos idea looking at the </v>

123
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.330
<v Speaker 1>bottom of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's APP suit and tie.</v>

124
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.193
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the Mesopotamians don't say much </v>

125
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:22.721
<v Speaker 1>about absolute and I kinda think that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think maybe that's because at that point</v>

126
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 1>society hadn't become so highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured that and,</v>

127
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>and long lasting that that is a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of it had been formed.</v>

128
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that happened until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptians,</v>

129
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>but I might be wrong about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>

130
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamians don't say much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute.</v>

131
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is tire mats down there </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the depths,</v>

132
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.633
<v Speaker 1>Sorta like the whale in Pinocchio fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very much like the whale in Pinocchio </v>

133
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.193
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her husband and they're locked together </v>

134
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.284
<v Speaker 1>in a sexual embrace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the idea here is that </v>

135
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>while the Union of opposites is </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary before something new can arise</v>

136
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.413
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that union of opposites can be </v>

137
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized in some way sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:04.634
<v Speaker 1>using male and female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when male and female come </v>

139
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:07.244
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something new emerges out of that and </v>

140
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 1>that sort of ideas like the matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the matrix of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mother matter,</v>

142
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things emerge out of a matrix.</v>

143
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

144
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:19.814
<v Speaker 1>absent soon time at are down there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the depths and they're locked together </v>

145
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>in the sexual embrace and they produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>offspring and lots of them.</v>

146
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.883
<v Speaker 1>So that's the initial world of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's all sorts of gods they give </v>

147
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:33.260
<v Speaker 1>rise to and we don't know a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

148
00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to make some hypotheses </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the gods because you might think,</v>

149
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are gods anyways,</v>

150
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

151
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.763
<v Speaker 1>I think about them as personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their personalities and their </v>

152
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:47.240
<v Speaker 1>archetypical personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like,</v>

153
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venus for example,</v>

154
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 1>is the god of love and I'll show you </v>
<v Speaker 1>some pictures of Venus.</v>

155
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>And so what does that mean exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.333
<v Speaker 1>it's like a complex of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venus is how you act when you're in </v>

157
00:07:58.191 --> 00:07:59.024
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venus is what people find sexually </v>

158
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 1>attractive in women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venus is the,</v>

159
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.153
<v Speaker 1>the possession that occurs when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in love or when you're really attracted </v>

160
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 1>to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all those things.</v>

161
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:12.530
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like a forest that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>invade you.</v>

162
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of perceiving.</v>

163
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.403
<v Speaker 1>It's a superordinate instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shared across not only human </v>

164
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but birds and bees as we all know.</v>

165
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a transcendent property and it,</v>

166
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.240
<v Speaker 1>it can take personified forum because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can inhabit you.</v>

167
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.553
<v Speaker 1>And so it's this thing that's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective and subjective and it's also </v>

168
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:35.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the fundamental elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

169
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's Venus for example,</v>

170
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:38.444
<v Speaker 1>and there's areas that's Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a god of war and he's usually </v>

171
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:44.380
<v Speaker 1>masculine and he's very aggressive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

172
00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:45.214
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a,</v>

173
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.350
<v Speaker 1>he's like the personality of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a warrior like rage.</v>

174
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

175
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.410
<v Speaker 1>so I kind of think about the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the more fundamental gods.</v>

176
00:08:56.411 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 1>There's something like primordial forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's a leap and I don't know about</v>

177
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:01.974
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it's a recapitulation </v>

178
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>in some sense of individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization.</v>

179
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think that what happens to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with is that,</v>

180
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

181
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.183
<v Speaker 1>as you emerge as an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start out in a chaotic and </v>

182
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>uninformed manner and then these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to life inside of you.</v>

183
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:22.763
<v Speaker 1>And those things are these fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems that we were </v>

184
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:25.674
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're the first products of </v>

185
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:28.344
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those things have to get their </v>

186
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:31.471
<v Speaker 1>act together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>So like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a leap and I haven't been able to</v>

188
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 1>completely fill in the gaps there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>

189
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 1>all these gods and goddesses get created</v>
<v Speaker 1>by time at an absolute right.</v>

190
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So then they're running around causing </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

191
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 1>The first God's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd make a lot of racket.</v>

192
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.433
<v Speaker 1>They're doing a lot of impulsive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy things and they make a lot of </v>

193
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 1>noise and they're not very cautious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they make a big mistake.</v>

194
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 1>They kill app suit and then they live on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body.</v>

195
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

196
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:06.181
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

197
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there?</v>

198
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:08.094
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute is masculine and so the </v>

199
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:12.870
<v Speaker 1>masculine thing seems to be associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way with God,</v>

200
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>the father and the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what does it mean if he's dead?</v>

201
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.723
<v Speaker 1>It means that all this chaotic activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's disintegrated has killed the </v>

202
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:25.050
<v Speaker 1>structure and so they're all now living </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a corpse,</v>

203
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.123
<v Speaker 1>which is not a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they didn't know what they </v>

204
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:32.910
<v Speaker 1>killed and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine they're careless.</v>

205
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:33.744
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what the hell's going </v>

206
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:36.090
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they break a bunch of rules and they</v>

207
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:37.470
<v Speaker 1>destroy the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

208
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.753
<v Speaker 1>the orderly element of what initially </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave rise to them and then they live on </v>

209
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:43.180
<v Speaker 1>it's corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In.</v>

210
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Another way of thinking about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's what you guys do.</v>

211
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 1>You're living on a corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're living on the corpse of the past,</v>

212
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the consequence of the activity</v>

213
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:55.500
<v Speaker 1>of the dead and it's dead because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the activity of the dead,</v>

214
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the library.</v>

215
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no life in a library except for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in it.</v>

216
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.670
<v Speaker 1>The rest of it's all ghosts.</v>

217
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 1>So you're living on the dead shell of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

218
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

219
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.583
<v Speaker 1>these guards are all making all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>racket and running around and spinning </v>

220
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:14.800
<v Speaker 1>up wind and dust and noise and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really chaotic and then they kill Appsu.</v>

221
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.631
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

222
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So absolute was also ordered.</v>

223
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens when you kill order?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you destroy order,</v>

224
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up comes chaos.</v>

225
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened in Iraq for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

226
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So time that comes up and she thinks,</v>

227
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about these things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

228
00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:38.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're really noisy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying and careless.</v>

229
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went and killed up suits.</v>

230
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:43.650
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's my current Saturdays necessary.</v>

231
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for them.</v>

232
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>They're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wipe them out.</v>

233
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like God deciding to wipe out </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody with the flood.</v>

234
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.323
<v Speaker 1>It's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These stories all came from the same </v>

235
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

236
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's another representation of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

237
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>It's also kind of have a vengeful God </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

238
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

239
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>what about this vengeful God idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

240
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:03.664
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really want to have a god that's </v>

241
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:04.984
<v Speaker 1>eventual?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a stupid question </v>

242
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 1>because you've got one whether you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>one or not.</v>

243
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's think about New Orleans,</v>

244
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:13.803
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So New Orleans got hit by a hurricane </v>

245
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:17.890
<v Speaker 1>and it was a natural disaster and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out a big chunk of the city,</v>

246
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

247
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't really right.</v>

248
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So the Dutch live underwater basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

249
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 1>The whole bloody country is below sea </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

250
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 1>So the dots make these huge dams and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they maintain them like Matt.</v>

251
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:34.264
<v Speaker 1>And here's the Dutch rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try to calculate the </v>

252
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 1>worst possible storm that could possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in 10,000</v>

253
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:44.170
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to build those damn</v>

254
00:12:44.171 --> 00:12:44.460
<v Speaker 1>dikes.</v>

255
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So if that storm comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're safe.</v>

256
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>

257
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Holland isn't underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no natural disaster.</v>

258
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.220
<v Speaker 1>So let's go to New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

259
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did Orleans get wiped out?</v>

260
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a hurricane.</v>

261
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.353
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they know that there might be </v>

262
00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>hurricanes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

263
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Did they know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dikes weren't big enough.</v>

264
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.593
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have they been complaining about it for </v>

265
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:07.630
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

266
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Have there been things put in place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get the dikes better?</v>

267
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did that work?</v>

268
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

269
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Because it's corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a corrupt state now.</v>

270
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:20.074
<v Speaker 1>All the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pour it in there too to help the </v>

271
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 1>people after the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the flood.</v>

272
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.660
<v Speaker 1>That didn't help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just disappeared.</v>

273
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:26.494
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the state is corrupt and the </v>

274
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 1>individuals within it or corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means the structure.</v>

275
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 1>The society is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a corpse.</v>

276
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.390
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when you make a corpse </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of your society?</v>

277
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:39.070
<v Speaker 1>A corrupt corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

278
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:39.904
<v Speaker 1>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature comes back and takes what </v>

279
00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:44.050
<v Speaker 1>she has and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

280
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:45.820
<v Speaker 1>isn't the world a terrible place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

281
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try not frittering away the money.</v>

282
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.030
<v Speaker 1>See what happens.</v>

283
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 1>It's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.493
<v Speaker 1>It's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a whole tangled up idea of </v>

285
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.540
<v Speaker 1>murderers and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get into that.</v>

286
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.530
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

287
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 1>so ty mass had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

288
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things aren't worth preserving.</v>

289
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:07.783
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go and wipe them out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then everything will be nice and calm </v>

290
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 1>and peaceful yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the gods,</v>

291
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:13.830
<v Speaker 1>they get wind of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.651
<v Speaker 1>and they're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

293
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 1>this isn't very good because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

294
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.273
<v Speaker 1>that's time out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about here she is mother </v>

295
00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:22.540
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in that inner terrible sense.</v>

296
00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:24.940
<v Speaker 1>And she creates everything and she kills</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

297
00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:26.750
<v Speaker 1>And if he decides that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.920
<v Speaker 1>going back to where we came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably what's going to happen.</v>

299
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:31.630
<v Speaker 1>So they're pretty blurry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about this.</v>

300
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.200
<v Speaker 1>So they get together in a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>council.</v>

301
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying to organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

302
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 1>say they get to get under under council </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they think,</v>

303
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:40.360
<v Speaker 1>oh well what are we going to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

304
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.583
<v Speaker 1>And so they elect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take one of their gods and they </v>

305
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:43.511
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

306
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:45.810
<v Speaker 1>why don't you go out there and try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.450
<v Speaker 1>keep time at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at bay and straightened her out.</v>

308
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.313
<v Speaker 1>So one God goes out and has a big fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>with tire Matt and comes back and he's </v>

309
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:55.970
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defeated and wiped out,</v>

310
00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.813
<v Speaker 1>not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then they send another God out </v>

311
00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:01.510
<v Speaker 1>and he's just completely useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work.</v>

312
00:15:01.511 --> 00:15:03.800
<v Speaker 1>It comes back and it was getting pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn desperate.</v>

313
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 1>They're in the realm of the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>gods and so this is going on for quite a</v>

314
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:09.134
<v Speaker 1>long time and while this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gods are still marrying each other </v>

315
00:15:12.111 --> 00:15:12.944
<v Speaker 1>and producing offspring and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one day this new sort of go onto </v>

316
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 1>peers on the scenes and his name is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin and Martin is.</v>

317
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.283
<v Speaker 1>He's a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not really sure what to do with </v>

318
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 1>them and he's got.</v>

319
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.720
<v Speaker 1>He can really hear and he can speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>magic words.</v>

320
00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>And so when he says magic words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day appears in the night disappears.</v>

321
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 1>And so he's got the power of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal.</v>

322
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 1>And he's got eyes all the way around his</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

323
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 1>You can see everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can really pay attention.</v>

324
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.373
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's big and he's strong and he's </v>

325
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:41.954
<v Speaker 1>tough and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the big things is he can speak and </v>

326
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 1>he can really seek and really pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

327
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 1>So the gods think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

328
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.353
<v Speaker 1>well he's kind of a new character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't thrown anything like that at </v>

329
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:53.450
<v Speaker 1>time matt yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

330
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.463
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they all get together in their </v>

331
00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Speaker 1>counsel and they bring it in and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

332
00:15:58.131 --> 00:15:58.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

333
00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of thinking to be a good idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you went out and fought this terrible</v>

334
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:02.054
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

335
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

336
00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:05.120
<v Speaker 1>you think that's a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

337
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 1>it's me on the line here so I need a </v>
<v Speaker 1>price.</v>

338
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And so the price is you make me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>determiner of destiny's.</v>

339
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Now that's an interesting phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

340
00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:17.960
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know exactly know what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant,</v>

341
00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:22.961
<v Speaker 1>but it's something like what I am that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marduk is now going to be the thing that</v>

342
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 1>determines how things unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like,</v>

343
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be taught God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may,</v>

344
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:33.650
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going off to fight time at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm top God.</v>

345
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.863
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you can define top God </v>

346
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 1>taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is the God that can go out and fight</v>

347
00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 1>tie imac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other,</v>

348
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.653
<v Speaker 1>the other guards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not very happy about having to </v>

349
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:43.514
<v Speaker 1>subordinate themselves to Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they think beats the hell out of </v>

350
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:47.300
<v Speaker 1>being eaten by ty amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they say,</v>

351
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

352
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get to be like top God,</v>

353
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:53.270
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the tablets of destiny,</v>

354
00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 1>you can determine destiny fight fine.</v>

355
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

356
00:16:57.321 --> 00:16:58.154
<v Speaker 1>Martin goes off and he gets his act </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and it gets big net and he </v>

357
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 1>prepares himself and he rides forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>and encounters time at.</v>

358
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>She's this great big dragon like monster</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's her there on the,</v>

359
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.323
<v Speaker 1>on the right left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see she's kind of a dragon </v>

360
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.060
<v Speaker 1>angel monster thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

361
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.923
<v Speaker 1>she is a monster and what she is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really an amalgam of frightening things </v>

362
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.210
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

363
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:24.044
<v Speaker 1>And there's Martech on the right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go give her a good </v>

364
00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:26.714
<v Speaker 1>whacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he goes out there and the first </v>

365
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:29.810
<v Speaker 1>thing he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is quite cool,</v>

366
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:30.973
<v Speaker 1>he encapsulate her in a net now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about that because she's </v>

367
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 1>basically natural chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the productivity of natural chaos.</v>

368
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.823
<v Speaker 1>And so what mark does is it encapsulates</v>
<v Speaker 1>her in the net and that's like a </v>

369
00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:43.880
<v Speaker 1>conceptual scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

370
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.713
<v Speaker 1>He puts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he puts boundaries around the chaos and </v>

371
00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:48.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what Margaret can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

372
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.093
<v Speaker 1>that's his ability with his ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak in his eyes and his capacity to </v>

373
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:53.400
<v Speaker 1>pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

374
00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.960
<v Speaker 1>he encloses her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

375
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 1>And so that's kind of hard on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't get out of the net.</v>

376
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.313
<v Speaker 1>And then he cuts her into pieces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he makes the world out of the </v>

377
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:01.674
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact one of Martin's names is he </v>

378
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:08.740
<v Speaker 1>who fashioned ingenious things out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the carcass of format,</v>

379
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.840
<v Speaker 1>which is so cool because it's a tool use</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor.</v>

380
00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:12.674
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you conquer nature while you go </v>

381
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:15.660
<v Speaker 1>in there and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

382
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.960
<v Speaker 1>will decompose it in many ways and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make weapons out of it and you make cool</v>

383
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:19.794
<v Speaker 1>things and that keeps it at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you do that by speaking and </v>

384
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:24.090
<v Speaker 1>paying attention.</v>

385
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 1>So that's what the Mesopotamians figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

386
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:27.084
<v Speaker 1>Now they didn't know that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they figured out because like the idea </v>

387
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:31.494
<v Speaker 1>was already there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was implicit in the dominance </v>

388
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:34.044
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and they were observing the </v>

389
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got their kingdom together.</v>

390
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 1>They were bringing tribes in from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

391
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the tribes had their stories and</v>

392
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:45.234
<v Speaker 1>then I'll know all those stories had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and so that's like the battle of </v>

393
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:49.614
<v Speaker 1>gods in the battle of the gardens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having all those stories had to fight </v>

394
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.943
<v Speaker 1>just like Islam and Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism and protestantism or all </v>

395
00:18:56.611 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 1>scrapping for dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're fighting.</v>

396
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.700
<v Speaker 1>How do we make sense out of this mess?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe take several thousand years,</v>

397
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.483
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamia gathered together all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these tribes and their stories and then </v>

398
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.883
<v Speaker 1>the stories fought and out of that fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged this story and that was a good </v>

399
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:13.230
<v Speaker 1>enough story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everyone was happy with it.</v>

400
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>And the story was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

401
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.663
<v Speaker 1>I know we have to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story was whatever Martin </v>

402
00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.160
<v Speaker 1>represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's top God.</v>

403
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.860
<v Speaker 1>And so what did he represent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vision,</v>

404
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.930
<v Speaker 1>attention and speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the Mesopotamians already figured</v>

405
00:19:31.931 --> 00:19:35.500
<v Speaker 1>out everything else should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate to vision,</v>

406
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.620
<v Speaker 1>attention and speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like good work.</v>

407
00:19:38.621 --> 00:19:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamians.</v>

408
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.023
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my daughter and she wants to pick </v>

409
00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:47.340
<v Speaker 1>me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

410
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Hi there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you?</v>

411
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bye.</v>

412
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.700
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one final thing.</v>

413
00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:02.150
<v Speaker 1>The Mesopotamian emperor emperor was </v>
<v Speaker 1>charged with the imitation of Martin.</v>

414
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what made him sovereign so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not arbitrary.</v>

415
00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:08.814
<v Speaker 1>It's like if he was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereign and he was going to be a good </v>

416
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:11.154
<v Speaker 1>sovereign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meant he had to be a good Marduk </v>

417
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.330
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk about that when we meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
