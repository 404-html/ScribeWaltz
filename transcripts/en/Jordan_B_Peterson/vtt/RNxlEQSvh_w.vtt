1
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.153
<v Speaker 2>last time we talked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to walk you through the </v>

3
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:31.684
<v Speaker 2>nervous system a little bit and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started with the monkey business </v>

4
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:36.304
<v Speaker 2>illusion and one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really remarkable about the monkey </v>

5
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:39.964
<v Speaker 2>business illusion is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and change blindness experiments in </v>

6
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 2>general is that they demonstrate to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to what degree you,</v>

7
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 2>you could either describe yourself as </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind or focused.</v>

8
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.030
<v Speaker 2>And I think focused is actually better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than blind.</v>

9
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.163
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a laser beam doesn't cover much </v>

10
00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:58.024
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really illuminates what it </v>

11
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 2>strikes and people are sort of like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were really beamed into a single point.</v>

12
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.683
<v Speaker 2>And there's something metaphysically </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular about that I think because </v>

13
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.673
<v Speaker 2>that single point that were narrowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to is in some thing some sense the </v>

14
00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:16.730
<v Speaker 2>thing that rates the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

15
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.400
<v Speaker 2>because as we interact with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're able to turn it one way or another</v>

16
00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 2>in all sorts of complicated ways.</v>

17
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 2>And I mean I know our powers and doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>so are obviously constrained to a,</v>

18
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 2>to a substantial degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>

19
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.230
<v Speaker 2>that focal point of concentration </v>
<v Speaker 2>enables us to interact with the world.</v>

20
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:39.220
<v Speaker 2>And then at least seemingly to change it</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to our will,</v>

21
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:41.904
<v Speaker 2>it's like we take a future that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential and we interact with are the </v>

23
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:45.484
<v Speaker 2>focal point and then it transforms </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself into a past that's in some sense </v>

24
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 2>fixed and real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty strange.</v>

25
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 2>So I guess you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't,</v>

26
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to underestimate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility of a point.</v>

27
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.373
<v Speaker 2>So I want to talk to you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>first about what you're blind to and </v>

28
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:03.964
<v Speaker 2>then what this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much of what the consequences of that </v>

29
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this here is a little diagram of a,</v>

30
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.860
<v Speaker 2>of a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

31
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 2>conceptual diagram of a computer and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's predicated on.</v>

32
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a quick story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I've told you this story,</v>

33
00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:26.554
<v Speaker 2>please stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think I've told you guys </v>

34
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:28.744
<v Speaker 2>this story.</v>

35
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.683
<v Speaker 2>So one day back in about 1987,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working on my computer and I was </v>

36
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.080
<v Speaker 2>typing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>long essay in doth.</v>

37
00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:41.914
<v Speaker 2>And you really had to backup in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>days because the programs didn't do any </v>

38
00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:46.384
<v Speaker 2>backup for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if the thing shut off and you </v>

39
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 2>hadn't been super careful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to lose all of it.</v>

40
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.380
<v Speaker 2>So that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was typing away,</v>

41
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 2>computer went off and so I had an </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional reaction to that right now,</v>

42
00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.773
<v Speaker 2>an emotional reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is kind of an interesting event </v>

43
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.164
<v Speaker 2>because I would say that you're not even</v>
<v Speaker 2>working with the computer until it </v>

44
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.473
<v Speaker 2>quits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I would say that is </v>

45
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 2>because if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the computer's functioning,</v>

46
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.893
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it's an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated device is basically </v>

47
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.104
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're working with roughly </v>

48
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>speaking is the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not really.</v>

49
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Not even the screen you're working with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the phrase or the or even the word</v>

50
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>that's presented on the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're typing the word phrase,</v>

51
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 2>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paragraph,</v>

52
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.773
<v Speaker 2>essay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and only out pass that domain of </v>

53
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 2>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you start thinking about the hardware</v>

54
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 2>technology that underlies what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing?</v>

55
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to think about that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

56
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 2>When something's working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to see it.</v>

57
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 2>And so that gives you a clue as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

58
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.443
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an error detecting and correcting </v>

59
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 2>phenomena and you're not conscious of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are going well,</v>

60
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which might explain to some degree why a</v>

61
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 2>lot of our life seems to be made up of </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering and all.</v>

62
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.943
<v Speaker 2>If things are going well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't exactly like you're happy if </v>

63
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 2>things are going well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just don't notice when they're going</v>

64
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:13.534
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes if they unexpectedly go well </v>

65
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:16.624
<v Speaker 2>then that makes you happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but otherwise it's just the same old </v>

66
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

67
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

68
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.683
<v Speaker 2>I was yesterday I was eating breakfast </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my son and I was complaining about </v>

69
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:32.761
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I have eat canned tuna </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't really like fish,</v>

70
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 2>but I have to eat fish for a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different reasons and I thought,</v>

71
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you complaining about?</v>

72
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean really you don't have tuna is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like most things are like,</v>

73
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 2>they're like small whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

74
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 2>They weighed 600 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're impossible to count.</v>

75
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>So there's some poor characters out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there hauling in tuna,</v>

76
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.363
<v Speaker 2>which is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they have to clean them and freeze </v>

77
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 2>them and smoke them and can them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

78
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:55.504
<v Speaker 2>I have to do is go to the store to pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>up this can of tuna and then I can </v>

79
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 2>complain about it for breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

80
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 2>it's really quite staggering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:07.441
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I can even ever eat a tuna</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a complete bloody miracle,</v>

82
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:10.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the sort of thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes me happy because,</v>

83
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just expect that which is very </v>

84
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 2>pathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's how it goes.</v>

85
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the computer.</v>

86
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.623
<v Speaker 2>So it stops working well and I would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I noticed the computer and </v>

87
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing more annoying than </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticing the computer when you're in the</v>

88
00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 2>middle of writing an essay because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell do you know about computers and</v>

89
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>own nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do?</v>

90
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Turn it on and off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

91
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem solving process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

92
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It usually works,</v>

93
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:40.054
<v Speaker 2>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then if it doesn't work well then </v>

94
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 2>you're into either the software or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardware.</v>

95
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.173
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turned it on and off of that didn't </v>

96
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:49.024
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then I turned on light to see if </v>

97
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:52.870
<v Speaker 2>if something had happened at the back of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

99
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.793
<v Speaker 2>but the light didn't go on so then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought a half the power of probably </v>

100
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:56.644
<v Speaker 2>went out or I blew a fuse so went and </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked to see if the fuse was burned </v>

101
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't.</v>

102
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>And then I noticed that all the power </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the house was off and then I noticed</v>

103
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 2>that I went outside down to the corner </v>
<v Speaker 2>store to get something.</v>

104
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:08.894
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I knew when I went outside I </v>

105
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:11.234
<v Speaker 2>noticed that all the street lights were </v>
<v Speaker 2>off and then the entire power grid in </v>

106
00:06:15.181 --> 00:06:16.014
<v Speaker 2>Montreal and was on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the entire power grid for like </v>

107
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 2>half of Quebec was out and a big chunk </v>
<v Speaker 2>of eastern North America.</v>

108
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 2>And do you know why have I told you this</v>
<v Speaker 2>story?</v>

109
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there was a solar flare.</v>

110
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

111
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 2>the sun is a big hydrogen bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if you guys know this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheerful piece of information for you if</v>

113
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:36.644
<v Speaker 2>you need to be cheered up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you had to have a hydrogen bomb </v>

114
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:40.560
<v Speaker 2>and you exploded it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.460
<v Speaker 2>a hydrogen bomb has an atom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb courts trigger pool.</v>

116
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.583
<v Speaker 2>Did you guys know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to know that because it's </v>

117
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 2>important because an atom bomb is a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

118
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.814
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just a trigger for a hydrogen </v>

119
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.544
<v Speaker 2>bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a hydrogen bomb is unimaginably </v>

120
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.033
<v Speaker 2>bigger than that and Adam ball anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you blew a hydrogen bomb in the </v>

121
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere over central North America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could probably wipe out maybe all of</v>

122
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 2>the electronic equipment in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>continent permanently.</v>

123
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Because what happens is when a hydrogen </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb goes off,</v>

124
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 2>there's an electromagnetic burst and has</v>
<v Speaker 2>that propagates,</v>

125
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 2>it'll hit your electronic equipment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>propagate across the wires and produce a</v>

126
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:20.840
<v Speaker 2>big spike in current voltage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

127
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 2>And it'll just low it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your car was,</v>

128
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.640
<v Speaker 2>were your tractors won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your work,</v>

129
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 2>your cars won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your computers won't work,</v>

130
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 2>your satellites won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>

131
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to cheer you up even more,</v>

132
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.590
<v Speaker 2>back in the late 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in the 18 sixties,</v>

133
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 2>there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

134
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.470
<v Speaker 2>uh Oh.</v>

135
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.303
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the sun is a big hydrogen bomb and </v>

136
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 2>now and then it freaks out and emits no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big solar flare,</v>

137
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 2>which is something that's gone wrong on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun and maybe it flows out the solar</v>

138
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 2>flare almost to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:56.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

140
00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orbit of mercury.</v>

141
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:00.044
<v Speaker 2>And then that burst of radiation comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>zooming towards earth and then nine </v>

142
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:05.114
<v Speaker 2>minutes later it hits and if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decent electromagnetic pulse than it'll </v>

143
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.390
<v Speaker 2>wipe up the power grid and come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened.</v>

144
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.583
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the reason my computer didn't work </v>

145
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 2>was because the son was misbehaving and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

146
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:21.950
<v Speaker 2>so I liked that it was very illuminating</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me because it just shows you how many</v>

147
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:22.784
<v Speaker 2>things have to be stacked on top of each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other working perfectly for some thing </v>

148
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 2>that you're doing to actually function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

149
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:32.440
<v Speaker 2>back in the late 18 hundreds in the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>

150
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.433
<v Speaker 2>there was a massive solar flare and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced a burst of power on the </v>

151
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 2>telegraph lines and it lit some </v>
<v Speaker 2>telegraph operators on fire.</v>

152
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.460
<v Speaker 2>And so this does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens about once a century.</v>

153
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:44.294
<v Speaker 2>And we just missed one last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So while you're worrying about global </v>

154
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>warming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be,</v>

155
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.820
<v Speaker 2>you can be considering the much higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that a solar flare,</v>

156
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 2>we'll knock out all of our electronics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and send us to like 1860.</v>

157
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 2>So the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a lot of,</v>

158
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.073
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of things going on to </v>

159
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 2>make up an object that you don't detect </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your vision.</v>

160
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you never think,</v>

161
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 2>well the reason that the computer works </v>
<v Speaker 2>is because the sun is,</v>

162
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting properly.</v>

163
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:12.264
<v Speaker 2>But it is of course the case that </v>
<v Speaker 2>endless numbers of things have to be </v>

164
00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 2>stabilized that you don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

165
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 2>well the sun isn't part of the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but well that's wrong.</v>

166
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not part of the computer in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense when it's behaving.</v>

167
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as it stops behaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's instantly part of the computer,</v>

168
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.290
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so here we've got</v>

169
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>

170
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:34.794
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say the power hadn't gone out in </v>

171
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:36.894
<v Speaker 2>the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped working and well then you might </v>

172
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll never buy that brand again.</v>

173
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe the brand is associated with,</v>

174
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the operation in some country where </v>

175
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 2>corruption is rife and things are made </v>
<v Speaker 2>in properly in the parts don't work very</v>

176
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might think,</v>

177
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:55.164
<v Speaker 2>well I made a stupid purchase decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course that's connected to the </v>

178
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:01.020
<v Speaker 2>political system of that place and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy and you know,</v>

179
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.063
<v Speaker 2>and then weird little things can happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>down at the micro level as well as the </v>

180
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 2>macro level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So computers have now got.</v>

181
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:10.250
<v Speaker 2>So the chips have now got so small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

182
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 2>they have little wires in them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

183
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.233
<v Speaker 2>The chips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wires now so small that because of </v>

184
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:15.534
<v Speaker 2>quantum uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So quantum uncertainty basically tells </v>

185
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 2>you that if you can't really tell how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where an electron is,</v>

186
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 2>if you want to know how fast it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't tell how fast it's going,</v>

187
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 2>if you want to know where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more than that,</v>

188
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:29.630
<v Speaker 2>it also says you can't really know where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the baby is.</v>

189
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that once you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get your wire short enough,</v>

190
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:33.204
<v Speaker 2>some of the electrons might not be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wires where they're supposed to be </v>

191
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Speaker 2>at the actually cause short circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's another issue.</v>

192
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.943
<v Speaker 2>There's other levels of reality that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>micro levels that you can't detect it </v>

193
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:44.274
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's macro levels that are way </v>

194
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:46.670
<v Speaker 2>beyond you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 2>political systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic systems,</v>

196
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 2>biological systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical systems outside of that.</v>

197
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:52.584
<v Speaker 2>And then there are these microsystems </v>
<v Speaker 2>layered all the way down and things can </v>

198
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 2>go wrong at any one of those levels.</v>

199
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of Max invisible to us.</v>

200
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.153
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing happens when something </v>

201
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 2>goes wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

202
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.200
<v Speaker 2>it's like what's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're,</v>

203
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 2>you're malfunctioning at the molecular </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

204
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.783
<v Speaker 2>your DNA isn't working properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get cancer or maybe some virus </v>

205
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.240
<v Speaker 2>which is even smaller than the DNA comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and takes up residence in that that's</v>

206
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.730
<v Speaker 2>really not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

207
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.613
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe you're eating something </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and you have an organ malfunction </v>

208
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.963
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe your family is screwed up and </v>

209
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:28.404
<v Speaker 2>you're stressed half to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason they're screwed up is </v>

210
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.863
<v Speaker 2>because of your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a radically a society that's </v>

211
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:37.100
<v Speaker 2>not friendly to your particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrant type.</v>

212
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 2>And so the real reason that you're sick </v>
<v Speaker 2>is because of,</v>

213
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's inability to get along with one</v>

214
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 2>another and so on and so forth and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

215
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:48.090
<v Speaker 2>And so God only knows where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to focus,</v>

216
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.330
<v Speaker 2>but focus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>

217
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.720
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

218
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.590
<v Speaker 2>motivation allows you to do is to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to focus on.</v>

219
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

220
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 2>there's all these things to focus on.</v>

221
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.640
<v Speaker 2>There's an infinite number of things to </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus on.</v>

222
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.020
<v Speaker 2>How in the world do you ever figured out</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to focus on anything?</v>

223
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer to that is evolution.</v>

224
00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like</v>

225
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.320
<v Speaker 2>you can view evolution in the following </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

226
00:12:25.321 --> 00:12:26.154
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

227
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.030
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of think about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>background of reality.</v>

228
00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I think the best way to think about if </v>
<v Speaker 2>it has this interplay of patterns,</v>

229
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.553
<v Speaker 2>complex patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like music and those patterns </v>

230
00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:39.360
<v Speaker 2>are always changing and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic weight.</v>

231
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.090
<v Speaker 2>And they exist at multiple levels just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like complex music does.</v>

232
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.670
<v Speaker 2>So then imagine that you're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to</v>

233
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.053
<v Speaker 2>to dance to the music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to align yourself to the music and it </v>

234
00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:53.100
<v Speaker 2>keeps changing on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so well,</v>

235
00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:54.120
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

236
00:12:54.121 --> 00:12:56.520
<v Speaker 2>if you can change that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can change for the music,</v>

237
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.130
<v Speaker 2>but if you can change then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not dancing anymore.</v>

238
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's assume that there's two ways of</v>

239
00:13:04.081 --> 00:13:08.010
<v Speaker 2>solving that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One way is just sheer number.</v>

240
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.383
<v Speaker 2>You're a single celled organism or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mosquito and you don't have that much </v>

241
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:14.340
<v Speaker 2>neural capacity for transformation.</v>

242
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.530
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't know what the melody is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be when you,</v>

243
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.390
<v Speaker 2>when you lay your eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a mosquito.</v>

244
00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:19.224
<v Speaker 2>And so you produce like a million eggs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of them can dance to the </v>

245
00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:25.980
<v Speaker 2>current beat and the others camp and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they all die.</v>

246
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.610
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what happens over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>course of evolution for a very,</v>

247
00:13:29.611 --> 00:13:30.444
<v Speaker 2>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The melody keeps changing and then what </v>

248
00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:37.830
<v Speaker 2>creatures do is propagate a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of variance of themselves.</v>

249
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.703
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of like small animals or</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish even or crayfish or that sort of </v>

250
00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:43.740
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

251
00:13:43.741 --> 00:13:44.574
<v Speaker 2>they just overproduce offspring like mad</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hope that one of them can dance to </v>

252
00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:50.190
<v Speaker 2>the current tune and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:13:50.191 --> 00:13:52.440
<v Speaker 2>we get three and a half billion years </v>
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

254
00:13:52.441 --> 00:13:54.420
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all are.</v>

255
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.520
<v Speaker 2>And what we've got is this dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous system and it enables us to take</v>

256
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.713
<v Speaker 2>an external pattern and map it to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurological pattern or multiple </v>

257
00:14:05.101 --> 00:14:07.830
<v Speaker 2>neurological patterns because we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpret things right?</v>

258
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.610
<v Speaker 2>And then to output that to multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral patterns.</v>

259
00:14:11.611 --> 00:14:12.444
<v Speaker 2>And so in some sense what we've done is </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've internalized the process of </v>

260
00:14:15.931 --> 00:14:20.760
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary variation into ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Camorra complex.</v>

261
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.623
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more layers your nervous system has </v>

262
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.683
<v Speaker 2>imagined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a pattern on your skin and then </v>

263
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:28.350
<v Speaker 2>that's interpreted by a pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nerves.</v>

264
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.700
<v Speaker 2>And then those nerves have an output </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

265
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.543
<v Speaker 2>Sensory nerves will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then those have an output to motor </v>

266
00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:35.394
<v Speaker 2>nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then how those have an output to </v>

267
00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:37.620
<v Speaker 2>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's you roughly.</v>

268
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:38.803
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're maybe a four layer thing in that </v>

269
00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:44.040
<v Speaker 2>regard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you grow all these extra layers</v>

270
00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:45.530
<v Speaker 2>of neural tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.480
<v Speaker 2>so that the layers are hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells,</v>

272
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.400
<v Speaker 2>thick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one hundreds of layers thick,</v>

273
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:51.234
<v Speaker 2>and then you can map a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns in the external world onto a </v>

274
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.144
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of patterns in the neuro </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and then onto a whole bunch of </v>

275
00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:02.450
<v Speaker 2>patterns in the motor world and so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you dynamically adaptable.</v>

276
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 2>But you learned all that through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly painful process of evolution,</v>

277
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:12.160
<v Speaker 2>which basically consisted of the death </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like 99 point nine,</v>

278
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.003
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine percent of everything that ever </v>

279
00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 2>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Species and individuals alike.</v>

280
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 2>So now why is that relevant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

281
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 2>how do you figure out how to focus in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

282
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big part of that is actually,</v>

283
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 2>let's see how we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

284
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:33.890
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you focusing on in here?</v>

285
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not poisonous snakes and you know,</v>

286
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 2>rampaging lions and chimpanzees because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not in here.</v>

287
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 2>And the reason they're not in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

288
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.870
<v Speaker 2>is because while you live in a culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very,</v>

289
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:47.690
<v Speaker 2>very highly advanced and it's got walls </v>
<v Speaker 2>like mad,</v>

290
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:51.110
<v Speaker 2>this is a carcassone I think of a French</v>
<v Speaker 2>city of medieval city.</v>

291
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Speaker 2>It's still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful City.</v>

292
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.370
<v Speaker 2>You'll see how the medieval people solve</v>
<v Speaker 2>this problem.</v>

293
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:56.061
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

294
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 2>you can't deal with much.</v>

295
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what do we do?</v>

296
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Build some walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep a bunch of stuff out.</v>

297
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.453
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rampaging barbarians then because they </v>

298
00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:04.364
<v Speaker 2>just can't get in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of the reason that you can </v>

299
00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:07.334
<v Speaker 2>handle the insane complexity of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is because it's not even </v>

300
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:11.350
<v Speaker 2>neurological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

301
00:16:11.351 --> 00:16:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It has virtually nothing to do with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>physiology.</v>

302
00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:16.650
<v Speaker 2>It's just that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

303
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:17.743
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a university and the </v>

304
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:20.834
<v Speaker 2>university is protected by the city and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the city is protected by the province </v>

305
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:24.554
<v Speaker 2>and the province is protected by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and the country is protected by </v>

306
00:16:26.871 --> 00:16:30.560
<v Speaker 2>its know all of its multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>entanglements and you're just,</v>

307
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you're inside walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside walls,</v>

308
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:34.430
<v Speaker 2>inside walls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside walls and so on.</v>

309
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:35.264
<v Speaker 2>And so your role is pretty simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just sit there in relative </v>

310
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:41.060
<v Speaker 2>warmth and comfort and not have to worry</v>
<v Speaker 2>about anything.</v>

311
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.490
<v Speaker 2>So that's one solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a cultural solution,</v>

312
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.601
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

313
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:45.434
<v Speaker 2>inside the cultural solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's architectural </v>

314
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:48.164
<v Speaker 2>solutions of various sorts and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's political and economic </v>

315
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:52.244
<v Speaker 2>institutions that are pretty stable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they keep you from having to deal with </v>

316
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.340
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could see that chaos breaking</v>

317
00:16:58.341 --> 00:16:59.174
<v Speaker 2>out a little bit in the previous weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the American election because </v>

318
00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:07.070
<v Speaker 2>the trump people in the left wingers are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going at it at the trump rallies and you</v>

319
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:08.820
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that's just tinder.</v>

320
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.673
<v Speaker 2>That could just blow up at any point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of that protection that's </v>

321
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:17.420
<v Speaker 2>there because of these very complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>games that we've agreed to play,</v>

322
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:19.960
<v Speaker 2>like the democracy game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

323
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.120
<v Speaker 2>that just all flies by the wayside and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you have to content with</v>

324
00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:25.790
<v Speaker 2>what people are like and that is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you want to do.</v>

325
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.153
<v Speaker 2>Those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they they're capable of anything which </v>

326
00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 2>is good but also really bad.</v>

327
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Well then the next thing is you've got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>body now.</v>

328
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:39.290
<v Speaker 2>That's where the evolutionary process </v>
<v Speaker 2>really kicks in and so your.</v>

329
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.393
<v Speaker 2>The reason your body is the way it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking is because it's </v>

330
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.990
<v Speaker 2>mimicked the external environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just like you know,</v>

331
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.933
<v Speaker 2>piaget talks about children using their </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies to mimic the external </v>

332
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:53.810
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

333
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.013
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily your body is set up through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this evolutionary process so that you </v>

334
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 2>could focus on precisely that subset of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

335
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:02.904
<v Speaker 2>That seems to keep something like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>going for long enough for you to make </v>

336
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:06.684
<v Speaker 2>another one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's more or less like you </v>

337
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 2>and you know that it only really works </v>
<v Speaker 2>for about 100 years.</v>

338
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:13.583
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty much where it pops out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't solve the problem very </v>

339
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:17.994
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't solve the problem of radical </v>

340
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:23.610
<v Speaker 2>complexity very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you solve it well enough so that you</v>

341
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:25.140
<v Speaker 2>live long enough to reproduce.</v>

342
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.033
<v Speaker 2>Speaking strictly biological and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>appears to be good enough and part of </v>

343
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:34.020
<v Speaker 2>the reason why you seem to expire </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might think,</v>

344
00:18:34.021 --> 00:18:37.530
<v Speaker 2>well if I evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like why don't people just live for</v>

345
00:18:37.531 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 2>like 500 years instead of 100 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

346
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:40.554
<v Speaker 2>because you think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who could continue to reproduce </v>

347
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.253
<v Speaker 2>for 200 years instead of 100 years would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have it all over someone who could only </v>

348
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:50.574
<v Speaker 2>manage it for 50 years say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that your genes have a </v>

349
00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:56.030
<v Speaker 2>better time of it if you just put them </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a new body</v>

350
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.583
<v Speaker 2>and shuffle off this mortal coil so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not using up too many resources </v>

351
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:03.450
<v Speaker 2>while your children and grandchildren </v>
<v Speaker 2>are trying to,</v>

352
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

353
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.910
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to,</v>

354
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.230
<v Speaker 2>that's an evolutionary solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

355
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.093
<v Speaker 2>Death is not technically inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are creatures that are roughly </v>

356
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.490
<v Speaker 2>immortal gold fish for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really annoying.</v>

357
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.323
<v Speaker 2>So like really goldfish because their </v>
<v Speaker 2>cart and cart basically just keep </v>

358
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 2>growing and it isn't obvious that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sent us or,</v>

359
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:26.703
<v Speaker 2>or age they get killed because they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get diseases and this sort of </v>

360
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:31.700
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

361
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.543
<v Speaker 2>there are 300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 year old carp and some turtles seem </v>

362
00:19:35.251 --> 00:19:37.520
<v Speaker 2>to not a age really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

363
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 2>and then of course your DNA is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for ever since life started.</v>

364
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.003
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't really age either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it corrects itself so things can </v>

365
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 2>last a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very long time,</v>

366
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:51.210
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not us.</v>

367
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.313
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were put inside of this floor and he </v>

368
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.790
<v Speaker 2>frames things for us and starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrowing things down.</v>

369
00:19:57.791 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 2>In this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

370
00:19:59.011 --> 00:19:59.844
<v Speaker 2>our psychophysiological cells have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>limited range of interests and desires </v>

371
00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:07.530
<v Speaker 2>and needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however you want to construe that,</v>

372
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that gets instantiated more </v>

373
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.400
<v Speaker 2>into the nervous system.</v>

374
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.743
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mistake to think people always </v>

375
00:20:14.041 --> 00:20:14.874
<v Speaker 2>think your brain is in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really not a very bright way </v>

376
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:17.604
<v Speaker 2>of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly why we think that </v>

377
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:22.170
<v Speaker 2>way because while there's the nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

378
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.153
<v Speaker 2>you can see it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of your nervous system </v>

379
00:20:26.251 --> 00:20:27.800
<v Speaker 2>that's not in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

380
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the volume,</v>

381
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.190
<v Speaker 2>the motor and sensory systems are </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed throughout your body.</v>

382
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.443
<v Speaker 2>Your spine is smart enough so that if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets severed and we put you over top of </v>

383
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 2>a treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspend you,</v>

384
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:38.844
<v Speaker 2>you can walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know you're walking and you </v>

385
00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 2>can't control it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your legs,</v>

386
00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 2>we'll do a perfectly good job of walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>without you being involved at all.</v>

387
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.800
<v Speaker 2>So your spine is brain tissue for all </v>
<v Speaker 2>intents and purposes.</v>

388
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.180
<v Speaker 2>You're brain is distributed through your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

389
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.700
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>

390
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:59.701
<v Speaker 2>it's evolved so that it's pretty good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>going around specifying what it needs.</v>

391
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the hypothalamus the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day.</v>

393
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.690
<v Speaker 2>That was it and how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

394
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.573
<v Speaker 2>accounts for what I called </v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonalities that are motivated </v>

395
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 2>towards particular ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those ends are,</v>

396
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously the things that we would </v>

397
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 2>identify as fundamental biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessities,</v>

398
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.003
<v Speaker 2>but then they transformed themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we interact socially into more and more </v>

399
00:21:28.301 --> 00:21:31.630
<v Speaker 2>complex fundamental biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessities.</v>

400
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:32.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

401
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.283
<v Speaker 2>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tricky thing because people talk </v>

402
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 2>about needs as if they're biologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantiated.</v>

403
00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.933
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're the fundamental building </v>

404
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:43.120
<v Speaker 2>elements of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not really that obvious a.</v>

405
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

406
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:48.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being hungry as a biological need,</v>

407
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:52.910
<v Speaker 2>but being a doctor isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well not really because you know,</v>

408
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:53.763
<v Speaker 2>if you do end up being a physician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pretty much solve the food </v>

409
00:21:56.531 --> 00:21:58.720
<v Speaker 2>acquisition problem permanently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

410
00:21:58.721 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a higher order </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of the same thing and it's</v>

411
00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:03.544
<v Speaker 2>higher order because instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating once you eat everyday for the </v>

412
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:09.160
<v Speaker 2>next 40 years and instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding you,</v>

413
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.800
<v Speaker 2>you feed you and your family and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>some other people too.</v>

414
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.800
<v Speaker 2>So thinking of that as something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't rooted in biology is not accurate.</v>

415
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.843
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of a continuous </v>

416
00:22:19.031 --> 00:22:24.031
<v Speaker 2>complexification from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the simple local time bound,</v>

417
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.373
<v Speaker 2>a</v>
<v Speaker 2>immature subpersonalities that can only </v>

418
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:30.994
<v Speaker 2>fulfill themselves in this moment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>with help to the development of those </v>

419
00:22:34.991 --> 00:22:35.824
<v Speaker 2>circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I would say is your personality </v>

420
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:41.830
<v Speaker 2>that are capable of providing you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you need in order to live and to be</v>

421
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 2>attractive to other people across very </v>
<v Speaker 2>large spans of time.</v>

422
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:45.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

423
00:22:45.961 --> 00:22:48.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like a tree expanding upward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good.</v>

424
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a good metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

425
00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's fine.</v>

426
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:54.424
<v Speaker 2>So that's motivation sets up your </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual frame and so people often </v>

427
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:02.800
<v Speaker 2>talk about motivation as if it's a drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a need,</v>

428
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:03.693
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that those terms are particularly </v>

429
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:05.734
<v Speaker 2>well defined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A drive I suppose is a deterministic </v>

430
00:23:08.531 --> 00:23:11.200
<v Speaker 2>sequence of motor output,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

431
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.423
<v Speaker 2>but it's not accurate because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation actually it specifies what </v>

432
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:21.421
<v Speaker 2>you look at and specifies right what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it's.</v>

433
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.600
<v Speaker 2>And then it specifies as well what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to respond to emotionally.</v>

434
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.173
<v Speaker 2>So just imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say I'd offered a $10,000 prize for the </v>

435
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:33.874
<v Speaker 2>person who counts the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>basketballs correctly and then you know </v>

436
00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:38.404
<v Speaker 2>you're doing your best to count the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of basketballs in the monkey </v>

437
00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:45.100
<v Speaker 2>illusion and somebody stands up in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you like this and blocks your view.</v>

438
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what emotion are you going to feel?</v>

439
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

440
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.733
<v Speaker 2>In all likelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that might be anxiety because </v>

441
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:55.023
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be fear or anxiety because </v>

442
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.104
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also fear because what the hell is </v>

443
00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:05.330
<v Speaker 2>this crazy person doing anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

444
00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 2>That's another negative emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

445
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:10.250
<v Speaker 2>There's a positive attack element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

446
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration,</v>

447
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 2>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe some grief,</v>

448
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:14.384
<v Speaker 2>like a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm differentiate mess of negative </v>

449
00:24:16.341 --> 00:24:17.690
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

450
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:19.160
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

451
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:24.161
<v Speaker 2>in some sense the motivational system </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifies the map and the,</v>

452
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:25.940
<v Speaker 2>and the goal.</v>

453
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a little more complicated though </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it also specifies where you are,</v>

454
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:32.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you can think about it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a map with a,</v>

455
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.870
<v Speaker 2>with a destination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why stories are like that,</v>

456
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we inhabit Lumax Max like that </v>

457
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what emotions do,</v>

458
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:46.640
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking is telling you whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not things are going the way you want</v>

459
00:24:46.641 --> 00:24:47.474
<v Speaker 2>them to as you're on that path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the emotions in some sense have </v>

460
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 2>to have a motivational specification </v>
<v Speaker 2>before their,</v>

461
00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:56.650
<v Speaker 2>before their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

462
00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.850
<v Speaker 2>before they're properly functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

463
00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.680
<v Speaker 2>what should you get angry at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

464
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:01.514
<v Speaker 2>generally you get angry at things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>either interfere with your progression </v>

465
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:08.390
<v Speaker 2>towards a valued goal or upset the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire.</v>

466
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.090
<v Speaker 2>Some personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:13.520
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that contains the goal itself.</v>

468
00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 2>That's a more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a more,</v>

469
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

470
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.730
<v Speaker 2>That's a more serious failure.</v>

471
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have to,</v>

472
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.930
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing to fail when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do something.</v>

473
00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:26.990
<v Speaker 2>It's another thing to fail so hard you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to give up the whole project.</v>

474
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.343
<v Speaker 2>We would rather just fail at sub sub </v>
<v Speaker 2>element then have to give up the whole </v>

475
00:25:31.111 --> 00:25:31.731
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

476
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:32.564
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing to fail an exam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another thing to fail out of </v>

477
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

478
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.630
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason for that,</v>

479
00:25:38.631 --> 00:25:39.464
<v Speaker 2>I thought about that for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it worse to fail out of </v>

480
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.093
<v Speaker 2>university?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assuming you want to be in university </v>

481
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 2>then it is to fail an exam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does your brain compute that?</v>

482
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.733
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can't tell all the </v>

483
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:52.130
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

484
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:52.964
<v Speaker 2>So it's not self evident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that it's something </v>

485
00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:59.480
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about these,</v>

486
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.463
<v Speaker 2>these functional subpersonalities as </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a temporal and spacial range of </v>

487
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 2>application.</v>

488
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.373
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a university student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're sort of stabilized for like </v>

489
00:26:11.631 --> 00:26:12.530
<v Speaker 2>four years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

490
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Wherever you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

491
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:14.781
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

492
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:16.190
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>

493
00:26:16.191 --> 00:26:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm a university student and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy about that.</v>

494
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from an economic perspective,</v>

495
00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:25.370
<v Speaker 2>it's probably worse than being </v>
<v Speaker 2>unemployed,</v>

496
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some sense and,</v>

497
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:30.410
<v Speaker 2>but if you can't just go tell people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're unemployed and then you have</v>

498
00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:32.990
<v Speaker 2>a nice little high status slot in </v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

499
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:33.824
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can do that as a university </v>

500
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:36.280
<v Speaker 2>student,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.153
<v Speaker 2>so it fulfills your social obligations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it makes you feel like you're doing </v>

502
00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:42.230
<v Speaker 2>something at least vaguely useful and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean apart from the learning and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other things that are positive about</v>

504
00:26:45.361 --> 00:26:46.940
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is,</v>

505
00:26:46.941 --> 00:26:50.910
<v Speaker 2>is that map basically covers a space and</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

506
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.430
<v Speaker 2>The time is four years in the space is </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

507
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.820
<v Speaker 2>You go during those four years and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>if that map burns up,</v>

508
00:26:56.821 --> 00:26:57.654
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're exposed on all fronts </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that entire four year period and </v>

509
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.890
<v Speaker 2>that might even be the two years </v>
<v Speaker 2>previously.</v>

510
00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

511
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.343
<v Speaker 2>because it's strange to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you bail out of university </v>

512
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.303
<v Speaker 2>halfway through your third year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've also structured the map that you </v>

513
00:27:16.141 --> 00:27:16.974
<v Speaker 2>use to organize your memories in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of the previous two and a half </v>

514
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:20.911
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

515
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:21.744
<v Speaker 2>Because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were the memories of someone who's </v>

516
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.503
<v Speaker 2>doing just fine and going through </v>
<v Speaker 2>university and now all of a sudden </v>

517
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 2>they're the memories of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed.</v>

518
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't the same memories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's weird that you know,</v>

519
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:34.260
<v Speaker 2>it's weird that an error can alter the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

520
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

521
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.583
<v Speaker 2>but you can and often does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean break any relationship breakup </v>

522
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.950
<v Speaker 2>that's of any significance will do </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same thing.</v>

523
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:44.783
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you are trading right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not just the present and </v>

524
00:27:47.791 --> 00:27:48.624
<v Speaker 2>the future that dissolve into chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take you on a little trip to the </v>

525
00:27:51.631 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 2>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also your revision.</v>

526
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.210
<v Speaker 2>You're the necessity of revising your </v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

527
00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then I would say,</v>

528
00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:00.744
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>failing a class while the class will be </v>

529
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.943
<v Speaker 2>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you in some sense and focuses you for a </v>

530
00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:08.110
<v Speaker 2>certain subset of the general going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>university map.</v>

531
00:28:08.111 --> 00:28:08.944
<v Speaker 2>So it's going to be less traumatizing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do poorly on a class than it is to fail </v>

532
00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:18.861
<v Speaker 2>out of university because the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>space and time that goes respective maps</v>

533
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:19.974
<v Speaker 2>covers differs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you're trying to do always </v>

534
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.023
<v Speaker 2>is to lay out under a functional game </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way of thinking about it </v>

535
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 2>on the spacetime territory that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabit.</v>

536
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.423
<v Speaker 2>And if you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can start to understand a </v>

537
00:28:34.261 --> 00:28:35.550
<v Speaker 2>little bit about emotions.</v>

538
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.600
<v Speaker 2>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

539
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

540
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:43.710
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to put a little Coda in there.</v>

541
00:28:43.711 --> 00:28:47.310
<v Speaker 2>And that's the motivations and emotions </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not technical terms.</v>

542
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.680
<v Speaker 2>There's sort of like in an ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

543
00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:50.514
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

544
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 2>their turns that you can use to </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure a debate.</v>

545
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.863
<v Speaker 2>Like I showed you the hypothalamus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it's made out of the Volvo's </v>

546
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 2>little nuclei.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not the same.</v>

547
00:28:58.171 --> 00:29:01.620
<v Speaker 2>So you can't say that every part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus is doing something that you</v>

548
00:29:01.621 --> 00:29:02.454
<v Speaker 2>can fit into a class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motivation and motivations and emotions </v>

549
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:07.230
<v Speaker 2>overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

550
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say hunger.</v>

551
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.410
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be some of them overseeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>more purely motivation.</v>

552
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you have a,</v>

553
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.800
<v Speaker 2>an unsettling altercation with someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>at tends not to make you hungry now.</v>

554
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it might make you angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might make you happy,</v>

555
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it might make you sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

556
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.130
<v Speaker 2>so hunger is something that seems to pop</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

557
00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 2>one of these maps and then emotions </v>
<v Speaker 2>guide your way through it or telling you</v>

558
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:37.800
<v Speaker 2>where you are on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you have complex motivation,</v>

559
00:29:37.801 --> 00:29:42.801
<v Speaker 2>emotions like pain and also anger </v>
<v Speaker 2>because pain has a goal in it,</v>

560
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:43.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

561
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Get away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>

562
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 2>or stop or get away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's usually get away,</v>

563
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.290
<v Speaker 2>but it also has an emotional feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

564
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:53.020
<v Speaker 2>It feels bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it feels like an emotion.</v>

565
00:29:53.021 --> 00:29:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grief is like pain.</v>

566
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Disappointment is like pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

567
00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loneliness is like paint and I mean this</v>

568
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:03.184
<v Speaker 2>technically all of those things can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>addressed rather successfully with </v>

569
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:08.740
<v Speaker 2>opiates by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So technically they're the same,</v>

570
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.880
<v Speaker 2>but pain you can't really be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is being hurt in emotion.</v>

571
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.040
<v Speaker 2>While people will say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel hurt,</v>

572
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.143
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anger is another one of those that </v>

573
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 2>sort of ambivalent because anger has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>

574
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

575
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.120
<v Speaker 2>remove obstacle removed or destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>obstacle in a sense.</v>

576
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.180
<v Speaker 2>That's the goal of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people talk about it as an emotion,</v>

577
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.133
<v Speaker 2>so we're oversimplifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter because it's useful </v>

578
00:30:37.251 --> 00:30:39.920
<v Speaker 2>oversimplification and that sort of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>a theory is.</v>

579
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>useful oversimplification.</v>

580
00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.480
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

581
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I kind of laid out what I think are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic motivations there.</v>

582
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirst,</v>

583
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>

584
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.303
<v Speaker 2>thermal regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be too hot or too </v>

585
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:00.940
<v Speaker 2>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Panic or escape,</v>

586
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.020
<v Speaker 2>affiliation or care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual desire,</v>

587
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.153
<v Speaker 2>exploration play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can kind of divide those into </v>

588
00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:12.820
<v Speaker 2>self maintenance motivations and south </v>
<v Speaker 2>propagation motivations.</v>

589
00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:13.654
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of just a way to keep track of </v>

590
00:31:16.391 --> 00:31:17.860
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then emotions.</v>

591
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.023
<v Speaker 2>So the hypothalamus is involved in law </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not the only thing but it's </v>

592
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:22.450
<v Speaker 2>involved in a lot of that.</v>

593
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.443
<v Speaker 2>So here's sort of how I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized one of these maps and </v>

594
00:31:28.171 --> 00:31:29.680
<v Speaker 2>we've seen this thing before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

595
00:31:29.681 --> 00:31:33.900
<v Speaker 2>you're at point a because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>using a map or if you're in a game,</v>

596
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.630
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a starting point or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a player.</v>

597
00:31:36.631 --> 00:31:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Either way there's you there and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going somewhere,</v>

598
00:31:40.081 --> 00:31:40.914
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to do something to get </v>

599
00:31:41.911 --> 00:31:42.541
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

600
00:31:42.541 --> 00:31:45.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's the little map and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go make a peanut butter sandwich</v>

601
00:31:45.481 --> 00:31:46.314
<v Speaker 2>or you have to turn the thermostat down </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you need to call your friend or </v>

602
00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:49.860
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

603
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:50.933
<v Speaker 2>it's the same kind of structure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using in all those different </v>

604
00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:55.830
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they switch,</v>

605
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're finished being hungry,</v>

606
00:31:58.381 --> 00:31:59.820
<v Speaker 2>now you're thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then your lonesome,</v>

607
00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:02.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it says if this,</v>

608
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.910
<v Speaker 2>it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one damn thing after another,</v>

609
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.893
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what keeps you alive and </v>

610
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:12.840
<v Speaker 2>you have to be chasing things all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time because your natural tendency is to</v>

611
00:32:12.841 --> 00:32:14.400
<v Speaker 2>run out of fuel and became.</v>

612
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.530
<v Speaker 2>And so that's entropy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to fight that.</v>

613
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:17.933
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a continual battle because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty organized and it's really </v>

614
00:32:21.001 --> 00:32:24.660
<v Speaker 2>hard for something that organized to </v>
<v Speaker 2>just stay organized.</v>

615
00:32:24.661 --> 00:32:26.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot easier.</v>

616
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:28.020
<v Speaker 2>There's a million ways to mess up your </v>
<v Speaker 2>route.</v>

617
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.190
<v Speaker 2>There's like one way to clean it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 10 years,</v>

618
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.303
<v Speaker 2>but you get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then it's the same with anything </v>

619
00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:36.204
<v Speaker 2>that's extraordinarily complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not that many ways it can stay </v>

620
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.093
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of ways it can fall </v>

621
00:32:41.091 --> 00:32:41.924
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why you're running all the </v>

622
00:32:43.071 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 2>time on a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fighting the second.</v>

623
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.393
<v Speaker 2>Is it the second law of thermodynamics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is entropy the second law of </v>

624
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 2>thermodynamics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>

625
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 2>that's a major one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

626
00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.450
<v Speaker 2>good luck in your scrap because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to need it.</v>

627
00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:58.893
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of these little underlying </v>

628
00:33:02.451 --> 00:33:03.284
<v Speaker 2>biological systems pop up the primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>maps and then those are elaborated </v>

629
00:33:07.281 --> 00:33:08.114
<v Speaker 2>upward into maps that are more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated and the more and more </v>

630
00:33:10.131 --> 00:33:10.964
<v Speaker 2>complicated maps maybe solve two </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems at the same time for a week or </v>

631
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:17.000
<v Speaker 2>they solve 10 problems at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 20 years.</v>

632
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.240
<v Speaker 2>That's why you want a job or a career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

633
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole bunch of problems are </v>
<v Speaker 2>solved all immediately as soon as you're</v>

634
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.123
<v Speaker 2>employed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean you have some other problems </v>

635
00:33:27.471 --> 00:33:31.550
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's inescapable anyways.</v>

636
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.473
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're inside one of these so you're </v>

637
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:34.484
<v Speaker 2>always motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always running around after </v>

638
00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:37.030
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

639
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.873
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing to know too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the basic state of human beings </v>

640
00:33:41.361 --> 00:33:43.160
<v Speaker 2>is not quite essence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

641
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 2>you're not napping in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fireplace.</v>

642
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.220
<v Speaker 2>If you're not pursuing something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're motivated to pursue,</v>

643
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.293
<v Speaker 2>then generally what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out how to pursue other things </v>

644
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:56.060
<v Speaker 2>that you're motivated to pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exploration.</v>

645
00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:01.090
<v Speaker 2>So if you're not actively motivated by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by biological necessity will say for the</v>

646
00:34:01.881 --> 00:34:02.714
<v Speaker 2>sake of simplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the next motivation kicks in is </v>

647
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:08.660
<v Speaker 2>which well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare for the next time that you're so</v>

648
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>motivated and that really accounts for </v>
<v Speaker 2>our capacity to explore and we're always</v>

649
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.100
<v Speaker 2>zooming around the world and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what to do with it next,</v>

650
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:16.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquiring more information or even when </v>

651
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:23.030
<v Speaker 2>we're entertaining ourselves because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost always looking at stories when we</v>

652
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:23.900
<v Speaker 2>entertain ourselves.</v>

653
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:24.763
<v Speaker 2>We're still acquiring the information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has functional significance and so </v>

654
00:34:28.341 --> 00:34:29.174
<v Speaker 2>attractive to us that we find it </v>
<v Speaker 2>innately rewarding just to observe that </v>

655
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:33.704
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's even in strange situations like </v>

656
00:34:36.531 --> 00:34:38.530
<v Speaker 2>people will go to horror movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

657
00:34:38.531 --> 00:34:39.380
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with,</v>

658
00:34:39.381 --> 00:34:40.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

659
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.820
<v Speaker 2>the why do you want to go get scared or </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusted because that's horror,</v>

660
00:34:43.821 --> 00:34:44.654
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fear and disgust that this plane </v>

661
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:47.954
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horror movies like the Blair witch </v>

662
00:34:49.341 --> 00:34:51.290
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty much all fear and then you</v>

663
00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:52.124
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the slasher movies and that sort of </v>

664
00:34:52.881 --> 00:34:55.190
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty much all discussed and you</v>

665
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:56.024
<v Speaker 2>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why bother exposing yourself to </v>

666
00:34:57.441 --> 00:35:02.441
<v Speaker 2>that and part of it is get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

667
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.463
<v Speaker 2>it's exposure because life has </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying elements and it has </v>

668
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:10.390
<v Speaker 2>disgusting elements and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to learn to,</v>

669
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.910
<v Speaker 2>to maintain yourself in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

670
00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:14.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean certainly illness is going to </v>

671
00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:21.390
<v Speaker 2>challenge your capacity to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgust and you know,</v>

672
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 2>there's any number of reasons to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified.</v>

673
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:27.650
<v Speaker 2>So you go to movies and you practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>facing.</v>

674
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Then you observed that you can know and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's other motivations too,</v>

675
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.073
<v Speaker 2>but those are the sort of the healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that go along with people wanting </v>

676
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:38.670
<v Speaker 2>to expose themselves to dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

677
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.133
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even in that you see exploration in </v>

678
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:45.720
<v Speaker 2>the preparation for what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen next and the exploratory circuits</v>

679
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:47.320
<v Speaker 2>and very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fundamental circuit.</v>

680
00:35:47.321 --> 00:35:49.200
<v Speaker 2>It's also hypothyroid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ironically mediated.</v>

681
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.870
<v Speaker 2>So the way the hypothalamus works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite cool,</v>

682
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:52.704
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

683
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.610
<v Speaker 2>on one hand it pops up all these little </v>
<v Speaker 2>maps that you can occupy that did have,</v>

684
00:35:58.611 --> 00:36:01.360
<v Speaker 2>the court will say biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessities,</v>

685
00:36:01.361 --> 00:36:02.194
<v Speaker 2>so roughly Freud's id,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when those things all shut down </v>

686
00:36:04.971 --> 00:36:08.150
<v Speaker 2>because they're satiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a technical term by the way,</v>

687
00:36:08.151 --> 00:36:12.500
<v Speaker 2>satiated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means satisfied and it's a form of,</v>

688
00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a form of reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

689
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.823
<v Speaker 2>so it sort of how you feel after you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>eaten a good meal and you're in a warm </v>

690
00:36:19.551 --> 00:36:22.130
<v Speaker 2>room and your friends around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

691
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe you'd go to sleep if it's your </v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

692
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm thinking about Thanksgiving </v>

693
00:36:27.141 --> 00:36:31.220
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just everything is taken care of.</v>

694
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And so we fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of that satiation.</v>

695
00:36:34.821 --> 00:36:35.654
<v Speaker 2>You can see that now and almost all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time because they spend a lot of time </v>

696
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.430
<v Speaker 2>seizuring dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sleep a lot,</v>

697
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.130
<v Speaker 2>cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sleep a lot because you know,</v>

698
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.500
<v Speaker 2>they've already attacked her cat food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty much it for the day.</v>

699
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.220
<v Speaker 2>So human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.160
<v Speaker 2>we tend not so much to enter into states</v>
<v Speaker 2>of satiation.</v>

701
00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens when,</v>

702
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:55.783
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in one of those little </v>

703
00:36:58.701 --> 00:36:59.560
<v Speaker 2>units,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

704
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:00.463
<v Speaker 2>one of those little motivated things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of things that can </v>

705
00:37:02.721 --> 00:37:03.554
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

706
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.853
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

707
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.280
<v Speaker 1>The next one probably.</v>

708
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

709
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.813
<v Speaker 2>This is good.</v>

710
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

711
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we talked about motivation.</v>

712
00:37:37.081 --> 00:37:42.081
<v Speaker 2>So as sort of setting up this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a little frame and then we can talk</v>

713
00:37:42.611 --> 00:37:43.444
<v Speaker 2>about emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there you're going somewhere and </v>

714
00:37:51.541 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 2>there was this little straight line </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll take you there.</v>

715
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 2>It's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient way to get there.</v>

716
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Now why do you want to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiently?</v>

717
00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:59.363
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you use up the least amount of </v>

718
00:38:00.901 --> 00:38:01.734
<v Speaker 2>resources so then you can maintain some </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources for doing the next thing that </v>

719
00:38:05.821 --> 00:38:06.654
<v Speaker 2>you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you care about efficiency and </v>

720
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:10.920
<v Speaker 2>simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to go like the crow flies to</v>

721
00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:12.930
<v Speaker 2>the destination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then what,</v>

722
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.900
<v Speaker 2>what happens along the way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

723
00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:18.123
<v Speaker 2>let's say you just get to go straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>while basically what happens is that </v>

724
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:21.663
<v Speaker 2>you're motivated by your perception of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal or intermediary goals because </v>

725
00:38:25.121 --> 00:38:25.954
<v Speaker 2>the goals can be linked together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then as long as things are going </v>

726
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:33.520
<v Speaker 2>according to plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know as you move towards the goal in</v>

727
00:38:33.521 --> 00:38:34.354
<v Speaker 2>an untrammeled way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going feel mild positive emotion </v>

728
00:38:37.061 --> 00:38:37.894
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're turning the environment the </v>

729
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 2>environment almost never has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it's irrelevant.</v>

730
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 2>The rest of it has a positive or </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative valence,</v>

731
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.230
<v Speaker 2>and if things are going according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>

732
00:38:50.231 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 2>it has a mild positive valence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

733
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.003
<v Speaker 2>You think things are okay and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing is you're observing </v>

734
00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:57.664
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're observing that the things that </v>

735
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:00.634
<v Speaker 2>should be happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know what you're doing while </v>

736
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:03.694
<v Speaker 2>you're acting are happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so each step forward is an </v>

737
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:12.040
<v Speaker 2>indication that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting closer to your goal.</v>

738
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 2>That's incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incentive reward,</v>

739
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 2>and that's the sort of reward that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually think of as fun and incentive.</v>

740
00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:20.974
<v Speaker 2>Reward is produced by activation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploratory system that's in the </v>

741
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has its roots in the hypothalamus and</v>

742
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:27.844
<v Speaker 2>that's the dopaminergic system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the system that cocaine and </v>

743
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:31.474
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines and all those other drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people really like to take </v>

744
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.593
<v Speaker 2>hyperactivates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making them feel like they're doing </v>

745
00:39:36.161 --> 00:39:36.994
<v Speaker 2>something important and useful even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though they're not so the dopaminergic </v>

746
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:44.730
<v Speaker 2>drugs in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hijack your incentive reward systems and</v>

747
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.550
<v Speaker 2>it's incentive reward because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentivized to continue moving forward.</v>

748
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.953
<v Speaker 2>Anything that you look at that makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to touch it or move forward to it </v>

749
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.610
<v Speaker 2>basically activates the dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

750
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:02.140
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you say,</v>

751
00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:02.974
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens when you're on your way to </v>

752
00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:06.160
<v Speaker 2>somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

753
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:10.360
<v Speaker 2>roughly what happens is neutral things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is okay.</v>

754
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 2>You can ignore them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive things or negative things,</v>

755
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.013
<v Speaker 2>positive things happen when things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going according to plan or even better </v>

756
00:40:16.931 --> 00:40:19.210
<v Speaker 2>than according to plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you're walking to school,</v>

757
00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:21.650
<v Speaker 2>it's raining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody you know stops and offers you a</v>

758
00:40:21.651 --> 00:40:22.484
<v Speaker 2>lift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

759
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:23.643
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing okay getting to school and </v>

760
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.760
<v Speaker 2>that was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden you're getting there</v>

761
00:40:26.761 --> 00:40:28.360
<v Speaker 2>a little faster and you're not getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>wet,</v>

762
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:29.194
<v Speaker 2>so at cheers you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an indication that you're able to </v>

763
00:40:32.231 --> 00:40:34.960
<v Speaker 2>save the resource as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're moving towards a goal,</v>

764
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.073
<v Speaker 2>open the we mediated and then we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine a different scenario where </v>

765
00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:43.330
<v Speaker 2>you're walking to school in the rain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody drives by you.</v>

766
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's even the same friend and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't see you and there's a puddle right</v>

767
00:40:46.451 --> 00:40:48.510
<v Speaker 2>beside you and not only do they not </v>
<v Speaker 2>start,</v>

768
00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.393
<v Speaker 2>but they completely cover you with oily </v>
<v Speaker 2>and frigid water and so you know that's </v>

769
00:40:52.811 --> 00:40:53.644
<v Speaker 2>not so good.</v>

770
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.300
<v Speaker 2>You're angry about that and upset why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

771
00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.450
<v Speaker 2>your day is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

772
00:41:01.451 --> 00:41:04.180
<v Speaker 2>my day is ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean exactly?</v>

773
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.823
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that you had a little map on </v>

774
00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:11.320
<v Speaker 2>top of your day and you were hoping that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day and the map would correspond and</v>

775
00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:12.154
<v Speaker 2>then all of a sudden the map burned up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and god only knows what's going to </v>

776
00:41:14.021 --> 00:41:14.854
<v Speaker 2>happen to the day and so it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom has dropped out your map and so </v>

777
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:20.194
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to worry about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes and catching cold and all those </v>

778
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:23.104
<v Speaker 2>things and turning around and going home</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it will mean if you miss class </v>

779
00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:26.284
<v Speaker 2>and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically that's the domain of chaos </v>

780
00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:31.900
<v Speaker 2>that we talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a negative thing,</v>

781
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:32.883
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the thing about negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>things is there sort of hard to </v>

782
00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:38.960
<v Speaker 2>disentangle from unexpected things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

783
00:41:38.961 --> 00:41:39.794
<v Speaker 2>because most of the things that happened</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you that are negative are also </v>

784
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:46.691
<v Speaker 2>unexpected because you don't go around </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to make negative things happen so</v>

785
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.063
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

786
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:50.443
<v Speaker 2>What happens when something negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens while you get a negative </v>

787
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:55.850
<v Speaker 2>emotion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pain,</v>

788
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.103
<v Speaker 2>anxiety discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those seem to be the big three and </v>

789
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:02.594
<v Speaker 2>they're mediated by different systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand the disgust system </v>

790
00:42:05.631 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't load with neuroticism,</v>

791
00:42:08.811 --> 00:42:09.644
<v Speaker 2>which is quite weird because all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other negative emotions is load on </v>

792
00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Speaker 2>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neuroticism,</v>

793
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:15.590
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain seems to be what you experienced.</v>

794
00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:18.440
<v Speaker 2>If you're receptive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surfaces are,</v>

795
00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your physiological self is subject to</v>

796
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:23.623
<v Speaker 2>stimulation of an intensity that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficient either to developing to </v>

797
00:42:26.571 --> 00:42:30.740
<v Speaker 2>damage it or to damage the receptors so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

798
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:31.663
<v Speaker 2>but pain is complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just physical pain from </v>

799
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:35.174
<v Speaker 2>physical damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how you define physical </v>

800
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:41.650
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone dies that pain,</v>

801
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.880
<v Speaker 2>if you're alone and isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's paid.</v>

802
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:48.400
<v Speaker 2>If you're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's paint.</v>

803
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:52.570
<v Speaker 2>If you're frustrated or disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pain.</v>

804
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Frustrated might mean something gets in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way of you moving towards a goal and</v>

805
00:42:56.681 --> 00:42:59.950
<v Speaker 2>disappointment might be in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn structure just collapsed on you.</v>

806
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pain now,</v>

807
00:43:02.921 --> 00:43:03.920
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

808
00:43:03.921 --> 00:43:06.970
<v Speaker 2>the behaviors would have called that an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconditioned,</v>

809
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:08.523
<v Speaker 2>like a painful stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would've called that an </v>

810
00:43:09.911 --> 00:43:10.744
<v Speaker 2>unconditioned stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to learn for that to be </v>

811
00:43:13.961 --> 00:43:17.260
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of built in bad and they would</v>

812
00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:20.740
<v Speaker 2>think about anxiety in response to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected as learned.</v>

813
00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.633
<v Speaker 2>So the tech like the behaviors would </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that you need to learn what </v>

814
00:43:27.431 --> 00:43:28.264
<v Speaker 2>predicts something painful and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn that something predicts something </v>

815
00:43:31.961 --> 00:43:32.794
<v Speaker 2>painful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get anxious to it or afraid of </v>

816
00:43:34.601 --> 00:43:36.190
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

817
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:38.223
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that it's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated than that so that we know </v>

818
00:43:40.571 --> 00:43:43.770
<v Speaker 2>what the behaviors would think is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain in some senses,</v>

819
00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.160
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental negative emotion.</v>

820
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.850
<v Speaker 2>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're a kid and you,</v>

821
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.833
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stand up underneath the table and </v>

822
00:43:52.211 --> 00:43:54.190
<v Speaker 2>you whack your head on it when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning to walk.</v>

823
00:43:54.191 --> 00:43:55.024
<v Speaker 2>And then when you go under the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you get anxious because you've </v>

824
00:43:57.791 --> 00:44:00.070
<v Speaker 2>learned that if you stand up under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table,</v>

825
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.750
<v Speaker 2>you bang your head in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hurts.</v>

826
00:44:01.751 --> 00:44:04.600
<v Speaker 2>And so anxiety under those circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 2>that learned behavior,</v>

827
00:44:04.601 --> 00:44:06.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a conditioned response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It,</v>

828
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.983
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

829
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.873
<v Speaker 2>it's more complicated than that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety can also be an unlearned </v>

830
00:44:12.611 --> 00:44:13.444
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you just encounter something </v>

831
00:44:15.431 --> 00:44:18.430
<v Speaker 2>you've never seen before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to make you anxious.</v>

832
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.760
<v Speaker 2>And there's actually a circuit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediates anxiety.</v>

833
00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:26.110
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just a secondary derivation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the pain circuitry,</v>

834
00:44:26.111 --> 00:44:26.944
<v Speaker 2>it's its own little unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's sort of like you figured out </v>

835
00:44:29.471 --> 00:44:31.860
<v Speaker 2>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over evolutionary time,</v>

836
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 2>not to get hurt because you know you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to be damaged,</v>

837
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:36.504
<v Speaker 2>but then you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've learned how to detect the </v>

838
00:44:39.361 --> 00:44:40.194
<v Speaker 2>probability that you will get hurt for </v>
<v Speaker 2>so long that you've also evolved a </v>

839
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 2>system just to respond to that.</v>

840
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 2>And so some of that response to things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have learned are dangerous.</v>

841
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Some of it responds to things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>generally dangerous,</v>

842
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.470
<v Speaker 2>blonde spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

843
00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:02.990
<v Speaker 2>in insects of various sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facial expressions that indicate fear or</v>

844
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:07.290
<v Speaker 2>disgust or anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm broken.</v>

845
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Limbs bodies especially mutilated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you know,</v>

846
00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.350
<v Speaker 2>you can think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what's in horror movies,</v>

847
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.420
<v Speaker 2>that's all sort of primary fear stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

848
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:17.503
<v Speaker 2>And it's built right into now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychologists debate about whether it's </v>

849
00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:23.760
<v Speaker 2>bird built in or whether you can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn it really easily.</v>

850
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.680
<v Speaker 2>But I would say there's sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuum.</v>

851
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Some of it seems pretty damn built in </v>
<v Speaker 2>snake fear.</v>

852
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:31.680
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps who've never seen snakes,</v>

853
00:45:31.681 --> 00:45:33.660
<v Speaker 2>you bring one into their cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a rubber snake.</v>

854
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:34.494
<v Speaker 2>Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hit the roof and then they look at </v>

855
00:45:36.121 --> 00:45:36.954
<v Speaker 2>it and snakes in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chimp will go up to his big snake in </v>

856
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:42.300
<v Speaker 2>the wild and who data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have this special snake,</v>

857
00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:43.134
<v Speaker 2>they called a snake wrapped to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing and some of them will just </v>

858
00:45:44.881 --> 00:45:48.810
<v Speaker 2>look at the snake for like 24 hours so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

859
00:45:48.811 --> 00:45:53.040
<v Speaker 2>partly they're afraid of it partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to explore it and so what they</v>

860
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:53.874
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get close to it and the fear </v>

861
00:45:55.141 --> 00:45:55.974
<v Speaker 2>increases and then they back up and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear decreases and the curiosity </v>

862
00:45:59.251 --> 00:45:59.880
<v Speaker 2>increases.</v>

863
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.713
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is they move back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth until they're right on the line </v>

864
00:46:03.451 --> 00:46:04.284
<v Speaker 2>where they're afraid but they're curious</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then they're stuck and they're </v>

865
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:08.304
<v Speaker 2>looking at it and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you experienced that all the time </v>

866
00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:15.030
<v Speaker 2>actually because when you are engaged in</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's meaningful,</v>

867
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:19.080
<v Speaker 2>that's where you are and that's like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>line between order and chaos.</v>

868
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.213
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you want to solve and it's </v>

869
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:22.110
<v Speaker 2>important leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>

870
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:22.944
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're reading papers about some </v>

871
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:26.610
<v Speaker 2>illness that you hope to work on her </v>
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>

872
00:46:26.611 --> 00:46:27.121
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

873
00:46:27.121 --> 00:46:30.840
<v Speaker 2>you're worried about the damn illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know all you're doing is confronting</v>

874
00:46:30.841 --> 00:46:34.110
<v Speaker 2>it through the paper so you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly well sheltered from it,</v>

875
00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want it to exist and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather it wasn't around,</v>

876
00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:39.750
<v Speaker 2>but you're curious so you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get engrossed in it,</v>

877
00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:40.584
<v Speaker 2>and most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the degree that you're immersed in </v>

878
00:46:43.201 --> 00:46:47.010
<v Speaker 2>anything are part immersed because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive it as a problem,</v>

879
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 2>so you know that's like existential </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety in a sense.</v>

880
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's just part of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's problems that have to be solved.</v>

881
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.690
<v Speaker 2>They produce anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're complicated.</v>

882
00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.213
<v Speaker 2>You find this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find a way of approaching them so </v>

883
00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:04.800
<v Speaker 2>that the anxiety doesn't overwhelm you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the curiosity is optimized.</v>

884
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:05.663
<v Speaker 2>That's an incentive reward activation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're awake because the </v>

885
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 2>anxiety keeps you awake and so does the </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity and you think,</v>

886
00:47:11.821 --> 00:47:12.654
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a good place to be and it is a </v>

887
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:14.784
<v Speaker 2>good place to be because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're optimally protected right there </v>

888
00:47:16.981 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 2>and you're optimally learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

889
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:20.543
<v Speaker 2>that's a good place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could think about that as an answer </v>

890
00:47:24.331 --> 00:47:27.390
<v Speaker 2>to the Nietzschean problem of how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>create value.</v>

891
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.850
<v Speaker 2>You don't exactly created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find it.</v>

892
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.253
<v Speaker 2>There's problems that need to be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They automatically engage your emotions </v>

893
00:47:36.131 --> 00:47:38.980
<v Speaker 2>both positively and negatively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to find the right balance.</v>

894
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's something like contending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

895
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:43.263
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that human beings have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have something to contend with or they </v>

896
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:48.130
<v Speaker 2>can't tolerate themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

897
00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:48.964
<v Speaker 2>because life seems like a stupid joke if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have something worthwhile to </v>

898
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:52.504
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could have something worthwhile </v>

899
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:54.110
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

900
00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:54.943
<v Speaker 2>And so then maybe it's not so stupid and</v>
<v Speaker 2>observed and tragic and that's at least </v>

901
00:48:00.041 --> 00:48:05.041
<v Speaker 2>a good way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got satiation on the one hand,</v>

902
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.033
<v Speaker 2>on the positive side and the behaviors </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have considered that an </v>

903
00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:09.364
<v Speaker 2>unconditioned response to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really thought about that and his </v>

904
00:48:11.231 --> 00:48:13.120
<v Speaker 2>reward initially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

905
00:48:13.121 --> 00:48:14.350
<v Speaker 2>so you take a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hungry,</v>

906
00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:17.290
<v Speaker 2>you feed them something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reward now skinner,</v>

907
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.030
<v Speaker 2>he used to train rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

908
00:48:19.031 --> 00:48:20.360
<v Speaker 2>And he was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

909
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:21.580
<v Speaker 2>he was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

910
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:22.503
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very well renowned behavioral </v>

911
00:48:26.621 --> 00:48:27.454
<v Speaker 2>psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he could train routes to do damn </v>

912
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:29.524
<v Speaker 2>near anything and what he would do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>starve them to three quarters of their </v>

913
00:48:32.231 --> 00:48:35.520
<v Speaker 2>body weight because then their damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>mode,</v>

914
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.840
<v Speaker 2>they are basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

915
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.713
<v Speaker 2>Hungry Rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were hungry lonesome rats because </v>

916
00:48:39.851 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 2>they lived at ice isolated existence </v>
<v Speaker 2>which rats don't like.</v>

917
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.390
<v Speaker 2>And then they would start going to three</v>
<v Speaker 2>quarters of their body weight.</v>

918
00:48:46.391 --> 00:48:47.224
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the behaviorist used rats as a </v>

919
00:48:49.601 --> 00:48:52.210
<v Speaker 2>model for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually used poetry,</v>

920
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 2>lonesome rats as a model for rats as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>model for people.</v>

921
00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:57.431
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

922
00:48:57.431 --> 00:49:00.370
<v Speaker 2>what kind of model is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it turns out it's pretty good bottle</v>

923
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.780
<v Speaker 2>because you're a lot more like a scared </v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry rat than you'd like to,</v>

924
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.820
<v Speaker 2>that you'd like to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is partly why you can emphasize,</v>

925
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.020
<v Speaker 2>empathize with what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

926
00:49:08.021 --> 00:49:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Everybody sitting there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

927
00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:11.800
<v Speaker 2>over the poor rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

928
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:14.050
<v Speaker 2>the more you thought that more agreeable</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

929
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 2>So how many people were feeling pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry for those rats.</v>

930
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how about men?</v>

931
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.880
<v Speaker 2>How many men were feeling sorry for </v>
<v Speaker 2>those rats?</v>

932
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about three.</v>

933
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a big gender difference in </v>

934
00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.210
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness between men and women by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

935
00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:32.350
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>

936
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:33.363
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about that more so now the </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior is also thought that you had </v>

937
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:40.660
<v Speaker 2>this primary set of rewards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call them unconditioned,</v>

938
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:45.580
<v Speaker 2>and then you had to learn that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>things predicted them like,</v>

939
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.200
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>classically,</v>

940
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>rat and push a lever and get a pellet.</v>

941
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.160
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he's pushing that lever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Matt,</v>

942
00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:55.870
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty happy about pushing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lever.</v>

943
00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:56.913
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he learned that conditioned </v>

944
00:49:58.211 --> 00:50:01.210
<v Speaker 2>association between lever pushing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a reward,</v>

945
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been around for so long,</v>

946
00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:05.643
<v Speaker 2>you also have a system for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just a learned association </v>

947
00:50:09.041 --> 00:50:11.260
<v Speaker 2>to what satiates you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole system.</v>

948
00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:12.183
<v Speaker 2>That's the dopaminergic system and it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The serotonin system seems to be the </v>

949
00:50:15.641 --> 00:50:18.160
<v Speaker 2>thing that satiates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

950
00:50:18.161 --> 00:50:21.400
<v Speaker 2>if you have a big Turkey dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like up goes the serotonin levels.</v>

951
00:50:21.401 --> 00:50:25.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't have to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Serotonin is a calm,</v>

952
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.223
<v Speaker 2>a calming and regulating neurochemical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why antidepressants stop your </v>

953
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:31.844
<v Speaker 2>neurons from taking up serotonin before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had a real chance to use it to </v>

954
00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:39.770
<v Speaker 2>regulate your nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So but Dopa mean tells you,</v>

955
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.633
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good things are on their way and that's </v>

956
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 2>pretty much what people run on and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could think about that as hope.</v>

957
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.850
<v Speaker 2>So incentive reward is sort of like hope</v>
<v Speaker 2>or promise,</v>

958
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.773
<v Speaker 2>I think promises a better term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's pain and satiation and those </v>

959
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:57.074
<v Speaker 2>are really ancient systems and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are newer systems that are an </v>

960
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.753
<v Speaker 2>anxiety and promise</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are related to those more </v>

961
00:51:07.101 --> 00:51:09.890
<v Speaker 2>fundamental negative and positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>

962
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:12.830
<v Speaker 2>And those things regulate you while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on your path.</v>

963
00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:13.693
<v Speaker 2>Now there's one more level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>complication because you think what can </v>

964
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:22.370
<v Speaker 2>happen on the way to your goal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing irrelevant.</v>

965
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

966
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:24.643
<v Speaker 2>that's the irrelevance that enables you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to not see the gorilla and almost </v>

967
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.293
<v Speaker 2>everything around you is irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's partly why people </v>

968
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:33.464
<v Speaker 2>don't like to have their little maps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world destroyed because if your map </v>

969
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:41.510
<v Speaker 2>of the world is thoroughly demolished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything becomes irrelevant and you do</v>

970
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:45.470
<v Speaker 2>not want everything to become relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much for you.</v>

971
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:50.420
<v Speaker 2>So you wake up and you're naked and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark in the middle of a jungle.</v>

972
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything's relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to like that.</v>

973
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:54.943
<v Speaker 2>It's going to burn me out quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so most of the time you have to be </v>

974
00:51:57.471 --> 00:52:00.410
<v Speaker 2>protected so that almost everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>

975
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:02.023
<v Speaker 2>And then you can focus on the few things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're capable of handling and you </v>

976
00:52:06.381 --> 00:52:07.214
<v Speaker 2>do that so you're in your little map and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then as you move towards your emotions </v>

977
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:14.320
<v Speaker 2>play and the negative emotions appear </v>
<v Speaker 2>when things are not going well,</v>

978
00:52:14.321 --> 00:52:16.520
<v Speaker 2>when the positive emotions appear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when things are going well,</v>

979
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.863
<v Speaker 2>that's basically how your emotions work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got your satiation and your </v>

980
00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:24.323
<v Speaker 2>your pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you've got your threat and your </v>

981
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.033
<v Speaker 2>promise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then on top of that you've gotten </v>

982
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:30.763
<v Speaker 2>more complicated thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is novelty because that's the </v>

983
00:52:32.511 --> 00:52:36.380
<v Speaker 2>other thing that can happen when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way from point a to point b,</v>

984
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:41.720
<v Speaker 2>something you didn't expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you don't understand,</v>

985
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:42.853
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

986
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:55.453
<v Speaker 2>you're walking down the street and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's someone laying their face down </v>

987
00:52:59.511 --> 00:53:03.230
<v Speaker 2>on the sidewalk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know they're this,</v>

988
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:08.330
<v Speaker 2>they're disheveled and so well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your emotional response while you</v>

989
00:53:09.231 --> 00:53:10.064
<v Speaker 2>didn't expect it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to be taken aback that </v>

990
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:13.163
<v Speaker 2>that's anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're moving towards your </v>

991
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:16.640
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The anxiety stops you.</v>

992
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Now you could think of the space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could think of this space,</v>

993
00:53:20.871 --> 00:53:24.470
<v Speaker 2>time area around that person as </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexplored territory.</v>

994
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.243
<v Speaker 2>Now you don't want any unexplored </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory in your map because God only </v>

995
00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:30.660
<v Speaker 2>knows what's going to happen there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

996
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.300
<v Speaker 2>so what are you supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

997
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:34.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe you cross the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

998
00:53:34.621 --> 00:53:35.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person's drunk,</v>

999
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1000
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:37.344
<v Speaker 2>they're a homeless person and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>lying on a sleeping bag on just to </v>

1001
00:53:39.681 --> 00:53:42.000
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you're going to be losing,</v>

1002
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:42.923
<v Speaker 2>you're going to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're going to observe and </v>

1003
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:45.954
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to use little cues to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to put your map back together and </v>

1004
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:50.610
<v Speaker 2>your map is what's going on here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what should I do about it.</v>

1005
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 2>And so it's partly this interplay </v>
<v Speaker 2>between anxiety and curiosity.</v>

1006
00:53:55.261 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Now you can just step around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue,</v>

1007
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:00.320
<v Speaker 2>but maybe that'll upset your moral map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of personnel?</v>

1008
00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:01.163
<v Speaker 2>Mind you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should've done something about </v>

1009
00:54:02.641 --> 00:54:03.474
<v Speaker 2>it or maybe you think there's no damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>way I'm going to get involved in this </v>

1010
00:54:05.881 --> 00:54:06.714
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what'll happen if I step in </v>

1011
00:54:09.301 --> 00:54:11.400
<v Speaker 2>there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair enough,</v>

1012
00:54:11.401 --> 00:54:14.460
<v Speaker 2>because who knows what will happen if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you step in there.</v>

1013
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:19.910
<v Speaker 2>The point is is that it's like your map </v>
<v Speaker 2>which has made everything irrelevant.</v>

1014
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:21.413
<v Speaker 2>It's got a hole in it and now some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's complicated is shining through </v>

1015
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.823
<v Speaker 2>and that thing that's shining through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what the phenomenologists </v>

1016
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 2>talked about as shining forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing that's shining through.</v>

1017
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1018
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.750
<v Speaker 2>What should you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1019
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:37.710
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do.</v>

1020
00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:38.544
<v Speaker 2>What you do do and what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you do is you prepare to do </v>

1021
00:54:41.281 --> 00:54:44.490
<v Speaker 2>everything and that's an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to novelty.</v>

1022
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:45.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1023
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.740
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should prepare yourself for anything</v>

1024
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:50.813
<v Speaker 2>and that that's stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could prepare it and something good </v>

1025
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:55.710
<v Speaker 2>will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1026
00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:56.581
<v Speaker 2>let's say in,</v>
