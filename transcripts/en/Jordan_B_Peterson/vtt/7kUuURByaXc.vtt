1
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I have the distinct pleasure today of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to sit down and talk to Dr </v>

2
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Steven Pinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard University,</v>

3
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>who's just written a new book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many.</v>

4
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>He's written many books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the newest one.</v>

5
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>It's called enlightenment now and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York Times best seller for seven </v>

6
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.451
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was a great accomplishment and </v>

7
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>darker pinker has indicated to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's doing,</v>

8
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

9
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's doing better than his other books </v>

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>have and and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've also done very well.</v>

11
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:51.651
<v Speaker 1>So that's really something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Steven Pinker is the Harvard College </v>

12
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>professor of psychology at Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>He's a two time Pulitzer prize finalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the winner of many awards for his </v>

14
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.811
<v Speaker 1>research teaching and books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been named one of Time's 100 most </v>

15
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>influential people and one of foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>

16
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>100 leading global fakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His books include the stuff of thought,</v>

17
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>the better angels of our nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blank slate and the sense of style.</v>

18
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.540
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm welcoming Dr Baker obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd like him to start telling us to </v>

19
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>start by telling us about the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and then we'll talk about broader</v>

20
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>issues and about the other books he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>written and that sort of thing.</v>

21
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book's subtitle is the case or </v>

22
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 2>reasons science humanism and progress at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

23
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:44.401
<v Speaker 2>I'll begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the progress because that was the </v>

24
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 2>epiphany that more than anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspired the book.</v>

25
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd been in a previous book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better angels of our nature when I </v>

26
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 2>was surprised to come across data sets </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing that many measures of violence.</v>

27
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 2>It declined over the course of history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was stunned to see a graph that showed</v>

28
00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:03.511
<v Speaker 2>the rates of homicide from England and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other western European countries from </v>

29
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 2>the 13 hundreds to the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing a decline of anywhere from 35 to</v>

30
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 2>50 in the chances of getting murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

31
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.170
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 2>called attention to this factor and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>blog post,</v>

33
00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 2>I didn't got correspondence from </v>
<v Speaker 2>historians,</v>

34
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.160
<v Speaker 2>from international relations scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from sociologists say,</v>

35
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have mentioned other declines,</v>

36
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 2>another decline of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And War scholar showed that the greater </v>

37
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 2>depth of war had plummeted.</v>

38
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Another showed me the rates of domestic </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence have gone down,</v>

39
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.140
<v Speaker 2>still another that rates of child abuse </v>
<v Speaker 2>had gone down.</v>

40
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 2>And I realized that this was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>important story here that was a,</v>

41
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 2>that it had to be told that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different declines of violence ought to </v>

42
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.330
<v Speaker 2>be presented to the world in between a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single pair of covers,</v>

43
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because it didn't seem to be </v>

44
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.461
<v Speaker 2>something of a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a psychologist it opened up the </v>

45
00:02:59.461 --> 00:02:59.461
<v Speaker 2>challenge of how to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

46
00:02:59.461 --> 00:03:01.280
<v Speaker 2>how to explain the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.350
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is so much violence in human </v>

48
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 2>affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the fact that it can be brought</v>

49
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:07.640
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

50
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I had a similar set of epiphanies that </v>
<v Speaker 2>led to the writing of enlightenment.</v>

51
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when after better angels was published,</v>

52
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to come across data showing </v>

53
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>that other aspects of human wellbeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>had improved.</v>

54
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 2>The rate of extreme poverty had </v>
<v Speaker 2>plummeted by about 50 percent just in </v>

55
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 2>three decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now stands at less than 10 percent.</v>

56
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Life expectancy has been increasing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the world,</v>

57
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 2>including the poorest parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

58
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of kids going to school has </v>

59
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 2>increased,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including girls,</v>

60
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.880
<v Speaker 2>more than 90 percent of people under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>age of 25 on,</v>

61
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 2>on the planet are literate now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have more leisure time.</v>

62
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>We're safer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 2>in measure after measure life has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting better.</v>

64
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's not the kind of development </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could learn about reading the </v>

65
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.591
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite the contrary because journalism </v>

66
00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 2>covers what goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not what goes right.</v>

67
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.610
<v Speaker 2>You could easily come away with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>impression that the world was getting </v>

68
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 2>worse and worse as a kind of statistical</v>
<v Speaker 2>illusion of a feeding,</v>

69
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 2>a cognitive bias and not realize until </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at data sets,</v>

70
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 2>how many ways in which life has </v>
<v Speaker 2>improved,</v>

71
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.390
<v Speaker 2>including measures like war and crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

72
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:23.391
<v Speaker 2>which would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what my guests are going in the wrong </v>

73
00:04:23.391 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>direction as opposed to the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

74
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.250
<v Speaker 2>And I combined that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other motivation for the book was a </v>

75
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.370
<v Speaker 2>set of attacks on the application of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science to the traditional domains of </v>

76
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 2>the humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

77
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 2>to history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the arts,</v>

78
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 2>to morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to language.</v>

79
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

80
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:46.471
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an effort that I think is quite a </v>

81
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:46.471
<v Speaker 2>celebrity is the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

82
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:50.730
<v Speaker 2>that scientific insights that are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought to bear on a Cuban affairs and </v>

83
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 2>how could they not give him the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

84
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.390
<v Speaker 2>art and society or are in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>products of our,</v>

85
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 2>our psychology products of human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in a lot of intellectual life,</v>

86
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:07.081
<v Speaker 2>there's bitter resentment to any </v>
<v Speaker 2>application of scientific ideas or the </v>

87
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 2>scientific mindset to human affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was first noted by CP snow in this </v>

88
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 2>famous lectures and cultures in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early,</v>

89
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 2>late 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] early 19 sixties.</v>

90
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.250
<v Speaker 2>But the conflict was very much with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an essay called science is not </v>

91
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.141
<v Speaker 2>your enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were published in the new </v>

92
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:28.141
<v Speaker 2>Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which went viral.</v>

93
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 2>And that was the immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kickoff for the proposal that ended up</v>

94
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 2>leaving and enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

95
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was involved in something of a </v>

96
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 2>literary spat with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

97
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>with Leon wieseltier and editor at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>new republic.</v>

98
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:42.960
<v Speaker 2>But I quickly realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.340
<v Speaker 2>two guys having an argument is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to,</v>

100
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pump out a book.</v>

101
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.540
<v Speaker 2>And so I had the centerpiece of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>

102
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 2>just be the documentation of a fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people are unaware of,</v>

103
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 2>namely that in most measures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life has gotten better over time.</v>

104
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as with the better angels of our nature,</v>

105
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to just present a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>grants,</v>

106
00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:10.011
<v Speaker 2>although I did present many graphs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to explain them and it </v>

107
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 2>seemed to me that if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was any overarching explanation</v>

108
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 2>as to wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get got better.</v>

109
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:15.450
<v Speaker 2>It's that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

110
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 2>in the past thought that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding how the world works,</v>

111
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 2>including ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

112
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.540
<v Speaker 2>we can try to solve problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember what works a drop,</v>

113
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 2>drop the failures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as we accumulate are our cultural </v>

114
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

115
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.200
<v Speaker 2>we can improve our wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I attribute that mindset to the </v>

116
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 2>light and the idea that we can use </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge to improve human wellbeing.</v>

117
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Now that might sound almost too banal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that tribe to be worth defending.</v>

118
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought that those ideals very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much needed a defense.</v>

119
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

120
00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:53.430
<v Speaker 1>So you're waiting a number of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

121
00:06:53.431 --> 00:06:58.431
<v Speaker 1>So the first is your discovery that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the data that things are </v>

122
00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:04.701
<v Speaker 1>getting better at a rate that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable that it is really nothing </v>

123
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:08.841
<v Speaker 1>short of miraculous and you've produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens of graphs showing that in </v>

124
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.910
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I noticed the same thing about three</v>

125
00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:15.930
<v Speaker 1>years ago when I was working for UN </v>
<v Speaker 1>panel on economic sustainability,</v>

126
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.230
<v Speaker 1>the for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the secretary general,</v>

127
00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:21.900
<v Speaker 1>the original narrative was extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic,</v>

128
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>detailed how we were disappointing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet and how everything was getting </v>

129
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.060
<v Speaker 1>worse and how we are at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 1>at each other's throats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started to read extremely widely </v>

131
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.291
<v Speaker 1>and I found that on measure after </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure with some notable exceptions </v>

132
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:40.671
<v Speaker 1>like oceanic oceanic overfishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have been doing so staggeringly much </v>

133
00:07:41.521 --> 00:07:46.230
<v Speaker 1>better in the last 150 years that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't believe it on almost every,</v>

134
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.690
<v Speaker 1>on almost every measure you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you detail out and</v>

135
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.550
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment now.</v>

136
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then now that that's a secret,</v>

137
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say people don't know about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

138
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.380
<v Speaker 1>and that's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also associated with a </v>

139
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.560
<v Speaker 1>critique of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

140
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.920
<v Speaker 1>of the enlightenment and scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality.</v>

141
00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:09.921
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that you're implying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps you're stating explicitly </v>

142
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:14.271
<v Speaker 1>that you're stating explicitly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a connection between the </v>

143
00:08:14.851 --> 00:08:19.851
<v Speaker 1>pessimism and the lack of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this and the critique of the </v>

144
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:23.400
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment and rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a question here.</v>

145
00:08:23.401 --> 00:08:28.401
<v Speaker 1>If things are getting so much better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the news is overwhelming on that </v>

146
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:32.271
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of the things you outlined </v>

147
00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:32.271
<v Speaker 1>are like the weather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decrease,</v>

148
00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:37.230
<v Speaker 1>decreases and starvation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the most remarkable and the </v>

149
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.880
<v Speaker 1>provision of bountiful food on less and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less farmland,</v>

150
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.990
<v Speaker 1>which is not something that people know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if all this is happening,</v>

151
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.530
<v Speaker 1>why don't we know about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how is it linked to the.</v>

152
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>How do you think if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it all is linked to the critique of,</v>

153
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.910
<v Speaker 1>of enlightenment rationality,</v>

154
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 2>what are the reasons is an interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the nature of journalism and the</v>

155
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 2>nature of cognition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Namely the news is about what happens,</v>

156
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 2>not what hasn't happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of the.</v>

157
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.310
<v Speaker 2>A very beneficial developments consists </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things that don't happen.</v>

158
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Countries that are at peace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that used to be kids who are not </v>

159
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.530
<v Speaker 2>starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a kid,</v>

160
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.750
<v Speaker 2>a terrorist attacks that do not have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never see a journalist saying,</v>

161
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm reporting live from a country that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been at peace for 40 years.</v>

162
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 2>But if a war breaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be sure that we'll hear about it</v>

163
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more so now that,</v>

164
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 2>that a majority of humanity consists of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

165
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 2>on the spot video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Journalists,</v>

166
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 2>thanks to smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

167
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 2>also a bad things can happen quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things can blow up,</v>

168
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 2>worse can start a massacre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can happen,</v>

169
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 2>but good things aren't built in a day.</v>

170
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.140
<v Speaker 2>And they often consist of incremental </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvements,</v>

171
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.680
<v Speaker 2>but few percentage points a year that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the compound that,</v>

172
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.890
<v Speaker 2>that accumulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that can never make the news because</v>

173
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 2>they never happened all of a sudden on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thursday in October.</v>

174
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 2>But together with all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

175
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive impediments to understanding </v>

176
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.291
<v Speaker 2>the state of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that news reports a memorable </v>

177
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:06.291
<v Speaker 2>events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know,</v>

178
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from these study of the cognition of </v>

179
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 2>risk and probability from Daniel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kahneman and Amos Tversky,</v>

180
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:20.060
<v Speaker 2>that we tend to assess probability and </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk by a shortcut called the </v>

181
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.420
<v Speaker 2>availability heuristic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Namely,</v>

182
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:24.620
<v Speaker 2>the easier it is to I dredge up an </v>
<v Speaker 2>example from memory,</v>

183
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.750
<v Speaker 2>the more likely we think something is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people think that a tornado's </v>

184
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.710
<v Speaker 2>killed a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't realize that falling off </v>

185
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.210
<v Speaker 2>ladders kills far more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

186
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Because when someone falls off a ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make the news,</v>

187
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:38.190
<v Speaker 2>but when there is a tornado it guys.</v>

188
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the solar power kills more </v>

189
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.370
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nuclear power every year.</v>

190
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't surprise me because </v>

191
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.860
<v Speaker 2>nuclear power kills no one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose as installers,</v>

192
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.890
<v Speaker 1>fall off routes is full approves for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

193
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

194
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

195
00:10:56.821 --> 00:10:58.830
<v Speaker 1>so that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine that.</v>

196
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.420
<v Speaker 1>So good news or bad news is sudden it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic.</v>

197
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.780
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're tilted towards the processing of </v>

198
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:08.780
<v Speaker 1>negative information in any case.</v>

199
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.740
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't naturally computer ratio </v>

200
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:13.740
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

201
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.171
<v Speaker 2>occurrences and not occurrences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course what goes into a </v>

202
00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:21.730
<v Speaker 2>probability and a rational assessment of</v>
<v Speaker 2>risk and probability.</v>

203
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.670
<v Speaker 2>So there's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>

204
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:28.671
<v Speaker 2>it's more than that in that because </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual life in large parts of </v>

205
00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:33.040
<v Speaker 2>academia in a commentary caters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pundits,</v>

206
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 2>there is an ideology of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of decline goes back to the 19th </v>

207
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.171
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of the counter of light that </v>

208
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:44.110
<v Speaker 2>arose in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a reaction to enlightenment,</v>

209
00:11:44.111 --> 00:11:47.600
<v Speaker 2>hope score for progress of rationality </v>
<v Speaker 2>that said that the,</v>

210
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:52.710
<v Speaker 2>that the holes that society is Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization is teetering on the brink </v>

211
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.380
<v Speaker 2>or it's circling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>circling the drain and it's going to </v>

212
00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 2>collapse any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any time now.</v>

213
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 2>And it's up to the intellectuals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>commentators and,</v>

214
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

215
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

216
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 2>point out how beckon into degenerate </v>
<v Speaker 2>society is.</v>

217
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.470
<v Speaker 2>And to people like that musical progress</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes also sit in a front.</v>

218
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 2>The reaction is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

219
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:21.601
<v Speaker 2>we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been warning all of you about how </v>

220
00:12:21.601 --> 00:12:22.470
<v Speaker 2>society is on the verge of collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't come around and tell us that,</v>

221
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.600
<v Speaker 2>but everything's going fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are,</v>

222
00:12:24.601 --> 00:12:25.570
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do now</v>

223
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 1>with the romantic types like Russo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was reading,</v>

224
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder to the,</v>

225
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:39.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a powerful Marxist narrative </v>

226
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.850
<v Speaker 1>that's run its course for about 130 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years too,</v>

227
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:44.851
<v Speaker 1>that's predicated on the idea that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an oppressed class and the no </v>

228
00:12:44.851 --> 00:12:49.801
<v Speaker 1>pressure class and that narrative seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>also to thrive on or to be affronted by </v>

229
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:56.311
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the current,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current system might be producing </v>

230
00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>benefits across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you do in fact,</v>

231
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:03.541
<v Speaker 1>in one part of the book ask about </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not these benefits are only </v>

232
00:13:03.541 --> 00:13:03.541
<v Speaker 1>accruing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

233
00:13:03.541 --> 00:13:08.191
<v Speaker 1>to the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't seem to be the case as </v>

234
00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:08.970
<v Speaker 1>far as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as the data indicates,</v>

235
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 1>is that a fair,</v>

236
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.810
<v Speaker 2>quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most dramatic improvements have been</v>

237
00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:15.330
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom of the machinery,</v>

238
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme poor where,</v>

239
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the proportion of the world's population</v>

240
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:25.261
<v Speaker 2>living in extreme poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scala and over the last couple of </v>

241
00:13:25.261 --> 00:13:26.860
<v Speaker 2>centuries from probably about 90 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>to less than 10 percent.</v>

242
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.460
<v Speaker 2>And the United Nations has set as one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>its millennia,</v>

243
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 2>elegant goals to eliminate extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty everywhere by the year 20,</v>

244
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 2>30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably too optimistic.</v>

245
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.030
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that it can be set as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

246
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:45.210
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a plausible aspiration is itself a </v>

247
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Scottish.</v>

248
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the UN had said as one of its </v>

249
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.790
<v Speaker 1>millennial goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the having of absolute poverty between </v>

250
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 1>2000 and 2015 and that was accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 1>by 2012.</v>

251
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ahead of schedule.</v>

252
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

253
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Has a complicated relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress because Marxist doctrine </v>

254
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.180
<v Speaker 2>actually does a layout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pathway to progress.</v>

255
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:12.181
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pathway consists of violet class </v>

256
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:12.181
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

257
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:13.990
<v Speaker 2>it isn't the light and the ideal of </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress through,</v>

258
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:19.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through problem solving from the pro se </v>

259
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.700
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a belief that a nature throws problems </v>

260
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.081
<v Speaker 2>at us and that if we apply brain power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can gradually chip away at them of </v>

261
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.170
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>

262
00:14:27.171 --> 00:14:32.171
<v Speaker 2>is quite different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're right that there is a strong </v>

263
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 2>critiques of progress both from the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>and from the right.</v>

264
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.070
<v Speaker 2>But from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the left,</v>

265
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

266
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of contempt for institutions like,</v>

267
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like markets like liberal democracy that</v>

268
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.250
<v Speaker 2>deserve a lot of the credit for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress that we've made in that we,</v>

269
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the academic left a,</v>

270
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.790
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a despising of the very idea of </v>

271
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.821
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found that the only political </v>

272
00:15:00.821 --> 00:15:02.550
<v Speaker 2>faction is actually sympathetic to </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress or libertarians.</v>

273
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:08.140
<v Speaker 2>There have been a number of rational </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimist books in the last decade by </v>

274
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 2>people like Matt Ridley and Ron Bailey </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Johan Norberg that,</v>

275
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:17.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that do have overlapping vision to the </v>

276
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:21.410
<v Speaker 2>one that I took on lightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now namely documenting progress.</v>

277
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but both from the academic left and from</v>

278
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:27.860
<v Speaker 2>the political right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has been a,</v>

279
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.940
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a contempt for the notion of progress or</v>

280
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 2>were there different reasons in </v>
<v Speaker 2>academia?</v>

281
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to the Romantics to Russo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you mentioned,</v>

282
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.680
<v Speaker 2>but also to Schopenhauer Nietzsche.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heidegger,</v>

283
00:15:39.681 --> 00:15:44.681
<v Speaker 2>the existentialists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the critical theorists of the Frankfurt </v>

284
00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:46.580
<v Speaker 2>school have large swaths of the academic</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanities.</v>

285
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually detest the enlightenment,</v>

286
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 2>ironically enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not by no means all of them,</v>

287
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:52.540
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

288
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.200
<v Speaker 2>but there's a significant faction.</v>

289
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

290
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.020
<v Speaker 1>the questionnaire I guess in part is </v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

291
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the things that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>struck me as I've gone through this </v>

292
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.490
<v Speaker 1>material over the last years is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really good news.</v>

293
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Particularly it doesn't really matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're on the left to the right.</v>

294
00:16:10.091 --> 00:16:14.140
<v Speaker 1>If you're on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that the fact that the poorest</v>

295
00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:17.350
<v Speaker 1>of the poor are being lifted out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abject,</v>

296
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.020
<v Speaker 1>absolute abject misery at a rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just.</v>

297
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could hope for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster improvement no matter how </v>

298
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.760
<v Speaker 1>optimistic you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the right of course,</v>

299
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.990
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the benefits of liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>

300
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.840
<v Speaker 1>let's say and free markets are driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>this in large part,</v>

301
00:16:34.841 --> 00:16:37.090
<v Speaker 1>you take would also be a cause for </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebration.</v>

302
00:16:37.091 --> 00:16:42.091
<v Speaker 1>So there's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked about the availability </v>

303
00:16:42.091 --> 00:16:43.090
<v Speaker 1>heuristic and some of the role that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>press might be playing,</v>

304
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.150
<v Speaker 1>the stock that negative events stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

305
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.090
<v Speaker 1>We can also see negative events all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world now,</v>

306
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:54.300
<v Speaker 1>so we can't think of all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you hear about a negative </v>

307
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.921
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if it's happening next door and </v>

308
00:16:58.921 --> 00:17:02.650
<v Speaker 1>is not as a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are the breadth of our news is </v>

309
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.440
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated and the coverage is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated,</v>

310
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.670
<v Speaker 1>but there still seems to me to be this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mystery at the bottom of all this,</v>

311
00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:12.940
<v Speaker 1>which is in the face of such radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>good news.</v>

312
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Why is there such an insistence that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system is corrupt,</v>

313
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.150
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to hell in a handbasket</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that,</v>

314
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are a cancer on the planet </v>

315
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>and everything is heading towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse.</v>

316
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.540
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

317
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:30.870
<v Speaker 1>it's so deep and it doesn't seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved by the fact much.</v>

318
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I kind of think sometimes that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hangover from the cold war,</v>

319
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was so deeply pessimistic for so </v>

320
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.870
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

321
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.410
<v Speaker 2>It goes back before the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It certainly as a,</v>

322
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.840
<v Speaker 2>as a psychological syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back,</v>

323
00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:50.841
<v Speaker 2>at least to the Old Testament prophets </v>
<v Speaker 2>who combined kind of social criticism </v>

324
00:17:50.841 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

325
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:57.160
<v Speaker 2>fortunately at apocalyptic disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute that syndrome,</v>

326
00:17:57.161 --> 00:18:02.161
<v Speaker 2>that combination of a moral schooling </v>
<v Speaker 2>with predictions of doom.</v>

327
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 2>It's something that our species quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally falls into.</v>

328
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is frankly a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

329
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

330
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.460
<v Speaker 2>interprofessional competition that </v>
<v Speaker 2>society has various elites.</v>

331
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.500
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the politicians,</v>

332
00:18:17.501 --> 00:18:19.180
<v Speaker 2>the business people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military,</v>

333
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.890
<v Speaker 2>religious elites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the academics,</v>

334
00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:25.891
<v Speaker 2>the journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always kind of competing for </v>

335
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:29.310
<v Speaker 2>status since intellectuals don't deserve</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole lot of credit for getting </v>

336
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 2>society to run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

337
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.060
<v Speaker 2>for putting food in the stores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that keeping the peace and,</v>

338
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.680
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

339
00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:39.100
<v Speaker 2>protecting the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy to,</v>

340
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look down on other societal elites </v>

341
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on government,</v>

342
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.730
<v Speaker 2>on business and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

343
00:18:45.731 --> 00:18:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you guys are all failing and we're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones who are morally a refined enough to</v>

344
00:18:50.711 --> 00:18:52.330
<v Speaker 2>point it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

345
00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.720
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't put down just a sheer human </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitiveness.</v>

346
00:18:55.721 --> 00:19:00.721
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the first to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite explanations of the </v>

347
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:01.560
<v Speaker 2>veneration of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

348
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.840
<v Speaker 2>of the past of golden ages comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>comms hogs.</v>

349
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:10.140
<v Speaker 2>You said competition of praise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inclined to a reverence of antiquity or </v>

350
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.160
<v Speaker 2>men contend with living not with a dead.</v>

351
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.200
<v Speaker 1>It also seems that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

352
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of resentment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is driving that as well.</v>

353
00:19:19.871 --> 00:19:23.890
<v Speaker 1>And that would go along with the status </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition because there's anger.</v>

354
00:19:23.891 --> 00:19:28.891
<v Speaker 1>I suppose if you're a member of anemia </v>
<v Speaker 1>group to see that your paradigm,</v>

355
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.960
<v Speaker 1>let's say isn't leading the charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

356
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

357
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:39.210
<v Speaker 2>that's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you talked about the astonishing </v>

358
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.531
<v Speaker 2>decline in global poverty and a part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that story is it did not come about </v>

359
00:19:41.841 --> 00:19:44.520
<v Speaker 2>through massive redistribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which for,</v>

360
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:49.430
<v Speaker 2>for many people on the left was the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>route to lifting up the poor,</v>

361
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.190
<v Speaker 2>namely to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to redistribute resources.</v>

362
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Now that have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course adjust adjustments either </v>

363
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.820
<v Speaker 2>shocks the fact that China and India and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bangladesh and Indonesia have risen out </v>

364
00:20:01.191 --> 00:20:02.400
<v Speaker 2>of poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

365
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:07.250
<v Speaker 2>came in part of the expense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing jobs in the United States.</v>

366
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.760
<v Speaker 2>That's not exactly what people meant by </v>
<v Speaker 2>redistribution.</v>

367
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.430
<v Speaker 2>And it literally is a redistribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

368
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.790
<v Speaker 2>although it is a shaking up of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>economies of many,</v>

369
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:21.850
<v Speaker 2>many nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this massive increase in the wealth </v>

370
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.990
<v Speaker 2>of that Asian countries did not come </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was,</v>

371
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
<v Speaker 2>the horses were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were shipped from the wealthy west to </v>

372
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.000
<v Speaker 2>the impoverished east.</v>

373
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's also a threat to the doctrine </v>

374
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.590
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a direct threat.</v>

375
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.920
<v Speaker 1>The fact that wealth is being produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's being distributed to people at </v>

376
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.550
<v Speaker 1>the low end means that implies that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>redistributive philosophy is likely an </v>

377
00:20:45.441 --> 00:20:50.441
<v Speaker 1>error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can understand that might be </v>

378
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:52.901
<v Speaker 1>regarded as a catastrophic threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the people on the radical </v>

379
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:52.901
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

380
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:57.110
<v Speaker 2>well certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly for radical notions of </v>

381
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 2>redistribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

382
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.760
<v Speaker 2>the more limited kinds of redistribution</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have,</v>

383
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:05.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are ubiquitous in wealthy </v>

384
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:05.860
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a graph showing that the amount,</v>

385
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:11.040
<v Speaker 2>the proportion of GDP allocated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>social spending a skyrocketed in the </v>

386
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.481
<v Speaker 2>20th century from about one percent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 22 percent in every developed </v>

387
00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:16.990
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No exceptions.</v>

388
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

389
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to,</v>

390
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 2>to spending on the cooler on children on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sick,</v>

391
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:27.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the rates of absolute poverty have </v>

392
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:30.070
<v Speaker 2>fallen in wealthy countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not only,</v>

393
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:30.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

394
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:36.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed developing world become </v>

395
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 2>wealthier and not directly expensive the</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed world,</v>

396
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:43.231
<v Speaker 2>but in the developed world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to some amount of social </v>

397
00:21:43.231 --> 00:21:45.661
<v Speaker 2>spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could call it </v>

398
00:21:45.661 --> 00:21:45.661
<v Speaker 2>redistribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

399
00:21:45.661 --> 00:21:45.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even as inequality has risen,</v>

400
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.230
<v Speaker 2>poverty has not.</v>

401
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

402
00:21:48.311 --> 00:21:53.311
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading a book by Walter </v>

403
00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Shadelle called the great leveler is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent book and one of the things he </v>

404
00:21:57.041 --> 00:22:00.640
<v Speaker 1>did was an empirical analysis of left </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus right wing governments,</v>

405
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I think across the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might've gone farther back then </v>

406
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.800
<v Speaker 1>now to see if there was any difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Gini Coefficient across the </v>

407
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.991
<v Speaker 1>classes of government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he found was that there was no </v>

408
00:22:12.991 --> 00:22:16.980
<v Speaker 1>difference whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes a fairly strong case that the </v>

409
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.401
<v Speaker 1>only redistributive techniques that work</v>
<v Speaker 1>our pestilence and war essentially,</v>

410
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:22.810
<v Speaker 1>and that's because they knock everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to zero,</v>

411
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.380
<v Speaker 1>but you're making a different case like </v>
<v Speaker 1>an incremental case in some sense,</v>

412
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:31.381
<v Speaker 1>which is that governments perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of their ideological </v>

413
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 1>proclivities in the 20th centuries as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've become more wealthy,</v>

414
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.180
<v Speaker 1>they have incrementally devoted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger part of their,</v>

415
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:45.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their resources to incremental </v>

416
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.571
<v Speaker 1>improvements in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think about it as an </v>

417
00:22:48.571 --> 00:22:50.861
<v Speaker 1>investment in the future rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>redistribution or investment in social </v>

418
00:22:50.861 --> 00:22:54.310
<v Speaker 1>capital education and health care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those sorts of things that,</v>

419
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:55.810
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably,</v>

420
00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:01.260
<v Speaker 2>it's probably some combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a combination of investment in </v>

421
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.360
<v Speaker 2>public goods because of course the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>society is better off if,</v>

422
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.280
<v Speaker 2>if everyone's educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

423
00:23:04.281 --> 00:23:06.910
<v Speaker 2>also in assurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people support a,</v>

424
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:07.620
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

425
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 2>a safety net that's most popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>euphemism for social spending because </v>

426
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.661
<v Speaker 2>you never know whether it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>you or your or your mother or your </v>

427
00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:19.811
<v Speaker 2>brother who's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to be a need in the lottery </v>

428
00:23:19.811 --> 00:23:21.800
<v Speaker 2>of misfortune.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then part of it's part of it is,</v>

429
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.250
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

430
00:23:22.251 --> 00:23:24.770
<v Speaker 2>his charity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the modern conscience,</v>

431
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.020
<v Speaker 2>won't allow the little match girl to </v>
<v Speaker 2>freeze to death.</v>

432
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.310
<v Speaker 2>The jokes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

433
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.030
<v Speaker 2>to Barry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandpa by the side of route 66.</v>

434
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 2>And so I think social spending has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed along by,</v>

435
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.300
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

436
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.520
<v Speaker 2>all three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

437
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.620
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't necessarily in some countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably has reduced the Gini </v>

438
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.131
<v Speaker 2>Coefficient in western European </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries which have a more aggressive </v>

439
00:23:45.131 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 2>system of taxation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States or Canada,</v>

440
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.900
<v Speaker 2>but more important than the ginny </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution is that it's reduced the </v>

441
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.411
<v Speaker 2>number of people living in poverty which</v>
<v Speaker 2>are morally relevant measure at any </v>

442
00:23:56.411 --> 00:23:56.411
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

443
00:23:56.411 --> 00:24:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those two things are complicated </v>

444
00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.110
<v Speaker 1>because obviously you want to raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out of abject poverty.</v>

445
00:24:02.111 --> 00:24:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

446
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:07.620
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a zero argument proposition and </v>

447
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.650
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be happening very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question after that I suppose is to </v>

448
00:24:11.171 --> 00:24:16.171
<v Speaker 1>what degree does the remaining degree of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality that's generated by </v>

449
00:24:16.171 --> 00:24:18.550
<v Speaker 1>productive capital assistance also </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituted social threat?</v>

450
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Because there is evidence it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>reviewed best buy in the spirit level </v>

451
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.560
<v Speaker 1>that as inequality increases rates of </v>
<v Speaker 1>male homicide,</v>

452
00:24:26.561 --> 00:24:31.561
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase in all sorts of other negative </v>

453
00:24:31.561 --> 00:24:34.411
<v Speaker 1>measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some weird interaction </v>

454
00:24:34.411 --> 00:24:37.381
<v Speaker 1>between raising absolute levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and ensuring that inequality </v>

455
00:24:37.381 --> 00:24:38.520
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

456
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.330
<v Speaker 1>exceed some hypothetical optimal that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

457
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.650
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be considered in social </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>

458
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

459
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I signed some skeptical Ri analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the data in the spirit level.</v>

460
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.880
<v Speaker 2>And probably absolute prosperity matters</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than inequality in determining a </v>

461
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.860
<v Speaker 2>social health include such as happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime,</v>

462
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:09.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other kinds of social pathologies like </v>

463
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:09.270
<v Speaker 2>drug addictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

464
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.780
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to try to tease them </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

465
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:11.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

466
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries like Sweden are a very </v>

467
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.920
<v Speaker 2>egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also very rich that are more</v>

468
00:25:19.921 --> 00:25:24.921
<v Speaker 2>lopsided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also very poor and so it </v>

469
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:27.681
<v Speaker 2>takes a little bit of statistical wizard</v>
<v Speaker 2>rated to tie them apart and my reading </v>

470
00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:30.921
<v Speaker 2>of the literature is that it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperity that is more important than </v>

471
00:25:30.921 --> 00:25:31.560
<v Speaker 2>that at any quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>

472
00:25:31.561 --> 00:25:36.561
<v Speaker 2>and this is a point that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological literature rate was </v>

473
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.500
<v Speaker 2>emphasized by Christina's Storman's and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Bloom that what people sometimes </v>

474
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.211
<v Speaker 2>think of as a sort of aversion to </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality to people having different </v>

475
00:25:48.091 --> 00:25:53.091
<v Speaker 2>amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually an aversion to unfairness </v>

476
00:25:53.091 --> 00:25:53.091
<v Speaker 2>to injustice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

477
00:25:53.091 --> 00:25:57.560
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people would really infuriates </v>

478
00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.781
<v Speaker 2>people who said they think that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people at the top half ill gotten gains </v>

479
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:02.670
<v Speaker 2>equal if they sense that the system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically fair,</v>

480
00:26:02.671 --> 00:26:05.940
<v Speaker 2>that either greater effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talent,</v>

481
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.590
<v Speaker 2>or even luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

482
00:26:07.591 --> 00:26:11.370
<v Speaker 2>result in an unequal distribution of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>impartial lottery,</v>

483
00:26:11.371 --> 00:26:12.960
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're okay with that.</v>

484
00:26:12.961 --> 00:26:14.140
<v Speaker 2>It's cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That really.</v>

485
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people are really good at </v>

486
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:19.460
<v Speaker 1>remembering cheating and recognizing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

487
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

488
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is something we could talk </v>

489
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 1>about for a minute because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

490
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the is political.</v>

491
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:33.310
<v Speaker 1>What do you call rumblings about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that I think a lot of this is </v>

492
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.711
<v Speaker 1>generated by the radical left types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly on the campuses that the </v>

493
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:38.910
<v Speaker 1>system is rigged and that it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive patriarchy.</v>

494
00:26:38.911 --> 00:26:43.911
<v Speaker 1>And that the reason that people were at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top is because they played power </v>

495
00:26:43.911 --> 00:26:43.911
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

496
00:26:43.911 --> 00:26:48.701
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sense is that the control is that </v>

497
00:26:48.701 --> 00:26:52.360
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're ethnic or racial or gender groups </v>

498
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.581
<v Speaker 1>and we're competing in the Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner and those who win have one </v>

499
00:26:55.581 --> 00:26:58.731
<v Speaker 1>because of oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know the literature on the </v>

500
00:26:58.731 --> 00:27:01.800
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual differences and longterm life</v>

501
00:27:01.801 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 1>success in the Western world and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature is actually very clear.</v>

502
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:10.850
<v Speaker 1>So intelligence seems to account for </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 20 percent of the variance in </v>

503
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:15.441
<v Speaker 1>longterm life success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then trait conscientiousness </v>

504
00:27:15.441 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 1>accounts for perhaps another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10 to 15 percent.</v>

505
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.120
<v Speaker 1>And then there's smaller contributions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of emotional stability.</v>

506
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also have trait openness,</v>

507
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:26.440
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be a good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial ability.</v>

508
00:27:26.441 --> 00:27:31.441
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like in the West that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can attribute about 40 to 50 percent of </v>

509
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 1>the variance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a little high,</v>

510
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:38.271
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not radical over estimate to the </v>

511
00:27:38.271 --> 00:27:41.691
<v Speaker 1>sorts of individual differences that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with productivity because </v>

512
00:27:41.691 --> 00:27:44.850
<v Speaker 1>increases an Iq Higher Iq at higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness definitely make people</v>

513
00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:49.851
<v Speaker 1>more productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that you can use that as </v>

514
00:27:49.851 --> 00:27:50.320
<v Speaker 1>an index of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

515
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:56.060
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the genuinely meritocratic nature of </v>

516
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.791
<v Speaker 1>a culture and also as an index of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to engage in fair play </v>

517
00:27:58.791 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 1>because you'd expect if a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your culture is aimed at productivity</v>

518
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out that those are the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>pr and it turns out that the most </v>

519
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:09.840
<v Speaker 1>productive people are in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentially rewarded.</v>

520
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:14.070
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>index of the success of the society.</v>

521
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Now that data is still leaves 50 to 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the variance and explained.</v>

522
00:28:19.261 --> 00:28:23.640
<v Speaker 1>And so you can in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can include racism and prejudice and</v>

523
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:28.790
<v Speaker 1>the tyranny of the system and blind luck</v>
<v Speaker 1>and physical health and all the </v>

524
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:33.171
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary random events that make up </v>
<v Speaker 1>that determined whether someone is </v>

525
00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:37.161
<v Speaker 1>successful or failures in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it does seem to me to provide a </v>

526
00:28:37.161 --> 00:28:40.821
<v Speaker 1>metric saying that not only is our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society crazily productive and </v>

527
00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 1>reasonably and reasonably good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>district distributing the spoils,</v>

528
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:45.480
<v Speaker 1>even though there's still some </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>

529
00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:50.481
<v Speaker 1>but a fair bit of inequality is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>generated as a consequence of </v>

530
00:28:50.481 --> 00:28:53.220
<v Speaker 1>differences in genuine productivity that</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem reasonable to you.</v>

531
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

532
00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.200
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

533
00:28:55.310 --> 00:29:00.310
<v Speaker 2>it ought to be obvious and the now </v>
<v Speaker 2>except for the fact that in a lot of </v>

534
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:04.451
<v Speaker 2>intellectual life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assumption is that the correlation </v>

535
00:29:04.451 --> 00:29:05.840
<v Speaker 2>between psychological traits and success</v>
<v Speaker 2>at zero.</v>

536
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.510
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that it's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

537
00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.920
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's 40 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's 33 percent,</v>

538
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:15.250
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot higher than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than most people are willing to </v>

539
00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.250
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you said is exactly right.</v>

540
00:29:16.251 --> 00:29:21.251
<v Speaker 2>That leaves more than half of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>variance not to be correlated with </v>

541
00:29:21.251 --> 00:29:25.910
<v Speaker 2>individual differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course various inequities could </v>

542
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.890
<v Speaker 2>go into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're not mutually exclusive.</v>

543
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:32.850
<v Speaker 3>It seems hard.</v>

544
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.880
<v Speaker 2>We know that there's a lot of gaming of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the system,</v>

545
00:29:36.881 --> 00:29:37.510
<v Speaker 2>particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

546
00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.640
<v Speaker 3>by the wealthy.</v>

547
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that should obviously be eliminated.</v>

548
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:44.650
<v Speaker 2>It's not meritocratic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not fair.</v>

549
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:49.651
<v Speaker 2>It's not productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could also ask another question is </v>

550
00:29:49.651 --> 00:29:53.880
<v Speaker 2>whether the rewards that go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>untalented aren't necessarily in sectors</v>

551
00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:57.700
<v Speaker 2>that lead to what we might call a </v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity in the sense of,</v>

552
00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.350
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

553
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.840
<v Speaker 2>increasing societal wealth and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument can be made that there is some </v>

554
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 2>misallocation of intellectual resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have.</v>

555
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

556
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.480
<v Speaker 2>the economy is too driven by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by finance that the,</v>

557
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are too many lawsuits.</v>

558
00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Legal system is who each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

559
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.200
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

560
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.530
<v Speaker 2>arrested by intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this does still leave a,</v>

561
00:30:20.531 --> 00:30:22.930
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place for criticizing a number of the,</v>

562
00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

563
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:28.030
<v Speaker 2>the ways in which our economy is set up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always scope for improvement.</v>

564
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about why despite the </v>

565
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.551
<v Speaker 1>fact that a fair bit of the variance or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a third to half of the variance in life </v>

566
00:30:38.091 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 1>success is taken up by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

567
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.960
<v Speaker 1>individual attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still room for a systemic </v>

568
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:44.960
<v Speaker 1>critique that's valid.</v>

569
00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:50.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the pathologies of intellectual </v>

570
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.351
<v Speaker 4>life that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote about it in the blank slate of </v>

571
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.350
<v Speaker 4>the denial of human nature was that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

572
00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:59.620
<v Speaker 4>the in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in polite company in intellectual </v>

573
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.070
<v Speaker 4>circles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of life success determined by</v>

574
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:06.080
<v Speaker 4>a inherent and largely heritable </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological traits has to be zero.</v>

575
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just the,</v>

576
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.520
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

577
00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

578
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:13.400
<v Speaker 4>only acceptable position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you and I know it's not zero.</v>

579
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Well also just send me interject for one</v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

580
00:31:16.191 --> 00:31:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fairness element there.</v>

581
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.480
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that that's extraordinary</v>

582
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.400
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily selfserving of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

583
00:31:23.401 --> 00:31:27.270
<v Speaker 1>because if you get together with a group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Harvard professors,</v>

584
00:31:27.271 --> 00:31:32.271
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious that their innate </v>

585
00:31:32.271 --> 00:31:35.931
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is one of the factors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine their success and to deny the </v>

586
00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:40.191
<v Speaker 1>fact that heritable differences make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference means perhaps to act as an </v>

587
00:31:41.131 --> 00:31:46.131
<v Speaker 1>Avatar of a social justice orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but equally to deny the role of,</v>

588
00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 1>of the benefits of chance in your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>success and to therefore lack a certain </v>

589
00:31:53.071 --> 00:31:56.400
<v Speaker 1>degree of humility that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise be required to have.</v>

590
00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:01.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not claiming that you were </v>

591
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.661
<v Speaker 1>implying this at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not all in the service of </v>

592
00:32:05.661 --> 00:32:09.150
<v Speaker 1>higher social ideals that people denied </v>
<v Speaker 1>the contribution of,</v>

593
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.820
<v Speaker 1>of heritable components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

594
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.890
<v Speaker 1>the birth laundry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

595
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.190
<v Speaker 1>whoops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just stepped.</v>

596
00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

597
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.740
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately the video just froze.</v>

598
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.280
<v Speaker 4>And after you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying you claim this,</v>

599
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:31.770
<v Speaker 4>you suddenly froze on the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not saying you're claiming this.</v>

600
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

601
00:32:33.191 --> 00:32:36.190
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems self serving for people who are</v>

602
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:37.990
<v Speaker 1>particularly bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

603
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:43.350
<v Speaker 1>to not be grateful for the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they won the genetic lottery in that,</v>

604
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:48.730
<v Speaker 1>in that manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sufficiently humble to not know what</v>

605
00:32:51.701 --> 00:32:55.580
<v Speaker 1>the role of that arbitrary chance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining their success.</v>

606
00:32:55.610 --> 00:33:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they don't deserve their </v>

607
00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.141
<v Speaker 1>success because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But claiming a certain degree of </v>

608
00:33:02.141 --> 00:33:06.041
<v Speaker 1>biological determinism doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily make you a bad person even </v>

609
00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:10.871
<v Speaker 1>though it can be read that way because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you very sensitive to your own </v>

610
00:33:10.871 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 1>good fortune if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think it through carefully.</v>

611
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

612
00:33:15.211 --> 00:33:18.030
<v Speaker 4>successful people are the winners of at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least three lotteries.</v>

613
00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.740
<v Speaker 4>One of them that you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course it's the Connecticut lottery,</v>

614
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:26.870
<v Speaker 4>the fact that some people were born with</v>
<v Speaker 4>greater intelligence and </v>

615
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.470
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness and openness to </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

616
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 4>Another is that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a second lottery in a human development </v>

617
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:38.930
<v Speaker 4>that is not strictly genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is in a sense of constitutional </v>

618
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:41.910
<v Speaker 4>or developmental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that I might consider this,</v>

619
00:33:41.911 --> 00:33:46.911
<v Speaker 4>one of the most profound discoveries in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the history of psychology that </v>

620
00:33:46.911 --> 00:33:51.071
<v Speaker 4>correlations between identical twins </v>
<v Speaker 4>reared together are generally on the </v>

621
00:33:51.781 --> 00:33:56.310
<v Speaker 4>order of five point five and they share </v>
<v Speaker 4>not only their genome,</v>

622
00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.250
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the vast amount of their environments,</v>

623
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.020
<v Speaker 4>their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their neighborhoods,</v>

624
00:34:01.021 --> 00:34:04.260
<v Speaker 4>their older siblings or younger sibs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The number of books in the house,</v>

625
00:34:04.261 --> 00:34:06.630
<v Speaker 4>number of guns in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>number of tvs in the house,</v>

626
00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.370
<v Speaker 4>they're not indistinguishable.</v>

627
00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Identical twins are a correlate quite </v>
<v Speaker 4>highly,</v>

628
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:17.570
<v Speaker 4>but no one near perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which means that there is a second </v>

629
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.301
<v Speaker 4>lottery that has to do either with just </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way the brain congeals during </v>

630
00:34:21.451 --> 00:34:26.451
<v Speaker 4>development,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which can be specified down to the last </v>

631
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:29.040
<v Speaker 4>snips by the genes and perhaps by chance</v>
<v Speaker 4>life events,</v>

632
00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:34.070
<v Speaker 4>which might leave unpredictable traces </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we can't add a document store or </v>

633
00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:37.410
<v Speaker 4>systematically understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then of course there's the third lottery</v>

634
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.440
<v Speaker 4>of what happens to you in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>profession.</v>

635
00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:47.540
<v Speaker 4>Did you bet on the right sector?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you happen to have a good </v>

636
00:34:48.481 --> 00:34:51.480
<v Speaker 4>relationship with the boss?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Numerous.</v>

637
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of being in the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>place at the right time,</v>

638
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.920
<v Speaker 4>the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all that having been said,</v>

639
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

640
00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.690
<v Speaker 4>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're absolutely right.</v>

641
00:34:59.691 --> 00:35:04.691
<v Speaker 4>We have to acknowledge the role of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of hereditary temperament.</v>

642
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:11.060
<v Speaker 4>Untalent be known zero role of chance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that still leaves a big chunk of the</v>

643
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:16.061
<v Speaker 4>variants that could be due to a systemic</v>
<v Speaker 4>features of the system that perhaps </v>

644
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:21.731
<v Speaker 4>ought to be changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just no doubt that the wealthy </v>

645
00:35:21.731 --> 00:35:21.731
<v Speaker 4>game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the system,</v>

646
00:35:21.731 --> 00:35:25.631
<v Speaker 4>particularly in the United States in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>number of ways that don't work to the </v>

647
00:35:25.631 --> 00:35:29.590
<v Speaker 4>benefit of society at large.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are also aspects of the system </v>

648
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.701
<v Speaker 4>that are perhaps fair but irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that so much of our </v>

649
00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:35.930
<v Speaker 4>intellectual talent now gets sucked into</v>
<v Speaker 4>finance.</v>

650
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:41.260
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course we do need a financial sector </v>

651
00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:41.260
<v Speaker 4>and it's weird that they're smart people</v>
<v Speaker 4>in it,</v>

652
00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.190
<v Speaker 4>but having a lot of our brain power </v>
<v Speaker 4>devoted to figuring out how to act on </v>

653
00:35:46.261 --> 00:35:51.261
<v Speaker 4>financial information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Microsoft microsecond faster than ones </v>

654
00:35:51.261 --> 00:35:54.080
<v Speaker 4>competitors is probably not the best use</v>
<v Speaker 4>of our societies.</v>

655
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 4>Intellectual capital.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Likewise,</v>

656
00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:01.470
<v Speaker 4>there's no doubt that we have far too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much brain power invested in a legal </v>

657
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:06.531
<v Speaker 4>system in a corporation suing each other</v>
<v Speaker 4>patent trolling a and another not so </v>

658
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:07.920
<v Speaker 4>productive uses.</v>

659
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.940
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing is too though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's an erotica erotica of </v>

660
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.440
<v Speaker 1>pathology in in a system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense.</v>

661
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that struck me quite </v>

662
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.350
<v Speaker 1>hard for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you look at the creativity </v>

663
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:30.330
<v Speaker 1>curves across the lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they matched the criminality curves </v>

664
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.220
<v Speaker 1>almost perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that make me think</v>

665
00:36:33.221 --> 00:36:37.390
<v Speaker 1>when I was doing that research was so as</v>
<v Speaker 1>young men become more antisocial,</v>

666
00:36:37.391 --> 00:36:42.391
<v Speaker 1>they also become more creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though those things might not be </v>

667
00:36:42.391 --> 00:36:42.490
<v Speaker 1>correlated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do map on top of one another.</v>

668
00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I was taking in a society like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

669
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.510
<v Speaker 1>which has a fair degree of criminality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also a fair degree of creativity.</v>

670
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how loose the system has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be so that malfeasance can thrive so </v>

671
00:36:56.831 --> 00:37:01.831
<v Speaker 1>that it can also be similar caneously </v>
<v Speaker 1>loose enough so that creativity can </v>

672
00:37:01.831 --> 00:37:01.831
<v Speaker 1>thrive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

673
00:37:01.831 --> 00:37:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Because you might think if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic that you can tighten up the </v>

674
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.481
<v Speaker 1>system and get rid of the criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior without adding a totalitarian </v>

675
00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:11.860
<v Speaker 1>layer to this system that would also </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously demolish,</v>

676
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual variability and creativity.</v>

677
00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:20.220
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our models just aren't sophisticated </v>

678
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:20.220
<v Speaker 1>enough to see such things apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

679
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

680
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.060
<v Speaker 4>there I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not so sure there.</v>

681
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:23.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

682
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 4>I do agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain amount of,</v>

683
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:31.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>risk taking or young men on the bake </v>

684
00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.930
<v Speaker 4>that might underlie both criminality and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a productive creativity.</v>

685
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.820
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

686
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:39.830
<v Speaker 4>over the course of history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the accomplishments of </v>

687
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:40.840
<v Speaker 4>civilization and indeed have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

688
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 4>an enlightenment driven progress is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have managed to tease them apart.</v>

689
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.710
<v Speaker 4>Just two examples are the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rate of homicide punished by a factor of</v>

690
00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:52.620
<v Speaker 4>about 35 from the Middle Ages to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>20th century,</v>

691
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.770
<v Speaker 4>and that in fact that includes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientific revolution,</v>

692
00:37:55.771 --> 00:38:00.771
<v Speaker 4>the industrial revolution lightened </v>
<v Speaker 4>meant into all of the advances of the </v>

693
00:38:00.771 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 4>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So justice people were not stabbing each</v>

694
00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:03.680
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for instance,</v>

695
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.800
<v Speaker 4>if they were also coming up with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory of evolution and the atomic </v>

696
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.570
<v Speaker 4>theory of matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then again,</v>

697
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:15.200
<v Speaker 4>19 nineties when the rate of violent </v>
<v Speaker 4>crime in the United States fell by half </v>

698
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.360
<v Speaker 4>and they were also declines in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Britain,</v>

699
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:22.670
<v Speaker 4>other western countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This certainly it was not a time of </v>

700
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.670
<v Speaker 4>economic stagnation or.</v>

701
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

702
00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:24.610
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

703
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess then the question starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become is how in the world did those </v>

704
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:33.151
<v Speaker 1>things get teased apart so that we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to regulate anti social behavior </v>

705
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:36.781
<v Speaker 1>without simultaneously making things </v>
<v Speaker 1>excessively rigid,</v>

706
00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:39.460
<v Speaker 1>unregulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian.</v>

707
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.160
<v Speaker 1>We managed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's part of that same incremental</v>

708
00:38:42.161 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 1>process that you detailed out at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of our talk.</v>

709
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing that struck me about your </v>

710
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.860
<v Speaker 1>book that was quite interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was that you list the names</v>

711
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:55.861
<v Speaker 1>of a very large number of totally unsung</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes and those are people in.</v>

712
00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 1>We have a very interesting table near </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning where you list,</v>

713
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I think about 10 names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 12 of people who've saved between </v>

714
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of billions and billions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives with their scientific,</v>

715
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.990
<v Speaker 1>but they're incremental scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

716
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.470
<v Speaker 1>And yet those are people that are by no </v>
<v Speaker 1>means household names.</v>

717
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.140
<v Speaker 1>That's another place where things don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the news.</v>

718
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:18.510
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

719
00:39:18.511 --> 00:39:23.420
<v Speaker 4>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny how our moral,</v>

720
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:28.790
<v Speaker 4>a crediting our moral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our awarding of moral Brownie points </v>

721
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:33.690
<v Speaker 4>doesn't quite correlate with how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>good it often doesn't at all correlate.</v>

722
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the case of the inventors of </v>

723
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.540
<v Speaker 4>synthetic fertilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vaccines of chlorination,</v>

724
00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:47.541
<v Speaker 4>of public water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>supplies of the green revolution in </v>

725
00:39:47.541 --> 00:39:48.090
<v Speaker 4>agriculture are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are pretty much unknown.</v>

726
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.110
<v Speaker 4>And they literally say billions of lives</v>
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>

727
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:56.240
<v Speaker 4>whereas various reformers and profits </v>
<v Speaker 4>and agitators are a pretty well known.</v>

728
00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.370
<v Speaker 4>A number of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

729
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:04.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly people who are sanctioned by </v>

730
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.820
<v Speaker 4>the Roman Catholic Church who have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>perform a miracle that might resolve it,</v>

731
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.150
<v Speaker 4>results in saving one life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

732
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.890
<v Speaker 4>in fact did not because miracles don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

733
00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:16.340
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that that definition of </v>
<v Speaker 4>saint has nothing to do with saving </v>

734
00:40:16.501 --> 00:40:21.501
<v Speaker 4>lives on skills of millions or billions </v>
<v Speaker 4>to shows like human moral sense is not </v>

735
00:40:22.591 --> 00:40:26.610
<v Speaker 4>really well calibrated to morality as we</v>
<v Speaker 4>would a defended by,</v>

736
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:32.460
<v Speaker 4>I think it was stolen who said something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a single death is a tragedy,</v>

737
00:40:32.461 --> 00:40:37.350
<v Speaker 4>but a million deaths is a statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He actually didn't say it,</v>

738
00:40:37.351 --> 00:40:37.740
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

739
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:38.330
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

740
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.140
<v Speaker 4>it's a conventionally attributed to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's say for good reason.</v>

741
00:40:43.141 --> 00:40:48.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose I could have said it to or I </v>

742
00:40:48.141 --> 00:40:49.760
<v Speaker 4>guess maybe the same thing plays in </v>
<v Speaker 4>reverse a,</v>

743
00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:50.160
<v Speaker 4>is that</v>

744
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:55.510
<v Speaker 1>the saving of a single life has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative punch and the incremental </v>

745
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.430
<v Speaker 1>savings of 100 million lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially through prevention.</v>

746
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:59.840
<v Speaker 1>That's another problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

747
00:40:59.841 --> 00:41:04.841
<v Speaker 1>Because prevention isn't dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the terrible thing merely </v>

748
00:41:04.841 --> 00:41:05.310
<v Speaker 1>doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not,</v>

749
00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:07.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

750
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:12.130
<v Speaker 4>I rather cheekily wrote an article on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the human moral sense that began with a,</v>

751
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.200
<v Speaker 4>who do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who do you think is most morally </v>

752
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.051
<v Speaker 4>praiseworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mother Teresa or Bill Gates or Norman </v>

753
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:23.620
<v Speaker 4>Borlaug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this was before a gates is pivot </v>

754
00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.440
<v Speaker 4>from a computer technology to </v>
<v Speaker 4>philanthropy was,</v>

755
00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:27.170
<v Speaker 4>was well known.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was about 10 years ago.</v>

756
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:32.470
<v Speaker 4>And I set it up as a bit of a trick </v>
<v Speaker 4>question because of course everyone </v>

757
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:35.351
<v Speaker 4>would say mother Teresa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even in our field and in of moral </v>

758
00:41:35.351 --> 00:41:38.831
<v Speaker 4>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever a speaker has to pull out at </v>

759
00:41:38.831 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 4>the end example of a particularly moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>

760
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.250
<v Speaker 4>Mother Teresa is the stereotype.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though if you ask people,</v>

761
00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what exactly did she accomplish?</v>

762
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.140
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many lives did she save?</v>

763
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:50.120
<v Speaker 4>How many sick people did she actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>cure?</v>

764
00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:55.380
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very hard to come up with our </v>

765
00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.851
<v Speaker 4>actual accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does Bill Gates has already been </v>

766
00:41:57.851 --> 00:42:01.030
<v Speaker 4>credited with saving perhaps 100 million</v>
<v Speaker 4>lives through his efforts to eliminate </v>

767
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.110
<v Speaker 4>effective infectious disease loving </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

768
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.800
<v Speaker 4>And Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace </v>
<v Speaker 4>Prize in 1974.</v>

769
00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:11.801
<v Speaker 4>His role in fomenting the green </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolution probably saved a billion </v>

770
00:42:11.801 --> 00:42:16.421
<v Speaker 4>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>selective breeding of hybrid crops that </v>

771
00:42:16.421 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 4>required less fertilizer that could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>grown twice a year,</v>

772
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.500
<v Speaker 4>less water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher yields,</v>

773
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 4>less susceptibility to disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

774
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:27.020
<v Speaker 4>which are countries like Mexico and </v>
<v Speaker 4>India from,</v>

775
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.330
<v Speaker 4>from basket cases to exporters of food </v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

776
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in less than a decade.</v>

777
00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:37.140
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that would be a story that </v>

778
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.061
<v Speaker 5>everyone in in elementary and junior </v>
<v Speaker 5>high school would learn because it's </v>

779
00:42:39.061 --> 00:42:41.980
<v Speaker 5>such a remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely remarkable story and no one,</v>

780
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what percentage of people </v>

781
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:47.280
<v Speaker 5>would know his name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his name,</v>

782
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.250
<v Speaker 5>but I don't imagine it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

783
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.130
<v Speaker 5>I suspect it's in the low percentages if</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

784
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.450
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

785
00:42:52.451 --> 00:42:53.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that's right.</v>

786
00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.460
<v Speaker 4>I think it may have been a change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I seem to recall a,</v>

787
00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:00.370
<v Speaker 4>although I hate to begin any sentence </v>
<v Speaker 4>with when I was young,</v>

788
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we,</v>

789
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.320
<v Speaker 4>we did read a heroic biographies of </v>
<v Speaker 4>medical pioneers,</v>

790
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.260
<v Speaker 4>like the discover of intuitive and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Thomas Edison,</v>

791
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know if that kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>heroic biography of the innovator of the</v>

792
00:43:18.921 --> 00:43:23.921
<v Speaker 4>inventor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a scientist is as common in children's </v>

793
00:43:23.921 --> 00:43:23.921
<v Speaker 4>education.</v>

794
00:43:23.921 --> 00:43:25.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suspect I strongly suspect not.</v>

795
00:43:25.651 --> 00:43:30.651
<v Speaker 5>It certainly wouldn't be in Canada given</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tilt that our education system has </v>

796
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:30.651
<v Speaker 5>taken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

797
00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:36.140
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so a couple of a couple of broader </v>

798
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:36.140
<v Speaker 5>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

799
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.580
<v Speaker 5>if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a whole corpus of work and </v>

800
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.960
<v Speaker 5>there are recurrent themes in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>

801
00:43:42.961 --> 00:43:47.430
<v Speaker 5>One of them being things are getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>better in ways that we really don't know</v>

802
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:52.710
<v Speaker 5>and what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if you could have what you wanted </v>

803
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.880
<v Speaker 5>with regards to the impact of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>books,</v>

804
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:59.610
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would you want that impact to be </v>

805
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.980
<v Speaker 5>and also what do you think like one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the things I've done on twitter recently</v>

806
00:44:01.981 --> 00:44:06.360
<v Speaker 5>because I'm trying to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>use twitter is to tilt my tweets towards</v>

807
00:44:06.361 --> 00:44:11.361
<v Speaker 5>people like human progress.org.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone you site in your introduction </v>

808
00:44:11.361 --> 00:44:14.010
<v Speaker 5>and people who are purveying information</v>
<v Speaker 5>while including yourself by the way,</v>

809
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:19.310
<v Speaker 5>who are purveying information about how </v>
<v Speaker 5>much better things are getting and so </v>

810
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:23.270
<v Speaker 5>what impact would you like to have your </v>
<v Speaker 5>books have and how do you see that </v>

811
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.640
<v Speaker 5>playing out psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>politically,</v>

812
00:44:23.641 --> 00:44:28.641
<v Speaker 5>and what do you think people who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>listening now say could do practically </v>

813
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.960
<v Speaker 5>to get the good news out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak?</v>

814
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 4>Certainly intellectual life should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>more data driven.</v>

815
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:40.970
<v Speaker 4>How bad you shouldn't be allowed to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>or talk about any reported trend based </v>

816
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:47.151
<v Speaker 4>on an event that happened yesterday or </v>
<v Speaker 4>this year because trend means change </v>

817
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:52.461
<v Speaker 4>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in so many areas we really do have </v>

818
00:44:52.461 --> 00:44:54.690
<v Speaker 4>data and it's just irresponsible not to </v>
<v Speaker 4>cite those data,</v>

819
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:59.930
<v Speaker 4>particularly since they have become </v>
<v Speaker 4>increasingly available through websites </v>

820
00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 4>like our world and data and keeping </v>
<v Speaker 4>progress.</v>

821
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.640
<v Speaker 4>So I'd like to see a replacement of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological debate,</v>

822
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:14.750
<v Speaker 4>which so much of our current debate is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's whether the right or the left is </v>

823
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:17.150
<v Speaker 4>more St Louis Moral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

824
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:19.860
<v Speaker 4>praiseworthy correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And more,</v>

825
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:20.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

826
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.450
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's look at the data.</v>

827
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:25.340
<v Speaker 4>It chances are that neither an off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shelf position of the left door,</v>

828
00:45:25.341 --> 00:45:28.260
<v Speaker 4>an off the shelf position of the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>is likely to have it all figured out.</v>

829
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.080
<v Speaker 4>No one is on this event or infallible.</v>

830
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 4>These ideologies go back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the French revolution,</v>

831
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:38.580
<v Speaker 4>and they're unlikely to be the font of </v>
<v Speaker 4>solutions to complex problems.</v>

832
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:44.170
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's try to see what works and what </v>

833
00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:45.861
<v Speaker 4>doesn't and come up with the mixture of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what is most likely to solve our </v>

834
00:45:45.861 --> 00:45:49.431
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spoken like a true proponent of the </v>

835
00:45:49.431 --> 00:45:49.431
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

836
00:45:49.431 --> 00:45:49.880
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

837
00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 4>and stepping back even farther,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see a greater </v>

838
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.430
<v Speaker 4>integration of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

839
00:45:55.930 --> 00:46:00.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the insights and mindset of the science </v>

840
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:04.520
<v Speaker 4>into social and cultural affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As we talked about earlier in the </v>

841
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This very idea is often met with horror.</v>

842
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:14.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The humanities types I suppose in some </v>

843
00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:18.741
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't very happy with the idea that </v>

844
00:46:18.741 --> 00:46:18.741
<v Speaker 4>they'd have to learn statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I can,</v>

845
00:46:18.741 --> 00:46:20.040
<v Speaker 4>I have a certain amount of sympathy for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that perspective.</v>

846
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:21.510
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

847
00:46:21.511 --> 00:46:22.230
<v Speaker 4>there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

848
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:24.210
<v Speaker 4>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a horror therapy,</v>

849
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:27.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>expanding realm of five member in data.</v>

850
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.500
<v Speaker 4>And a horror,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Epi,</v>

851
00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.120
<v Speaker 4>a thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

852
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.630
<v Speaker 4>ideas about human nature from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

853
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 4>from science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from evolutionary psychology,</v>

854
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.460
<v Speaker 4>from behavioral genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from social and personality and </v>

855
00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.801
<v Speaker 4>cognitive psychology might be brought to</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear on our understanding of society,</v>

856
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.520
<v Speaker 4>of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

857
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.510
<v Speaker 4>of art,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literature,</v>

858
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:55.560
<v Speaker 4>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quite contrary to be the mindset of the </v>

859
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment where all of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightened few us off.</v>

860
00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.940
<v Speaker 4>We're a pretty serious psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be the field didn't exist at the </v>

861
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:03.510
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they weren't called that,</v>

862
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:08.870
<v Speaker 4>but they a mind the observations from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from travelers and missionaries and,</v>

863
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and explorers,</v>

864
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:17.300
<v Speaker 4>Opi ways of other cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They relied on their own observations </v>

865
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:21.850
<v Speaker 4>and common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tapped into what brain science </v>

866
00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:21.850
<v Speaker 4>existed at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not a,</v>

867
00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:25.430
<v Speaker 4>it's hardly a radical idea that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of,</v>

868
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:28.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of art and culture and society should be</v>

869
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 4>informed by our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of human nature.</v>

870
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:35.670
<v Speaker 4>But now the disciplines have become so </v>
<v Speaker 4>professionalized and they're housed in </v>

871
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:39.301
<v Speaker 4>different buildings on campus and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're rivals for the money from the </v>

872
00:47:39.301 --> 00:47:39.410
<v Speaker 4>dean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

873
00:47:39.411 --> 00:47:44.411
<v Speaker 4>there's a great hostility to the old </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment idea of consilience is </v>

874
00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:45.350
<v Speaker 4>often a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

875
00:47:45.351 --> 00:47:47.650
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a paranoid fear that this means that the</v>

876
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:51.220
<v Speaker 4>sciences we'll take over the humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which of course is preposterous.</v>

877
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:52.510
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would want to,</v>

878
00:47:52.511 --> 00:47:53.700
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't there be good.</v>

879
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:58.910
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think the sciences can really </v>

880
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.910
<v Speaker 5>inform the humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

881
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.910
<v Speaker 5>versa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

882
00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:03.720
<v Speaker 5>I'd been trained as a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My appreciation for the humanities is </v>

883
00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:03.900
<v Speaker 5>actually substantially deepened.</v>

884
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:07.690
<v Speaker 4>So in here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and indeed in many fields,</v>

885
00:48:07.691 --> 00:48:11.260
<v Speaker 4>this is a complete my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I own fields of linguistics.</v>

886
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.440
<v Speaker 4>It's just taken for granted that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And no one really cares where the </v>

887
00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.010
<v Speaker 4>humanities influences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ended the scientific ones.</v>

888
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Studies of philology of classical </v>
<v Speaker 4>grammar,</v>

889
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:27.600
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of texts now blend into a statistical </v>

890
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.951
<v Speaker 4>studies of Corpora of laboratory studies</v>
<v Speaker 4>have speech and language processing.</v>

891
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:38.880
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the where the science ends up in the </v>

892
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.010
<v Speaker 4>ends off the humanities begins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one even talks to him.</v>

893
00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.560
<v Speaker 5>The science can also really change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can really change your mind.</v>

894
00:48:42.561 --> 00:48:46.280
<v Speaker 5>Like I've looked at individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>differences in relationship to political</v>

895
00:48:46.281 --> 00:48:51.281
<v Speaker 5>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I've learned three things from </v>

896
00:48:51.281 --> 00:48:54.761
<v Speaker 5>doing that that I think are </v>
<v Speaker 5>revolutionary have been revolutionary </v>

897
00:48:54.761 --> 00:48:58.040
<v Speaker 5>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the first is that I'm liberal.</v>

898
00:48:58.041 --> 00:49:00.500
<v Speaker 5>Lefty types are characterized by higher </v>
<v Speaker 5>trade,</v>

899
00:49:00.501 --> 00:49:03.590
<v Speaker 5>openness and lower conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then conservatives,</v>

900
00:49:03.591 --> 00:49:05.750
<v Speaker 5>the reverse and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

901
00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.780
<v Speaker 5>well that's quite interesting because it</v>
<v Speaker 5>puts the liberal left types into </v>

902
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.570
<v Speaker 5>creative entrepreneurial domain because </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's characterized by high openness </v>

903
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:17.141
<v Speaker 5>and it puts the conservative types in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the managerial and administrative </v>

904
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:20.080
<v Speaker 5>domain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that implies that the liberal </v>

905
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.961
<v Speaker 5>left types create new ideas and new </v>
<v Speaker 5>enterprises including entrepreneurial </v>

906
00:49:22.961 --> 00:49:24.770
<v Speaker 5>enterprises because the data there is </v>
<v Speaker 5>fairly solid.</v>

907
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:30.040
<v Speaker 5>Whereas the conservative types manage </v>
<v Speaker 5>and administer those enterprises and so </v>

908
00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.240
<v Speaker 5>each needs the other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's that nice polarity </v>

909
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.260
<v Speaker 5>dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's also the idea that the </v>

910
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:43.181
<v Speaker 5>reason that openness and </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness unite to predict </v>

911
00:49:43.181 --> 00:49:43.700
<v Speaker 5>political behaviors because of borders.</v>

912
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:49.190
<v Speaker 5>So open people liked the borders between</v>
<v Speaker 5>concepts to be fluid so that there's </v>

913
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.350
<v Speaker 5>information exchange and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>orderly.</v>

914
00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.690
<v Speaker 5>The liberal types because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscientious.</v>

915
00:49:53.691 --> 00:49:57.290
<v Speaker 5>And so they don't see any utility in </v>
<v Speaker 5>keeping things categorically distinct.</v>

916
00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 5>Whereas the conservatives are afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the contamination of things because of </v>

917
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:06.881
<v Speaker 5>the movement of information and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>like to see the borders between things </v>

918
00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:11.290
<v Speaker 5>to to ensure that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the reason that openness </v>

919
00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:15.220
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness stack together as </v>
<v Speaker 5>predictors of political behavior seems </v>

920
00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:19.151
<v Speaker 5>to be because of the two fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 5>different attitudes toward towards </v>

921
00:50:20.001 --> 00:50:22.670
<v Speaker 5>borders all the way from the conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the political,</v>

922
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 5>so the right wingers think while borders</v>
<v Speaker 5>are good because that stops and </v>

923
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.670
<v Speaker 5>contamination is a real problem and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely problem often and the liberal</v>

924
00:50:31.671 --> 00:50:32.770
<v Speaker 5>lefty type state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

925
00:50:32.771 --> 00:50:37.771
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We want as much information to flow as </v>

926
00:50:37.771 --> 00:50:39.611
<v Speaker 5>possible and both of those perspectives </v>
<v Speaker 5>are valid and need to be discussed.</v>

927
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:45.610
<v Speaker 5>Then the other thing I learned from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>American empirical data was that </v>

928
00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.850
<v Speaker 5>orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is part of the part of </v>

929
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 5>conscientiousness predicts conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is associated with disgust,</v>

930
00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:54.941
<v Speaker 5>sensitivity and so that that feeds that </v>
<v Speaker 5>desire to maintain borders so that </v>

931
00:50:56.061 --> 00:51:01.061
<v Speaker 5>there's no cross contamination that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with what's been called the </v>

932
00:51:01.061 --> 00:51:04.871
<v Speaker 5>behavioral immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so those are actually quite </v>

933
00:51:04.871 --> 00:51:07.541
<v Speaker 5>revolutionary ideas from the perspective</v>
<v Speaker 5>of political theory or political belief </v>

934
00:51:07.541 --> 00:51:11.930
<v Speaker 5>is temperamentally determined that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason that the two temperamental traits</v>

935
00:51:11.931 --> 00:51:15.080
<v Speaker 5>determined political belief is because </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a difference in attitude,</v>

936
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:20.200
<v Speaker 5>fundamental difference in attitude </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards the borders between things that </v>

937
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 5>you can make a case for open and closed </v>
<v Speaker 5>borders on evolutionary grounds and that</v>

938
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:28.780
<v Speaker 5>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an association between </v>

939
00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.330
<v Speaker 5>conservatism and discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which for me shed tremendous light,</v>

940
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:31.700
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the motivations of Hitler who was an</v>

941
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:36.701
<v Speaker 5>extraordinarily orderly person and who </v>
<v Speaker 5>used disgust oriented language all the </v>

942
00:51:36.701 --> 00:51:38.810
<v Speaker 5>time when he was formulating his </v>
<v Speaker 5>policies of extermination.</v>

943
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:42.680
<v Speaker 5>So those are revolutionary contributions</v>
<v Speaker 5>of individual,</v>

944
00:51:42.681 --> 00:51:47.681
<v Speaker 5>different science to political theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all driven by hard data </v>

945
00:51:47.681 --> 00:51:48.320
<v Speaker 5>statistically derived.</v>

946
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:50.270
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

947
00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:55.290
<v Speaker 4>I agree and I can sense the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>paranoid reaction that these claims </v>

948
00:51:56.191 --> 00:52:01.191
<v Speaker 4>might elicit among some traditional </v>
<v Speaker 4>political theorists and thinkers that,</v>

949
00:52:01.831 --> 00:52:06.831
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you saying that the conservative </v>

950
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:08.040
<v Speaker 4>beliefs are nothing but an expression of</v>
<v Speaker 4>disgust sensitivity,</v>

951
00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:12.390
<v Speaker 4>and of course it doesn't apply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's a fascinating findings.</v>

952
00:52:12.391 --> 00:52:16.330
<v Speaker 4>Don't say that the earned income tax </v>
<v Speaker 4>credit is a good or a bad idea,</v>

953
00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:21.340
<v Speaker 4>or the Paris climate accords themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The issue still have to be decided on </v>

954
00:52:22.891 --> 00:52:25.410
<v Speaker 4>their merits the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do,</v>

955
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 4>if you are aware of your own potential </v>
<v Speaker 4>biases than that,</v>

956
00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:32.160
<v Speaker 4>that is a source of insight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a source of understanding.</v>

957
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 4>It could cause you to step back from </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own convictions and be more </v>

958
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.660
<v Speaker 4>receptive to arguments on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

959
00:52:39.661 --> 00:52:41.160
<v Speaker 4>that was definitely done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That for me,</v>

960
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:45.870
<v Speaker 4>that it can't not be a helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>CanNot be an important source of insight</v>

961
00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:47.850
<v Speaker 4>as to how political debates unfold.</v>

962
00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:48.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

963
00:52:48.541 --> 00:52:53.541
<v Speaker 5>if you know that the liberal left types </v>
<v Speaker 5>are necessary for the fostering of new </v>

964
00:52:53.541 --> 00:52:55.680
<v Speaker 5>enterprises and the Conservatives are </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessary to run them,</v>

965
00:52:56.190 --> 00:53:00.630
<v Speaker 5>then that certainly indicates why both </v>
<v Speaker 5>groups not only are necessary,</v>

966
00:53:00.631 --> 00:53:05.631
<v Speaker 5>but are all of mutual benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody has to maintain systems and </v>

967
00:53:05.631 --> 00:53:10.161
<v Speaker 5>someone has to expand them and those </v>
<v Speaker 5>things are gonna work in opposition to </v>

968
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:11.820
<v Speaker 5>one another because expanding a system </v>
<v Speaker 5>often fragmented,</v>

969
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:17.330
<v Speaker 5>so there's gonna be tension,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no system can remain static forever </v>

970
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:17.480
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

971
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:22.730
<v Speaker 5>and completely untrammeled </v>
<v Speaker 5>transformation throws everything into </v>

972
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:27.351
<v Speaker 5>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there obviously has to be a dialogue </v>

973
00:53:27.351 --> 00:53:29.540
<v Speaker 5>between those viewpoints like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like an opponent process issue </v>

974
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.150
<v Speaker 5>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And</v>

975
00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:31.620
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

976
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:32.120
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

977
00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:37.140
<v Speaker 4>all of us ought to be more aware,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have more insight into how our own </v>

978
00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.740
<v Speaker 4>psych,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychological proclivities might,</v>

979
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:46.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>affect the positions that seem to each </v>

980
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.970
<v Speaker 4>of us to be obvious.</v>

981
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:48.670
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that is what they do,</v>

982
00:53:48.671 --> 00:53:53.671
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the temperamental variable or </v>

983
00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:53.671
<v Speaker 5>variables actually tell you what is self</v>
<v Speaker 5>evident.</v>

984
00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:54.850
<v Speaker 5>That's how they operate.</v>

985
00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.000
<v Speaker 4>My understanding from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the literature that you're citing,</v>

986
00:53:58.001 --> 00:53:59.610
<v Speaker 4>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

987
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>variance and opinions that is correlated</v>

988
00:54:02.561 --> 00:54:04.880
<v Speaker 4>with personality differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

989
00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.290
<v Speaker 4>is also the hardest to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>give up to,</v>

990
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:09.490
<v Speaker 4>to persuade them.</v>

991
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:10.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

992
00:54:10.101 --> 00:54:12.820
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no doubt because I think the,</v>

993
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:16.210
<v Speaker 5>those temperamental differences are like</v>
<v Speaker 5>axiomatic values,</v>

994
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're grounded and I think they're</v>

995
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.050
<v Speaker 5>grounded in the hyper development of </v>
<v Speaker 5>separate circuitry.</v>

996
00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:26.040
<v Speaker 5>So it's going to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very mean.</v>

997
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.910
<v Speaker 5>And I also think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're an x,</v>

998
00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:29.920
<v Speaker 5>if you're an introvert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to learn to be an extrovert,</v>

999
00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:34.210
<v Speaker 5>you have to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Micro skill by micro skill,</v>

1000
00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no revolution,</v>

1001
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:41.580
<v Speaker 5>there's no revolutionary cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>transformation that's going to turn you </v>

1002
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:41.680
<v Speaker 5>into an extrovert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can pick up the skills,</v>

1003
00:54:41.681 --> 00:54:44.260
<v Speaker 5>but it's bit by bit and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>incremental.</v>

1004
00:54:44.261 --> 00:54:49.261
<v Speaker 5>And so I think it's the same with </v>
<v Speaker 5>political attitudes is you can develop </v>

1005
00:54:49.261 --> 00:54:52.891
<v Speaker 5>an appreciation for the viewpoint of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are on the other side of the </v>

1006
00:54:52.891 --> 00:54:54.190
<v Speaker 5>temperamental divide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a,</v>

1007
00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.430
<v Speaker 5>it's an increment by increment advance </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's very,</v>

1008
00:54:57.431 --> 00:54:59.560
<v Speaker 5>very effortful but necessary.</v>

1009
00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.020
<v Speaker 5>It's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1010
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:06.090
<v Speaker 5>it's been really useful to me to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the cognitive,</v>

1011
00:55:06.371 --> 00:55:11.371
<v Speaker 5>sociological,</v>
<v Speaker 5>political utility of both political </v>

1012
00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:12.840
<v Speaker 5>temperaments lights and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1013
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:15.070
<v Speaker 5>and why it's so crucially important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1014
00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:17.350
<v Speaker 5>with regards to disgust sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1015
00:55:17.351 --> 00:55:22.351
<v Speaker 5>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's pure reduct purely </v>

1016
00:55:22.351 --> 00:55:22.351
<v Speaker 5>reductionistic with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservative viewpoint.</v>

1017
00:55:22.351 --> 00:55:26.760
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people in history have died as </v>

1018
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.870
<v Speaker 5>a consequence of cross cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>contamination,</v>

1019
00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.060
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there are estimates that up to 90</v>

1020
00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:36.061
<v Speaker 5>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe even 95 percent of the native </v>

1021
00:55:36.061 --> 00:55:36.250
<v Speaker 5>Americans parish because of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>exposure to the Spaniards.</v>

1022
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:41.520
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the idea that contamination is a </v>

1023
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.560
<v Speaker 5>problem when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when two things that were distinct unite</v>

1024
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.990
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

1025
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:51.200
<v Speaker 5>is a truism and it's a powerful </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary force and equally powerful </v>

1026
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:51.820
<v Speaker 5>as the observation that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1027
00:55:51.821 --> 00:55:52.810
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>despite that,</v>

1028
00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:56.050
<v Speaker 5>despite that though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the benefit of information flow,</v>

1029
00:55:56.051 --> 00:56:01.051
<v Speaker 5>free information flow and trade is so </v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming that you can't throw the </v>

1030
00:56:01.051 --> 00:56:01.051
<v Speaker 5>baby out with the bathwater.</v>

1031
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.220
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the case where the,</v>

1032
00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:04.130
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1033
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:08.860
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary adaptive value of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1034
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:12.740
<v Speaker 4>of a motive or a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an emotion is explicable.</v>

1035
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:18.080
<v Speaker 4>And we can also recognize that thanks to</v>
<v Speaker 4>advances in science and technology,</v>

1036
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:22.640
<v Speaker 4>the emotions themselves are no longer </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly effective defenses against,</v>

1037
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this case infection by my pathogens.</v>

1038
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:28.390
<v Speaker 4>We have much better ways of protecting </v>
<v Speaker 4>ourselves,</v>

1039
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:32.170
<v Speaker 4>but we are stuck with these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 4>adaptations which are,</v>

1040
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:35.320
<v Speaker 4>are no longer quite so adaptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can be harmful,</v>

1041
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:40.690
<v Speaker 4>especially to treat other people on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>metaphor of contaminants are pathogens.</v>

1042
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 4>And you're certainly right that in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1043
00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:51.280
<v Speaker 4>in Hitler's rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 4>despite the fact that he is often a </v>

1044
00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:55.380
<v Speaker 4>claimed to have used eugenic ideas to </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivate a genocide against the Jews,</v>

1045
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.070
<v Speaker 4>much more of his language came from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1046
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.980
<v Speaker 4>from pathology and histology.</v>

1047
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's contempt.</v>

1048
00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.190
<v Speaker 5>And there was a parasite</v>

1049
00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:09.050
<v Speaker 4>parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1050
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:13.440
<v Speaker 4>Microbiology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not genetics that Hitler is</v>

1051
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.900
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I thought we might close by.</v>

1052
00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:23.110
<v Speaker 5>I have a question for you about your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your derivation of these moral virtues </v>

1053
00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:28.970
<v Speaker 5>specifically from the enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm curious about that because.</v>

1054
00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:30.440
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1055
00:57:30.441 --> 00:57:35.441
<v Speaker 5>you could make a case that it wasn't so </v>
<v Speaker 5>much the enlightenment as it was the </v>

1056
00:57:35.441 --> 00:57:36.350
<v Speaker 5>specifically the rise of empirical </v>
<v Speaker 5>science.</v>

1057
00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 5>And then you could of course have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion about how those two things </v>

1058
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:41.680
<v Speaker 5>are related,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm also curious.</v>

1059
00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:46.400
<v Speaker 5>I've been reading Ian mcgilchrist book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the master and his emissary and mcgill.</v>

1060
00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:51.580
<v Speaker 5>Chris makes a pretty strong case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that get the rationalistic </v>

1061
00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:56.051
<v Speaker 5>enlightenment values are in some sense a</v>
<v Speaker 5>consequence of the articulation of an </v>

1062
00:57:56.751 --> 00:58:01.130
<v Speaker 5>underlying set of principles that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>more metaphoric in nature,</v>

1063
00:58:01.131 --> 00:58:06.131
<v Speaker 5>more narrative in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The case I also made in my book maps of </v>

1064
00:58:06.131 --> 00:58:09.401
<v Speaker 5>meaning and to some degree in 12 rules </v>
<v Speaker 5>for life that the enlightenment project </v>

1065
00:58:09.401 --> 00:58:13.391
<v Speaker 5>and it's rationalities nested inside a </v>
<v Speaker 5>deeper web of metaphor and ritual and </v>

1066
00:58:13.391 --> 00:58:17.780
<v Speaker 5>image that would be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 5>longer scale cognitive processes,</v>

1067
00:58:17.781 --> 00:58:19.790
<v Speaker 5>some of which are expressed in religious</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>

1068
00:58:19.791 --> 00:58:24.791
<v Speaker 5>but some of which are grounded in not so</v>
<v Speaker 5>much rationality as in motivation and </v>

1069
00:58:24.791 --> 00:58:28.460
<v Speaker 5>emotion and the way your book is </v>
<v Speaker 5>structured.</v>

1070
00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:33.460
<v Speaker 5>And I think the way enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinkers think is that there was a </v>

1071
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.901
<v Speaker 5>miracle of sorts that occurred sometime </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the last three to 500 years and </v>

1072
00:58:37.901 --> 00:58:42.461
<v Speaker 5>people woke up and became rational.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the question is to what degree </v>

1073
00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:46.841
<v Speaker 5>was the ground for that awakening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Prepared by events that weren't the </v>

1074
00:58:46.841 --> 00:58:51.641
<v Speaker 5>awakening itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there were associated with other </v>

1075
00:58:51.641 --> 00:58:53.300
<v Speaker 5>processes and I'm just curious as to </v>
<v Speaker 5>what your thoughts are on that.</v>

1076
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:59.650
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing new under the sun and a </v>

1077
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:02.110
<v Speaker 4>good intellectual historian can find the</v>
<v Speaker 4>antecedents of any intellectual movement</v>

1078
00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.560
<v Speaker 4>in various precursors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1079
00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:05.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to.</v>

1080
00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:12.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's a lot in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment that can specifically be </v>

1081
00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:12.050
<v Speaker 4>attributed to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1082
00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:13.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a religion,</v>

1083
00:59:13.971 --> 00:59:18.971
<v Speaker 4>particularly Christianity just based on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that it was already around for </v>

1084
00:59:18.971 --> 00:59:19.220
<v Speaker 4>a thousand years and nothing much </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

1085
00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.790
<v Speaker 4>So it couldn't be religion or </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity itself.</v>

1086
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.440
<v Speaker 4>Although there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you say,</v>

1087
00:59:24.441 --> 00:59:27.950
<v Speaker 4>there are strands that were carried over</v>
<v Speaker 4>for in particular,</v>

1088
00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.760
<v Speaker 4>and this is an insight that I got from </v>
<v Speaker 4>my other half,</v>

1089
00:59:31.761 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 4>Rebecca Goldstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife,</v>

1090
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

1091
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.700
<v Speaker 4>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've appeared on stage with winter.</v>

1092
00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.470
<v Speaker 4>The one thing that the Greeks didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have that,</v>

1093
00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:44.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Christianity did was the idea of </v>

1094
00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.540
<v Speaker 4>compassion for the week and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and universal human flourishing.</v>

1095
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:51.430
<v Speaker 4>You don't really have that for all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the brilliance of a,</v>

1096
00:59:51.431 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 4>of ancient Greece.</v>

1097
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:54.760
<v Speaker 4>That wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big feat.</v>

1098
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.470
<v Speaker 4>But the enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

1099
00:59:57.471 --> 00:59:59.330
<v Speaker 4>did not spring out of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of nowhere,</v>

1100
00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:03.830
<v Speaker 4>if I were to identify the emphases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what your why,</v>

1101
01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:08.850
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened prior to the 18th century </v>

1102
01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:09.760
<v Speaker 4>that allowed her to fold them as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a couple of hundred years earlier,</v>

1103
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:14.770
<v Speaker 4>a couple of hundred years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of them was the scientific </v>

1104
01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 4>revolution of conventionally located in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1105
01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:20.210
<v Speaker 4>in the 17th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which not only provided a kind of a </v>

1106
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:23.890
<v Speaker 4>paradigm for understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>namely a testing propositions against </v>

1107
01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 4>the empirical world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeking deeper naturalistic explanations</v>

1108
01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:30.170
<v Speaker 4>for phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And which,</v>

1109
01:00:30.171 --> 01:00:35.171
<v Speaker 4>of course overturned a millennia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old dogmas reminding people that they're</v>

1110
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.460
<v Speaker 4>their own common sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own societies,</v>

1111
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:42.920
<v Speaker 4>convictions were fallible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was,</v>

1112
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an essential precursor.</v>

1113
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.140
<v Speaker 4>Another one was the discovery of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1114
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:51.380
<v Speaker 4>of the new world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there were entire civilizations,</v>

1115
01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:56.381
<v Speaker 4>entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally worlds in the sense that it </v>

1116
01:00:56.381 --> 01:01:00.431
<v Speaker 4>had been a unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the knowledge base that they had </v>

1117
01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:05.531
<v Speaker 4>been part of a Western civilization for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for Millennia was radical,</v>

1118
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:06.730
<v Speaker 4>incomplete.</v>

1119
01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.240
<v Speaker 4>And technologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suspect that the greater,</v>

1120
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exchange of ideas and people,</v>

1121
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a contributor of the prior to the,</v>

1122
01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.130
<v Speaker 4>just prior to the lightning in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>second half of the 18th century,</v>

1123
01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:24.330
<v Speaker 4>there's a massive growth in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>efficiency of a printing printing </v>

1124
01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:29.790
<v Speaker 4>presses itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was the democratization of books </v>

1125
01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:31.780
<v Speaker 4>and pamphlets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rise literacy,</v>

1126
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the movement of people.</v>

1127
01:01:33.921 --> 01:01:35.960
<v Speaker 4>It became easier for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1128
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.040
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for heretics and radicals to jump ship </v>

1129
01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:45.730
<v Speaker 4>and move to where things were cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if things got too uncomfortable where </v>

1130
01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:50.171
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's amazing how many of the </v>

1131
01:01:50.171 --> 01:01:50.171
<v Speaker 4>enlightenment thinkers were persecuted </v>
<v Speaker 4>for their beliefs,</v>

1132
01:01:50.171 --> 01:01:52.670
<v Speaker 4>who they were threatened with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imprisonment or death.</v>

1133
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Many of them ended up in Holland or </v>
<v Speaker 4>Paris or London,</v>

1134
01:01:56.241 --> 01:01:59.030
<v Speaker 4>or jumped around to wherever they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>made the greatest freedom,</v>

1135
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 4>but also just the sheer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a kind of precursor of the,</v>

1136
01:02:03.141 --> 01:02:04.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the web today.</v>

1137
01:02:04.341 --> 01:02:09.341
<v Speaker 4>The fact that pamphlet can be introduced</v>
<v Speaker 4>and within a few months and it will be </v>

1138
01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:13.480
<v Speaker 4>translated into a dozen European </v>
<v Speaker 4>languages and,</v>

1139
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.510
<v Speaker 4>and smuggled in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the exchange of ideas,</v>

1140
01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:22.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it helped to accelerate the </v>

1141
01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:27.140
<v Speaker 4>route,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although since it only happened once in </v>

1142
01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.410
<v Speaker 4>human history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can never really know for sure why it</v>

1143
01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.370
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it did.</v>

1144
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.750
<v Speaker 4>But those are three good hypo.</v>

1145
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:32.300
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1146
01:02:32.301 --> 01:02:37.301
<v Speaker 5>and we're in an interesting time now </v>
<v Speaker 5>where we can sit and make a video like </v>

1147
01:02:37.301 --> 01:02:40.781
<v Speaker 5>this and publish it almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>instantaneously and share it with half a</v>

1148
01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.830
<v Speaker 5>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that,</v>

1149
01:02:42.831 --> 01:02:47.831
<v Speaker 5>that ability to share ideas rapidly as </v>
<v Speaker 5>developing a pace and God only knows </v>

1150
01:02:48.201 --> 01:02:49.840
<v Speaker 5>what the consequence of that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're,</v>

1151
01:02:49.841 --> 01:02:53.720
<v Speaker 5>we're in a situation now which has only </v>
<v Speaker 5>occurred to me about last year where the</v>

1152
01:02:53.721 --> 01:02:58.721
<v Speaker 5>spoken word for the first time in human </v>
<v Speaker 5>history has the same breach and </v>

1153
01:02:58.721 --> 01:03:00.800
<v Speaker 5>longevity as the written word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's easier for people to listen.</v>

1154
01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.050
<v Speaker 5>No audio books are becoming very </v>
<v Speaker 5>popular.</v>

1155
01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.690
<v Speaker 5>Lots and lots of people listen to </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcasts.</v>

1156
01:03:05.691 --> 01:03:10.691
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have working class people come to my </v>

1157
01:03:10.691 --> 01:03:10.691
<v Speaker 5>talks all the time and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1158
01:03:10.691 --> 01:03:14.591
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting in my forklift for three </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours a day and I'm doing nothing but </v>

1159
01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:14.840
<v Speaker 5>listening to podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1160
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:17.870
<v Speaker 5>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a really remarkable thing.</v>

1161
01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.780
<v Speaker 5>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm going to let you go.</v>

1162
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.580
<v Speaker 5>You've been very generous with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1163
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:28.630
<v Speaker 5>I appreciate the conversation very much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to close by showing your book </v>

1164
01:03:29.601 --> 01:03:31.070
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steven Pinker's,</v>

1165
01:03:31.071 --> 01:03:36.071
<v Speaker 5>new book and lightened now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is tearing up the bestseller </v>

1166
01:03:36.071 --> 01:03:39.100
<v Speaker 5>charts and which is a guide to proper </v>
<v Speaker 5>end intelligent optimism in the 21st </v>

1167
01:03:39.681 --> 01:03:42.230
<v Speaker 5>century.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And maybe I'd ask you just in closing,</v>

1168
01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.560
<v Speaker 5>what do you think there are things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals,</v>

1169
01:03:45.561 --> 01:03:50.561
<v Speaker 5>what do you think individuals should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly optimistic about right now </v>

1170
01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:53.861
<v Speaker 5>and what do you think individuals could </v>
<v Speaker 5>do to spread the message that things are</v>

1171
01:03:55.071 --> 01:03:57.350
<v Speaker 5>getting better and that we can solve our</v>
<v Speaker 5>problems?</v>

1172
01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:05.130
<v Speaker 4>The fact that there are new efforts to </v>
<v Speaker 4>try transcend political divisions and </v>

1173
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:11.240
<v Speaker 4>find out what works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tend to politicize and rationalize a </v>

1174
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.180
<v Speaker 4>problems like poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like climate change,</v>

1175
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.600
<v Speaker 4>a light like war and peace like crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are very much worth supporting </v>

1176
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:27.650
<v Speaker 4>organizations like at a political.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are ngos that try to monitor the </v>

1177
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.060
<v Speaker 4>state of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's effective altruism.</v>

1178
01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:38.250
<v Speaker 4>There's just the general application of </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationality to solve our problems that </v>

1179
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:41.220
<v Speaker 4>is responsible for the progress that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've enjoyed in the past and if there's</v>

1180
01:04:41.221 --> 01:04:46.221
<v Speaker 4>going to be progress ahead of us will be</v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible for what will enjoy in the </v>

1181
01:04:46.221 --> 01:04:46.221
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

1182
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:47.860
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I'm,</v>

1183
01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:52.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm would like to close to by mentioning</v>

1184
01:04:52.091 --> 01:04:54.730
<v Speaker 5>to everyone who's listening that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1185
01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:59.820
<v Speaker 5>things are getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're getting better because people </v>

1186
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.370
<v Speaker 5>are facing problems and actually trying </v>
<v Speaker 5>to solve them.</v>

1187
01:05:00.371 --> 01:05:02.830
<v Speaker 5>They're doing micro analysis of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>problems,</v>

1188
01:05:02.831 --> 01:05:04.990
<v Speaker 5>breaking them down into their </v>
<v Speaker 5>constituent elements,</v>

1189
01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:10.620
<v Speaker 5>being humbled enough to use incremental </v>
<v Speaker 5>solutions to solve them and to address </v>

1190
01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.400
<v Speaker 5>them at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>

1191
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.640
<v Speaker 5>at a high level of resolution instead of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a low level of or a low resolution level</v>

1192
01:05:15.641 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 5>of ideological debate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's really working.</v>

1193
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.930
<v Speaker 5>And I would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1194
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:25.680
<v Speaker 5>what would we say encourage people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>pick up Dr Baker's book because the </v>

1195
01:05:25.691 --> 01:05:30.691
<v Speaker 5>world is getting better and we should </v>
<v Speaker 5>know it and we should be happy about it </v>

1196
01:05:30.691 --> 01:05:32.410
<v Speaker 5>and we should continue to foster that </v>
<v Speaker 5>development in every way that we can.</v>

1197
01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:36.740
<v Speaker 5>And I think this is an excellent book as</v>
<v Speaker 5>an excellent contribution to that effort</v>

1198
01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:40.410
<v Speaker 5>as well as your other books like are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are better,</v>

1199
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Speaker 5>better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>better,</v>

1200
01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:47.310
<v Speaker 5>better angels of our nature.</v>
