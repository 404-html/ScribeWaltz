00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.523
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should really be editing my book </v>

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:05.390
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3
00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:06.224
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd take a bit of time to </v>

4
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:08.664
<v Speaker 1>respond to something that happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the media today in the aftermath of </v>

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>James Demaurice Google memo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the coverage it's received.</v>

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.103
<v Speaker 1>A journalist named Steve Kovak wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story for business insider called </v>

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley's liberal bubble has </v>
<v Speaker 1>burst and the culture war has arrived in</v>

8
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>that article which discussed the memo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He characterized myself and,</v>

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stefan Molyneux a well known youtube </v>

10
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:36.774
<v Speaker 1>personality as far right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is article said specifically was </v>

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I quote Youtube,</v>

12
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.034
<v Speaker 1>which is ironically owned by Google and </v>
<v Speaker 1>has become a hotspot for right wing v </v>

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Loggers was they would let of choice for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Demora himself.</v>

14
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.473
<v Speaker 1>His first public interviews were to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stefan Molyneux and Jordan b Peterson </v>

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>far right figures who have built up </v>
<v Speaker 1>large followings on the video site.</v>

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>And I felt that that was inappropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say to say the least.</v>

17
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.383
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I tweeted that and emailed him </v>

18
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:09.684
<v Speaker 1>and said that that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mischaracterization and asked him to </v>

19
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.404
<v Speaker 1>justify his claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm going to do is to read </v>

20
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:18.920
<v Speaker 1>our email exchange to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

21
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can draw your own conclusions </v>

22
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:21.864
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

23
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>the first email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my email,</v>

24
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear Mr Kovach,</v>

25
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you called me a far right figure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>press.</v>

26
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't have one iota of proof for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that statement.</v>

27
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>And it is patently untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been lecturing,</v>

28
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:39.714
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the dangers of national socialist </v>

29
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.413
<v Speaker 1>ideology for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find a single thing I've said that </v>

30
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:45.714
<v Speaker 1>places me on the far right in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absence of a smoking pistol is that </v>

31
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>grounds for a lawsuit for defamation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

32
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Inquiring minds want to know if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk,</v>

33
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm open to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should watch your words.</v>

34
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm seriously unhappy about you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>careless and false characterization.</v>

35
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

36
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>and see if it's far right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I link to a youtube video of a lecture I</v>

37
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>gave on the temperamental basis of right</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing belief.</v>

38
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.113
<v Speaker 1>And so then Steve responded and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you prefer to be </v>

39
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 1>characterized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he said,</v>

40
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.423
<v Speaker 1>just saw your tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please let me know what you would </v>

41
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>prefer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said I would prefer the truth.</v>

42
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.253
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer that journalists such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself use absolute precision of </v>

43
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:34.734
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not up to me to tell you what that </v>

44
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:37.344
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you given your choice of </v>

45
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is no laughing matter,</v>

46
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Mr Kovach as you seem to imply with </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

47
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.233
<v Speaker 1>please let me know what you prefer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been fighting an intellectual </v>

48
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>war against radicals on the right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>left for three decades.</v>

49
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.213
<v Speaker 1>I've been very clear and public track </v>
<v Speaker 1>record with regards to my attitude to </v>

50
00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>the far right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time and for example,</v>

51
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:00.694
<v Speaker 1>in my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning outlining the </v>

52
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology of national socialists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it made my opposition to such things</v>

53
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>known in a manner both public and widely</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>

54
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.493
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I'm equally unhappy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gulag type leftists generally </v>

55
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>ignored by the modern postmodernists </v>
<v Speaker 1>does not make me far right.</v>

56
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.793
<v Speaker 1>I'm seriously unhappy about being </v>
<v Speaker 1>carelessly lumped in with people I </v>

57
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>despise and have spent my life fighting.</v>

58
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>He wrote back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for your response.</v>

59
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>So the article is truthful and accurate.</v>

60
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>How would you like to be characterized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

61
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.873
<v Speaker 1>I said very clearly you mischaracterized</v>
<v Speaker 1>me as far right on what grounds </v>

62
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever can you make that claim and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having made it,</v>

63
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.973
<v Speaker 1>it is your responsibility to either </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify the characterization with some </v>

64
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>investigation or to withdraw it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologize politically.</v>

65
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm a classic British liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Temperamentally.</v>

66
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm high in openness which tells me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

67
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>although I am also conscientious which </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells me to the right.</v>

68
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Philosophically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an individualist collectivist,</v>

69
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>have the right or the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysically.</v>

70
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:09.994
<v Speaker 1>I'm an American pragmatist who has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly influenced by the </v>

71
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.553
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic and clinical thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud young and the psycho therapists </v>

72
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:18.304
<v Speaker 1>who have followed in their wake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is simply nothing I've said or </v>

73
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>done that makes me far right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>

74
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.533
<v Speaker 1>I've warned thousands of students over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course of three decades that the </v>

75
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:28.954
<v Speaker 1>spirit of Auschwitz concentration camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>guards dwells in their heart and that </v>

76
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>they should do everything in their power</v>
<v Speaker 1>to recognize it's existence and overcome</v>

77
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:37.684
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single lecture of my maps of </v>

78
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:40.414
<v Speaker 1>meaning course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>various versions which have now been </v>

79
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 1>watched or listened to by millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

80
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.903
<v Speaker 1>make some variant of that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also produced a series of </v>

81
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:50.014
<v Speaker 1>individual self development programs now</v>
<v Speaker 1>used by thousands of people to </v>

82
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.854
<v Speaker 1>strengthen themselves as individuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine their proper and honorable </v>

83
00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>destinies and live productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful lives.</v>

84
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.173
<v Speaker 1>You didn't do your homework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cast a serious dispersion on my </v>

85
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't deserve it in the least.</v>

86
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do something about it.</v>

87
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.280
<v Speaker 1>He responds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for the clarification,</v>

88
00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:14.114
<v Speaker 1>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will correct the story and identify </v>

89
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you as a classic British liberal.</v>

90
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I responded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this one before.</v>

91
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I received his response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I sent it after so I'm keeping it in</v>

92
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:26.974
<v Speaker 1>the order that it actually emerged </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than in the order that it makes </v>

93
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 1>precise sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dear Mr. Colback,</v>

94
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>do you really think that if I were far </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

95
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.593
<v Speaker 1>I could have placed 200 university </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures online and taught for three </v>

96
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:41.584
<v Speaker 1>decades at Harvard and at the University</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto without someone making a </v>

97
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 1>devastating case for my ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perversity?</v>

98
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>In what universe could that possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>occur?</v>

99
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm a university professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologists,</v>

100
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:55.204
<v Speaker 1>and a public intellectual whose primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal is the psychological and </v>

101
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical strength and fortification </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the individual.</v>

102
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I was still trying to clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.933
<v Speaker 1>how I would like to be referred to </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally nothing about that as far </v>

104
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:08.294
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even care though that you've </v>

105
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>called me that name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last year,</v>

106
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:14.010
<v Speaker 1>I've been called names by people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have made that kind of behavior,</v>

107
00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 1>a well-practiced part of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional specialty.</v>

108
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>What I care about is the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name is wrong,</v>

109
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.383
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're engaged in a very important </v>

110
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 1>public debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handled incorrectly.</v>

111
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 1>That debate will degenerate into </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

112
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>When you make an error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willful or otherwise,</v>

113
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you increase the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

114
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling your attention to such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>

115
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.773
<v Speaker 1>To put it bluntly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are contributing to the dangerous </v>

116
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>political polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly typifying public discourse.</v>

117
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.003
<v Speaker 1>By vilifying my views and my character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it appears that you have done so either </v>

118
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>carelessly or to add some narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch to your story.</v>

119
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.833
<v Speaker 1>Neither of these reasons are in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>least justifiable post our email </v>

120
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:55.574
<v Speaker 1>dialogue publicly if you'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the readers sorted out for </v>

121
00:06:58.221 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to stick to your guns,</v>

122
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.670
<v Speaker 1>and then I thought and replied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

123
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 1>All Post the dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Screenshots to twitter,</v>

124
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 1>which I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Kovak responded,</v>

125
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>thanks for your help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story has been corrected and without</v>

126
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

127
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.903
<v Speaker 1>Kovak went online and changed his </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of both Stefan Molyneux and </v>

128
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I had mentioned previously,</v>

129
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.730
<v Speaker 1>far right to the current description,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is right leaning,</v>

130
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Stefan Molyneux and classic British </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal Jordan b Peterson,</v>

131
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.613
<v Speaker 1>which I might point out is quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial departure from the initial </v>

132
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.783
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

133
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>You might think I'd be pleased about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>change and I suppose it's better the way</v>

134
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 1>it is then the way it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not pleased at all with the fact</v>

135
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 1>that it happened or really with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was changed so easily.</v>

136
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not a straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

137
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of no import to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mischaracterize someone as far right,</v>

138
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.383
<v Speaker 1>especially in today's political climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's indicative of what I would </v>

139
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:08.710
<v Speaker 1>describe as loose journalistic ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.673
<v Speaker 1>to put it mildly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To then be so willing to transform your </v>

141
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:18.120
<v Speaker 1>terminology with no explanation to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>reader and no apparent.</v>

142
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.103
<v Speaker 1>Let's call it crisis of conscience or</v>
<v Speaker 1>or serious consideration of the meaning </v>

143
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:26.870
<v Speaker 1>of your options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it that way</v>

145
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys can,</v>

146
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:34.543
<v Speaker 1>apart from that commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I couldn't stop myself from </v>

147
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:38.054
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys can draw your own conclusions </v>

148
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>and then one last thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure what to make of the</v>

149
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>alt right and</v>

150
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.083
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

151
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>and then one last thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure</v>

152
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:56.883
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

153
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.823
<v Speaker 1>and then one last thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how to understand the old </v>

154
00:09:03.281 --> 00:09:07.540
<v Speaker 1>right or to characterize it or even to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to think about.</v>

155
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.580
<v Speaker 1>It's hypothetical existence or my </v>
<v Speaker 1>association with it,</v>

156
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:13.923
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you that I'm not in favor</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people banding together in </v>

157
00:09:17.271 --> 00:09:18.104
<v Speaker 1>ideological groups and instead would </v>
<v Speaker 1>much rather see people live </v>

158
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.233
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally productive and meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and honest individual lives and in that </v>

159
00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:32.590
<v Speaker 1>manner be a light unto their neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

160
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 1>to show the way to live in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>without undue ideological possession and</v>

161
00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:41.950
<v Speaker 1>to move forward things productively in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that manner.</v>

162
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.873
<v Speaker 1>I don't know of any pathway forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this increasingly polarized </v>

163
00:09:47.201 --> 00:09:48.034
<v Speaker 1>political landscape that we find </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in that isn't absolutely rife </v>

164
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:55.480
<v Speaker 1>with the possibility of conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I haven't made that clear so far,</v>

165
00:09:55.481 --> 00:09:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly like to make it clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

166
00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.553
<v Speaker 1>So I would encourage those of you who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are considering yourself say on the old </v>

167
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.260
<v Speaker 1>right for that matter as well as on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left too,</v>

168
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.993
<v Speaker 1>transcend your</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous and impersonal ideological </v>

169
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:18.880
<v Speaker 1>identification and start to live is true</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals in the world.</v>

170
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think and I hope that I've</v>

171
00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:24.340
<v Speaker 1>been communicating that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I haven't,</v>

172
00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:27.250
<v Speaker 1>well I apologize because that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to do.</v>
