00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.193
<v Speaker 1>Earlier today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conrad Black wrote an article in </v>

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Canada's National Post and the article </v>
<v Speaker 1>was called Jordan Peterson speaks,</v>

3
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>for those of us who refused to follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>the great liberal deathwish.</v>

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.983
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who don't know who </v>

5
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:20.964
<v Speaker 1>conrad black is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll read you a little bit from his </v>

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conrad Moffat.</v>

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Black Baron black of cross harbor was </v>
<v Speaker 1>born on the 25th of August,</v>

8
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>1944.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a Canadian born British,</v>

9
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.590
<v Speaker 1>former newspaper publisher and author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a non affiliated life peer,</v>

10
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.423
<v Speaker 1>black controlled Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your international once the world's </v>

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>third largest English language newspaper</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empire,</v>

12
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>which published the Daily Telegraph in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK,</v>

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.723
<v Speaker 1>the Chicago Sun Times in the US and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem Post Israel as well as in the </v>

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.473
<v Speaker 1>National Post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newspaper that he published this </v>

15
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>article in in Canada and hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>community newspapers in North America.</v>

16
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to start this by thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>lord black for his support.</v>

17
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>But I would also like to point out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite his supportive stance,</v>

18
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are things that are important that</v>

19
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get right.</v>

20
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's reasonable to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's attention to them.</v>

21
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.594
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I'm going to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just read what he wrote and then I'm </v>

22
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:24.984
<v Speaker 1>going to comment on it a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to do so in a manner that </v>

23
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.323
<v Speaker 1>I hope does indicate that I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate his support and I'm not </v>

24
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>trying to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.413
<v Speaker 1>pr frivolously critical in any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I want to read a response that </v>

26
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.263
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer has prepared as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so that you understand all of you </v>

27
00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>who are listening understand this a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more clearly.</v>

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.583
<v Speaker 1>Conrad Black Rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have just endured the sobering </v>

29
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>experience of watching the always very </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and professional Steve Pakan</v>

30
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.353
<v Speaker 1>chair a panel about the transgender </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy that centers on University </v>

31
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Dr Jordan Peterson.</v>

32
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>That was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an appearance on TV,</v>

33
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>was the agenda with Steve Pakan a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weeks ago where the Pronoun issue was</v>

34
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.573
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>

35
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.453
<v Speaker 1>Lack states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had vaguely followed the story as it </v>

36
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:16.074
<v Speaker 1>percolated up in the press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the fraud things in which must </v>

37
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.303
<v Speaker 1>usually be taken lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was I fear a piercing glimpse into </v>

38
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>what great and venerable statesmen of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>youth,</v>

39
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>such as Winston Churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dwight Eisenhower,</v>

40
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Harry Truman and Louis St Laurent called</v>
<v Speaker 1>days that I shall not see.</v>

41
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.803
<v Speaker 1>I did not until now grasp the fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance between gratitude and </v>

42
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>wistfulness in their invocation of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase,</v>

43
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>as a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought at the license of the great to</v>

44
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:42.474
<v Speaker 1>engage in Histrionics and I now claim it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the right of lesser yet aging people </v>

45
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:46.524
<v Speaker 1>such as myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black states for those who have sagely </v>

46
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>duct or otherwise being spared exposure </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this controversy.</v>

47
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.653
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson rejects the right of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>students to require him to address them </v>

48
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.493
<v Speaker 1>if they are trans people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat in some state of flux between the </v>

49
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>male and female polls of gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification,</v>

50
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>not their orientation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they are homosexual,</v>

51
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bisexual,</v>

52
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>or asexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with it.</v>

53
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.863
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise then in a way that concerns </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to the cluster confines of being </v>

54
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>male or female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

55
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.473
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that's </v>

56
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>interesting about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Mr. blocks</v>

57
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.563
<v Speaker 2>call them.</v>

58
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.970
<v Speaker 1>He obviously considers this issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient importance to address it,</v>

59
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>but there's an that he can't eliminate </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely from his mind the supposition</v>

60
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.160
<v Speaker 1>that this is absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is observed in many ways,</v>

61
00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>but here's the mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because something is absurd,</v>

62
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.153
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean it was trivial and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think this is where Mr Black makes an </v>

63
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:46.430
<v Speaker 1>error in his column.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

64
00:03:46.431 --> 00:03:47.264
<v Speaker 1>it's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he says that people have </v>

65
00:03:49.971 --> 00:03:50.804
<v Speaker 1>sagely ducted or otherwise being spared </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure to it because it's been a </v>

66
00:03:53.871 --> 00:03:57.560
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous controversy and I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no question about that.</v>

67
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It's surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found the whole thing was surreal,</v>

68
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.233
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the 19 thirties when the Nazis </v>

69
00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:05.540
<v Speaker 1>first made their appearance on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>

70
00:04:05.541 --> 00:04:06.374
<v Speaker 1>everyone thought they were observed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and concluded that that meant that </v>

71
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.920
<v Speaker 1>they were trivial and they were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial despite their absurdity,</v>

72
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.380
<v Speaker 1>and this is not trivial despite its </v>
<v Speaker 1>absurdity.</v>

73
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.243
<v Speaker 1>In fact its absurdity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in some sense points precisely </v>

74
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:24.011
<v Speaker 1>to the fact that it is anything but </v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial because something that is on the</v>

75
00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:29.600
<v Speaker 1>surface of it so absurd is being made so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much is being made of it.</v>

76
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>It's been classified if refuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll use pronouns,</v>

77
00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:33.404
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is being classified as a hate crime </v>

78
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.440
<v Speaker 1>that's not trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it is observed</v>

79
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.243
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

80
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.413
<v Speaker 1>z for he and or she and Zack are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place of his or him are the sticking </v>

81
00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:46.094
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is accumulating behind these </v>

82
00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:49.910
<v Speaker 1>imbecilic distinctions is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>sinister.</v>

83
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.943
<v Speaker 1>The tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Pake and ran up Dr Peterson being </v>

84
00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:56.480
<v Speaker 1>reviled and shouted down and physically </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimidated at the University of Toronto</v>

85
00:04:56.481 --> 00:04:57.314
<v Speaker 1>was distressing and we may be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>edge of a defining moment in our jolie </v>

86
00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:01.214
<v Speaker 1>and progressive Canadian civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson sees it as a matter of </v>

87
00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:04.544
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression and believes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>others do not have the authority to </v>

88
00:05:07.311 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 1>require him to address them in a newly </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatched vocabulary devise to oppress the</v>

89
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.793
<v Speaker 1>gender binary conventional practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While his opponents profess to believe </v>

90
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.670
<v Speaker 1>that in refusing to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is committing a hate crime punishable</v>

91
00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:21.710
<v Speaker 1>by human rights commissions or </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribunals.</v>

92
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.650
<v Speaker 1>These hurry headed monsters and black is</v>
<v Speaker 1>referring to the human rights tribunals,</v>

93
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.693
<v Speaker 1>who's agregious tryst trespasses on </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression in the name of </v>

94
00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:31.760
<v Speaker 1>despotic.</v>

95
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Political correctness has been heroic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't successfully contested by my</v>

96
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:36.524
<v Speaker 1>friends Mark Stein and as relevant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>others does not prescribe imprisonment </v>

97
00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:43.460
<v Speaker 1>under the articles invoked by Dr. </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson says assailant,</v>

98
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.510
<v Speaker 1>but if fine is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

99
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:46.344
<v Speaker 1>and we might also point out that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very large fine that is possible in New </v>

100
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.930
<v Speaker 1>York state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

101
00:05:50.931 --> 00:05:51.764
<v Speaker 1>failure to use the requisite pronouns </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings with it a maximum fine of </v>

102
00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:59.261
<v Speaker 1>$250,000 in case Conrad goes on to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if to assure the least possibility of</v>

103
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.564
<v Speaker 1>a quiet end to this preposterous issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson has declared that he will </v>

104
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:06.284
<v Speaker 1>not pay a fine and if in prison for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying it would embark on a hunger </v>

105
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

106
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.860
<v Speaker 1>this is another place where black </v>
<v Speaker 1>confuses absurdity with triviality.</v>

107
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.824
<v Speaker 1>He believes that my response to this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>an overreaction and that's part of my </v>

108
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.930
<v Speaker 1>refusal to bring this preposterous issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a quiet end.</v>

109
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.690
<v Speaker 1>He's suggesting that I'm exaggerating </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that as a consequence,</v>

110
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:34.634
<v Speaker 1>he's implying that I'm at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for blowing up something </v>

111
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.273
<v Speaker 1>that's merely observed into something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm blowing up the importance of </v>

112
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>something that's merely observed</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

113
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:47.301
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

114
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:48.134
<v Speaker 1>my sympathies are with Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an unjustified hypothetical </v>

115
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:51.254
<v Speaker 1>escalation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remember that he says this is an </v>

116
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>unjustified hypothetical escalation if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it came to that,</v>

117
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.343
<v Speaker 1>the authorities would attach his bank </v>
<v Speaker 1>account or his income in to collect the </v>

118
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.224
<v Speaker 1>fine and Batman or rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>imprisoning him and provoking a hunger </v>

119
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

120
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see about that.</v>

121
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:06.014
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that I want to tell </v>

122
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listeners is,</v>

123
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.363
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the powers of the social justice </v>

124
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:12.554
<v Speaker 1>tribunals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pulled this from their own statement </v>

125
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 1>about their power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is one point six.</v>

126
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>This is section one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point six,</v>

127
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 1>powers of the social justice tribunals </v>
<v Speaker 1>in irrelevant,</v>

128
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.133
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario legislative document one point </v>

129
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:26.864
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>

130
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>You have to listen to this very </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully.</v>

131
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 1>The tribunal will determine how a matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be dealt with.</v>

132
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.033
<v Speaker 1>That's a matter brought before them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a matter of discrimination or </v>

133
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:36.554
<v Speaker 1>harassment defined by their policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their appalling policies and may use </v>

134
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 1>procedures other than traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjudicative or adversarial procedures.</v>

135
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to repeat that.</v>

136
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.273
<v Speaker 1>The tribunal will determine how a matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be dealt with and may use </v>

137
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>procedures other than traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjudicative or adversarial procedures.</v>

138
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one point.</v>

139
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point seven.</v>

140
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 1>In order to provide for the fair just </v>
<v Speaker 1>and expeditious resolution of any matter</v>

141
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:07.040
<v Speaker 1>before it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tribunal may a limit the evidence or</v>

142
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:07.874
<v Speaker 1>submissions on any issue so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider that for a while and I'm going </v>

143
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>to skip to w take any other action that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tribunal determines is appropriate.</v>

144
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got that they've actually written</v>

145
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:21.224
<v Speaker 1>a clause into the policy documents that </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe their powers that states that </v>

146
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>they can take any other action they </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine as appropriate.</v>

147
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Well then I would say that's gone beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd.</v>

148
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I would say that's still observed,</v>

149
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:35.324
<v Speaker 1>but it's by no means trivial and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that this is extraordinarily </v>

150
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:39.344
<v Speaker 1>dangerous legislation is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas dark Mr Block's insistence that </v>

151
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:44.354
<v Speaker 1>I'm exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seriousness of the situation is </v>

152
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.810
<v Speaker 1>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's three point one,</v>

153
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:50.663
<v Speaker 1>three from the same document where a </v>
<v Speaker 1>party has been notified of a fair </v>

154
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.493
<v Speaker 1>hearing and fails to attend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tribunal may take any other action it </v>

155
00:08:58.831 --> 00:08:59.664
<v Speaker 1>considers appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a duplication of the previous </v>

156
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking with,</v>

157
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the human rights tribunal takes to</v>

158
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>itself the power to do whatever it wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

159
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some other things to consider.</v>

160
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.083
<v Speaker 1>Notice that these tribunals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the Ontario human rights </v>

161
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 1>tribunals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's eight different tribunals.</v>

162
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 1>They're called social justice tribunals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

163
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 1>that's not an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider what that means.</v>

164
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.883
<v Speaker 1>The term social justice is a code for </v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness and equity </v>

165
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:30.660
<v Speaker 1>oriented political philosophy.</v>

166
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.703
<v Speaker 1>People know that this is why the radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>left activists are parodied as social </v>

167
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:36.414
<v Speaker 1>justice warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the social justice tribunals </v>

168
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:39.894
<v Speaker 1>operating in Ontario or quasi judicial </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiations of the politically </v>

169
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:43.704
<v Speaker 1>correct authoritarian creed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're designed by their designers </v>

170
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>to operate outside of the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters of the law.</v>

171
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 1>This is why they attribute to themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>the powers to use quote procedures other</v>

172
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>than traditional adjudicative or </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversarial procedures.</v>

173
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.443
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that the standard British </v>

174
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:00.174
<v Speaker 1>common law approach to the issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought before the tribunal can be </v>

175
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:03.300
<v Speaker 1>suspended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

176
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>why would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.293
<v Speaker 1>it's rooted in politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underlying politically correct </v>

178
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Marxist and postmodernist philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can consider it this way.</v>

179
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 1>If the fundamental presupposition is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

180
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.653
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

181
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.513
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Canadian civilization as well as </v>

182
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Western civilization in general is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt patriarchy.</v>

183
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.703
<v Speaker 1>Then what's the problem with suspending </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rules of procedure when you're </v>

184
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:29.394
<v Speaker 1>pursuing a justice the tire than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's a represented inside </v>

185
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:33.474
<v Speaker 1>that tradition?</v>

186
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what they've written into</v>

187
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:36.294
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the laws attributing to themselves </v>

188
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:39.744
<v Speaker 1>power so you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think for yourself and decide </v>

189
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 1>just exactly how dangerous that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

190
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.433
<v Speaker 1>back to black Dr Peterson's approach is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so inflexible and so entirely righteous </v>

191
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.450
<v Speaker 1>without much using the powerful weapon </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ridicule that is available to him.</v>

192
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 1>He may not have tracked the full range </v>
<v Speaker 1>of support.</v>

193
00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:00.774
<v Speaker 1>The virtue of his arguments and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal courage deserve so funny </v>

194
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:03.894
<v Speaker 1>sentence because I can't tell exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terminology that my approach is so </v>

195
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>inflexible that I may not attract the </v>
<v Speaker 1>full range of support.</v>

196
00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 1>The virtue of my arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my personal courage deserve.</v>

197
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.913
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think that I'm being </v>

198
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:18.834
<v Speaker 1>reflected in flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm merely refusing to use the language </v>

199
00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:28.320
<v Speaker 1>that's made up by politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical left wing authoritarians.</v>

200
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's not inflexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reasonable.</v>

201
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Why would I use that language?</v>

202
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.353
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with the philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the principles upon which it's </v>

203
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>predicated are not only factually </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrect,</v>

204
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.833
<v Speaker 1>scientifically incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but malevolently motivated and </v>

205
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:46.110
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make me inflexible,</v>

206
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.953
<v Speaker 1>and so the terminology there is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me committed to not using that </v>

207
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:57.250
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the substance of the issue.</v>

208
00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Lack continues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is of course correct.</v>

209
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 1>We must always be wary of the majority </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darien tyranny,</v>

210
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>which has preoccupied mini civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarians,</v>

211
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 1>including the principal authors of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution of the United States,</v>

212
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 1>especially James Madison and Alexander </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hamilton,</v>

213
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.593
<v Speaker 1>who agreed on little else about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender community is less than one </v>

214
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:14.614
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've written many times in many </v>

215
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 1>contexts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over many tiers rights do not exist only</v>

216
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:21.844
<v Speaker 1>for the numerous and a litmus test of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimacy of a society is it's </v>

217
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>observance of the rights of minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including especially minorities.</v>

218
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:28.444
<v Speaker 1>Have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The jurisprudence of all great </v>

219
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 1>democratic nations is replete with </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous cases to this effect.</v>

220
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Captain Dreyfus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Samuel Mudd,</v>

221
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 1>who was prosecuted for treating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassin of Abraham Lincoln.</v>

222
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.663
<v Speaker 1>Though there was no evidence that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in the plot and even the </v>

223
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 1>British Archer Shia fair made famous in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the drama,</v>

224
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:45.783
<v Speaker 1>the winslow boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Peterson affairs threatening to </v>

225
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:48.754
<v Speaker 1>cross the double white line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All people must be treated with respect </v>

226
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 1>equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are only two genders to sexist</v>

227
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.880
<v Speaker 1>are species and all other mammals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender binary.</v>

228
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 1>While I would like to point out to Mr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Block that that's now illegal under bill</v>

229
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.273
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and its associated sister </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation and that might be observed </v>

230
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not trivial idiocy written into</v>

231
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 1>the law unfolds into the idiocy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement and obedience and that's not</v>

232
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:19.720
<v Speaker 1>trivial and as we will soon find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot continues.</v>

233
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.613
<v Speaker 1>All people may state their sex and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is contrary to physical </v>

234
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:24.670
<v Speaker 1>appearances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that remains the right,</v>

235
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:25.893
<v Speaker 1>but no individual or group has the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>to invent a new vocabulary and a new </v>

236
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.983
<v Speaker 1>cool co equal gender because of a state </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ambivalence or confusion about which </v>

237
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:34.174
<v Speaker 1>sex they are.</v>

238
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Black,</v>

239
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 1>they do have that right and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely what bill see.</v>

240
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 1>16 instantiates and it's already written</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the human rights codes,</v>

241
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 1>human rights codes of the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian provinces.</v>

242
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.840
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

243
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 1>it's also an act of hate speech to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispute it.</v>

244
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.030
<v Speaker 1>So individuals and groups have precisely</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to invent new vocabularies and</v>

245
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.040
<v Speaker 1>not one but many co equal genders up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>70 in New York state for example,</v>

246
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 1>black continues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every legally competent individual has a</v>

247
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:06.550
<v Speaker 1>perfect and absolute right to declare </v>
<v Speaker 1>their sex,</v>

248
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.893
<v Speaker 1>but not to create a new legal status and</v>
<v Speaker 1>legally require the use of a new </v>

249
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:11.104
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary for those influx between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only two sexes we have mercilessly </v>

250
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:19.381
<v Speaker 1>binary throw their finite number may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>well the same argument applies there.</v>

251
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.553
<v Speaker 1>They do have the right to create a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal status or many new legal statuses </v>

252
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.623
<v Speaker 1>and to legally require the use of a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary that's already written into </v>

253
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 1>the law that they have that right.</v>

254
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.120
<v Speaker 1>And I would say as well that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Conrad blocks comments on that are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>now illegal.</v>

256
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.263
<v Speaker 1>The individuals in that condition may </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the registered sex each day if </v>

257
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:40.504
<v Speaker 1>they wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not treat anyone who declines to </v>

258
00:14:41.921 --> 00:14:43.990
<v Speaker 1>address them in terms that debunked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>

259
00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Binary world has guilty of a hate crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishable by imposable fines.</v>

260
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.380
<v Speaker 1>How about six months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a column in this space about the</v>

261
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:52.214
<v Speaker 1>acceptance by the Supreme Court of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada to hear an appeal of judgments </v>

262
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:55.694
<v Speaker 1>from well-reasoned local courts or </v>
<v Speaker 1>request from a British Columbia band of </v>

263
00:14:59.031 --> 00:14:59.864
<v Speaker 1>native people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbering 900 who claimed that 25 years </v>

264
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>of consultation was constitutionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequate over a proposed ski area that</v>

265
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:07.244
<v Speaker 1>an elder of their band was super </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally advised and after a lapse of </v>

266
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:11.054
<v Speaker 1>some years told his people would drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the spirit of the grizzly bear that </v>

267
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:15.410
<v Speaker 1>was central to the religion of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>band.</v>

268
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.813
<v Speaker 1>I concluded the column with the shabby </v>
<v Speaker 1>polemical device that I only rarely </v>

269
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 1>employed a rhetorical question in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

270
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.023
<v Speaker 1>Are we all mad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course we are not and we still live </v>

271
00:15:25.131 --> 00:15:27.620
<v Speaker 1>in a country where people can self </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify as they wish,</v>

272
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.870
<v Speaker 1>even if it diverges from apparent </v>
<v Speaker 1>realities,</v>

273
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:33.620
<v Speaker 1>but we're almost at the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who declined to be legally forced</v>

274
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:36.890
<v Speaker 1>to acknowledge the warning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible applications of this right are</v>

275
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:37.724
<v Speaker 1>subject to persecution by social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors and quite conceivably the </v>

276
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:42.500
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not almost at that point,</v>

277
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Mr Black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already written into law.</v>

278
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.830
<v Speaker 1>We're terribly finally reluctant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>impose normal rules,</v>

279
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.703
<v Speaker 1>free discourse over the agitation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are using an imagined </v>

280
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.580
<v Speaker 1>unlimited latitude on sexual self </v>
<v Speaker 1>description to gag,</v>

281
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.533
<v Speaker 1>dictate to and prosecute reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>people exercising their rights to free </v>

282
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:02.030
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is another manifestation</v>

283
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.603
<v Speaker 1>parentheses of which the hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocritically respectful limitations </v>

284
00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:08.264
<v Speaker 1>about the Stalinists desk bought Fidel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Castro or another and parentheses of </v>

285
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 1>what my late friend Malcolm muggeridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the great liberal death wish.</v>

286
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.250
<v Speaker 1>The great majority do not want to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>along for that ride.</v>

287
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 1>And this time the great majority must be</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard and obeyed.</v>

288
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.863
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I told you what I thought about Mr </v>

289
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.293
<v Speaker 1>Black's comments and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm going to read a legal </v>

290
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:33.700
<v Speaker 1>opinion about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

291
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.023
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I regularly read your articles with </v>

292
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:38.054
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have interest in many of the subjects </v>

293
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:39.914
<v Speaker 1>that you seem to devote attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>including US history in presidential </v>

294
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.334
<v Speaker 1>politics and behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have further enjoyed your recent </v>

295
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:48.980
<v Speaker 1>appearances on CNN with respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect to the trump phenomenon.</v>

296
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I was motivated to write to you in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>instance with respect to your article in</v>

297
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 1>the National Post today mentioned in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject line of this email,</v>

298
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.453
<v Speaker 1>a right not to detract from your main </v>
<v Speaker 1>thesis regarding Mr Peterson and those </v>

299
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:00.164
<v Speaker 1>aligned against him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather to identify potentially ms </v>

300
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.160
<v Speaker 1>dot point of importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your article,</v>

301
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you call into question the volume of Mr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson's rhetoric.</v>

302
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.023
<v Speaker 1>My words not yours as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate by identifying that </v>

303
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:12.134
<v Speaker 1>imprisonment is not the punishment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he faces by disregarding the gender </v>

304
00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:18.800
<v Speaker 1>neutral ideology and any resultant </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders from a human rights tribunal.</v>

305
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.070
<v Speaker 1>While you may be and hopefully are </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct that in prison,</v>

306
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>it meant is not a Mr Peterson's future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The path to prison remains clear.</v>

307
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.623
<v Speaker 1>The key point being that the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights tribunals can and regularly do </v>

308
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.213
<v Speaker 1>order nonmonetary remedies in addition </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the typical and well known monetary </v>

309
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:38.414
<v Speaker 1>awards well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure to pay a financial penalty can </v>

310
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:44.420
<v Speaker 1>result in imprisonment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is admittedly a long and winding road</v>

311
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.480
<v Speaker 1>not entirely related to the unpaid </v>
<v Speaker 1>penalty itself.</v>

312
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.553
<v Speaker 1>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a tribunal war to issue its standard </v>

313
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:51.594
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't necessarily include some </v>

314
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 1>variation of the following.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

315
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.823
<v Speaker 1>a declaratory order requiring Mr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson not to misgender someone again </v>

316
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.530
<v Speaker 1>or use the wrong pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

317
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.543
<v Speaker 1>a gag order requiring him to refrain </v>
<v Speaker 1>from discussing the subject in public </v>

318
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.510
<v Speaker 1>possible given his academic status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>

319
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.493
<v Speaker 1>a publication ban requiring him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>refrain from publishing on these </v>

320
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 1>subjects possible given his media </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence and number four,</v>

321
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:18.743
<v Speaker 1>to take mandatory sensitivity or anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias training if Mr Peterson were to </v>

322
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.150
<v Speaker 1>breach these orders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

323
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:27.750
<v Speaker 1>by refusing to participate in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>training and guess what I would do?</v>

324
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.573
<v Speaker 1>The typical recourse of the tribunal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pursue a contempt of court which </v>

325
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:33.294
<v Speaker 1>inevitably results in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Section 19 of the Statutory Powers </v>

326
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:38.304
<v Speaker 1>Procedures Act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario states that an order of the </v>

327
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:42.570
<v Speaker 1>tribunal is an order of the superior </v>
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

328
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.123
<v Speaker 1>Section 13 of the statutory powers </v>
<v Speaker 1>Procedures Act says the tribunal can </v>

329
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:48.984
<v Speaker 1>pursue a breach of its own order by </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing an application to the </v>

330
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:54.840
<v Speaker 1>divisional court superior court on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>application.</v>

331
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.420
<v Speaker 1>The divisional court employees rule 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>point one,</v>

332
00:18:57.421 --> 00:18:58.254
<v Speaker 1>one of the rules of civil procedure </v>
<v Speaker 1>which states that when faced with </v>

333
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 1>contempt of a nonmonetary order of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Superior Court,</v>

334
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.053
<v Speaker 1>the court can order imprisonment for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indefinite period and finds the civil </v>

335
00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 1>courts send people to prison for </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaches of nonmonetary injunctions,</v>

336
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.400
<v Speaker 1>non defamation orders with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>regularity.</v>

337
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights tribunals have a history of</v>

338
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 1>imprisoning persons for breaches of non </v>
<v Speaker 1>monetary and monetary tribunal orders.</v>

339
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:30.350
<v Speaker 1>This happened most notoriously under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently repealed section 13 hate speech</v>

340
00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 1>provisions of the Canadian Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>Code,</v>

341
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.223
<v Speaker 1>of which Mr Lavato and Mr Stein quietly </v>
<v Speaker 1>performed Yulman service for all </v>

342
00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Canadian citizens and having repealed.</v>

343
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.340
<v Speaker 1>While the likelihood of prison remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly contingent and remote,</v>

344

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the pathway to imprisonment for </v>

<v Speaker 1>beneath contempt and then it's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing blown out of proportion and I'd </v>

358
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:33.780
<v Speaker 1>like to say as clearly as I possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

359
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.240
<v Speaker 1>this is not being blown out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion.</v>

360
