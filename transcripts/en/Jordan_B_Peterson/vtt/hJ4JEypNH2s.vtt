00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 2>so today I'm talking to Dr James W </v>
<v Speaker 2>pennebaker.</v>

3
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 2>He is professor of psychology at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Texas at Austin,</v>

4
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 2>and the Executive Director of Project </v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty Twenty one aimed at rethinking </v>

5
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate education at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

6
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.090
<v Speaker 2>His cross disciplinary research is </v>
<v Speaker 2>related to linguistics,</v>

7
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 2>clinical and cognitive psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communications,</v>

8
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and computer science.</v>

9
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 2>He and his students have explored </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural language use group dynamics and </v>

10
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 2>personality in educational and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>real world settings.</v>

11
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.660
<v Speaker 2>He has demonstrated that physical health</v>
<v Speaker 2>and work performance can be improved by </v>

12
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.531
<v Speaker 2>simple writing or talking exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Pennebaker has received numerous </v>

13
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:06.021
<v Speaker 2>awards and honors has written or edited </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 250 scientific articles as </v>

14
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:11.541
<v Speaker 2>well as nine books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including more recently expressive </v>

15
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 2>writing words that heal and the secret </v>
<v Speaker 2>life of pronouns.</v>

16
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 2>He also happens to be one of my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists.</v>

17
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Welcome Dr Pennebaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very much looking forward to talking</v>

18
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 2>to you guys to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

19
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

20
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you may know what,</v>

21
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 2>because I think we've talked about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit before.</v>

22
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 2>I developed some computer online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>computerized writing programs with my </v>

23
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 2>colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of which we call future authoring.</v>

24
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 2>One's passed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all three ones present,</v>

25
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 2>all threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a suite of writing program </v>

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 2>said they were heavily influenced in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their design by your research.</v>

27
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my lab's been interested in narrative </v>

28
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.241
<v Speaker 2>for a long time and also in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in clinical work and also in the </v>

29
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 2>application of psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.810
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the real world setting and the </v>

31
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.431
<v Speaker 2>practical setting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I spent a lot of time developing </v>

32
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:04.791
<v Speaker 2>tests to help employers screen for </v>
<v Speaker 2>employees and we got pretty good at </v>

33
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But while I was doing that,</v>

34
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:12.171
<v Speaker 2>I was constantly bombarded with </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions from managers of middle </v>

35
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:16.791
<v Speaker 2>managers usually have medium sized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>large corporations telling me that it </v>

36
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 2>was all well and good if we could hire </v>
<v Speaker 2>better employees,</v>

37
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:24.891
<v Speaker 2>but they wanted to know what they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with their poorer performing </v>

38
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:24.891
<v Speaker 2>employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

39
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 2>because that was a continual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intractable problem.</v>

40
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

41
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that much interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them and it's not that easy to </v>

42
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.611
<v Speaker 2>solve people's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's probably not a lot you could </v>

43
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:40.521
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I kinda got sick of telling people </v>

44
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:41.120
<v Speaker 2>that over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I scoured the literature.</v>

45
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 2>It was at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably about 15 years ago,</v>

46
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:49.461
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years ago that I came across your </v>

47
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.471
<v Speaker 2>research on expressive writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you could start by telling us </v>

48
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 2>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you learned and how you went about </v>

49
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.730
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

50
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a social psychologist by training,</v>

51
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

52
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any clinical training.</v>

53
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:07.171
<v Speaker 3>I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of my career has just been </v>

54
00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:10.081
<v Speaker 3>stumbling upon one idea after another as</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to approaching anything with a </v>

55
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.420
<v Speaker 3>clear set up where it was going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been looking at mind body issues.</v>

56
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 3>I've always been interested in how </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological factors influence physical</v>

57
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:24.181
<v Speaker 3>health and mental health and I came </v>
<v Speaker 3>across a fighting years ago that just </v>

58
00:03:24.181 --> 00:03:28.441
<v Speaker 3>bugged me and that was people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a major traumatic experience in </v>

59
00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 3>their lives that were much more likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get sick and people who had not.</v>

60
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Now that that was an old finding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as I dug in more deeply,</v>

61
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 3>what I discovered was people who had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trauma and kept it secret.</v>

62
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.880
<v Speaker 3>We're far more likely to have health </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems than people who had the same </v>

63
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.031
<v Speaker 3>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who talked with others about it and </v>

64
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:51.751
<v Speaker 3>it made me wonder what if we brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the lab and had them actually </v>

65
00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 3>write about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of trauma,</v>

66
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:57.271
<v Speaker 3>ideally one they hadn't talked to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people about would that influence their </v>

67
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 3>health and that was really the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlying idea.</v>

68
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.430
<v Speaker 3>So the very first study was done in 1983</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we brought in about 50 people.</v>

69
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Some of them were asked to write about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most dramatic experience of their </v>

70
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other half were asked to write about</v>

71
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:19.111
<v Speaker 3>superficial topics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm simplifying this study some and they</v>

72
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 3>wrote for four days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes a day,</v>

73
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.720
<v Speaker 3>and they also gave us permission to </v>
<v Speaker 3>track their student health center </v>

74
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 3>records.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were college students and this was</v>

75
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.601
<v Speaker 3>at a private college where the student </v>
<v Speaker 3>health center was right next to the </v>

76
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:34.020
<v Speaker 3>dorms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

77
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.030
<v Speaker 3>what we discovered was that those people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were asked about traumatic </v>

78
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.751
<v Speaker 3>experiences ended up going to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>student health center at about half the </v>

79
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:46.501
<v Speaker 3>rate as people in our control condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones who had regretted about </v>

80
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:51.361
<v Speaker 3>superficial topics over the next three </v>
<v Speaker 3>to six months and this was a really </v>

81
00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:53.370
<v Speaker 3>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding it was,</v>

82
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I kind of hoped would occur,</v>

83
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.530
<v Speaker 3>but I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

84
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.510
<v Speaker 3>I was so thrilled that it actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked.</v>

85
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.030
<v Speaker 3>And then we did another study that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>very similar and here again,</v>

86
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:12.031
<v Speaker 3>we had half the people write about </v>
<v Speaker 3>traumas have right about superficial </v>

87
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 3>topics and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

88
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 3>they wrote about trauma or superficial </v>
<v Speaker 3>topics.</v>

89
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.690
<v Speaker 3>By a flip of the coin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We decided which are the two topics </v>

90
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 3>they'd write about and this time we drew</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood before we,</v>

91
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assign them to condition again after the</v>

92
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.460
<v Speaker 3>last day of writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then six weeks later and the blood </v>

93
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 3>was essay by a group of people at Ohio </v>
<v Speaker 3>state looking at immune function.</v>

94
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.870
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found that writing about traumatic </v>

95
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.971
<v Speaker 3>experiences associated with enhanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>immune function and also reductions in </v>

96
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 3>doctor visits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this now takes us to about 1988.</v>

97
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 3>And by then other labs started to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we were doing.</v>

98
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 3>And it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole technique started to take off.</v>

99
00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.240
<v Speaker 3>And then over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more including my own found </v>

100
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 3>generally positive effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not always,</v>

101
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 3>but generally they're writing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>upsetting experiences had this saluatory</v>

102
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:12.011
<v Speaker 3>affected and influenced both health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical health and mental health.</v>

103
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.350
<v Speaker 3>And then later various labs found to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>related to all sorts of things </v>

104
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 3>associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

105
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 3>increased,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

106
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 3>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive functioning and so forth.</v>

107
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

108
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were doing the earliest </v>

109
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.890
<v Speaker 2>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were also influenced by Freud's idea</v>

110
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.520
<v Speaker 2>of catharsis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the idea that if,</v>

111
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.730
<v Speaker 2>if people had a traumatic or unpleasant </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

112
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 2>if they were encouraged to express the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions that were associated with that </v>

113
00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:45.960
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that would be curative.</v>

114
00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:48.270
<v Speaker 2>That was partly Freud's hypothesis,</v>

115
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 3>but it was a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's important to.</v>

116
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 3>It is absolutely consistent with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Freud's initial idea.</v>

117
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.170
<v Speaker 3>And what was interesting is because most</v>
<v Speaker 3>people listening to this podcast,</v>

118
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.260
<v Speaker 3>we'll hear Catharsis and they will think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Catharsis means blowing off steam </v>

119
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.820
<v Speaker 3>venting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's not actually what Freud </v>

120
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.980
<v Speaker 3>actually meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's interesting in Europe,</v>

121
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:18.940
<v Speaker 3>catharsis has a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning than it does in North America.</v>

122
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.590
<v Speaker 3>So in North America we view it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>venting Freud and Jung and Europeans,</v>

123
00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:28.591
<v Speaker 3>you'd Catharsis as connecting emotions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and thoughts and that is actually what I</v>

124
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 3>was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

125
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
<v Speaker 3>I had assumed that Freud meant venting </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had found actually that people </v>

126
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.351
<v Speaker 3>who just blew off steam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who he just expressed emotions actually </v>

127
00:07:40.351 --> 00:07:41.800
<v Speaker 3>didn't show any health improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was only</v>

128
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.470
<v Speaker 2>what stick analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

129
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.500
<v Speaker 2>And that was really fascinating about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the research.</v>

130
00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:48.540
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you can tell us a bit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>

131
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't initially again,</v>

132
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have never.</v>

133
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 3>I had never been at a and been </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in psychotherapy in here.</v>

134
00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:06.700
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden I was doing a study that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was essentially glorified psychotherapy,</v>

135
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.970
<v Speaker 3>which garbage speaking to clinicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the question was why does </v>

136
00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:15.340
<v Speaker 3>writing about an upsetting experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing about these changes?</v>

137
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.580
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a straightforward question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's not a straightforward </v>

138
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.380
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my lab and others started looking at</v>

139
00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:28.381
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of possibilities and looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at markers of inhibition,</v>

140
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people holding back,</v>

141
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:34.540
<v Speaker 3>we're more prone to illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what this did was to loosen them up.</v>

142
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.190
<v Speaker 3>We didn't find good evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other people had other hypotheses and at</v>

143
00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:44.191
<v Speaker 3>some point I started looking at what </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were actually saying and I got </v>

144
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:48.660
<v Speaker 3>groups of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>students who are in clinical psychology </v>

145
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.650
<v Speaker 3>to write the essays that people wrote in</v>
<v Speaker 3>on all these different dimensions and </v>

146
00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:57.931
<v Speaker 3>what I found was that relying on people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to read these essays and come up with </v>

147
00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:02.661
<v Speaker 3>some kind of deep understanding or even </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicting if a person would benefit or </v>

148
00:09:02.661 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 3>not just didn't work.</v>

149
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 3>It was too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stories were really traumatic.</v>

150
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:09.470
<v Speaker 3>They actually depressed a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who were in our system who,</v>

151
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.630
<v Speaker 3>who were reading the essays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it occurred to me it would make much </v>

152
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 3>more sense to come up with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective marker of reading these essays</v>

153
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 3>and a computer program would be what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed.</v>

154
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out back then,</v>

155
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:28.761
<v Speaker 3>this was now the early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no such program and </v>

156
00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:32.411
<v Speaker 3>fortunately I'd take it a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer science in college and one of </v>

157
00:09:32.411 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 3>my graduate students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martha Francis,</v>

158
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:37.581
<v Speaker 3>had actually done some done her </v>
<v Speaker 3>undergraduate degree in computer </v>

159
00:09:37.581 --> 00:09:41.091
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I asked Martha to essentially </v>

160
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.380
<v Speaker 3>help me to a computer program that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>go through and analyze the the language </v>

161
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:54.290
<v Speaker 3>of an essay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the idea behind it is really quite </v>

162
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.591
<v Speaker 3>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the computer go in and look at </v>

163
00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:00.441
<v Speaker 3>each word and you would compare each </v>
<v Speaker 3>word in the essay with some master list </v>

164
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 3>of words.</v>

165
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 3>So we would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say we're looking for anger words.</v>

166
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:07.710
<v Speaker 3>We want the computer to count up all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>words associated with anger.</v>

167
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.740
<v Speaker 3>So we'd have this dictionary of anger </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

168
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Speaker 3>And to get that dictionary we had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make that ourselves.</v>

169
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 3>We had to look in dictionaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thesauruses.</v>

170
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:19.950
<v Speaker 3>We had to have students generate anger </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

171
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.400
<v Speaker 3>And then we had all these rules of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>account,</v>

172
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 3>what makes for an egg award versus not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once you have that list,</v>

173
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 3>you go through and you have the computer</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at each word,</v>

174
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.510
<v Speaker 3>compare it with a master list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and anytime it finds it anger word,</v>

175
00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 3>it just adds it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at the end it adds up.</v>

176
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 3>All the anger words divided by the total</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of words,</v>

177
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.220
<v Speaker 3>and it produces the percentage of total </v>
<v Speaker 3>anger words.</v>

178
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.510
<v Speaker 3>In an essay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we did this now for not just anger </v>

179
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 3>words or sad words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guilt words,</v>

180
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.400
<v Speaker 3>negative emotion words in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we did positive emotion words and </v>

181
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.211
<v Speaker 3>then cognitive words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>words that suggested cause and effect </v>

182
00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 3>like cars because effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rationale where such as that,</v>

183
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 3>and then as long as we were doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we added more and more dimensions.</v>

184
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.470
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

185
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 3>we had pronouns and prepositions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>articles,</v>

186
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:08.050
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>

187
00:11:08.051 --> 00:11:13.051
<v Speaker 3>And wE ended up with about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's probably 80 different </v>

188
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:16.161
<v Speaker 3>dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when we went back and started </v>

189
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.200
<v Speaker 3>looking at essays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found that certain dimensions of </v>

190
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.450
<v Speaker 3>writing really predicted health </v>
<v Speaker 3>improvements.</v>

191
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Now we found that the use of positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions was associated with health </v>

192
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.241
<v Speaker 3>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you cAn write an essay about the </v>

193
00:11:32.241 --> 00:11:33.240
<v Speaker 3>worst thing in your life and still use </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive emotions,</v>

194
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a marker that you're going to show </v>
<v Speaker 3>health improvements.</v>

195
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 3>The effects are pretty small negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion words using a moderate number of</v>

196
00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:46.650
<v Speaker 3>negative emotions is weakly related to </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing better as well.</v>

197
00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:51.510
<v Speaker 3>But what turned out to be far stronger </v>
<v Speaker 3>was use of cognitive words.</v>

198
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:56.511
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because effect where it's like </v>

199
00:11:56.511 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 3>understand and realize no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are words that we now know are </v>

200
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 3>markers of people working through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

201
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you a question about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I saw it a lot about that.</v>

202
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.330
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was really aN interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

203
00:12:09.331 --> 00:12:10.250
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

204
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.650
<v Speaker 2>this question has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>function of memory.</v>

205
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty obvious that we don't and </v>

206
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.850
<v Speaker 2>count store what's the equivalent of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>videotape of the entire domain of </v>

207
00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:27.390
<v Speaker 2>sensory experience when we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>interacting with people.</v>

208
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

209
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.760
<v Speaker 2>and it just so obvious as well that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't how memory works and that memory </v>

210
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.001
<v Speaker 2>is modifiable across time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so here's a hypothesis for you and </v>

211
00:12:38.001 --> 00:12:42.480
<v Speaker 2>you tell me what you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that the purpose of </v>

212
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.271
<v Speaker 2>memory is so that you can remember the </v>
<v Speaker 2>good things that happened to you in the </v>

213
00:12:47.271 --> 00:12:51.831
<v Speaker 2>past and how they occurred and duplicate</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the future and remember the bad </v>

214
00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:57.201
<v Speaker 2>things that happened and figure out why </v>
<v Speaker 2>and change your course of lights and </v>

215
00:12:57.201 --> 00:12:59.940
<v Speaker 2>your pathway in the future so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>occur less frequently.</v>

216
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.940
<v Speaker 2>And so the cause and effect analysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be something like the adjustment </v>

217
00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.231
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a pathway map and it sort of reminds </v>

218
00:13:09.231 --> 00:13:11.940
<v Speaker 2>me of the work that was done with rap </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory because the hippa campus seems to</v>

219
00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:16.941
<v Speaker 2>store or something like cognitive maps </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maps almost by definition are are </v>

220
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:23.130
<v Speaker 2>are representations of ways to get from </v>
<v Speaker 2>one place to another and so you could </v>

221
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:27.231
<v Speaker 2>say maybe that you go from one place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another and you fall into a hole and </v>

222
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:32.340
<v Speaker 2>that's very traumatic and so you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember the pathway and how you got</v>

223
00:13:32.341 --> 00:13:37.341
<v Speaker 2>there and analyze it and reconstruct a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different potential future causal </v>

224
00:13:38.161 --> 00:13:41.100
<v Speaker 2>pathway so that you don't have to fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the same hole twice.</v>

225
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you think about that,</v>

226
00:13:43.351 --> 00:13:43.560
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

227
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Well I think that actually I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>works is true both the way you describe </v>

228
00:13:52.021 --> 00:13:57.021
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also on a much broader metaphorical </v>

229
00:13:57.021 --> 00:13:57.021
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

230
00:13:57.021 --> 00:14:00.981
<v Speaker 3>a person who falls into an emotional </v>
<v Speaker 3>hole that their life is going well and </v>

231
00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:05.961
<v Speaker 3>then their girlfriend dumps them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they go and get drunk in a bar and wreck</v>

232
00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:14.250
<v Speaker 3>their car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That experience is incredibly,</v>

233
00:14:14.251 --> 00:14:18.300
<v Speaker 3>incredibly complex and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unlike the rat,</v>

234
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.400
<v Speaker 3>what the human mind has to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the world went on with my </v>

235
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.620
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did she leave me?</v>

236
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.350
<v Speaker 3>What did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did I go get drunk?</v>

237
00:14:28.351 --> 00:14:33.351
<v Speaker 3>Have I been drinking too much and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If to process that requires tremendous </v>

238
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:39.531
<v Speaker 3>cognitive capacity and what happens is </v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's something were humiliated about,</v>

239
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.880
<v Speaker 3>were really reticent to talk to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people about it and we.</v>

240
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 3>So we add languages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really efficient way to process </v>

241
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.070
<v Speaker 3>complex issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

242
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.740
<v Speaker 3>Shared language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

243
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what I found in my clinical practice </v>

244
00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:57.570
<v Speaker 2>very frequently is that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with,</v>

245
00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 2>with people who are traumatized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they often encounter.</v>

246
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.700
<v Speaker 2>this is something else I wanted to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>you both.</v>

247
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.820
<v Speaker 2>They often have an encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 2>malevolence as well as a,</v>

248
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an encounter with just catastrophe.</v>

249
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 2>So it's not only did something bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to them,</v>

250
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 2>it's often something bad that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciously directed that the by another</v>

251
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:19.190
<v Speaker 2>person and they have a really hard time </v>
<v Speaker 2>mapping that,</v>

252
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:21.260
<v Speaker 2>especially if there is somewhat naive </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

253
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.730
<v Speaker 2>but then the other people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally affected by such things and can</v>

254
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 2>recover are those who have no one to </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to them because people,</v>

255
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.440
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that most people think by</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking and unless you have someone to </v>

256
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:40.541
<v Speaker 2>talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually don't get to think through </v>

257
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:41.120
<v Speaker 2>it and draw the appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's call them cause the lessons.</v>

258
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.720
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you also made this comment </v>

259
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:46.720
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

260
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 2>let's say the classic example I like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use is that,</v>

261
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're a premed student and you </v>

262
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:54.980
<v Speaker 2>write the medical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the g,</v>

263
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.600
<v Speaker 2>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the one for,</v>

264
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:59.300
<v Speaker 2>for medical entrance kept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

265
00:15:59.301 --> 00:15:59.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

266
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:04.751
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you consider yourself as a pretty solid </v>

267
00:16:04.751 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 2>student and that's a core element of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

268
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a predicate of the multiple maps of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life that you use.</v>

269
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.940
<v Speaker 2>And then you write the end cap and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>end up with 20th percentile scores.</v>

270
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:19.330
<v Speaker 2>And so then what happens is that not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only is your map of the future now </v>

271
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.831
<v Speaker 2>rendered null and void,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so is your map of you as a predicate</v>

272
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:28.991
<v Speaker 2>for president actions and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything about yourself that you </v>

273
00:16:28.991 --> 00:16:33.011
<v Speaker 2>thought held true in the past has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>reexamined and so it's something like </v>

274
00:16:33.011 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 2>the the degree of trauma is </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportionate to the amount of the area </v>

275
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.810
<v Speaker 2>that have map that's disturbed by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the,</v>

276
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.700
<v Speaker 2>by the unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected,</v>

277
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes the malevolent event.</v>

278
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 2>ANd so then the other thing I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about with regards to this,</v>

279
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is more germane to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>immunological element,</v>

280
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.420
<v Speaker 2>is so it's obviously very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult for the mind to compute </v>

281
00:16:58.821 --> 00:17:03.821
<v Speaker 2>how dangerous the environment is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment in some senses </v>

282
00:17:03.821 --> 00:17:08.410
<v Speaker 2>infinitely dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you never know when something small </v>

283
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.621
<v Speaker 2>happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's the harbinger of something </v>

284
00:17:11.621 --> 00:17:13.841
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because an ache in your side can be </v>

285
00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:15.440
<v Speaker 2>the cancer that kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might ask yourself,</v>

286
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.570
<v Speaker 2>given the complexity of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of framing in an unexpected event,</v>

287
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:24.800
<v Speaker 2>how do you ever manage it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of it's temperamental,</v>

288
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:29.801
<v Speaker 2>so if you're higher in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things hit you harder and part of it is </v>

289
00:17:29.801 --> 00:17:34.121
<v Speaker 2>based on your observed competence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other part I think is something </v>

290
00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:37.901
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something like the brain computes </v>

291
00:17:37.901 --> 00:17:41.960
<v Speaker 2>the proportion of times that you failed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past compared to the performer to</v>

292
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:45.020
<v Speaker 2>the times that you've succeeded and </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculates.</v>

293
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 2>I liked that name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger in depths,</v>

294
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:52.510
<v Speaker 2>and then it raises up your average </v>
<v Speaker 2>cortisol levels in correspondence to how</v>

295
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:58.461
<v Speaker 2>dangerous the general environment as </v>
<v Speaker 2>being because that puts you on alert </v>

296
00:17:58.461 --> 00:18:03.110
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with the advantage to </v>

297
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.110
<v Speaker 2>being on alert is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

298
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 2>if anything else negative happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more ready to act.</v>

299
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.790
<v Speaker 2>But the negative consequences is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cortisol is toxic and in reason,</v>

300
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in high doses across time.</v>

301
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:19.011
<v Speaker 2>And it also suppresses immunological </v>
<v Speaker 2>function and it also tends to suppress </v>

302
00:18:19.011 --> 00:18:23.661
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal functioning as well because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the prefrontal cortex is more involved </v>

303
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:28.761
<v Speaker 2>in low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medium to longterm planning and less in </v>

304
00:18:28.761 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 2>short term emergency preparation </v>
<v Speaker 2>activities.</v>

305
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 2>So I'd also like to know if you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

306
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.160
<v Speaker 2>that those ideas ring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ring a bell.</v>

307
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 3>So they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an interesting.</v>

308
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.560
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another dimension that ties into</v>

309
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:48.561
<v Speaker 3>this and that is sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we know that sleep is intimately </v>

310
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 3>related to cortisol is related to </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>

311
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:52.460
<v Speaker 3>is related to immune function,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is related to,</v>

312
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these systems are inter </v>

313
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.231
<v Speaker 3>correlated and the person who is dealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with an upheaval that they're trying to </v>

314
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:04.160
<v Speaker 3>understand what they'd had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have somebody to talk to,</v>

315
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.670
<v Speaker 3>end up not sleeping as well and part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is they're trying to process all this</v>

316
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:13.671
<v Speaker 3>additional information and this ties </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the idea of working memory that </v>

317
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.250
<v Speaker 3>they have less working memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not Sleeping as well.</v>

318
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Cortisol is is higher there and they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>also worse friends,</v>

319
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:29.100
<v Speaker 3>so when you talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're distracted.</v>

320
00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:34.101
<v Speaker 3>They're not paying attention and so all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these things are working together to </v>

321
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:41.331
<v Speaker 3>undermine the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now their cortisol hypothesis is a </v>

322
00:19:41.331 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 3>wonderful hypothesis.</v>

323
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.190
<v Speaker 3>The killer problem is that the studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have been done with cortisol and is</v>

324
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:52.191
<v Speaker 3>linked to writing and trauma have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to stand back and look at the</v>

325
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.040
<v Speaker 3>overall studies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It kind of squint and there's a weak </v>

326
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.521
<v Speaker 3>evidence to support it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not as clean as I wish it were.</v>

327
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has been the problem with,</v>

328
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:10.100
<v Speaker 3>with the writing and research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also the problem of all </v>

329
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:10.810
<v Speaker 3>clinical research that theory is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

330
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.830
<v Speaker 3>once you start getting real data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not just self reports of p </v>

331
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:16.830
<v Speaker 3>of a client said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

332
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 3>that was really great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you start to get a hard data,</v>

333
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.810
<v Speaker 3>everything is kind of off the table that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the effect sizes are very,</v>

334
00:20:24.811 --> 00:20:26.280
<v Speaker 3>very modest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either way.</v>

335
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:29.370
<v Speaker 3>That's true of medical outcomes as well </v>
<v Speaker 3>for medical disease.</v>

336
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

337
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

338
00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:37.081
<v Speaker 2>so you're the downward spiral that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of described there too,</v>

339
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.240
<v Speaker 2>could also account for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could also account for the negative </v>

340
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.370
<v Speaker 2>health consequences post trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

341
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:48.390
<v Speaker 2>so you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all is that the traumatized </v>

342
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.440
<v Speaker 2>person is going to be more reactive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>two additional trauma,</v>

343
00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 2>but also that as they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they,</v>

344
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.670
<v Speaker 2>as the effects of their failure cascade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say across their friendship,</v>

345
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.270
<v Speaker 2>interfere with their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

346
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.500
<v Speaker 2>educational function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interfere with their sleep.</v>

347
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.770
<v Speaker 2>The quality of their life overall is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to decline and that should also </v>

348
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.450
<v Speaker 2>produce multiple small stressors that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to compromise something,</v>

349
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.540
<v Speaker 2>including say that the decreased sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe also alterations and appetite </v>

350
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:20.581
<v Speaker 2>and those might accumulate across time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and produced the negative health </v>

351
00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:23.690
<v Speaker 2>consequences as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And don't forget the little smoke more.</v>

352
00:21:23.691 --> 00:21:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Drink board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take more drugs,</v>

353
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:27.280
<v Speaker 2>stop exercising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

354
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Kids out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have a trauma,</v>

355
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of yourself.</v>

356
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.980
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

357
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.640
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

358
00:21:33.641 --> 00:21:34.780
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

359
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

360
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I do with my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>clients generally speaking,</v>

361
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:42.781
<v Speaker 2>is make sure that they're getting enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep and try to reregulate they're </v>

362
00:21:42.781 --> 00:21:46.970
<v Speaker 2>sleeping and also to make sure they eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast at least because that,</v>

363
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:52.050
<v Speaker 2>that without those two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for someone to get </v>

364
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:52.180
<v Speaker 2>themselves back on the straight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrow.</v>

365
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:57.630
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now when we designed the self </v>

366
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.110
<v Speaker 2>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I had read,</v>

367
00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it was researched by Laura King,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember.</v>

368
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Somebody had taken your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your writing exercises and applied them </v>

369
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.581
<v Speaker 2>to the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had people write about the future </v>

370
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:11.581
<v Speaker 2>instead of the past and found similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>

371
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Was that Laura King?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>

372
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.990
<v Speaker 2>What was interesting was that study you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would think having people write what she</v>

373
00:22:22.201 --> 00:22:22.310
<v Speaker 2>did</v>

374
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:27.460
<v Speaker 3>I thought was she'd have people write </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the past versus right about the </v>

375
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.641
<v Speaker 3>future versus both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And her idea was that having them write </v>

376
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:34.640
<v Speaker 3>about both would be best because way </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy sometimes works in that way.</v>

377
00:22:34.641 --> 00:22:39.641
<v Speaker 3>so let's just work through your issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what are the implications for the </v>

378
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:43.571
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She found That writing about both </v>

379
00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:46.750
<v Speaker 3>actually wasn't very effective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that having them write about the future </v>

380
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.740
<v Speaker 3>was beneficial or just the pass was </v>
<v Speaker 3>beneficial.</v>

381
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 3>And since then there've been a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>other studies looking at having people </v>

382
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.870
<v Speaker 3>write about positive effects and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just negative.</v>

383
00:22:56.871 --> 00:23:01.871
<v Speaker 3>And what is generally found is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing about positive effects is also </v>

384
00:23:01.911 --> 00:23:04.430
<v Speaker 3>beneficial for health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the</v>

385
00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.120
<v Speaker 2>kind of indicates is the thinking has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been official for health.</v>

386
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

387
00:23:10.691 --> 00:23:12.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's also like,</v>

388
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best studies as I stand back and </v>

389
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:18.740
<v Speaker 3>look at the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the broad,</v>

390
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:19.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

391
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.640
<v Speaker 3>panorama of cover search is giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>people instructions to write really </v>

392
00:23:27.391 --> 00:23:32.391
<v Speaker 3>loosely in the sense of here you write </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the most traumatic experience of </v>

393
00:23:32.391 --> 00:23:37.011
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a lot of people haven't had </v>

394
00:23:37.011 --> 00:23:37.011
<v Speaker 3>traumas or maybe you've come to terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>with traumas,</v>

395
00:23:37.011 --> 00:23:40.350
<v Speaker 3>but friday about those topics that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting upon you the most right now.</v>

396
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 3>They may be positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>may be negative if they may be most or a</v>

397
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 3>little bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

398
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 3>and essentially that's what I encourage </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to do is to,</v>

399
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.590
<v Speaker 3>if you're having trouble sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

400
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:58.810
<v Speaker 3>set aside 15 minutes and just explore </v>
<v Speaker 3>your thoughts and feelings about issues </v>

401
00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:03.190
<v Speaker 3>that are weighing on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe something that you don't want to </v>

402
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.310
<v Speaker 3>talk about or something you don't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>even want to address.</v>

403
00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

404
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Well when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we set up the run you by the latest</v>

405
00:24:09.911 --> 00:24:13.630
<v Speaker 2>research on the future authoring program</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know about all of it.</v>

406
00:24:13.631 --> 00:24:18.631
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so basically what we've done with the </v>

407
00:24:18.631 --> 00:24:22.051
<v Speaker 2>future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the one with which now we've </v>

408
00:24:22.051 --> 00:24:25.290
<v Speaker 2>administered to thousands of university </v>
<v Speaker 2>students in different locales with very,</v>

409
00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:29.080
<v Speaker 2>very stable results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the results are quite remarkable,</v>

410
00:24:29.081 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

411
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.120
<v Speaker 2>so the way the thing is structured is we</v>
<v Speaker 2>first get people to consider six </v>

412
00:24:36.221 --> 00:24:38.330
<v Speaker 2>important dimensions of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>

413
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:43.350
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of construing the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>as something that's distributed across </v>

414
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.850
<v Speaker 2>dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>practical dimensions.</v>

415
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:48.851
<v Speaker 2>So those are um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimate relationship friendships,</v>

416
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.590
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>career education,</v>

417
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:59.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time spent outside of work and use of </v>

418
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.210
<v Speaker 2>drugs and alcohol because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbit hole.</v>

419
00:25:01.211 --> 00:25:06.211
<v Speaker 2>People can really go down and having a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least an idea of how you should </v>

420
00:25:06.211 --> 00:25:10.651
<v Speaker 2>handle intoxicating substances is better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than just going into it blindly.</v>

421
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.820
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing we get people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>write about and loosely following,</v>

422
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.970
<v Speaker 2>following that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a free association idea and </v>

423
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:20.970
<v Speaker 2>psych gwen analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

424
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also,</v>

425
00:25:22.001 --> 00:25:25.030
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frees people up to make mistakes because</v>

426
00:25:25.031 --> 00:25:26.860
<v Speaker 2>they get uptight if they have to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

427
00:25:26.861 --> 00:25:27.640
<v Speaker 2>You have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

428
00:25:27.641 --> 00:25:29.590
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it badly.</v>

429
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.800
<v Speaker 2>It's better than not doing it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have them write about to envision </v>

430
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:42.300
<v Speaker 2>what they would like to take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have what they wanted on each of those </v>

431
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:42.300
<v Speaker 2>domains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

432
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's three to five years down the road.</v>

433
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you're taking care of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and and as if you were someone you cared</v>

434
00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:54.220
<v Speaker 2>about and that things were set up </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimally for you,</v>

435
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.740
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would that look like?</v>

436
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:02.160
<v Speaker 2>And what I found in my clinical practice</v>
<v Speaker 2>very frequently is that people are </v>

437
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.840
<v Speaker 2>afraid of specifying their future </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're afraid of hope,</v>

438
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.680
<v Speaker 2>but also there's an avoidance element </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that once you specify your </v>

439
00:26:10.721 --> 00:26:15.721
<v Speaker 2>criteria for success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've also specified your criteria for </v>

440
00:26:15.721 --> 00:26:15.721
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>

441
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.850
<v Speaker 2>If you keep things vague and ill </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined,</v>

442
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:23.880
<v Speaker 2>then you can stumBle along without ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>really noticing that you're lost and </v>

443
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a really bad strategy in the medium</v>
<v Speaker 2>to longterm,</v>

444
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.240
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's effective as a means of</v>
<v Speaker 2>of well itself.</v>

445
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.810
<v Speaker 2>It's effective self deception in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>short term anyways.</v>

446
00:26:34.811 --> 00:26:39.811
<v Speaker 2>they do that first and then we get them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to write for 15 minutes with with no </v>

447
00:26:39.911 --> 00:26:43.060
<v Speaker 2>concern for spelling or grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think we took directly from your</v>

448
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:47.480
<v Speaker 2>and just just sketch out what life could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like three,</v>

449
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.880
<v Speaker 2>three years down the road if they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be good for them.</v>

450
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:56.400
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now that that also gives them </v>

451
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:56.960
<v Speaker 2>something to aim for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of,</v>

452
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

453
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:04.490
<v Speaker 2>we've been thinking through with regards</v>
<v Speaker 2>to having something to aim for is the </v>

454
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 2>fact that the systems that utilize </v>
<v Speaker 2>dopamine,</v>

455
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.620
<v Speaker 2>the incentive reward systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

456
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 2>which basically produced most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion that have the kind that</v>

457
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:18.381
<v Speaker 2>people really liked only respond in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to a specified goal.</v>

458
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:24.170
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel an incentive reward kit when </v>

459
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.171
<v Speaker 2>you're moving towards a value target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if there's no value target,</v>

460
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:32.301
<v Speaker 2>there's no positive emotion in lights </v>
<v Speaker 2>except in consequence of direct </v>

461
00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:37.641
<v Speaker 2>pleasure's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's no ongoing excitement or </v>

462
00:27:37.641 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm about tackling hard problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

463
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:44.130
<v Speaker 2>because there's no evidence that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>are related to a value destination.</v>

464
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's the entire dopaminergic system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

465
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.560
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

466
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.760
<v Speaker 2>that responds to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's of course the system that </v>

467
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.701
<v Speaker 2>cocaine and drugs like that effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then we do something else which </v>

468
00:27:55.701 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Speaker 2>we've introduced more recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is we say,</v>

469
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:57.800
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now look you,</v>

470
00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.820
<v Speaker 2>you specified the positive pole and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you something to to run towards.</v>

471
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.440
<v Speaker 2>NoW we want you to think through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways that the faults that you have and </v>

472
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:15.110
<v Speaker 2>and they and the resentment and anger </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you hold for whatever it is that </v>

473
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:19.911
<v Speaker 2>you're angry about and resentful about </v>
<v Speaker 2>an unhappy about and to consider your </v>

474
00:28:19.911 --> 00:28:24.210
<v Speaker 2>bad habits and imagine where those could</v>
<v Speaker 2>drag you three to five years from now if</v>

475
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 2>you let them take the upper hand.</v>

476
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 2>And so people write about that for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and we think,</v>

477
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:34.371
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gives them a negative pole to run </v>

478
00:28:34.371 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 2>away from like a hell to run away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>under heaven to run towards.</v>

479
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.800
<v Speaker 2>And there's some good evidence from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal literature that animals that are </v>

480
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.080
<v Speaker 2>running away and running towards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

481
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.840
<v Speaker 2>our run faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more motivated.</v>

482
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.850
<v Speaker 2>And then in the second half they lay out</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

483
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:54.380
<v Speaker 2>a well articulated longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>implementable plan and we try to get </v>

484
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:56.490
<v Speaker 2>them to deeply articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

485
00:28:56.491 --> 00:28:57.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

486
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.720
<v Speaker 2>drake it into eight goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rank order the goals if you attain goal </v>

487
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:05.670
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would that be good for you?</v>

488
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Why would it be good for your family?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would it be good for broader </v>

489
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.841
<v Speaker 2>society?</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you do with obstacles or </v>

490
00:29:14.841 --> 00:29:14.841
<v Speaker 2>rose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

491
00:29:14.841 --> 00:29:17.991
<v Speaker 2>So that's the pad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now at the university of rotterdam </v>

492
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.600
<v Speaker 2>at the business school there.</v>

493
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's the rotterdam school of </v>
<v Speaker 2>management.</v>

494
00:29:23.311 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I've been working with mckayla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shippers there and her colleagues.</v>

495
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.930
<v Speaker 2>We've run about 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people through that now.</v>

496
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:36.350
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the research indicates there's a bunch </v>

497
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.020
<v Speaker 2>of interesting things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

498
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.800
<v Speaker 2>overall it's raised grade point average </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 20 percent and drop drop dropout </v>

499
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 2>rate about 25 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is absolutely phenomenal.</v>

500
00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Was larger effects that we would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagined.</v>

501
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 2>But the effects are quite interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

502
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:50.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

503
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:55.720
<v Speaker 2>most interventions you rate if there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution of performance,</v>

504
00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:00.870
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you intervene and you raise the higher </v>

505
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.870
<v Speaker 2>performing people even higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

506
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.920
<v Speaker 2>absent a ceiling effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Performance.</v>

507
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:09.490
<v Speaker 2>This has the opposite of stack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it raises the lower end up and so at.</v>

508
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:14.850
<v Speaker 2>At rotterdam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the students that were most positively </v>

509
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.331
<v Speaker 2>affected were the ones who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>performing the worst and there are the </v>

510
00:30:18.331 --> 00:30:21.640
<v Speaker 2>way we divided them up by gender and and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity,</v>

511
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.800
<v Speaker 2>so male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>female obviously,</v>

512
00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:28.480
<v Speaker 2>but then we divided them into ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 2>hollander's,</v>

513
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:33.570
<v Speaker 2>so mostly caucasian natives and then non</v>
<v Speaker 2>western ethnic minorities.</v>

514
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.930
<v Speaker 2>So the males were underperforming the </v>
<v Speaker 2>females and then it was female dutch </v>

515
00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 2>natives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>male dutch natives,</v>

516
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.050
<v Speaker 2>female nonwestern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnic minorities,</v>

517
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.200
<v Speaker 2>male non western ethnic minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a big gap between the dutch </v>

518
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.711
<v Speaker 2>females said that non western ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 2>minority men within two years of </v>

519
00:30:55.711 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 2>completing the program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>non-ethnic western minority men past the</v>

520
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:03.220
<v Speaker 2>dutch women even though women also </v>
<v Speaker 2>increased a little bit.</v>

521
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:08.221
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and then we replicated that more </v>

522
00:31:08.221 --> 00:31:10.621
<v Speaker 2>recently in Canada at a little college </v>
<v Speaker 2>called mohawk college and we found there</v>

523
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:15.751
<v Speaker 2>that men were underperforming women </v>
<v Speaker 2>again and then we divided them into how </v>

524
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 2>well they were doing in high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they came into college.</v>

525
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:25.170
<v Speaker 2>And the worst performing males were the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones who were doing poorly in university</v>

526
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:30.541
<v Speaker 2>before they hit college or the sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the males who were in high school and </v>

527
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:35.881
<v Speaker 2>who had the worst grades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were those who improved most with the </v>

528
00:31:35.881 --> 00:31:37.770
<v Speaker 2>use of the future authoring program and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>

529
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:42.780
<v Speaker 2>they did the whole thing in an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly in one session.</v>

530
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.070
<v Speaker 3>That's very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you send me a copy of that?</v>

531
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:49.630
<v Speaker 3>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to see that.</v>

532
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 3>No problem.</v>

533
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Copy the mohawk paper yet because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't been released,</v>

534
00:31:54.991 --> 00:31:57.390
<v Speaker 2>but I can send you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you the rest of them.</v>

535
00:31:57.391 --> 00:31:57.870
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

536
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.700
<v Speaker 3>that's be assaults because these are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

537
00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:05.740
<v Speaker 3>Of course I'm dealing with right now on </v>
<v Speaker 3>here at the university of Texas trying </v>

538
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.320
<v Speaker 3>to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

539
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:11.410
<v Speaker 3>most of the interventions that we're are</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at is essentially a mean at a </v>

540
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>lower social class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids who are coming to college for the </v>

541
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.991
<v Speaker 3>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who faced so many obstacles that the </v>

542
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:21.470
<v Speaker 3>upper middle class students aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware exist.</v>

543
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

544
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.270
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to think through why this </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

545
00:32:25.271 --> 00:32:27.310
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of it is,</v>

546
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:29.490
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've thought this through a lot,</v>

547
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:34.500
<v Speaker 2>and part of it is I think that schools </v>
<v Speaker 2>before college never require really </v>

548
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:41.150
<v Speaker 2>require kids to make a decision and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't teach them how to make decisions.</v>

549
00:32:41.151 --> 00:32:44.690
<v Speaker 2>They never teach them that their life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>theirs to master,</v>

550
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they have to make a plan,</v>

551
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 2>but that the plant has to serve them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also have a suspicion that maybe men </v>

552
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:55.010
<v Speaker 2>will work unless they have their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan.</v>

553
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's associated with trait </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness,</v>

554
00:32:57.951 --> 00:32:59.990
<v Speaker 2>although we were still investigating </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

555
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:04.991
<v Speaker 2>but there is no doubt that these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least as far as our research has </v>

556
00:33:04.991 --> 00:33:09.041
<v Speaker 2>shown that these interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future planning interventions seem </v>

557
00:33:09.041 --> 00:33:12.070
<v Speaker 2>to have a more salutary effect on men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the men are under performing,</v>

558
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:12.570
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

559
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.830
<v Speaker 2>So for some reason the women don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same problem,</v>

560
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:20.831
<v Speaker 2>but it's something like males won't work</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless they have their own reasons to </v>

561
00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which wouldn't surprise me given that </v>

562
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 2>males are more disagreeable than </v>
<v Speaker 2>females.</v>

563
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.710
<v Speaker 2>So it's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

564
00:33:28.711 --> 00:33:31.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effects on dropout at mohawk college</v>

565
00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 2>for walloping about 50 percent decrease </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first semester,</v>

566
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:36.860
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

567
00:33:36.861 --> 00:33:41.861
<v Speaker 2>that's when kids always drop out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something about having a </v>

568
00:33:41.861 --> 00:33:41.990
<v Speaker 2>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we are thinking to that,</v>

569
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:46.991
<v Speaker 2>what's happening is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this kinda goes back to your </v>

570
00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:47.200
<v Speaker 2>comments about both positive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion,</v>

571
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.680
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be something like </v>

572
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.251
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty reduction and so and so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduces the effect of doubt,</v>

573
00:33:54.861 --> 00:33:57.500
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also tagging,</v>

574
00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the person designed a future,</v>

575
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:04.541
<v Speaker 2>they also want tags success with </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion and that carries them </v>

576
00:34:04.541 --> 00:34:07.230
<v Speaker 2>forward potentially through obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

577
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:12.490
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be very interesting to analyze the </v>

578
00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:12.580
<v Speaker 3>essays that these people wrote using,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

579
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.270
<v Speaker 3>using our computer program.</v>

580
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

581
00:34:15.181 --> 00:34:16.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we may have done that,</v>

582
00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.900
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may have done that with,</v>

583
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:20.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

584
00:34:20.071 --> 00:34:21.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rotterdam study,</v>

585
00:34:21.511 --> 00:34:26.511
<v Speaker 2>but I'd have to look because we've used </v>
<v Speaker 2>your l rwc a couple of times to look for</v>

586
00:34:26.701 --> 00:34:28.570
<v Speaker 2>the same sort of phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

587
00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 2>we've also done that to look at whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not we could extract out big five </v>

588
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:38.181
<v Speaker 2>traits from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for writing samples and that's also </v>

589
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:38.181
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

590
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:42.190
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes I'm less sanguine about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>big five approach because language and </v>

591
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.810
<v Speaker 3>self reports are really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really different animals.</v>

592
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

593
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to talk to you now if you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

594
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about your now you,</v>

595
00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.040
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did the computer analysis and words </v>

596
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.040
<v Speaker 2>and that got you interested in different</v>
<v Speaker 2>categories of words.</v>

597
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a whole book on pronouns.</v>

598
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason I want to talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>about pronouns,</v>

599
00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:10.210
<v Speaker 2>apart from the fact that I'm interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

600
00:35:10.211 --> 00:35:15.211
<v Speaker 2>I'd been embroiled in a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversy in Canada for the last five </v>

601
00:35:15.211 --> 00:35:18.790
<v Speaker 2>months that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been legislation here formulated</v>

602
00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:20.820
<v Speaker 2>at the federal level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already in place,</v>

603
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.360
<v Speaker 2>provincial level mandating the use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what had been called preferred pronouns.</v>

604
00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:30.570
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if that's come to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university of Texas at austin or not </v>

605
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:31.930
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that people have,</v>

606
00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nonspecific gender,</v>

607
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the right to choose pronouns by </v>

608
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.921
<v Speaker 2>which other people will address them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually been mandated and </v>

609
00:35:42.921 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 2>canadian law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something I'd been objecting to</v>

610
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:49.130
<v Speaker 2>sephora asleep because I don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>the government should mandate language </v>

611
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a massive error,</v>

612
00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:51.980
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

613
00:35:51.981 --> 00:35:56.981
<v Speaker 2>so I have a specific interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronouns and I know also the pronouns </v>

614
00:35:56.981 --> 00:36:00.150
<v Speaker 2>are in a closed linguistic categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't change that frequently.</v>

615
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:05.510
<v Speaker 2>But he wrote a whole book describing why</v>
<v Speaker 2>pronouns were so significant from a </v>

616
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 2>psychological perspective.</v>

617
00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.050
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's more,</v>

618
00:36:08.051 --> 00:36:13.051
<v Speaker 3>it's not just pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole class of words called </v>

619
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:14.950
<v Speaker 3>function words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at any text,</v>

620
00:36:14.951 --> 00:36:19.240
<v Speaker 3>are you listening very carefully?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of what we convey our,</v>

621
00:36:19.241 --> 00:36:24.241
<v Speaker 3>what we call content words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are nouns and regular verbs and </v>

622
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.730
<v Speaker 3>adjectives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most adverts,</v>

623
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.400
<v Speaker 3>and they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guts of what we're talking about,</v>

624
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:36.100
<v Speaker 3>but we have all these little words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>articles and the prepositions to have </v>

625
00:36:36.251 --> 00:36:37.720
<v Speaker 3>for pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

626
00:36:37.721 --> 00:36:38.470
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

627
00:36:38.471 --> 00:36:39.650
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

628
00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.140
<v Speaker 3>And in english,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only about 180 common pronouns.</v>

629
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Now the average person has vocabuLary of</v>
<v Speaker 3>100,000</v>

630
00:36:47.501 --> 00:36:52.501
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only less than one half of one </v>

631
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:56.290
<v Speaker 3>percent of those words are these </v>
<v Speaker 3>function words.</v>

632
00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Yet they account for 60 percent of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the words we use,</v>

633
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they control how we talk and what they </v>

634
00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.880
<v Speaker 3>are specifying is how we connect with </v>
<v Speaker 3>one another they are,</v>

635
00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:13.060
<v Speaker 3>and how we connect with our topic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how we think about ourselves and our </v>

636
00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.710
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by analyzing these function words,</v>

637
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:20.050
<v Speaker 3>you get a really good sense of who a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person is and that that's the underlying</v>

638
00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:25.140
<v Speaker 3>theory of the work I've been doing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last several years using this </v>

639
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 3>computer program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is linguistic inquiries,</v>

640
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.140
<v Speaker 3>word count l,</v>
<v Speaker 3>iwc,</v>

641
00:37:29.141 --> 00:37:34.141
<v Speaker 3>which I pronounced luke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the loop program is really just a </v>

642
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:36.430
<v Speaker 3>dumb program that it mostly is looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at these function words.</v>

643
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.840
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell us some things that you've found</v>

644
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.120
<v Speaker 2>with specific words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

645
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:43.740
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

646
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:49.180
<v Speaker 3>let's start off with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the most commonly used spoken word,</v>

647
00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 3>which is the word I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tells us so much about people.</v>

648
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:59.550
<v Speaker 3>And if you go into your email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see that you use it </v>

649
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.400
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes in an email you will.</v>

650
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:06.150
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are depressed use the word I </v>

651
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.560
<v Speaker 3>more than when they're not depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who are suicidal,</v>

652
00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.620
<v Speaker 3>is it even more so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of our first studies was looking at </v>

653
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.310
<v Speaker 3>poet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so either committed suicide or didn't.</v>

654
00:38:14.311 --> 00:38:19.311
<v Speaker 3>And we analyze their poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The suicidal poets did not use more </v>

655
00:38:19.311 --> 00:38:23.791
<v Speaker 3>negative emotion words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't make more references to </v>

656
00:38:23.791 --> 00:38:24.010
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used the word I more and why?</v>

657
00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Because pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including telling us where we're paying </v>

658
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.500
<v Speaker 3>attention or if you used the word I </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself focused and we,</v>

659
00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:36.690
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a clinician that what are the </v>

660
00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.310
<v Speaker 3>theories of depression is that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease of self focused at people are so</v>

661
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 3>ruminative and looking inwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much</v>

662
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.530
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me ask you,</v>

663
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:47.480
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you a question about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if that seems related to the,</v>

664
00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:52.840
<v Speaker 2>to the psychometric finding that self </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is a facet of neuroticism.</v>

665
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

666
00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.110
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you one other question along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

667
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:06.260
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because self conscIousness seems to </v>

668
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.661
<v Speaker 2>load with the negative emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also one of the things that I often </v>

669
00:39:08.661 --> 00:39:12.591
<v Speaker 2>recommend to my clinical clients who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially anxious because I've watched </v>

670
00:39:12.631 --> 00:39:15.270
<v Speaker 2>how they interact and because they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>so focused,</v>

671
00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.630
<v Speaker 2>they don't look at other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't look at theIr face,</v>

672
00:39:18.631 --> 00:39:23.631
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's thinking about how other </v>

673
00:39:23.631 --> 00:39:26.250
<v Speaker 2>people are looking at them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>busy thinking about what to say next,</v>

674
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.520
<v Speaker 2>and so what happens is they stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the face of the people that </v>

675
00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.330
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking to or listening to them,</v>

676
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:38.630
<v Speaker 2>and so then they're extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>awkward and so what I've done is instead</v>

677
00:39:38.731 --> 00:39:41.550
<v Speaker 2>of telling people to stop thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

678
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:45.240
<v Speaker 2>the set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you enter a conversation really,</v>

679
00:39:45.241 --> 00:39:50.241
<v Speaker 2>really focused on the other people push </v>
<v Speaker 2>you attention outward because that seems</v>

680
00:39:50.461 --> 00:39:55.020
<v Speaker 2>to activate their unconscious and </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatize professional,</v>

681
00:39:55.021 --> 00:40:00.021
<v Speaker 2>let's say social skills and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>flow with the conversation.</v>

682
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:04.760
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and to build on this,</v>

683
00:40:04.761 --> 00:40:08.240
<v Speaker 3>the idea of people who are leaders and </v>
<v Speaker 3>status,</v>

684
00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:13.330
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the two people you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell with remarkable accuracy </v>

685
00:40:13.341 --> 00:40:17.240
<v Speaker 3>who's the higher status by the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who uses fewer eyes.</v>

686
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.820
<v Speaker 3>The high Status person doesn't use the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word I much.</v>

687
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:24.960
<v Speaker 3>The lower status person does it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the high status person is looking out at</v>

688
00:40:25.431 --> 00:40:27.650
<v Speaker 3>the world and the lower status person </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

689
00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:32.060
<v Speaker 3>Your pointed out is looking inward and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could take this to the bank,</v>

690
00:40:32.061 --> 00:40:35.180
<v Speaker 3>go look at your emails and you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're writing to someone of higher</v>

691
00:40:35.181 --> 00:40:37.360
<v Speaker 3>status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tend to use I'm or,</v>

692
00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.470
<v Speaker 3>and when you're writing to someone with </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower status,</v>

693
00:40:39.471 --> 00:40:42.650
<v Speaker 3>you use it less so it's so.</v>

694
00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me.</v>

695
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you another observation that</v>

696
00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:49.130
<v Speaker 2>I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell me what you think about this.</v>

697
00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you what to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a,</v>

698
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:56.630
<v Speaker 2>an observation from animation first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've done some very in depth analysis</v>

699
00:40:56.631 --> 00:41:01.631
<v Speaker 2>of various disney movies including the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lion king and the lion king involves on </v>

700
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:08.040
<v Speaker 2>a child and then an adolescent lion who </v>
<v Speaker 2>matures and so and the animators also </v>

701
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:17.200
<v Speaker 2>represented his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now his father has a very interesting </v>

702
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.730
<v Speaker 2>face because it looks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

703
00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's focused forward and kind of staring</v>

704
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were almost predatory because of </v>

705
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 2>predatory gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gazes locked on someone else,</v>

706
00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:27.960
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>

707
00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:33.260
<v Speaker 2>the adolescent lion who's kind of naive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and imbecilic in some sense is like this</v>

708
00:41:34.071 --> 00:41:39.071
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it seems to me that there's a </v>

709
00:41:39.071 --> 00:41:42.611
<v Speaker 2>relationship between immaturity and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>self focus and maturity and outward </v>

710
00:41:43.731 --> 00:41:46.280
<v Speaker 2>focus and in the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where when,</v>

711
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 2>when the adolescent lion undergoes this </v>
<v Speaker 2>initiation,</v>

712
00:41:49.491 --> 00:41:54.491
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his face changes into one like this and </v>

713
00:41:54.491 --> 00:41:55.070
<v Speaker 2>do one of determination.</v>

714
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems related to this is that,</v>

715
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

716
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:01.940
<v Speaker 2>when people are speaking in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

717
00:42:01.941 --> 00:42:06.941
<v Speaker 2>they often get self conscious and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel all the eyes on them and that makes</v>

718
00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:12.491
<v Speaker 2>them self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I've </v>

719
00:42:12.491 --> 00:42:14.381
<v Speaker 2>recommended to people who want to speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>to groups is never to speak to the </v>

720
00:42:14.381 --> 00:42:17.441
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to look at one individual and then </v>

721
00:42:17.441 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 2>another individual and then another </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual because that,</v>

722
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.680
<v Speaker 2>well that seems to foster communication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also blows out the probability of</v>

723
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:26.700
<v Speaker 2>becoming self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

724
00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.360
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

725
00:42:28.361 --> 00:42:32.170
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have recommended to teacher trainers.</v>

726
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.380
<v Speaker 3>So here's what you do at my university </v>
<v Speaker 3>for teacher training.</v>

727
00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:40.310
<v Speaker 3>You give a a practice lecture and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have the,</v>

728
00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:44.110
<v Speaker 3>the camera is in the audience looking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

729
00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:49.380
<v Speaker 3>That's the wrong way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way that you should train teachers </v>

730
00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.321
<v Speaker 3>is put a camera behind the teacher at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the audience and point out afterwards,</v>

731
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.190
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

732
00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.890
<v Speaker 3>That guy's not paying attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That person is and the net.</v>

733
00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not making yourself focus,</v>

734
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:04.190
<v Speaker 3>making you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're training the teacher training,</v>

735
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.640
<v Speaker 3>a public speaker doing exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying,</v>

736
00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:11.940
<v Speaker 3>you should give them the view of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the audience looks like and not </v>

737
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.170
<v Speaker 3>what you look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the exact wrong training.</v>

738
00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

739
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.500
<v Speaker 2>so tell me what you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm lecturing,</v>

740
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I pay attention to the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention.</v>

741
00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time,</v>

742
00:43:26.071 --> 00:43:28.380
<v Speaker 2>most people in my lectures are paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

743
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.150
<v Speaker 2>at least a reasonable proportion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

744
00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.670
<v Speaker 2>but the ones that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

745
00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:35.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they're not here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's lots of reasons.</v>

746
00:43:35.371 --> 00:43:37.560
<v Speaker 2>They might've had a bad night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might be overtired,</v>

747
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.330
<v Speaker 2>they may have taken the chorus by </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>

748
00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean god only knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I paid attention to the students </v>

749
00:43:44.581 --> 00:43:47.700
<v Speaker 2>that are paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I can read off their faces.</v>

750
00:43:47.701 --> 00:43:50.940
<v Speaker 2>How the audience is thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if I glance around,</v>

751
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:55.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's that intense communication from</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual to individual but seems to </v>

752
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:59.130
<v Speaker 2>make a lecturer or an interview or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation really compelling.</v>

753
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.900
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the secret to what </v>

754
00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:09.941
<v Speaker 3>are the secrets to being a good teacher </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a good speaker is really being able </v>

755
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 3>to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when also to the judge,</v>

756
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:14.940
<v Speaker 3>when all of a sudden you're starting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose,</v>

757
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:16.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

758
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.980
<v Speaker 3>you're also doing little experiments the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole time.</v>

759
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:25.091
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively new is they start to lose </v>

761
00:44:25.091 --> 00:44:26.840
<v Speaker 3>people and then they start speaking more</v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly,</v>

762
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.140
<v Speaker 3>which of course is precisely the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to do</v>

763
00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 2>and they start less attention</v>

764
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 3>because they get self conscious and want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hide from the audience.</v>

765
00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 3>And then they get into a loop and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>just go,</v>

766
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

767
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.880
<v Speaker 3>the worst speakers I'd ever seen stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the front of the,</v>

768
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 3>of the audience with your head down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mumble at their feet.</v>

769
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.840
<v Speaker 3>It's just painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean.</v>

770
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:51.480
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

771
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 3>So that's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

772
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.510
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you talked about,</v>

773
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:59.950
<v Speaker 3>you talked about dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else have you learned about </v>

774
00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:00.220
<v Speaker 3>specific words?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

775
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:01.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple more things about.</v>

776
00:45:01.931 --> 00:45:05.890
<v Speaker 3>I mixed with some others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is his honesty,</v>

777
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:11.100
<v Speaker 3>so the ability to detect deception </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus honesty as a function of how </v>

778
00:45:11.531 --> 00:45:16.531
<v Speaker 3>people talk and what we find is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've done many studies where we induced</v>

779
00:45:17.201 --> 00:45:22.201
<v Speaker 3>people to lie and tell the truth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then we look at the transcripts of the </v>

780
00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:25.961
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we find iS when people tell the </v>

781
00:45:25.961 --> 00:45:28.621
<v Speaker 3>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend to use it more that they're </v>

782
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:30.720
<v Speaker 3>owning what they're saying and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who was lying is psychologically </v>

783
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.011
<v Speaker 3>distancing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>distancing themselves from what you're </v>

784
00:45:35.011 --> 00:45:35.011
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

785
00:45:35.011 --> 00:45:36.730
<v Speaker 3>And then there's another feature is when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're telling the truth,</v>

786
00:45:36.731 --> 00:45:41.731
<v Speaker 3>you tend to use more words that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We used to call them exclusive words or </v>

787
00:45:42.251 --> 00:45:45.400
<v Speaker 3>differentiation words where you use </v>
<v Speaker 3>words like except,</v>

788
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 3>but without exclude word for you making </v>
<v Speaker 3>a distinction between west inner </v>

789
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 3>category and not in a category that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these exclusive kind of words are.</v>

790
00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:01.910
<v Speaker 3>You're being more honest because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying what you did but also what you </v>

791
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:06.160
<v Speaker 3>didn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a really complex cognitive </v>

792
00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.731
<v Speaker 3>tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you're lying and you didn't </v>

793
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:11.521
<v Speaker 3>do any of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just say what you did not do is just </v>

794
00:46:11.521 --> 00:46:16.240
<v Speaker 3>beyond the capabilities of most people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So both,</v>

795
00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:21.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I were usage in these exclusive words </v>

796
00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:21.620
<v Speaker 3>together do a pretty good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

797
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:24.510
<v Speaker 3>and another one is also focusing on </v>
<v Speaker 3>details.</v>

798
00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:27.130
<v Speaker 3>So if you do there with political </v>
<v Speaker 3>speeches.</v>

799
00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:29.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there had been some,</v>

800
00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:32.020
<v Speaker 3>there's been some nice research on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

801
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:34.030
<v Speaker 3>Jeff hancock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

802
00:46:34.031 --> 00:46:36.880
<v Speaker 3>is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stanford has played with this idea quite</v>

803
00:46:36.881 --> 00:46:41.881
<v Speaker 3>a bit when he was looking at all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric about what weapons of mass </v>

804
00:46:41.881 --> 00:46:46.210
<v Speaker 3>destruction during the bush </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration that their,</v>

805
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:51.380
<v Speaker 3>that what he found was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>administrators were being using </v>

806
00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.870
<v Speaker 3>deceptive language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

807
00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.190
<v Speaker 3>prior to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

808
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.610
<v Speaker 3>to the u.</v>
<v Speaker 3>S were before prior to our going to war.</v>

809
00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

810
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:59.940
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

811
00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:04.950
<v Speaker 2>so that opens up a whole completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>appalling,</v>

812
00:47:05.171 --> 00:47:10.171
<v Speaker 2>an interesting scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like me increasingly people are </v>

813
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:13.110
<v Speaker 2>using computer programs to analyze </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality and that sort of thing by,</v>

814
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.690
<v Speaker 2>by analyzing people's behavior on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>web.</v>

815
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:18.630
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

816
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.040
<v Speaker 3>and we've been done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been doing this a lot with,</v>

817
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:21.830
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

818
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:27.400
<v Speaker 3>a political figures and if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact I'm one of my graduate students </v>

819
00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.090
<v Speaker 3>and like caitlyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>

820
00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:30.760
<v Speaker 3>how we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a website,</v>

821
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:35.290
<v Speaker 3>it's called birdwatchers word </v>
<v Speaker 3>watchers.wordpress.com.</v>

822
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.730
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go in there,</v>

823
00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:41.320
<v Speaker 3>you can see our analysis of trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually this whole election from,</v>

824
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.420
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

825
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:47.910
<v Speaker 3>from my perspective as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has been a phenomenal electoral </v>

826
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 3>season as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not so much,</v>

827
00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:52.240
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

828
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're done here,</v>

829
00:47:55.361 --> 00:47:57.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll email you and you could give me </v>
<v Speaker 2>some links.</v>

830
00:47:57.611 --> 00:48:02.611
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I can put in a description here </v>

831
00:48:02.611 --> 00:48:02.611
<v Speaker 2>where people can go look this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing up.</v>

832
00:48:02.611 --> 00:48:04.030
<v Speaker 2>You bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's interesting.</v>

833
00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:09.031
<v Speaker 2>So can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you actually rank order politicians </v>

834
00:48:09.031 --> 00:48:09.520
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the probability that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the truth?</v>

835
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have,</v>

836
00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.940
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

837
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:23.120
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not sure I trust it very much </v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the interesting issues </v>

838
00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.531
<v Speaker 3>about deception is you've got some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are deceptive,</v>

839
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:32.780
<v Speaker 3>who are deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they honestly believe they're </v>

840
00:48:33.061 --> 00:48:34.980
<v Speaker 3>telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

841
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I think trump actually falls into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>category.</v>

842
00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:41.580
<v Speaker 3>I think he actually believes what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>says.</v>

843
00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:46.850
<v Speaker 3>Eddie might say just the opposite 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes later and he'll believe that as </v>

844
00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:46.850
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

845
00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you suppose?</v>

846
00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:47.680
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

847
00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:50.320
<v Speaker 2>So that's interesting because I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

848
00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:54.460
<v Speaker 2>in poorly written undergraduate essays </v>
<v Speaker 2>you commonly see,</v>

849
00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I think about it as fracturing at </v>
<v Speaker 2>different levels of the linguistic </v>

850
00:48:59.700 --> 00:48:59.700
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

851
00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.550
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to his schizophrenia </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak,</v>

852
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.270
<v Speaker 2>they're actually fractured at the level </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the frames.</v>

853
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:10.230
<v Speaker 2>And then if you listen to a manic speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more like fractured out the </v>

854
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.100
<v Speaker 2>level of the sentence or the paragraph </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can say a whole paragraph.</v>

855
00:49:12.101 --> 00:49:14.860
<v Speaker 2>And then the next paragraph they'll say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something completely different.</v>

856
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:20.130
<v Speaker 2>It contradicts the first paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no awareness of the </v>

857
00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.000
<v Speaker 2>contradiction and poorly written </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate essays.</v>

858
00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:27.001
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a claim made on page one and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a claim made john made on page two </v>

859
00:49:27.001 --> 00:49:29.710
<v Speaker 2>that are completely antithetical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

860
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:35.060
<v Speaker 2>it isn't self evident that you become </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious of paradoxes in your thinking </v>

861
00:49:36.011 --> 00:49:41.011
<v Speaker 2>unless you act out both propositions </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously and it produces a </v>

862
00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:44.800
<v Speaker 2>conflict because you can hold paradoxes </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommendation without ever knowing it.</v>

863
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:50.150
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe maybe what happens with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who who does that sort of </v>

864
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:55.330
<v Speaker 2>contradictory speech is temperamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very confident.</v>

865
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.520
<v Speaker 2>So they might be assertive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

866
00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:03.400
<v Speaker 2>something like that and maybe also low </v>
<v Speaker 2>end or high end stress tolerance.</v>

867
00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:05.550
<v Speaker 2>So they're not anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are,</v>

868
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 2>they're assertive and they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>care so much what other people think.</v>

869
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:13.681
<v Speaker 2>So they come across continually as </v>
<v Speaker 2>confident and so that would be more </v>

870
00:50:13.681 --> 00:50:16.240
<v Speaker 2>temperamental confidence which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a form.</v>

871
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:19.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny thing because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same as telling the truth,</v>

872
00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:24.571
<v Speaker 2>but it is something more like believing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you say or believing in what you </v>

873
00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:24.571
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

874
00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:29.140
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what I think that the text approach </v>

875
00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 3>is better at is when a person knows damn</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they're telling,</v>

876
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:33.870
<v Speaker 3>telling a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

877
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:39.070
<v Speaker 3>and that's when our tails do better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another phenomenon is called a </v>

878
00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:45.401
<v Speaker 3>performative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of my favorite that you can </v>

879
00:50:45.401 --> 00:50:48.000
<v Speaker 3>you hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is performatives are used in </v>

880
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:52.820
<v Speaker 3>linguistics and they're usually a phrase</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they might be something like,</v>

881
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 3>let me assure you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or as I said before,</v>

882
00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:01.360
<v Speaker 3>or believed me when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you have a performative,</v>

883
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:06.521
<v Speaker 3>it makes the entire sentence and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not able to detect if it's true or not.</v>

884
00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:13.991
<v Speaker 3>So you can't establish the truth value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me assure you that this is a glass </v>

885
00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:15.740
<v Speaker 3>of water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

886
00:51:15.741 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 3>is that true or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

887
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:18.680
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

888
00:51:18.681 --> 00:51:20.690
<v Speaker 3>actually it is because I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

889
00:51:20.691 --> 00:51:22.820
<v Speaker 3>I want to assure you that a glass of </v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

890
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:25.910
<v Speaker 3>it's true because I want to assure you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

891
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.290
<v Speaker 3>that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's not,</v>

892
00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 3>what happens is consciously we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know we do this,</v>

893
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:39.040
<v Speaker 3>but it's almost so our brain is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to protect us and we throw these </v>

894
00:51:40.221 --> 00:51:45.221
<v Speaker 3>up and I have another webpage that has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of performatives that you see in </v>

895
00:51:47.031 --> 00:51:52.031
<v Speaker 3>president after president where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president says something that the </v>

896
00:51:52.031 --> 00:51:54.260
<v Speaker 3>beginning sets it up.</v>

897
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.480
<v Speaker 3>So it's performative and then the second</v>
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>

898
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.320
<v Speaker 3>Sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

899
00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.540
<v Speaker 3>It is a lie.</v>

900
00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

901
00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:02.650
<v Speaker 2>so do you suppose that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

902
00:52:02.651 --> 00:52:03.960
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you,</v>

903
00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:09.210
<v Speaker 2>do you suppose that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is the performative a marker for,</v>

904
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.380
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for deceit,</v>

905
00:52:12.381 --> 00:52:12.870
<v Speaker 2>isn't it,</v>

906
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.440
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is?</v>

907
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

908
00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.120
<v Speaker 3>So I think it is and it's edited fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

909
00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:23.200
<v Speaker 3>trump's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His best word is believe me.</v>

910
00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:25.790
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

911
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:29.290
<v Speaker 3>I know more about the army than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>generals,</v>

912
00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:30.610
<v Speaker 3>believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

913
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.510
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was quite interesting.</v>

914
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:35.290
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

915
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.380
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a form of performative,</v>

916
00:52:38.381 --> 00:52:43.381
<v Speaker 3>which is he's really saying please </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe me that I know more that the </v>

917
00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:46.180
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he doesn't use it that way,</v>

918
00:52:46.181 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it essentially is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

919
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:53.560
<v Speaker 2>it kind of makes you wonder if he thinks</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if people believe in that makes it </v>

920
00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:53.560
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

921
00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.660
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny thing because there is some</v>

922
00:52:56.661 --> 00:52:58.220
<v Speaker 2>truth to the idea that</v>

923
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:02.090
<v Speaker 2>true things are what other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

924
00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:07.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you don't want to go too far </v>

925
00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:08.700
<v Speaker 2>down that road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is something,</v>

926
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a contract holds no truth unless there's</v>

927
00:53:12.811 --> 00:53:17.811
<v Speaker 2>consensus around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whenever the reality is dependent on </v>

928
00:53:17.811 --> 00:53:22.791
<v Speaker 2>everyone agreeing to do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then consensus is actually a very good </v>

929
00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:25.650
<v Speaker 2>marker for truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

930
00:53:25.651 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 2>because there's lots of situations where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

931
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:29.970
<v Speaker 2>well if we agree on all this then it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be true.</v>

932
00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what a contract is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

933
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.330
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost as if using words like that,</v>

934
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:41.331
<v Speaker 2>it's an attempt to establish a contract </v>
<v Speaker 2>where no contract can genuinely be </v>

935
00:53:41.521 --> 00:53:46.521
<v Speaker 2>established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can have a contract about </v>

936
00:53:46.521 --> 00:53:46.590
<v Speaker 2>whether or not Iran has weapons of mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction,</v>

937
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:51.680
<v Speaker 2>but we can certainly have a contract </v>
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not we'll go to war </v>

938
00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:51.680
<v Speaker 2>over it.</v>

939
00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

940
00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:56.550
<v Speaker 2>With regards to two interesting words.</v>

941
00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole.</v>

942
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:05.500
<v Speaker 3>We could go for hours on this actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So another one that I've been quite </v>

943
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:09.501
<v Speaker 3>interested in is using these groups of </v>
<v Speaker 3>words and looking at how to people </v>

944
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:14.640
<v Speaker 3>connect and in terms of these function </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

945
00:54:14.641 --> 00:54:19.641
<v Speaker 3>So what we could do is we can actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>calculate the percentage agreement we </v>

946
00:54:19.641 --> 00:54:23.100
<v Speaker 3>have in our use of pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prepositions are those articles,</v>

947
00:54:23.101 --> 00:54:28.101
<v Speaker 3>conjunctions and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we call this language style </v>

948
00:54:28.101 --> 00:54:29.520
<v Speaker 3>matching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the closer to people are in their,</v>

949
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:33.330
<v Speaker 3>in their use of these words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in any given conversation,</v>

950
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:38.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more they are in tune with each </v>

951
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.750
<v Speaker 3>other</v>

952
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:39.550
<v Speaker 2>being on the same wavelength.</v>

953
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:45.230
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not necessarily liking one </v>

954
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:48.360
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been absolutely paying attention to</v>

955
00:54:48.361 --> 00:54:53.361
<v Speaker 3>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So two people in the midst of an </v>

956
00:54:53.361 --> 00:54:54.870
<v Speaker 3>argument tend to entrain really closely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like two people madly in love.</v>

957
00:54:55.470 --> 00:55:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Now we've done analysis of transcripts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a speed dates and what we find is we </v>

958
00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:06.771
<v Speaker 3>actually can predict who will go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsequent date at race somewhat higher </v>

959
00:55:06.771 --> 00:55:07.500
<v Speaker 3>than the people themselves.</v>

960
00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:10.910
<v Speaker 2>So what's happening is the rapid </v>
<v Speaker 2>establishment of mutual limitation.</v>

961
00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.540
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what happens from the australian</v>

962
00:55:14.541 --> 00:55:16.610
<v Speaker 2>perspective when two children start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

963
00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:22.420
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've looked at a.</v>

964
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.990
<v Speaker 3>One that I particularly liked was we </v>
<v Speaker 3>studied,</v>

965
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:30.020
<v Speaker 3>we looked at 86 dating couples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a freshman in college and freshman </v>

966
00:55:30.211 --> 00:55:33.780
<v Speaker 3>in college are in notoriously unstable </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>

967
00:55:33.781 --> 00:55:38.730
<v Speaker 3>which from my perspective is perfect for</v>
<v Speaker 3>research and wait to be in our studies.</v>

968
00:55:38.731 --> 00:55:43.230
<v Speaker 3>They had to do instant messaging at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least daily with each other.</v>

969
00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:48.231
<v Speaker 3>And to give Us 10 days of their igms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they did and what we did,</v>

970
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:51.430
<v Speaker 3>and we also ask them how good is your </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship?</v>

971
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:54.000
<v Speaker 3>How likely will you be together in </v>
<v Speaker 3>several months?</v>

972
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:59.570
<v Speaker 3>And what we found was that we did a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shockingly good job at predicting who's </v>

973
00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:03.240
<v Speaker 3>still be together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people who were just average gut,</v>

974
00:56:03.241 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 3>their their style matching score,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their average treatment score,</v>

975
00:56:07.711 --> 00:56:10.470
<v Speaker 3>and we just got the top half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>80 percent.</v>

976
00:56:10.471 --> 00:56:12.570
<v Speaker 3>We're still together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three months later,</v>

977
00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:14.910
<v Speaker 3>if they were in the bottom half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only 50 percent.</v>

978
00:56:14.911 --> 00:56:19.911
<v Speaker 3>We're still together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And self-reports people's self reports </v>

979
00:56:21.631 --> 00:56:26.631
<v Speaker 3>about their relationship was absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 3>unrelated to whether or not they were </v>

980
00:56:26.631 --> 00:56:29.070
<v Speaker 3>still together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like dancing videos.</v>

981
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.780
<v Speaker 3>I've already started it.</v>

982
00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:34.310
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

983
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:39.600
<v Speaker 2>so what that really means in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it this way is that the two </v>

984
00:56:41.401 --> 00:56:44.880
<v Speaker 2>people come together and the two of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

985
00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:48.270
<v Speaker 2>it's as if they're making something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make something jointly,</v>

986
00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:52.290
<v Speaker 2>that they're both acting out so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're uniting into something central.</v>

987
00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Then you might think too that in order </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that to happen,</v>

988
00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:57.780
<v Speaker 2>they have to be paying close attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>to each other.</v>

989
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:03.830
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't train with someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you pay close attention to them </v>

990
00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:08.340
<v Speaker 2>and certainly one of the best markers </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the utility of the relationship is </v>

991
00:57:08.701 --> 00:57:10.800
<v Speaker 2>going to be whether or not the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to each other.</v>

992
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finding that's why children are so </v>

993
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:16.160
<v Speaker 2>absolutely desperate for adult </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

994
00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.430
<v Speaker 2>That's their currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

995
00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really cool.</v>

996
00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to another one,</v>

997
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:28.670
<v Speaker 3>because I've got another one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few,</v>

998
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:35.530
<v Speaker 3>three or four years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started working with much bigger </v>

999
00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:35.960
<v Speaker 3>dataset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was with,</v>

1000
00:57:35.961 --> 00:57:38.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 25,000</v>

1001
00:57:38.001 --> 00:57:43.001
<v Speaker 3>college students who have been admitted </v>
<v Speaker 3>to my university over four years and I </v>

1002
00:57:44.091 --> 00:57:49.091
<v Speaker 3>got their admissions essays and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>essays are people's explaining why they </v>

1003
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:50.300
<v Speaker 3>want to come to the university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1004
00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:54.050
<v Speaker 3>how they have overcome a difficult time </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

1005
00:57:54.051 --> 00:57:57.940
<v Speaker 3>So each person wrote two essays and a,</v>

1006
00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:03.750
<v Speaker 3>we went through and started to do some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a general analysis of word.</v>

1007
00:58:03.751 --> 00:58:08.751
<v Speaker 3>You're focusing on these function worms </v>
<v Speaker 3>and found that there was a central </v>

1008
00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:12.591
<v Speaker 3>dimension to language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a fundamental dimension and </v>

1009
00:58:12.591 --> 00:58:16.110
<v Speaker 3>it's when I'm calling it is analytic </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus narrative thinking.</v>

1010
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.800
<v Speaker 3>People high on analytic thinking are </v>
<v Speaker 3>using high rates of articles and </v>

1011
00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.521
<v Speaker 3>prepositions at the other end of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension are people who are using high </v>

1012
00:58:25.521 --> 00:58:26.940
<v Speaker 3>rates of pronouns on zillow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reverbs,</v>

1013
00:58:26.941 --> 00:58:28.290
<v Speaker 3>conjunctions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiations,</v>

1014
00:58:28.291 --> 00:58:33.291
<v Speaker 3>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a coherent dimension and that any </v>

1015
00:58:33.291 --> 00:58:38.151
<v Speaker 3>texts is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be put along this continuum and in </v>

1016
00:58:38.151 --> 00:58:38.910
<v Speaker 3>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a fingerprint.</v>

1017
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:40.820
<v Speaker 3>People who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1018
00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:46.020
<v Speaker 3>use words at this level tend to do so in</v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

1019
00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:50.790
<v Speaker 3>in other emails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other emails or natural conversation,</v>

1020
00:58:50.791 --> 00:58:55.791
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So are the narrative people using </v>

1021
00:58:55.791 --> 00:58:55.791
<v Speaker 3>metaphors?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1022
00:58:55.791 --> 00:58:57.420
<v Speaker 3>they probably would have.</v>

1023
00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:00.710
<v Speaker 2>So tell me how you would tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

1024
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said before,</v>

1025
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:07.440
<v Speaker 3>before we get into metaphors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>metaphors are going to take us down a </v>

1026
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:07.440
<v Speaker 3>rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>

1027
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:07.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

1028
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.230
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before we fall down the hole,</v>

1029
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:11.140
<v Speaker 3>let me just point out this analytic </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>

1030
00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:16.141
<v Speaker 3>What's so cool about it is we were able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to track these students grades over the </v>

1031
00:59:16.141 --> 00:59:19.681
<v Speaker 3>next four years of college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the higher they were on analytic </v>

1032
00:59:19.681 --> 00:59:21.130
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better they did in college.</v>

1033
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.570
<v Speaker 3>And in terms of grades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was correlated about point two.</v>

1034
00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:28.610
<v Speaker 3>And it didn't matter if they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>physics majors or fine art majors,</v>

1035
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.700
<v Speaker 3>if they were in engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology,</v>

1036
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

1037
00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social work that this,</v>

1038
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:41.110
<v Speaker 3>you could take this to the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more analytical person is in their </v>

1039
00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:42.110
<v Speaker 3>essay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better they do in college.</v>

1040
00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:45.500
<v Speaker 3>And part of it is as colleges based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on analytic thinking.</v>

1041
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.440
<v Speaker 3>But it's also correlated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

1042
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.720
<v Speaker 3>It's correlated with sat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1043
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably about point three,</v>

1044
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:55.560
<v Speaker 3>point three five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1045
00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:57.490
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1046
00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.120
<v Speaker 3>It's really quite striking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting is,</v>

1047
01:00:00.121 --> 01:00:05.121
<v Speaker 3>is that we can now use this as kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>remote sensor to get a sense of how </v>

1048
01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:08.180
<v Speaker 3>smart somebody is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for analyzing,</v>

1049
01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.150
<v Speaker 3>you're a dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dangerous man.</v>

1050
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.660
<v Speaker 3>Parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1051
01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:17.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's another one that we've been </v>

1052
01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.180
<v Speaker 3>playing with many other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been doing a lot of work on author</v>

1053
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 3>identification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we published a cool article,</v>

1054
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 3>one of my graduate students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ryan Boyd,</v>

1055
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.180
<v Speaker 3>and I've been focusing on last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1056
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:33.210
<v Speaker 3>last play or a play that was attributed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to shakespeare with people didn't know </v>

1057
01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:35.630
<v Speaker 3>if it was or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were able to do some really smart</v>

1058
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:39.740
<v Speaker 3>analysis showing pretty clearly that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was written by shakespeare,</v>

1059
01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:42.350
<v Speaker 3>probably coauthored with another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Fletcher,</v>

1060
01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:47.830
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we looked at some other manuscripts </v>

1061
01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:50.130
<v Speaker 3>that have been called into question that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have come out of the 17th century it.</v>

1062
01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:54.440
<v Speaker 3>so we know we've been taking this work </v>
<v Speaker 3>in all of these different directions.</v>

1063
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1064
01:00:56.371 --> 01:01:01.371
<v Speaker 2>So let's close thIs off by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you tell us something about </v>

1065
01:01:01.371 --> 01:01:02.700
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>revamping,</v>

1066
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:07.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate education at the </v>

1067
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:09.801
<v Speaker 2>university of Texas and what you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what your aims are and also why it was </v>

1068
01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:10.230
<v Speaker 2>that you were.</v>

1069
01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all gets into my analysis of </v>

1070
01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:22.211
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing all of this work trying to </v>

1071
01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:24.320
<v Speaker 3>understand could I get a say a group of </v>
<v Speaker 3>initially to people,</v>

1072
01:01:24.321 --> 01:01:29.321
<v Speaker 3>but then it's been five people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact with one another on the </v>

1073
01:01:29.321 --> 01:01:33.641
<v Speaker 3>computer and if so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I track how they are interacting </v>

1074
01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:39.581
<v Speaker 3>with each other and get a sense of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>the group was working and working with </v>

1075
01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:45.071
<v Speaker 3>some computer scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were able to come up with a really </v>

1076
01:01:45.071 --> 01:01:45.830
<v Speaker 3>slick program to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it occurred to me,</v>

1077
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:50.831
<v Speaker 3>would it be interesting to do that in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>large class because I taught a large </v>

1078
01:01:50.831 --> 01:01:52.070
<v Speaker 3>introductory psychology class with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>colleague of mine,</v>

1079
01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:56.000
<v Speaker 3>sam gosling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had 500 students in the class.</v>

1080
01:01:56.001 --> 01:02:01.001
<v Speaker 3>We had them bring a laptop to class one </v>
<v Speaker 3>day and we were able to break the class </v>

1081
01:02:01.161 --> 01:02:03.290
<v Speaker 3>into small groups of five each.</v>

1082
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:08.890
<v Speaker 3>They could interact with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we were able to track how they were </v>

1083
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:14.590
<v Speaker 3>interacting and we get feedback to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>group trying to get the group to work </v>

1084
01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:19.241
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we using this style matching and we </v>

1085
01:02:19.241 --> 01:02:21.491
<v Speaker 3>can tell people whether or not people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the members of the group were paying </v>

1086
01:02:21.491 --> 01:02:23.580
<v Speaker 3>attention attention to each other or </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone was talking too much.</v>

1087
01:02:23.581 --> 01:02:26.400
<v Speaker 3>We could ask him to not talk so much and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so forth,</v>

1088
01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:32.540
<v Speaker 3>and it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next semester we realized we could </v>

1089
01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:38.151
<v Speaker 3>use this idea and revamp the class from </v>
<v Speaker 3>top to bottom where we got rid of the </v>

1090
01:02:38.461 --> 01:02:40.770
<v Speaker 3>textbook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all readings were online.</v>

1091
01:02:40.771 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 3>We'd have a quiz at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 3>every class.</v>

1092
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:48.330
<v Speaker 3>We would have break the class into </v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions more frequently.</v>

1093
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Another word started to rethink the </v>
<v Speaker 3>class from top to bottom,</v>

1094
01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:54.990
<v Speaker 3>and then we moved it into an online </v>
<v Speaker 3>class so that we,</v>

1095
01:02:55.050 --> 01:03:00.050
<v Speaker 3>we were able to broadcast out and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>switched the format of the class.</v>

1096
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:03.870
<v Speaker 3>It was like a tv show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we were behind a desk,</v>

1097
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:08.700
<v Speaker 3>we'd have fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have at least one of us would be in</v>

1098
01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:10.640
<v Speaker 3>front of the green screen and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

1099
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:15.990
<v Speaker 3>the place it used to be able to use to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what I meant.</v>

1100
01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:19.740
<v Speaker 3>But I know as soon as I said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized I can't use that anymore,</v>

1101
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:23.010
<v Speaker 3>but this idea of one of us would be on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1102
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:23.630
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1103
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:27.060
<v Speaker 3>in front of a scene somewhere on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1104
01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:28.150
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1105
01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else?</v>

1106
01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:30.960
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

1107
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:32.550
<v Speaker 3>sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are you?</v>

1108
01:03:32.551 --> 01:03:37.551
<v Speaker 3>It looks like you are in a balloon today</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it looks like he's in a balloon </v>

1109
01:03:37.621 --> 01:03:39.450
<v Speaker 3>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In any case,</v>

1110
01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 3>the point was we turned this into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>television show and it,</v>

1111
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.590
<v Speaker 3>what we found was that by broadcasting </v>
<v Speaker 3>this out to the 1500 students,</v>

1112
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:55.130
<v Speaker 3>we sent it up because there was testing </v>
<v Speaker 3>every day that students were in class </v>

1113
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:59.730
<v Speaker 3>every day they were focusing more on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>materials,</v>

1114
01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:04.970
<v Speaker 3>they were more engaged and it turns out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that their average performance went up </v>

1115
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:08.550
<v Speaker 3>compared to when we taught it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past and more impressively,</v>

1116
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:13.650
<v Speaker 3>we people who took our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our online class did better in the other</v>

1117
01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:18.651
<v Speaker 3>classes they were taking that semester </v>
<v Speaker 3>class and the classes they took the </v>

1118
01:04:18.651 --> 01:04:23.311
<v Speaker 3>semester afterwards and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't huge.</v>

1119
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:29.060
<v Speaker 3>It was like a difference between a three</v>
<v Speaker 3>point one versus a three point two five.</v>

1120
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:36.830
<v Speaker 3>And we reduced the disparity between </v>
<v Speaker 3>upper middle and lower middle class </v>

1121
01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:40.821
<v Speaker 3>students in terms of their performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that historically we found one letter</v>

1122
01:04:40.861 --> 01:04:44.700
<v Speaker 3>grade between the upper middle and lower</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle class students and now and now we</v>

1123
01:04:44.701 --> 01:04:46.700
<v Speaker 3>had reduced it to point four letter </v>
<v Speaker 3>grade.</v>

1124
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.420
<v Speaker 3>That's what was happening with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the future authoring program.</v>

1125
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:53.610
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

1126
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:58.700
<v Speaker 3>And we heard that differential effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1127
01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:01.630
<v Speaker 3>on the lower performing students.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1128
01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:06.540
<v Speaker 3>it turns out we came across some </v>
<v Speaker 3>previous research that had found similar</v>

1129
01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:10.290
<v Speaker 3>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it deals with frequent testing.</v>

1130
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:15.710
<v Speaker 3>The idea is kids who come from lower </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle class backgrounds by and large </v>

1131
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:18.490
<v Speaker 3>went to crappy high schools and in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>high schools,</v>

1132
01:05:18.491 --> 01:05:19.600
<v Speaker 3>these were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1133
01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:21.780
<v Speaker 3>our kids are all smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're are always.</v>

1134
01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Most of them are the top seven percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their high school class.</v>

1135
01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:27.160
<v Speaker 3>But if they were at a crappy high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

1136
01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.880
<v Speaker 3>they learned to get by by memorizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the tests were memorization </v>

1137
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.651
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these kids were great at </v>

1138
01:05:37.651 --> 01:05:39.181
<v Speaker 3>memorizing and then they come to a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>university where you're not tested on </v>

1139
01:05:39.181 --> 01:05:39.850
<v Speaker 3>memorization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to think conceptually.</v>

1140
01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And historically when we taught those </v>

1141
01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:45.110
<v Speaker 3>classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the classes,</v>

1142
01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:48.700
<v Speaker 3>we had the usual three or four tests </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the course of the semester,</v>

1143
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:54.660
<v Speaker 3>I would always get students in my office</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking in after the first test saying I</v>

1144
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 3>have never made a b in my life and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just failed your first test.</v>

1145
01:05:57.881 --> 01:05:59.980
<v Speaker 3>That's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is this even possible?</v>

1146
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:05.040
<v Speaker 3>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you study while I had </v>

1147
01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.040
<v Speaker 3>flashcards?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this,</v>

1148
01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.540
<v Speaker 3>I memorized this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

1149
01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.980
<v Speaker 3>I told you memorization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it work?</v>

1150
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:14.010
<v Speaker 3>You have to think conceptually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that doesn't mean anything to these </v>

1151
01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:17.791
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now you've got a test every day and </v>

1152
01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:19.000
<v Speaker 3>you fail that first test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pow,</v>

1153
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:21.970
<v Speaker 3>you fail the second test power and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden you're realizing,</v>

1154
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:27.330
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's treated with memorizing doesn't </v>

1155
01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:27.330
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1156
01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think what's happening is that </v>

1157
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:30.770
<v Speaker 2>they're learning that memorization </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work faster.</v>

1158
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:33.470
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really funny.</v>

1159
01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.600
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they use these skills in their other</v>

1160
01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:39.720
<v Speaker 3>classes because they realized </v>
<v Speaker 3>memorization is not working in the other</v>

1161
01:06:39.721 --> 01:06:40.530
<v Speaker 3>classes either.</v>

1162
01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:42.530
<v Speaker 2>So how do they catch onto the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1163
01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:44.780
<v Speaker 2>so now they know that memorization </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>

1164
01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>How do they figure out what does work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1165
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:51.530
<v Speaker 3>it's been interesting moving to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>online world.</v>

1166
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:56.710
<v Speaker 3>We create all of these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically there's a video on how </v>

1167
01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:00.851
<v Speaker 3>to take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to study and there's another video </v>

1168
01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:01.970
<v Speaker 3>on how to take a test and another video </v>
<v Speaker 3>on um,</v>

1169
01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you managed your time?</v>

1170
01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.830
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we,</v>

1171
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:11.950
<v Speaker 3>we understand the problem a lot better </v>
<v Speaker 3>than we did before and so students are </v>

1172
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:14.720
<v Speaker 3>taking advantage of these resources and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up doing better.</v>

1173
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

1174
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.870
<v Speaker 2>So how long have you been doing now?</v>

1175
01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:24.980
<v Speaker 3>So after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we started the class the first year </v>

1176
01:07:25.861 --> 01:07:30.861
<v Speaker 3>in 2011 and then in the years afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started talking to people at the </v>

1177
01:07:33.871 --> 01:07:35.970
<v Speaker 3>university of Texas and elsewhere about </v>
<v Speaker 3>kennedy,</v>

1178
01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.400
<v Speaker 3>the big picture of education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

1179
01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.370
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are we doing in education </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now?</v>

1180
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world has changed.</v>

1181
01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:45.230
<v Speaker 2>I've been asking myself,</v>

1182
01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1183
01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:49.100
<v Speaker 3>but the world's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we have three hour courses?</v>

1184
01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.200
<v Speaker 3>There's no logic for a three hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>course.</v>

1185
01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Why do we have a semester that goes from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 1st of January to sometime in may.</v>

1186
01:07:55.550 --> 01:07:58.610
<v Speaker 3>There's no reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we have a half hour course?</v>

1187
01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:02.090
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we have a seminar course?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1188
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:05.180
<v Speaker 3>why do we put things together with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way we do?</v>

1189
01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:09.830
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out there's really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons because in the early 19 hundreds</v>

1190
01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:15.020
<v Speaker 3>when you need it in a standardized way </v>
<v Speaker 3>of talking about credit and so forth,</v>

1191
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:21.280
<v Speaker 3>and then we built computers to program </v>
<v Speaker 3>this in and we built buildings that we </v>

1192
01:08:21.921 --> 01:08:26.921
<v Speaker 3>knew how to use time and space and </v>
<v Speaker 3>location and and so that your computer </v>

1193
01:08:29.691 --> 01:08:34.691
<v Speaker 3>will tell you this class is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>meet in this room at this time and your </v>

1194
01:08:34.691 --> 01:08:36.020
<v Speaker 3>final exam will be at this place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this place.</v>

1195
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.120
<v Speaker 3>We don't need all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1196
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:43.121
<v Speaker 3>that's analogous to the conservation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a physical structure and evolution.</v>

1197
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.640
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we don't.</v>

1198
01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:50.540
<v Speaker 3>And and what's interesting is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university of Texas computer,</v>

1199
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 3>the read that the registrar uses can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have make a half hour course.</v>

1200
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:57.260
<v Speaker 3>It can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't change the semester.</v>

1201
01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:01.520
<v Speaker 3>It can't do any of these things at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern student information system.</v>

1202
01:09:01.521 --> 01:09:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Computer costs an unbelievable amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

1203
01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:10.631
<v Speaker 3>And so what I'm doing is I am working </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the university and the entire </v>

1204
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:14.390
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure to start to rethink </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1205
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:18.200
<v Speaker 3>What should be the curriculum?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need all these required courses</v>

1206
01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:20.420
<v Speaker 3>that we used to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense,</v>

1207
01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:25.650
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of our requirements made a lot of </v>

1208
01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:27.380
<v Speaker 3>states 50 years ago and a lot of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes were flushed out classes.</v>

1209
01:09:27.381 --> 01:09:32.381
<v Speaker 3>We don't need flunk out clAsses anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we can come up with with really </v>

1210
01:09:32.381 --> 01:09:35.720
<v Speaker 3>brief classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half our classes to learn a basic skill.</v>

1211
01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.630
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a requirement.</v>

1212
01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a statistics course to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take upper division psychology classes.</v>

1213
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Do you really need the statistics score </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well?</v>

1214
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Most of it you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if I asked my people teaching </v>

1215
01:09:50.530 --> 01:09:50.530
<v Speaker 3>statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking them,</v>

1216
01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:54.860
<v Speaker 3>do the statistics you're teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they relevant to today?</v>

1217
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 3>And they all say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

1218
01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.640
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't use analysis of variance.</v>

1219
01:09:58.641 --> 01:10:01.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't use t tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use linear regression.</v>

1220
01:10:01.191 --> 01:10:02.630
<v Speaker 3>I use this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use that,</v>

1221
01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but we can't teach that in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My view is if you're going to take my </v>

1222
01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.681
<v Speaker 3>upper division class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better know correlations and you </v>

1223
01:10:11.681 --> 01:10:14.360
<v Speaker 3>kinda know correlations up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could teach a correlation.</v>

1224
01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:19.490
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a point seven our corps </v>

1225
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:22.360
<v Speaker 3>and download it and take it anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care where you take.</v>

1226
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1227
01:10:22.971 --> 01:10:26.060
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been using youtube a lot for</v>

1228
01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:27.370
<v Speaker 2>the last three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1229
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:32.390
<v Speaker 2>when I put started putting my lectures </v>
<v Speaker 2>online just just with an ipad,</v>

1230
01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:35.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1231
01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.780
<v Speaker 2>and by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the beginning of 2016,</v>

1232
01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I've collected about a million views and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

1233
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:44.080
<v Speaker 4>oh</v>

1234
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:49.470
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different thing than I </v>

1235
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:52.511
<v Speaker 2>thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought youtube was for cute cat </v>

1236
01:10:52.511 --> 01:10:54.541
<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started thinking it through </v>

1237
01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:54.541
<v Speaker 2>what I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1238
01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:57.691
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the situation map for the first </v>

1239
01:10:57.691 --> 01:11:00.991
<v Speaker 2>time in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spoken word has as much staying </v>

1240
01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:05.341
<v Speaker 2>power and reach as books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No more reach you could publish faster </v>

1241
01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.700
<v Speaker 2>and it can be broken up and communicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of chunks.</v>

1242
01:11:09.701 --> 01:11:12.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is absolutely revolutionary.</v>

1243
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:16.590
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that while you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>race against time,</v>

1244
01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right because this is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>new world order and it's,</v>

1245
01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:26.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like every other part of our world </v>

1246
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:29.301
<v Speaker 3>right now where we're dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future of ai and the future of,</v>

1247
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.980
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of everything that this really messes </v>

1248
01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:40.521
<v Speaker 3>with the world order because so much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we can teach can be put up there </v>

1249
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.450
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1250
01:11:42.451 --> 01:11:47.451
<v Speaker 3>because the correlations haven't changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hell of a lot in the last hundred </v>

1251
01:11:47.451 --> 01:11:48.480
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need to update your lecture on</v>

1252
01:11:48.481 --> 01:11:49.840
<v Speaker 3>correlations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1253
01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 2>One really good lecture on correlations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more $10,000.</v>

1254
01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:59.140
<v Speaker 2>That's also very frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

1255
01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.150
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then</v>

1256
01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.580
<v Speaker 3>we do need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1257
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:04.570
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1258
01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:09.571
<v Speaker 3>we're talking now 15th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do need a guild mentality.</v>

1259
01:12:09.581 --> 01:12:14.380
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to become a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a scientist or this or that,</v>

1260
01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:17.530
<v Speaker 3>you need to have some serious lack of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

1261
01:12:17.531 --> 01:12:22.330
<v Speaker 3>You need to have some serious experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing things in addition to learning how</v>

1262
01:12:22.331 --> 01:12:27.310
<v Speaker 3>to think and to get some smart feedback </v>
<v Speaker 3>on how to think,</v>

1263
01:12:27.311 --> 01:12:32.311
<v Speaker 3>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to come up to get up to the level to</v>

1264
01:12:33.341 --> 01:12:38.150
<v Speaker 3>understand what's involved in trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a new size to make new advances.</v>

1265
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:43.450
<v Speaker 3>It's an incredibly exciting time and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>working with all parts of the </v>

1266
01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:46.840
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have 200 people working with me.</v>

1267
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:49.270
<v Speaker 3>I've got various,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1268
01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:51.370
<v Speaker 3>we were dealing with a development </v>
<v Speaker 3>studio,</v>

1269
01:12:51.371 --> 01:12:54.910
<v Speaker 3>working on new ways of thinking of on </v>
<v Speaker 3>online and other technologies.</v>

1270
01:12:54.911 --> 01:12:58.990
<v Speaker 3>I've got a big research methods group </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find out what even works.</v>

1271
01:12:58.991 --> 01:13:01.120
<v Speaker 3>We don't even know what works and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't.</v>

1272
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:06.510
<v Speaker 3>We're having to deal with extended </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus in terms of how we can push out </v>

1273
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.860
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

1274
01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:11.980
<v Speaker 3>our classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our information to the world in a way </v>

1275
01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:14.560
<v Speaker 3>that has some kind of financial value to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the university.</v>

1276
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.310
<v Speaker 3>So we in this office</v>

1277
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:23.450
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you guys been thinking about </v>

1278
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.450
<v Speaker 2>accreditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it seems to me that the business</v>

1279
01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:28.620
<v Speaker 2>is the big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is is the ability to </v>

1280
01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.900
<v Speaker 2>disseminate valuable information was </v>
<v Speaker 2>once the university.</v>

1281
01:13:32.901 --> 01:13:34.700
<v Speaker 2>In some sense how to hammer lock on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1282
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:38.890
<v Speaker 2>That's gone no more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that the.</v>

1283
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:44.060
<v Speaker 2>The impediment to mass education at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment in some sense is the problem of </v>

1284
01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:48.940
<v Speaker 2>mass accreditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Universities still have a hammer </v>

1285
01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:49.790
<v Speaker 2>marketing out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no reason that they need to.</v>

1286
01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:55.210
<v Speaker 2>So I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're thinking about the mass </v>

1287
01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:56.060
<v Speaker 2>distribution of education material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what have you been thinking about?</v>

1288
01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.480
<v Speaker 3>The problems and the complexity is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>are unbelievable,</v>

1289
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:08.481
<v Speaker 3>so some of it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nationwide bureaucracy,</v>

1290
01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:14.211
<v Speaker 3>so there are accrediting agencies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't know how to use deal with </v>

1291
01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:19.291
<v Speaker 3>fractional credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know how to deal with a variable </v>

1292
01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:21.661
<v Speaker 3>calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got financial aid issues because </v>

1293
01:14:21.661 --> 01:14:22.540
<v Speaker 3>they're based on these old systems as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1294
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.840
<v Speaker 3>We're dealing with intellectual property</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of who owns the ip of a class,</v>

1295
01:14:28.481 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 3>is it the instructors at the university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can university resell it?</v>

1296
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.050
<v Speaker 3>How do we rethink this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1297
01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:38.080
<v Speaker 3>the idea of having free open classes is </v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

1298
01:14:38.081 --> 01:14:43.081
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a very good business model </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this has been one of the problems </v>

1299
01:14:43.081 --> 01:14:45.991
<v Speaker 3>with coursera and edx and you're putting</v>
<v Speaker 3>your videos on online for free because </v>

1300
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.600
<v Speaker 3>the reality is the costume</v>

1301
01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.480
<v Speaker 2>patrion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1302
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know about patriotism?</v>

1303
01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:57.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does really interesting.</v>

1304
01:14:57.231 --> 01:14:58.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a platform that,</v>

1305
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:59.150
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1306
01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:04.300
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was developed because of the </v>

1307
01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.180
<v Speaker 2>difficulties that creative people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>having and monetizing their production.</v>

1308
01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:11.170
<v Speaker 2>And so with patrion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can voluntarily buy a monthly </v>

1309
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:15.431
<v Speaker 2>subscription if they find that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>content that you're producing is worth </v>

1310
01:15:15.431 --> 01:15:19.871
<v Speaker 2>supporting [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can donate monthly to your </v>

1311
01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:23.951
<v Speaker 2>patriot on account and they can either </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that on a monthly basis or they can </v>

1312
01:15:23.951 --> 01:15:26.870
<v Speaker 2>pay you a donation per video that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>put up.</v>

1313
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:32.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's been a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought with my youtube content </v>

1314
01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:36.311
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted to professionalize what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing to some degree to hire a </v>

1315
01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:36.311
<v Speaker 2>film crew and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to increase,</v>

1316
01:15:36.311 --> 01:15:39.930
<v Speaker 2>improve the audio and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I threw up a.</v>

1317
01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:45.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm a patriot account online last april </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I found out about the technology.</v>

1318
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.640
<v Speaker 2>just a curiosity and I got about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1319
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.570
<v Speaker 2>60 or 70 people subscribing in the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>

1320
01:15:53.571 --> 01:15:58.571
<v Speaker 2>so that was kind of interesting and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>enabled me to hire a film crew and that </v>

1321
01:15:59.361 --> 01:16:04.361
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's quite interesting because the </v>

1322
01:16:04.361 --> 01:16:04.880
<v Speaker 2>patriot on people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there's some perks they get,</v>

1323
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:06.430
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higher donors,</v>

1324
01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:09.320
<v Speaker 2>a signed copy of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of one of my books for example,</v>

1325
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:13.790
<v Speaker 2>but mostly they don't get access to any </v>
<v Speaker 2>content that everyone doesn't get access</v>

1326
01:16:13.791 --> 01:16:14.660
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people,</v>

1327
01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:20.080
<v Speaker 2>people have a strong sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reciprocity and they're not completely </v>

1328
01:16:20.241 --> 01:16:22.850
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with the idea of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>something for nothing.</v>

1329
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.540
<v Speaker 2>And now the patriot on account is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily useful.</v>

1330
01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:26.990
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1331
01:16:26.991 --> 01:16:27.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

1332
01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:28.970
<v Speaker 3>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1333
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.910
<v Speaker 3>we'll do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

1334
01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:38.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these are issues that we're </v>

1335
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:39.921
<v Speaker 3>struggling with at the university in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of how do we do it because to do </v>

1336
01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:45.330
<v Speaker 3>one of our courses is really quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive and you know,</v>

1337
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:46.140
<v Speaker 3>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1338
01:16:46.141 --> 01:16:46.830
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

1339
01:16:46.831 --> 01:16:51.831
<v Speaker 3>$30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying to figure out the model for </v>

1340
01:16:52.111 --> 01:16:57.111
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one thing that we can do is we can </v>

1341
01:16:57.111 --> 01:16:57.111
<v Speaker 3>give university credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>

1342
01:16:57.111 --> 01:16:57.990
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one,</v>

1343
01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.900
<v Speaker 3>that's one hold that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

1344
01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:04.350
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really does deal with a broader issue</v>

1345
01:17:04.351 --> 01:17:09.351
<v Speaker 3>and in our society which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is knowing the and knowing that and </v>

1346
01:17:10.941 --> 01:17:15.941
<v Speaker 3>knowing how to think sufficient to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>by in the real world or do you need the </v>

1347
01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:20.951
<v Speaker 3>official credential and hopefully we </v>
<v Speaker 3>both yes or no.</v>

1348
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:30.250
<v Speaker 3>If it was a just world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just knowing the material would be </v>

1349
01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:34.340
<v Speaker 3>sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you no rapid way of telling the</v>

1350
01:17:34.341 --> 01:17:35.160
<v Speaker 3>charlatans from.</v>

1351
01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:36.580
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

1352
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:41.650
<v Speaker 3>that's the big issue and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big issue is that as the </v>

1353
01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:46.481
<v Speaker 3>credential becomes more important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge becomes less important </v>

1354
01:17:46.481 --> 01:17:47.890
<v Speaker 3>because you can use that credential to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1355
01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.790
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to play the system.</v>

1356
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:51.800
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

1357
01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:55.720
<v Speaker 3>So these are the kinds of things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've been dealing with and I,</v>

1358
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to change a giant bureaucracy,</v>

1359
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:04.840
<v Speaker 3>turns out it's not real easy and it has </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these built in assumptions that,</v>

1360
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:11.470
<v Speaker 3>that are part of the structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only not only part of the cognitive </v>

1361
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:15.040
<v Speaker 3>apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually built right into the </v>

1362
01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:15.040
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right,</v>

1363
01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.900
<v Speaker 3>and what I've found is the people at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>university had been very supportive.</v>

1364
01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:21.050
<v Speaker 3>I thought for sure I would run into </v>
<v Speaker 3>major obstacles,</v>

1365
01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.300
<v Speaker 3>faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>

1366
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:25.400
<v Speaker 3>administrators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the legislators,</v>

1367
01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:30.401
<v Speaker 3>because this is a public university are </v>
<v Speaker 3>all really supportive and even though </v>

1368
01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:35.321
<v Speaker 3>I've got support all around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still just like swimming through </v>

1369
01:18:35.321 --> 01:18:40.121
<v Speaker 3>molasses because they're all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules and regulations that had been </v>

1370
01:18:40.121 --> 01:18:42.980
<v Speaker 3>there sometimes for a hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's no longer serve a purpose.</v>

1371
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1372
01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you know,</v>

1373
01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:50.051
<v Speaker 3>maybe you don't know about the typical </v>
<v Speaker 3>fortune 500 company over the last 30 </v>

1374
01:18:50.051 --> 01:18:53.270
<v Speaker 3>years and the typical family fortune </v>
<v Speaker 3>three generations.</v>

1375
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:59.470
<v Speaker 3>It's for the reasons that you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>described is what happens is that the </v>

1376
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:04.400
<v Speaker 3>structure itself becomes so </v>
<v Speaker 3>anachronistic that not even the people </v>

1377
01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.021
<v Speaker 3>within it can change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>something comes along that's that's </v>

1378
01:19:08.021 --> 01:19:12.250
<v Speaker 3>younger and it's built on different </v>
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions and just takes it out </v>

1379
01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:13.970
<v Speaker 3>and the probability that that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen to the universities,</v>

1380
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is overwhelmingly high because of </v>

1381
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:19.640
<v Speaker 3>exactly the sorts of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>described.</v>

1382
01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:24.660
<v Speaker 3>It's structural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's built for a different century from </v>

1383
01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:29.850
<v Speaker 3>the late 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it is and actually if you think </v>

1384
01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:34.571
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>university started in the 14 hundreds </v>

1385
01:19:34.571 --> 01:19:36.880
<v Speaker 3>and it's amazing that they have survived</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well as they have.</v>

1386
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:38.690
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

1387
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really good talking to you.</v>

1388
01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I've enjoyed as much though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd been a great admirer of your </v>

1389
01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.440
<v Speaker 3>research and I don't say that lightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because.</v>

1390
01:19:48.441 --> 01:19:49.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

1391
01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:54.340
<v Speaker 3>There's a handful of psychologists that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have had a profound effect on me and </v>

1392
01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.701
<v Speaker 3>you're certainly one of them and I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>also say you're a spectacular rarity </v>

1393
01:19:57.701 --> 01:19:58.710
<v Speaker 3>among social psychologists in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>estimate.</v>

1394
01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.710
<v Speaker 3>I know that's a nasty thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but being partly a social psychologist,</v>

1395
01:20:03.711 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm allowed to say it to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you again at some</v>

1396
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.980
<v Speaker 2>point in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe six months down the road or </v>

1397
01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.441
<v Speaker 2>something because you have all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that people need to know about </v>

1398
01:20:15.441 --> 01:20:16.830
<v Speaker 2>and this is a really good way of telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>people about them,</v>

1399
01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:22.340
<v Speaker 2>so I'll email you and get some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could think of three or four </v>

1400
01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:24.240
<v Speaker 2>links and a little description that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd like to go along with them,</v>

1401
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.720
<v Speaker 2>put them on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in the description of the </v>

1402
01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.581
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you when both the podcast and </v>

1403
01:20:31.581 --> 01:20:32.130
<v Speaker 2>the video will be up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that will be very soon.</v>

1404
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Send me an email and I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll do that.</v>

1405
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very nice talking with you.</v>

1406
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Nice talking with you as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks so much.</v>

1407
01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bye.</v>

1408
01:20:41.851 --> 01:20:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>
