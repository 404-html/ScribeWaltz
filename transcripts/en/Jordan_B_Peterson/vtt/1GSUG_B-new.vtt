00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of you who are out there,</v>

2
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can just send me a quick text </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell me if this is working.</v>

3
00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.741
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

4
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:00.574
<v Speaker 1>Can you hear me</v>

5
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Mad Matt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work at Mars in Toronto.</v>

6
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>Can you share your thoughts and why it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't worked?</v>

7
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated question.</v>

8
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Let's get to that a little bit later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys can hear me.</v>

9
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>

10
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.623
<v Speaker 1>So this is what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you first about </v>

11
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy and then I'm going to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>some questions that people have said.</v>

12
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:25.364
<v Speaker 1>I've got this new thing called a pigeon </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole and that's enabled people to vote </v>

13
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>up questions and then I'm also going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take some of the questions that are on,</v>

14
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>that are streaming in so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hopefully that'll all work.</v>

16
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>See if I'm in focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not too bad.</v>

17
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>

18
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:48.134
<v Speaker 1>Consider the overwhelming success of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patriot and counted the money raised by </v>

19
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:51.584
<v Speaker 1>rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will you be doing with their </v>

20
00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 1>contributions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's great.</v>

21
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.973
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've got a couple of things to say </v>

22
00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:57.614
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

23
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So the first one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I would say a number of people have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt and not an overwhelming number,</v>

25
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:05.864
<v Speaker 1>but a number of people have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to take me to task for the </v>

26
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:12.770
<v Speaker 1>fact that my patriotic support has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it overwhelmingly successful.</v>

27
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.063
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I'll tell you how I formulate my </v>

28
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:18.224
<v Speaker 1>response to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is I'm generating almost all </v>

29
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:26.270
<v Speaker 1>of my content and making it completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly accessible so it's free,</v>

30
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

31
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.823
<v Speaker 1>and so that way I'm bringing I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness of psychological issues to a </v>

32
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:35.720
<v Speaker 1>very large number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so far at the moment,</v>

33
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.700
<v Speaker 1>my view count on Youtube is up to 13 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million and I've did,</v>

34
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>did a little bit of calculations last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week to try to figure out what the total</v>

35
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>view count was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.603
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the cuts of my lectures that have </v>

37
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>been appearing on youtube and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political material as well.</v>

38
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:52.634
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's upward of 50 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm making psychological and </v>

39
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 1>political content available to 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>

40
00:02:58.521 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

42
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 2>seems like a reasonable thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

43
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>people who don't agree with what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying might differ,</v>

44
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>but I think that could be separated from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the educational content as well.</v>

45
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.533
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then with regards to the Patriot on </v>

46
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.203
<v Speaker 2>subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single person who's doing that is </v>

47
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:15.904
<v Speaker 2>doing it entirely voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also set up that Patriot on </v>

48
00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 2>account long before any of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>political material emerged.</v>

49
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Speaker 2>So my sense with the patron viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you guys can clue me in if I'm wrong</v>

50
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:28.324
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's two things happening is </v>

51
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:30.904
<v Speaker 2>one is it enables people who are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>very happy about the current political </v>

52
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>situation in the west to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

53
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contribute to something that might be at</v>

54
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:42.994
<v Speaker 2>least to some degree attempting to stem </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tide of such things as toxic </v>

55
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:47.194
<v Speaker 2>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And second that it enables people to </v>

56
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:51.454
<v Speaker 2>support my endeavors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bring general education to a wider </v>

57
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:55.744
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seems like a good deal for </v>

58
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

59
00:03:58.151 --> 00:03:58.811
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

60
00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.644
<v Speaker 2>it's a particularly good deal for me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not complaining about </v>

61
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 2>what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would also point out that,</v>

62
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't exactly been a straight </v>

63
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>forward thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

64
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.193
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

65
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 2>so I guess if anyone else wants to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

66
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:19.450
<v Speaker 2>they're more than welcome to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now having said that,</v>

67
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.063
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would also say that the real issue </v>

68
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:24.424
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is the fact that this </v>

69
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:27.034
<v Speaker 2>isn't self evident is also a commentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the toxicity of our culture at the </v>

70
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it actually isn't the issue.</v>

71
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 2>The issue isn't really how much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have.</v>

72
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.413
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a resentful and at </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively vicious way of judging </v>

73
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:41.674
<v Speaker 2>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the issue is what you do with </v>

74
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 2>the money when you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

75
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a particularly hedonistic person</v>

76
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not 25 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

77
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm 55 years old and I'm going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandfather in a couple of months,</v>

78
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God for that.</v>

79
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I want to do with that money is</v>

80
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 2>to do the best things I can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of to do with it.</v>

81
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I'm thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

82
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I started this biblical series and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that's help,</v>

83
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.433
<v Speaker 2>thankful thanks to you guys on Patrion </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that enabled me to generate the </v>

84
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 2>capital that was necessary to rent the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theater because for 12 lectures,</v>

85
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 2>that was a $60,000 investment about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

86
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then another $8,000 for the,</v>

87
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>for the camera work.</v>

88
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.960
<v Speaker 2>And that had to be basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

89
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 2>dealt with upfront.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a reasonable financial risks.</v>

90
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.223
<v Speaker 2>Now I've been s crazily fortunate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the theater tickets have also sold </v>

91
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:35.074
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like the biblical series </v>

92
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 2>will pay for itself with some extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>leftover.</v>

93
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:39.131
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty happy about that because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives me some more working capital.</v>

95
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

96
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do with the capital?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

97
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to continue doing the sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I'm already doing.</v>

98
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to do a series on the hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest books of the western Canon,</v>

99
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:54.964
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to move genuine humanities </v>

100
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 2>education out of the universities where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't being taught anyways.</v>

101
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 2>As far as I can tell online where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>can access it freely.</v>

102
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.503
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to a wide variety of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now about trying to do that in a </v>

103
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:09.614
<v Speaker 2>more formal sense so that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility for widespread university </v>

104
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 2>education can be universally accessible.</v>

105
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.333
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>crack is the problem of how to teach </v>

106
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 2>people to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's a real troublesome thing.</v>

107
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 2>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go onto my website,</v>

109
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Jordan peterson.com and you go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>courses</v>

110
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 2>and you go into psychology for 30 if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>look carefully there,</v>

111
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:36.044
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that there's an essay rubric </v>
<v Speaker 2>that teeth that tells people how to </v>

112
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:39.194
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually that's become quite </v>

113
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:41.144
<v Speaker 2>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're interested in how to </v>

114
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:43.574
<v Speaker 2>learn to write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written something about that </v>

115
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:45.524
<v Speaker 2>already and we're going to make a piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>of software that's going to help people </v>

116
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:48.104
<v Speaker 2>learn to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've got plans for how to make </v>

117
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 2>writing education broadly accessible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

118
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 2>So I would like to make humanities </v>
<v Speaker 2>education of the highest order,</v>

119
00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:58.394
<v Speaker 2>broadly accessible to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also want to teach them how to </v>

120
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>

121
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to try to crack the online</v>
<v Speaker 2>university accreditation problem.</v>

122
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the money that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a substantial proportion of the money</v>

123
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 2>that is being donated to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

124
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 2>or is being offered to me by my monthly </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporters.</v>

125
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 2>So that's all of you people is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be going to projects exactly like that.</v>

126
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.593
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what the hell else would I do </v>

127
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 2>with the money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

128
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me money is a tool.</v>

129
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the means whereby you develop a</v>

130
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:34.400
<v Speaker 2>luxurious lifestyle and spend your time </v>
<v Speaker 2>burning yourself,</v>

131
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 2>have to death in the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Caribbean,</v>

132
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 2>snorting cocaine and chasing hookers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

133
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just not in the cards for me.</v>

134
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

135
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.083
<v Speaker 2>and so I want to devote it towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things that I've already been </v>

136
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 2>pursuing except on a broader scale.</v>

137
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think of people like Elon Musk to,</v>

138
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 2>not that I'm comparing myself to Elon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Musk,</v>

139
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he has plenty of money and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean you really,</v>

140
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.543
<v Speaker 2>somebody's got to have the damn money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might as well be people who have the </v>

141
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:02.084
<v Speaker 2>kind of vision that people like he does </v>
<v Speaker 2>have because maybe they'll do something </v>

142
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:05.744
<v Speaker 2>good for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I hope his gigafactories produce </v>

143
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:09.824
<v Speaker 2>batteries like mad so that we can start </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make alternative energy sources </v>

144
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:15.974
<v Speaker 2>economically viable and maybe reduce our</v>
<v Speaker 2>dependence on oil and maybe get </v>

145
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:21.550
<v Speaker 2>ourselves out from underneath the thumb </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Saudi Arabs.</v>

146
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 2>That would be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the monetary issue,</v>

147
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite interesting.</v>

148
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like it is not the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the money,</v>

149
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:30.250
<v Speaker 2>it's what you do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>

150
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.123
<v Speaker 2>those are some of my plants and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't all of them because I'm going to </v>

151
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:34.604
<v Speaker 2>come up with a bunch more plans and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to try to implement them as </v>

152
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 2>rapidly as I possibly can.</v>

153
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I've put my clinical practice on hiatus </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the next three months so that I have</v>

154
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:43.904
<v Speaker 2>a chance to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've requested that the university </v>

155
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:47.054
<v Speaker 2>advanced my sabbatical by one year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I should have about a year to think </v>

156
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 2>about what I should be doing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube and how I can be promoting broad</v>

157
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 2>scale public education of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>

158
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's a really fun problem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve.</v>

159
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.503
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that I'm being supported by</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of you people on Patrion makes the </v>

160
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:04.314
<v Speaker 2>probability that avail to that all be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to devote my time to that much </v>

161
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 2>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

162
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.873
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I'm going to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do the best things I can </v>

163
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 2>possibly think of to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

164
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 2>hopefully that'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so far it seems to be going well.</v>

165
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

166
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.753
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been taken aback back quite </v>

167
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 2>a bit by the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

168
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not surprising that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

169
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.780
<v Speaker 2>the people who've been trying to take me</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

170
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.623
<v Speaker 2>let's say are squawking and bitching </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I happened to be generating a </v>

171
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:35.184
<v Speaker 2>fairly reasonable income from this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I don't think about it as an </v>

172
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:38.880
<v Speaker 2>income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I already said,</v>

173
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:39.714
<v Speaker 2>I think about it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a toolkit for pursuing more </v>

174
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 2>interesting things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if that's the best they can do</v>

175
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 2>with regards to continuing to tarnish my</v>
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>

176
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 2>well then let them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them go right ahead about that.</v>

177
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:51.804
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the proof is in the outcome and </v>

178
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.183
<v Speaker 2>the biblical series and that's a direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of the Patriot and support </v>

179
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:00.900
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be going like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

180
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.063
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 500,000 people have watched the </v>

181
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 2>videos so far with another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

182
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:08.470
<v Speaker 2>tens of thousands of people listening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcasts.</v>

183
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.303
<v Speaker 2>And that's just a bloody miracle that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that many people would be interested in </v>

184
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.223
<v Speaker 2>what I consider the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation for any true humanities </v>

185
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So great.</v>

186
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:20.490
<v Speaker 2>We'll build from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

187
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm going to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

188
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if people don't like that,</v>

189
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 2>then they don't have to donate or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to subscribe.</v>

190
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 2>It's hardly like it's mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

191
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll stop with that and I'll get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another question or a question.</v>

192
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Another question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

193
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.483
<v Speaker 2>here's one that got 264 votes so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the belief in something more than </v>

194
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 2>experienced reality unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

195
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:48.984
<v Speaker 2>So I want to address that question </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically to begin to begin with </v>

196
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:52.374
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do when someone asks you a question </v>

197
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:55.314
<v Speaker 2>is that you want to take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question because the question boxes you </v>

198
00:10:57.961 --> 00:10:58.860
<v Speaker 2>in in a certain way.</v>

199
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 2>And if you're going to answer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>question you make,</v>

200
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.123
<v Speaker 2>you have to make sure that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly processed the structure of the </v>

201
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's look at this one.</v>

202
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Is the belief in something more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced reality unreasonable.</v>

203
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>And so then I'm going to go socratic on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and say,</v>

204
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:14.664
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what you mean by belief </v>

205
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:17.903
<v Speaker 2>experienced reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something more and unreasonable and and </v>

206
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.523
<v Speaker 2>see the problem is you can't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer a question like that unless you </v>

207
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 2>delve into the definitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say,</v>

208
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by experienced reality?</v>

209
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you mean that which is directly </v>
<v Speaker 2>grippable by the senses?</v>

210
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.030
<v Speaker 2>While then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well do you believe in numbers?</v>

211
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Because numbers aren't directly </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienceable,</v>

212
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.983
<v Speaker 2>but obviously they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you define reality as the use of </v>

213
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.040
<v Speaker 2>concepts that give you grip and power in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

214
00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:51.874
<v Speaker 2>And I think because I'm a pragmatist in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean part of the way that I define </v>

215
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:55.923
<v Speaker 2>something as real is whether or not it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has functional operative status in the </v>

216
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the belief in something more than</v>

217
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 2>experienced reality is obviously clearly</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>

218
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 2>If you regard abstractions as something </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than experienced reality.</v>

219
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.953
<v Speaker 2>And that brings up another issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the issue is whether or not </v>

220
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:15.640
<v Speaker 2>instructions or even more real than </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced reality.</v>

221
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 2>And I would say often they are because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise abstraction wouldn't work.</v>

222
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's definitely not unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you,</v>

223
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.183
<v Speaker 2>do you mean merely subjectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced reality or do you mean the </v>

224
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.140
<v Speaker 2>kind of reality that can be experienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>by multiple people at the same time?</v>

225
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.123
<v Speaker 2>Because that's also different that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ladder is more in the domain of </v>

226
00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:36.634
<v Speaker 2>scientific inquiry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the problem with belief in </v>

227
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:41.374
<v Speaker 2>subjectively experienced reality is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much that what you experience </v>

228
00:12:44.511 --> 00:12:47.830
<v Speaker 2>subjectively isn't real is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the categories wrong.</v>

229
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams are real,</v>

230
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:51.783
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the same kind of real as</v>
<v Speaker 2>things in the outside world that other </v>

231
00:12:54.881 --> 00:12:55.714
<v Speaker 2>people can experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to conflate the two or to failure </v>

232
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.560
<v Speaker 2>fail to distinguish between them as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>form of insanity.</v>

233
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that both of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't real.</v>

234
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

235
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.653
<v Speaker 2>so the simple answer to the question is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the belief is the belief in something </v>

236
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 2>more than experienced reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unreasonable is no,</v>

237
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.333
<v Speaker 2>but it depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on your specific definitions </v>

238
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 2>of all those terms and those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things really matter.</v>

239
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bet.</v>

240
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.003
<v Speaker 2>Bob Asbury says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a 58 year old American redneck who </v>

241
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Speaker 2>never went to college a day in his life.</v>

242
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

243
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.060
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like I'm getting a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>class education every day.</v>

244
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson.</v>

245
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.480
<v Speaker 2>You are very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well thank you.</v>

246
00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how cool I am exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am.</v>

247
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.630
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

248
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.750
<v Speaker 2>and this is the dead truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am absolutely thrilled that I have the</v>

249
00:13:45.721 --> 00:13:50.721
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to provide educational </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources to people all over the world.</v>

250
00:13:50.761 --> 00:13:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

251
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.610
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

252
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:54.563
<v Speaker 2>it's an absolute privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I get letters from people like </v>

253
00:13:57.361 --> 00:14:00.060
<v Speaker 2>you very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very frequently from all over the world,</v>

254
00:14:00.061 --> 00:14:00.894
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one the fact that now we have the </v>

255
00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:03.144
<v Speaker 2>technology to allow people in principle </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a world class university </v>

256
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:08.334
<v Speaker 2>education is mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's something I think is </v>

257
00:14:11.011 --> 00:14:11.844
<v Speaker 2>absolutely comical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd been pursuing this with a group </v>

258
00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.290
<v Speaker 2>of people that I've been discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

259
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.273
<v Speaker 2>I've been having intense discussions </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some in Silicon Valley and some in </v>

260
00:14:19.651 --> 00:14:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some,</v>

261
00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:21.990
<v Speaker 2>in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

262
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.560
<v Speaker 2>the f here's the university situation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways.</v>

263
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.173
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're putting students in debt in a </v>

264
00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:33.090
<v Speaker 2>tremendous way in the United States over</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of overpriced education.</v>

265
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.740
<v Speaker 2>They don't let the students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

266
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.490
<v Speaker 2>declared bankruptcy because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doubt.</v>

267
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.423
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

268
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 2>And so it's basically indentured </v>
<v Speaker 2>servitude.</v>

269
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.493
<v Speaker 2>And so then students come out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>university and death it heavily at the </v>

270
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:49.204
<v Speaker 2>time of their life when they should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively free of financial burdens so </v>

271
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:54.074
<v Speaker 2>that they can be creative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial because you're going to </v>

272
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 2>do that when you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

273
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.290
<v Speaker 2>then the universities have become </v>
<v Speaker 2>administratively top heavy and,</v>

274
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:04.124
<v Speaker 2>and stultified because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they've abandoned their commitment </v>

275
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 2>to the humanities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

276
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.913
<v Speaker 2>Then they're not utilizing modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology to extend the reach as </v>

277
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:15.200
<v Speaker 2>broadly as they possibly could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they've,</v>

278
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

279
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.233
<v Speaker 2>in some sense abandoned their </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility to do a crediting </v>

280
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 2>properly and devalued the value of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree because they treat their students</v>

281
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:25.090
<v Speaker 2>like consumers and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

282
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.640
<v Speaker 2>and inflate the grade currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>

283
00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:29.474
<v Speaker 2>that's a perfect storm of error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I see an opportunity emerging </v>

284
00:15:32.511 --> 00:15:33.344
<v Speaker 2>right now where the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>property that's related to the true </v>

285
00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 2>humanities and that would be at least in</v>
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>

286
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:39.224
<v Speaker 2>the western Cultural Canon could just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken out of the universities grip and </v>

287
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.620
<v Speaker 2>provided to people in high quality form </v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

288
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.053
<v Speaker 2>And if I can crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to teach people to write and then </v>

289
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:51.170
<v Speaker 2>also to figure out the accreditation </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

290
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:52.250
<v Speaker 2>which I don't think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

291
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

292
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not an overwhelmingly complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

293
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.043
<v Speaker 2>It's complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not overwhelmingly then there's no </v>

294
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:01.760
<v Speaker 2>reason that the university can't moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Kent Move Online.</v>

295
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.433
<v Speaker 2>And I would say the true university </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists where people are pursuing </v>

296
00:16:06.141 --> 00:16:06.974
<v Speaker 2>education because they bloody well want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get educated because they know that </v>

297
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:10.964
<v Speaker 2>being sharp and articulate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically informed and </v>

298
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:17.120
<v Speaker 2>philosophically wise and all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes their lives better,</v>

299
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.730
<v Speaker 2>makes them better citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them more responsible.</v>

300
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.743
<v Speaker 2>And so I want to follow the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it goes and as far as I'm </v>

301
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:23.804
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universities where people want to </v>

302
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:25.634
<v Speaker 2>listen to wisdom and I'm going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>dispense wisdom to the degree that I'm </v>

303
00:16:29.391 --> 00:16:31.610
<v Speaker 2>fortunate enough to have access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

304
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

305
00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:33.614
<v Speaker 2>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm thrilled that I can be of </v>

306
00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:38.060
<v Speaker 2>service to you and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real privilege and so,</v>

307
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.590
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to do more of that.</v>

308
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.300
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

309
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 2>So another question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I feeling all right?</v>

310
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.390
<v Speaker 2>How is my health?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a good question.</v>

311
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

312
00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I've had a history of depression as some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you may know it,</v>

313
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.013
<v Speaker 2>it's a plague in my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes back many generations and also </v>

314
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:58.850
<v Speaker 2>has afflicted one of my children quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly.</v>

315
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.013
<v Speaker 2>But we are figuring this out and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually feeling pretty good right now </v>

316
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.350
<v Speaker 2>for the first time in about seven or </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight months.</v>

317
00:17:06.351 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm really looking forward to the future</v>
<v Speaker 2>again and I'm getting my energy back.</v>

318
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:12.170
<v Speaker 2>And when I have energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of energy.</v>

319
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.360
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

320
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.160
<v Speaker 2>and because I put my clinical practice </v>
<v Speaker 2>on hiatus and because I've applied for a</v>

321
00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:19.994
<v Speaker 2>sabbatical and I'm going to have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and because of this massive </v>

322
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:25.370
<v Speaker 2>construction project that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged in in my house,</v>

323
00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:28.550
<v Speaker 2>cause I put a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically a native American longhouse on</v>

324
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:30.440
<v Speaker 2>the ceiling of my house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

325
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.190
<v Speaker 2>maybe one day.</v>

326
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 2>I'll walk you through that if you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested.</v>

327
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a lot of time and I'm </v>

328
00:17:35.751 --> 00:17:38.360
<v Speaker 2>finishing a book and it's due on June </v>
<v Speaker 2>5th.</v>

329
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 2>It's called 12 rules for life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidote for chaos.</v>

330
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's just about done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it'll be out January 9th,</v>

331
00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 then,</v>

332
00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:49.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Speaker 2>that's going to clear up an awful lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time for me.</v>

334
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.463
<v Speaker 2>And so my health is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost about 50 pounds because I've </v>

335
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 2>stopped eating carbohydrates almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

336
00:17:57.541 --> 00:18:00.810
<v Speaker 2>And so that's bloody unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm back down to the weight I was when I</v>

337
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:01.644
<v Speaker 2>was 30 and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that I'm going to get on top of </v>

338
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:05.184
<v Speaker 2>my health problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my daughter who's had </v>

339
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.570
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily serious health problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including two hip,</v>

340
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 2>like a hip replacement when she was 16 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and an ankle replacement.</v>

341
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:14.550
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she was also 16,</v>

342
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 2>she walked around on two broken legs for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole year in excruciating agony.</v>

343
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.853
<v Speaker 2>Like she's figured a lot of this out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's offer auntie or her immune </v>

344
00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:25.320
<v Speaker 2>suppressant medication and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

345
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:29.130
<v Speaker 2>So it's a painstaking process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've been eating nothing,</v>

346
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:29.993
<v Speaker 2>literally nothing but beef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken and salad for a whole month </v>

347
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out where my dietary </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivities are.</v>

348
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:38.430
<v Speaker 2>But so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a long answer to your question,</v>

349
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:40.680
<v Speaker 2>but I'm feeling pretty damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I can,</v>

350
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I've got a few more administrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters that are chasing me around,</v>

351
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:47.310
<v Speaker 2>but I think I can get on top of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then man,</v>

352
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be back at it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be real fun.</v>

353
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.000
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

354
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 2>let's see what else we got for live </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions here.</v>

355
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 2>What would I say the male to female </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratio is in my classrooms currently?</v>

356
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no men man.</v>

357
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like 80% women in my psychology </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes and in 10 years there won't be a</v>

358
00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 2>mountain left in the humanities unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>they go online.</v>

359
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.400
<v Speaker 2>In which case maybe it'll only be man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know,</v>

360
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:12.234
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most of the people who are watching </v>

361
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:17.760
<v Speaker 2>my videos are men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about 90 91% actually.</v>

362
00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the men are bailing out of university,</v>

363
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:22.224
<v Speaker 2>like it's just unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's been happening for about 30 </v>

364
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

365
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might,</v>

366
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 2>if things don't change and if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president linear trends continue,</v>

367
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:33.690
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be all women by,</v>

368
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:38.750
<v Speaker 2>by 2025 and that's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that it's good,</v>

369
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.580
<v Speaker 2>not good because there are so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

370
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not good because there aren't any </v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

371
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.440
<v Speaker 2>And obviously that's not good for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>women either,</v>

372
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:48.090
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't know where they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to find their men.</v>

373
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.920
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

374
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.920
<v Speaker 2>What are your thoughts on the book of </v>
<v Speaker 2>revelation in the Bible?</v>

375
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.720
<v Speaker 2>It freaked me out when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

376
00:19:54.721 --> 00:19:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Well hell I should say.</v>

377
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 2>So man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're an adult and you read it,</v>

378
00:19:57.361 --> 00:19:59.610
<v Speaker 2>it should freak you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are my thoughts on it?</v>

379
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the,</v>

380
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:02.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

381
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 2>count of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hallucinogenic trip probably.</v>

382
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably,</v>

383
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.553
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call caused by silicide </v>

384
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.350
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

385
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm Anita Mascara,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

386
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 2>which were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was identified by a guy named last saw,</v>

387
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 25,</v>

388
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:21.324
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even more as the Soma of the </v>

389
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.560
<v Speaker 2>ancient Hindus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

390
00:20:25.561 --> 00:20:26.394
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a hallucination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an account of an extremely </v>

391
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 2>profound hallucinogenic trip that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think.</v>

392
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different issue.</v>

393
00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:36.504
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to try to address that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when and if I get to the book of </v>

394
00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:43.890
<v Speaker 2>revelations in my Biblical series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's going to be probably a couple</v>

395
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:44.723
<v Speaker 2>of years in the future at the rate I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going because it's taken me three weeks </v>

396
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:48.760
<v Speaker 2>to get through genesis one.</v>

397
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.830
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

398
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Violet Irwin says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look great while violet,</v>

399
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.840
<v Speaker 2>your Avatar looks great too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

400
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:57.880
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason I look great,</v>

401
00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.743
<v Speaker 2>I think to the degree that I do is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a very good camera that my son </v>

402
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:03.064
<v Speaker 2>helped me purchase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it makes me look a hell of a lot </v>

403
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:06.820
<v Speaker 2>better than I actually do look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

404
00:21:06.821 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate the sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

405
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.023
<v Speaker 2>Do I see any downside to a child being </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised by his father in the first three </v>

406
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:15.340
<v Speaker 2>years while the mother is working full </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

407
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Are there psychological consequences for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the child to be expected?</v>

408
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.463
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that depends very much on the </v>

409
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:25.300
<v Speaker 2>individual situation in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

410
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.373
<v Speaker 2>I'm not convinced that the art of infant</v>
<v Speaker 2>care is something that a tremendous </v>

411
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:36.550
<v Speaker 2>number of males are highly specialized </v>
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

412
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:37.384
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to have a feminine </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament and that would mean to do </v>

413
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do infant care properly.</v>

414
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.200
<v Speaker 2>And that would mean that you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least very agreeable and maybe you'll</v>

415
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.043
<v Speaker 2>also be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be relatively high in </v>

416
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:48.934
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism so that you respond rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to the distress cries of the </v>

417
00:21:51.911 --> 00:21:52.744
<v Speaker 2>child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that in order to bond </v>

418
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:57.873
<v Speaker 2>the way that you have to bond when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a mother who's taking care of an </v>

419
00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:02.380
<v Speaker 2>infant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say under nine months,</v>

420
00:22:02.381 --> 00:22:03.214
<v Speaker 2>I think some of the biochemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations that accompany </v>

421
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.520
<v Speaker 2>pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>childbirth and lactation probably set up</v>

422
00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:11.110
<v Speaker 2>the proper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

423
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 2>biochemical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying,</v>

424
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Speaker 2>biochemical and psychological mill you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes the kind of bonding that,</v>

425
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.890
<v Speaker 2>that increases the probability of high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level care possible in those few months.</v>

426
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.823
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that men can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say in my experience </v>

427
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:29.500
<v Speaker 2>that it's kind of hard on men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

428
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a complicated issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like one of the things I experienced</v>

429
00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:35.290
<v Speaker 2>and I really liked kits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.590
<v Speaker 2>like I love kids and they generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>respond really well to me.</v>

431
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:39.803
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>babies there are different matter </v>

432
00:22:41.411 --> 00:22:42.244
<v Speaker 2>because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really feel fully qualified to </v>

433
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 2>give a baby what it needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I guess,</v>

434
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's partly because,</v>

435
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breastfeeding at least so far is,</v>

436
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.710
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

437
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.070
<v Speaker 2>firmly in the domain of women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

438
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.153
<v Speaker 2>in fact it's one of the ways by which </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could define women if we were </v>

439
00:22:59.141 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 2>actually into that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

440
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 2>so I think that there are circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 2>under which that's a good thing to do.</v>

441
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:07.324
<v Speaker 2>And actually I had a business partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a business partner who has helped </v>

442
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:13.150
<v Speaker 2>me develop the self authoring suite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very smart guy named Daniel Higgins,</v>

443
00:23:13.151 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 2>who's a mit engineer and also has a phd </v>
<v Speaker 2>in psychology from Harvard.</v>

444
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.460
<v Speaker 2>And he spent a lot of his time taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>care of his kids when they were little.</v>

445
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.760
<v Speaker 2>His wife was going to medical school and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a pretty masculine guy.</v>

446
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.103
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

447
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.240
<v Speaker 2>it was hard on him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

448
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Like it just about killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

449
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.383
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have a lot of money and she </v>

450
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 2>was going through medical school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had two and then three little kids.</v>

451
00:23:35.951 --> 00:23:36.641
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

452
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:38.350
<v Speaker 2>that's a very busy time of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

453
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.683
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did it and he did a great job and he </v>

454
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:45.920
<v Speaker 2>has wonderful kids and he paid a hell of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of attention to them.</v>

455
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not easy.</v>

456
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 2>It was not easy for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

457
00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:51.104
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I watched her with our little kids </v>

458
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:53.144
<v Speaker 2>when they were infants in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she had had an affinity and a </v>

459
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:56.834
<v Speaker 2>proclivity for that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my wife is actually a pretty tough </v>

460
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:00.044
<v Speaker 2>cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't say overwhelmingly </v>

461
00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:03.134
<v Speaker 2>feminine by temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's kind of disagreeable and quite </v>

462
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 2>emotionally stable rather than being </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeable and,</v>

463
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.493
<v Speaker 2>and high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a more typical set of feminine </v>

464
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 2>traits.</v>

465
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.000
<v Speaker 2>She was so damn good with infants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just unbelievable.</v>

466
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:17.834
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do think that the biochemical </v>

467
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:23.440
<v Speaker 2>transformations that accompany pregnancy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth do facilitate that.</v>

468
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.303
<v Speaker 2>I've also seen that with my sister who </v>
<v Speaker 2>is quite a masculine woman and very </v>

469
00:24:27.051 --> 00:24:28.790
<v Speaker 2>adventurous man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

470
00:24:28.791 --> 00:24:29.624
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she smuggled a Mercedes trucks across </v>

471
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:34.184
<v Speaker 2>the Sahara desert in the 1980s from </v>
<v Speaker 2>France down through the whole Sahara </v>

472
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 2>into Niger and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

473
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Babysat orphan gorillas in the Congo and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ran safaris through Africa.</v>

474
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.143
<v Speaker 2>Like she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a very adventurous person and she </v>

475
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.430
<v Speaker 2>took a lot after my father who's quite a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough guy,</v>

476
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had kids when she was 40.</v>

477
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.073
<v Speaker 2>Luckily for her and man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she turned into my mother overnight and </v>

478
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:00.880
<v Speaker 2>I really liked my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

479
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 2>like that's no insult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me,</v>

480
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:04.660
<v Speaker 2>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a really great person,</v>

481
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:05.600
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very caring,</v>

482
00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:07.820
<v Speaker 2>very kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably to her own detriment.</v>

483
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:13.120
<v Speaker 2>But to see my sister transform into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough masculine person who I respected a</v>

484
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:14.700
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

485
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.700
<v Speaker 2>for exactly those virtues into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into mum was really quite remarkable.</v>

486
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:22.100
<v Speaker 2>And to think that there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>biochemical about that.</v>

487
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:22.911
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

488
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:23.744
<v Speaker 2>quite naive and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pointless because of course there's </v>

489
00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:29.594
<v Speaker 2>something biochemical about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about birth and childcare for God's </v>

490
00:25:32.961 --> 00:25:33.794
<v Speaker 2>sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been going on for like ever since </v>

491
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.330
<v Speaker 2>sexual dimorphism emerged on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary landscape.</v>

492
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.913
<v Speaker 2>So that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that boys in our society </v>

493
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 2>are in need of a concrete transition to </v>
<v Speaker 2>man who had like a modern day initiation</v>

494
00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:48.554
<v Speaker 2>ritual?</v>

495
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.750
<v Speaker 2>It probably doesn't matter whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in need of it,</v>

496
00:25:55.751 --> 00:25:56.584
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you can't really just invent </v>

497
00:25:58.211 --> 00:25:59.260
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

498
00:25:59.261 --> 00:26:00.094
<v Speaker 2>It has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that evolves over a very </v>

499
00:26:02.591 --> 00:26:05.620
<v Speaker 2>long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that what they need,</v>

500
00:26:05.621 --> 00:26:06.454
<v Speaker 2>and I really observed this interestingly</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough in the response that young men </v>

501
00:26:09.491 --> 00:26:10.324
<v Speaker 2>have had to my public talks and probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube as well with regards to what </v>

502
00:26:14.471 --> 00:26:16.330
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

503
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.343
<v Speaker 2>young people have been fed this pablum </v>
<v Speaker 2>since the 1960s that the pathway to </v>

504
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.640
<v Speaker 2>happiness and freedom in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

505
00:26:24.641 --> 00:26:26.860
<v Speaker 2>that those are the things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be after,</v>

506
00:26:26.861 --> 00:26:29.560
<v Speaker 2>especially happiness and that there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be found in,</v>

507
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.980
<v Speaker 2>in like rights and untrammeled freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's complete.</v>

508
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.113
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's completely one sided because for </v>

509
00:26:35.951 --> 00:26:36.784
<v Speaker 2>every right there is a corresponding </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility and freedom can be chaos </v>

510
00:26:40.271 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 2>just as much as it can be.</v>

511
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

512
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.413
<v Speaker 2>blissful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of responsibility and the ability </v>

513
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 2>to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he don't act choices one after another.</v>

514
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.940
<v Speaker 2>And I've been speaking to young men in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>

515
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones who keep coming to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>talks by the way,</v>

516
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 2>about truth in action and </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

517
00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 2>And like they're eating that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there.</v>

518
00:26:59.161 --> 00:27:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I can see their eyes light up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so cool.</v>

519
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.923
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking to the people who ran </v>

520
00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 2>for the conservative leadership in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

521
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.253
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that when I go talk to </v>

522
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 2>male audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially young men,</v>

523
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:16.191
<v Speaker 2>that they're unbelievably enthralled by </v>
<v Speaker 2>any discussion of genuine responsibility</v>

524
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:17.064
<v Speaker 2>and truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the conservatives have something </v>

525
00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:19.104
<v Speaker 2>to offer young man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that's roughly akin to </v>

526
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:22.740
<v Speaker 2>an initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

527
00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:26.220
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that at some point you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell young men,</v>

528
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.140
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow the hell up.</v>

529
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Take on some responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straighten yourself out,</v>

530
00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>act honestly,</v>

531
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.790
<v Speaker 2>make yourself into an an admirable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful character.</v>

532
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.653
<v Speaker 2>Not because you're</v>

533
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.620
<v Speaker 2>domesticated like a bloody puppy or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheep,</v>

534
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 2>but because that's the way to genuine </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority and influence and,</v>

535
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.090
<v Speaker 2>and the capacity to do great good in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

536
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's like an exciting call to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure.</v>

537
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:55.071
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's a modern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated intellectual equivalent to</v>

538
00:27:55.981 --> 00:27:56.814
<v Speaker 2>something like on initiation ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I hope to be like promoting that </v>

539
00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:04.750
<v Speaker 2>message more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was speaking to member of,</v>

540
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.571
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

541
00:28:05.571 --> 00:28:06.404
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the leaders of the indigenous </v>

542
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:07.944
<v Speaker 2>communities in Canada today about maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the high school version of the </v>

543
00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:13.980
<v Speaker 2>future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not future authoring program.</v>

544
00:28:13.981 --> 00:28:16.310
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about that a bit before on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrion.</v>

545
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.153
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a program at self authoring Dotcom </v>

546
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 2>that enables people to generate a vision</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their lives and also to,</v>

547
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:24.654
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

548
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:25.160
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

549
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.440
<v Speaker 2>And to detail out that vision and make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan of it.</v>

550
00:28:27.441 --> 00:28:28.274
<v Speaker 2>I think most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patriots subscribers have got links to </v>

551
00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:30.914
<v Speaker 2>that already and usernames and passwords</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hasn't really remarkably positive </v>

552
00:28:34.581 --> 00:28:37.550
<v Speaker 2>effect on young men who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>disenfranchised,</v>

553
00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:38.384
<v Speaker 2>who tend to be ethnic minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so initiating them into the idea </v>

554
00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:42.374
<v Speaker 2>that they need to take control of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>own destiny and that that's the proper </v>

555
00:28:44.751 --> 00:28:48.230
<v Speaker 2>pathway to authority and stature and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not self esteem,</v>

556
00:28:48.231 --> 00:28:50.630
<v Speaker 2>but self respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a completely different thing,</v>

557
00:28:50.631 --> 00:28:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I think is a reasonable modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to initiation ritual.</v>

558
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.353
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's take another live question </v>

559
00:28:57.831 --> 00:28:58.800
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

560
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.473
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

561
00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.503
<v Speaker 2>Brennan B says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm halfway finished cleaning my </v>

562
00:29:05.921 --> 00:29:09.520
<v Speaker 2>disaster of a room while I've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>something terrible to admit people,</v>

563
00:29:09.521 --> 00:29:12.730
<v Speaker 2>because at the moment I'm sitting in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and it isn't clean.</v>

564
00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.460
<v Speaker 2>The back behind here where you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>as clean,</v>

565
00:29:15.461 --> 00:29:19.150
<v Speaker 2>but because the events of the last seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>months have been so overwhelming,</v>

566
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:20.403
<v Speaker 2>I would say that there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of chaos that has invaded my </v>

567
00:29:22.631 --> 00:29:23.464
<v Speaker 2>immediate environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I have plans to get this place </v>

568
00:29:26.171 --> 00:29:29.650
<v Speaker 2>sorted out in a serious way over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next few months from top,</v>

569
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.310
<v Speaker 2>from bottom of the host to the talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So halfway Brendan,</v>

570
00:29:33.311 --> 00:29:34.144
<v Speaker 2>that's a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's real psychological </v>

571
00:29:35.651 --> 00:29:36.970
<v Speaker 2>consequences to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

572
00:29:36.971 --> 00:29:40.030
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're interested in this,</v>

573
00:29:40.031 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 2>everyone here's really sophisticated</v>

574
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.821
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could read,</v>

575
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:46.060
<v Speaker 1>you could take a look at Carl humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>last book,</v>

576
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.230
<v Speaker 1>which was called mysterium conjunction </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so that it's Latin.</v>

577
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.513
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the first part of that book is </v>

578
00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 1>really kind of like have a dictionary of</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolism.</v>

579
00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 1>He wrote it I think in his eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think he was trying to get down as</v>

580
00:29:59.141 --> 00:30:01.360
<v Speaker 1>much as he could of what he knew as fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he could.</v>

581
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:02.194
<v Speaker 1>So the first part is a dictionary of </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolism and it's very difficult to </v>

582
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 1>read unless you've read a lot of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>other writing.</v>

583
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.953
<v Speaker 1>But the second part of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an absolute work of </v>

584
00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:10.774
<v Speaker 1>genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll makes a couple of propositions </v>

585
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:13.414
<v Speaker 1>about higher order moral development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to run through them </v>

586
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 1>really quickly and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and described their symbolism.</v>

587
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:18.784
<v Speaker 1>So he said the first thing that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do if you're going to get your act </v>

588
00:30:21.161 --> 00:30:22.130
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

589
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.250
<v Speaker 1>and this is like an extension of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Piagetian notion of,</v>

590
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.420
<v Speaker 1>of stages of moral development.</v>

591
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.830
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 1>you have an intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

593
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.063
<v Speaker 1>and you have a set of emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and you can conceptualize </v>

594
00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:37.174
<v Speaker 1>the intellect symbolically as masculine </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the emotions and motivations </v>

595
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:43.300
<v Speaker 1>symbolically as feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the first conjunction,</v>

596
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:44.643
<v Speaker 1>which is the bringing together of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and feminine to make a </v>

597
00:30:46.871 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 1>complete being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the union of the intellect with</v>

598
00:30:49.691 --> 00:30:50.524
<v Speaker 1>the emotions and motivations so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not fighting your deeper </v>

599
00:30:54.191 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 1>motivations with your thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

600
00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:58.900
<v Speaker 1>that they're all moving in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

601
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be conjunction number </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

602
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.583
<v Speaker 1>And so then that makes you united in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of your capability for subjective </v>

603
00:31:06.851 --> 00:31:07.684
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're all pointing and all of that's </v>

604
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 1>pointing in the same direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that can make</v>

605
00:31:11.801 --> 00:31:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you unstoppable because you're not at </v>
<v Speaker 1>war with yourself.</v>

606
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:16.690
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the next conjunction as far as he</v>

607
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:19.390
<v Speaker 1>was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was also expressed symbolically.</v>

608
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 1>So now you have the masculine union of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>

609
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.240
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and motivation.</v>

610
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.153
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can now conceptualize this </v>

611
00:31:28.811 --> 00:31:29.644
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you bring those together in a </v>

612
00:31:31.041 --> 00:31:31.874
<v Speaker 1>creative union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you start to act </v>

613
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.433
<v Speaker 1>out what you think and feel so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no paradoxical relationship or </v>

614
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:41.703
<v Speaker 1>or enacted lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call that a performative </v>

615
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:47.650
<v Speaker 1>contradiction between what you think and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel and what you do.</v>

616
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.083
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so because part of being honest is </v>

617
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:54.370
<v Speaker 1>that you act out what you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

618
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:56.530
<v Speaker 1>And so that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the next conjunction.</v>

619
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.573
<v Speaker 1>And so that makes you integrated in mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and emotion and motivation and in </v>

620
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.170
<v Speaker 1>enacted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enacted routine and body.</v>

621
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.213
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another way of bringing </v>

622
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:08.044
<v Speaker 1>yourself together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the third conjunction is the one </v>

623
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:11.704
<v Speaker 1>that's most interesting and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that's most difficult to </v>

624
00:32:13.481 --> 00:32:14.314
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

625
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And that conjunction occurs when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take this unified mind body continuum,</v>

626
00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:21.760
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

627
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.110
<v Speaker 1>well wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an,</v>

628
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:26.980
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of that missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's my experience,</v>

629
00:32:26.981 --> 00:32:30.730
<v Speaker 1>my experience of the world that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically outside of me.</v>

630
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Or that's hypothetically not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

631
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.223
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your experience of the world outside </v>

632
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.043
<v Speaker 1>that's not you is a very strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience because it isn't self </v>

633
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:43.580
<v Speaker 1>evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

634
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:48.581
<v Speaker 1>to me that my wife is not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spend so much time together.</v>

635
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.453
<v Speaker 1>She's in my experience so much we have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>joint past and a present and a joint </v>

636
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.670
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same with my kids and the people who</v>

637
00:32:58.671 --> 00:32:59.504
<v Speaker 1>were close to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious to me that my wife is </v>

638
00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:02.804
<v Speaker 1>less valuable to me than I am to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She certainly more valuable to me than </v>

639
00:33:07.641 --> 00:33:10.550
<v Speaker 1>some arbitrary body part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an arm or a leg,</v>

640
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:11.384
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

641
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.313
<v Speaker 1>And people are perfectly capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>making gestures of physical self </v>

642
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice in order to rescue people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love.</v>

643
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.593
<v Speaker 1>And so just exactly who you are and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly who the external world is not </v>

644
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:25.814
<v Speaker 1>clear at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the last conjunction for young </v>

645
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:28.964
<v Speaker 1>was the eradication of the distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between your subjective experience as </v>

646
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 1>you and your object of experience as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

647
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:36.763
<v Speaker 1>which is to say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if I'm walking down the street and </v>

648
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:41.474
<v Speaker 1>I encounter someone in trouble and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble calls to me as something that I </v>

649
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:46.094
<v Speaker 1>could conceivably do something about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that that trouble isn't sat </v>

650
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:51.014
<v Speaker 1>right in the world is actually is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually because it's part of my </v>

651
00:33:54.261 --> 00:33:57.290
<v Speaker 1>experience is actually my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

652
00:33:57.291 --> 00:34:00.350
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that it's my fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it might be,</v>

653
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 1>might not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it isn't,</v>

654
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.303
<v Speaker 1>but it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still my responsibility and </v>

655
00:34:06.471 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to consider the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruption in my experiential field than</v>

656
00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:16.421
<v Speaker 1>encountering someone who is in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces as an actual disturbance in my,</v>

657
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:18.463
<v Speaker 1>in my being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then to act as if it's my </v>

658
00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:23.930
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to rectify that </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbance.</v>

659
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem of course comes in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how.</v>

660
00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:29.510
<v Speaker 1>So if you run across a street alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

661
00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:30.344
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the day and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stumbling wrong blindly and maybe their </v>

662
00:34:32.811 --> 00:34:35.330
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia to boot and mumbling </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things,</v>

663
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:36.523
<v Speaker 1>you know it's going to disturb you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be good if you could set it </v>

664
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:40.940
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know how.</v>

665
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:42.770
<v Speaker 1>So you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to avoid it.</v>

666
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because it's also you.</v>

667
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's why in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha,</v>

668
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:51.644
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Buddha was basically offered </v>

669
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 1>when he became enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chance to remain in Nirvana,</v>

670
00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:00.890
<v Speaker 1>right as a uniquely enlightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular individual.</v>

671
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.083
<v Speaker 1>And he actually regret rejected that </v>
<v Speaker 1>offer because it was his deepest </v>

672
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:11.840
<v Speaker 1>conviction that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not possible for one person to be</v>

673
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:12.674
<v Speaker 1>enlightened and to be in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada if everyone wasn't in that state </v>

674
00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:16.994
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he had to move himself out of </v>

675
00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:24.551
<v Speaker 1>that Utopian experience of Nirvana and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back to the normal world,</v>

676
00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to try to raise the consciousness of</v>

677
00:35:27.921 --> 00:35:32.900
<v Speaker 1>people around him because he regarded </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as unfinished business.</v>

678
00:35:32.901 --> 00:35:35.360
<v Speaker 1>That was his personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

679
00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.050
<v Speaker 1>now</v>

680
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who was I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

681
00:35:39.881 --> 00:35:42.280
<v Speaker 2>That's all about cleaning your room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have six actually,</v>

682
00:35:42.281 --> 00:35:43.031
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

683
00:35:43.031 --> 00:35:45.190
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that your,</v>

684
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.380
<v Speaker 2>your room isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not you.</v>

685
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

686
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:49.520
<v Speaker 2>it's actually you.</v>

687
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

688
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.733
<v Speaker 2>And so there's no difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos that's outside of you in a place </v>

689
00:35:55.551 --> 00:35:56.384
<v Speaker 2>that you spend as much time as you spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your room and the chaos that's </v>

690
00:35:59.781 --> 00:36:02.270
<v Speaker 2>internal psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

691
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.163
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I often do when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>first dealing with my clients as a </v>

692
00:36:06.591 --> 00:36:10.400
<v Speaker 2>simple exercise in setting themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right psychologically,</v>

693
00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.810
<v Speaker 2>is to have them start to clean up their </v>
<v Speaker 2>external environment.</v>

694
00:36:14.811 --> 00:36:15.644
<v Speaker 2>Because if people know how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's no difference between that </v>

695
00:36:18.621 --> 00:36:21.380
<v Speaker 2>and putting yourself straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically as you know,</v>

696
00:36:21.381 --> 00:36:24.580
<v Speaker 2>when you do something as serious as </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to clean up or your omen.</v>

697
00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.453
<v Speaker 2>So Brendan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing I would say is like </v>

698
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.153
<v Speaker 2>finish cleaning your room and then see </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can make it beautiful because </v>

699
00:36:31.491 --> 00:36:35.300
<v Speaker 2>that's also unbelievably useful man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it teaches you about beauty.</v>

700
00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.450
<v Speaker 2>And so then you can make one room in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your house beautiful.</v>

701
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:41.180
<v Speaker 2>And then it's organized and together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

702
00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.373
<v Speaker 2>And so once you do that with one room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're way wiser than you were </v>

703
00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:45.494
<v Speaker 2>before and you've actually accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 2>something concrete that's solid and in </v>

704
00:36:48.921 --> 00:36:52.250
<v Speaker 2>controvertible that you can point to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that strengthens your character.</v>

705
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:54.860
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you can do the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your whole house.</v>

706
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:58.400
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you can do that with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>more with the world around you.</v>

707
00:36:58.401 --> 00:37:00.470
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you start doing that,</v>

708
00:37:00.471 --> 00:37:03.740
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 2>wondering what the meaning of life is,</v>

709
00:37:03.741 --> 00:37:06.230
<v Speaker 2>because you're going to find it in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

710
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:08.990
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's see.</v>

711
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:11.183
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

712
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Max and mark says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts on the Jews.</v>

713
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's complicated.</v>

714
00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of my friends are Jews,</v>

715
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.440
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:37:21.441 --> 00:37:24.440
<v Speaker 2>and when I grew up in northern Alberta </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there were no Jews up there at all,</v>

717
00:37:24.441 --> 00:37:25.640
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

718
00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.120
<v Speaker 2>it coming out to eastern Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially Montreal,</v>

719
00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:32.060
<v Speaker 2>there were lots of Jewish people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I made friends with lots of them.</v>

720
00:37:32.061 --> 00:37:34.160
<v Speaker 2>And then in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Toronto,</v>

721
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

722
00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.493
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the reason that so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my friends have been Jewish is </v>

723
00:37:38.991 --> 00:37:41.410
<v Speaker 2>because the Jews have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:37:41.411 --> 00:37:44.180
<v Speaker 2>and I'm obviously speaking in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>general sense,</v>

725
00:37:44.181 --> 00:37:48.230
<v Speaker 2>is they have a rich intellectual life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tremendous respect for,</v>

726
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.550
<v Speaker 2>for intellectual pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we have a natural affinity.</v>

727
00:37:52.551 --> 00:37:53.960
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

728
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.423
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more power to them as far as I'm </v>

729
00:37:56.601 --> 00:37:57.710
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fair,</v>

730
00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:01.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a fair bit of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with regards to the Ashkenazi</v>

731
00:38:01.011 --> 00:38:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Jews that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

732
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:05.720
<v Speaker 2>they're average Iq is or about 15 points</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than the general population,</v>

733
00:38:05.721 --> 00:38:06.554
<v Speaker 2>which accounts in part for the radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>overrepresentation among Nobel prize </v>

734
00:38:10.071 --> 00:38:11.030
<v Speaker 2>winners for example.</v>

735
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.863
<v Speaker 2>And also in positions of let's say </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority and responsibility in many </v>

736
00:38:15.261 --> 00:38:16.670
<v Speaker 2>different domains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

737
00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.510
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not unhappy about successful people.</v>

738
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

739
00:38:22.071 --> 00:38:26.030
<v Speaker 2>it's the same in relationship to money </v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned.</v>

740
00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you have a position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority and I'm not going to say power</v>

741
00:38:29.691 --> 00:38:31.670
<v Speaker 2>because power and authority aren't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>

742
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>but if you have a position of authority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is what you do with it.</v>

743
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 2>And so if competent people occupy </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions of authority,</v>

744
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 2>then more power to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's lucky for the rest of us.</v>

745
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

746
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

747
00:38:45.251 --> 00:38:46.084
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often thought this about the Jews </v>

748
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:48.274
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're going to be a </v>

749
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:49.774
<v Speaker 2>minority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should at least have the decency to </v>

750
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:53.030
<v Speaker 2>fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that part of the reason,</v>

751
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.130
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

752
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.233
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're around and you're annoying </v>

753
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:57.370
<v Speaker 2>because you're a minority.</v>

754
00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:58.203
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people are fundamentally a </v>

755
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.590
<v Speaker 2>ethnocentric and all human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

756
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 2>But if a minority fails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why you can say,</v>

757
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:07.360
<v Speaker 2>well at least they failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

758
00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 2>that may be lousy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to hate them quite as much,</v>

759
00:39:09.911 --> 00:39:10.744
<v Speaker 2>but the Jews have this annoying </v>
<v Speaker 2>proclivity where they go as a minority </v>

760
00:39:14.081 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 2>to become extremely successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course nobody can stand that.</v>

761
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:19.720
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a huge part of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts for antisemitism,</v>

762
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Speaker 2>which are regarded as an absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a bismal and,</v>

763
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:24.640
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

764
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.160
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reprehensible.</v>

765
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.680
<v Speaker 2>A Priori stats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

766
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.650
<v Speaker 2>So that's some of my thoughts about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

767
00:39:32.651 --> 00:39:33.520
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

768
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.383
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>

769
00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Speaker 2>How did I meet my wife?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why did you marry her?</v>

770
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:40.853
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll tell you one of the earliest </v>

771
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.303
<v Speaker 2>memories I have my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it kind of tells me what she's </v>

772
00:39:46.991 --> 00:39:47.740
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh.</v>

773
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:48.573
<v Speaker 2>So she lived across the street from me </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this little town that we grew up in </v>

774
00:39:51.311 --> 00:39:52.480
<v Speaker 2>called fairview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alberta.</v>

775
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.640
<v Speaker 2>And I think I fell in love with her the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment that I saw her and I,</v>

776
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.050
<v Speaker 2>although I don't think the feeling was </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily mutual.</v>

777
00:39:59.051 --> 00:40:01.690
<v Speaker 2>And so I was about like seven I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

778
00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:02.524
<v Speaker 2>So I've known her for like 48 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's one memory because this is </v>

779
00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.550
<v Speaker 2>their two memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you.</v>

780
00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:10.384
<v Speaker 2>So one of them was when I was in grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>five I got glasses and I was pretty </v>

781
00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:17.080
<v Speaker 2>proud of these classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were horn rimmed glasses,</v>

782
00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:18.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was pretty proud of them.</v>

783
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.353
<v Speaker 2>And I went out and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she came out onto the street and she </v>

784
00:40:22.451 --> 00:40:23.530
<v Speaker 2>looked at my glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

785
00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:24.700
<v Speaker 2>what are you thinking of that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she says,</v>

786
00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:25.534
<v Speaker 2>I think you look really funny in those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she pointed at me and ran into </v>

787
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:28.924
<v Speaker 2>her house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't like 20 years later that </v>

788
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.743
<v Speaker 2>she finally told me that she had always </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to have glasses and she was </v>

789
00:40:34.061 --> 00:40:35.350
<v Speaker 2>jealous about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

790
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:37.900
<v Speaker 2>she decided she'd give me a good teasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a good poke.</v>

791
00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:38.734
<v Speaker 2>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we used to play croquet </v>

792
00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:41.434
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the great delights she would </v>

793
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:44.344
<v Speaker 2>take is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever laid </v>

794
00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:45.850
<v Speaker 2>croquet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

795
00:40:45.851 --> 00:40:46.684
<v Speaker 2>you're sometimes the one person's ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're hitting and another </v>

796
00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:51.064
<v Speaker 2>person's will come together and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can stand on your ball and you can nail </v>

797
00:40:54.131 --> 00:40:56.840
<v Speaker 2>it with the croquet mallet and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>knock the other person's,</v>

798
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>croquet ball halfway down the block.</v>

799
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.650
<v Speaker 2>And she used to think that was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn amusing when she did it to me.</v>

800
00:41:02.651 --> 00:41:04.000
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

801
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

802
00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:08.530
<v Speaker 2>what else can I remember about her that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

803
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.521
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

804
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I told my dad when I was in grade five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting with her on this big</v>

805
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:19.440
<v Speaker 2>armchair in our living room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was sitting beside me on the arm</v>

806
00:41:19.441 --> 00:41:20.980
<v Speaker 2>chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I was pretty damn thrilled about.</v>

807
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.490
<v Speaker 2>And she was being chased around by all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boys in the school at that point,</v>

808
00:41:24.491 --> 00:41:26.440
<v Speaker 2>even though she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was in the elementary school,</v>

809
00:41:26.441 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she was very,</v>

810
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot property,</v>

811
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among the elementary school boys.</v>

812
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.830
<v Speaker 2>And so I was pretty happy to have her </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit by me.</v>

813
00:41:33.831 --> 00:41:34.664
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she left and I told my dad that I was </v>

814
00:41:38.181 --> 00:41:42.380
<v Speaker 2>going to marry her</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

815
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:43.214
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that and he told that story </v>

816
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 2>at our wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was quite cute.</v>

817
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.860
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll tell you one more story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really think it's funny.</v>

818
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.720
<v Speaker 2>This is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

819
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 2>we were friends when we were kids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

820
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls mature faster than boys and she's </v>

821
00:41:57.471 --> 00:41:59.630
<v Speaker 2>a year older than me cause I skipped a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grade in school.</v>

822
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.460
<v Speaker 2>We were in the same grade in school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

823
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she hit about 13 or so,</v>

824
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 2>we kind of went our separate ways a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>

825
00:42:06.171 --> 00:42:07.004
<v Speaker 2>although we still remained friends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she had a paper route and I took her </v>

826
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:15.461
<v Speaker 2>paper route over when she hit 13 or so </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I like quadrupled the damn thing,</v>

827
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is pretty funny.</v>

828
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:18.703
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

829
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I also delivered paper to her house and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

830
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.180
<v Speaker 2>one day she was there with a number </v>
<v Speaker 2>other of her friends and,</v>

831
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:26.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was,</v>

832
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a cute chick too.</v>

833
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:29.083
<v Speaker 2>And I liked her quite a bit and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were sitting around talking about like </v>

834
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 2>talking about how they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

835
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.560
<v Speaker 2>feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

836
00:42:36.561 --> 00:42:37.394
<v Speaker 2>And they were talking when I walked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that neither of them are </v>

837
00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:43.520
<v Speaker 2>going to take their husbands last day </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they got married.</v>

838
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:44.870
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

839
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Tammy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

840
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:46.993
<v Speaker 2>I think said to her friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while that really means I'm going to </v>

841
00:42:49.821 --> 00:42:50.654
<v Speaker 2>have to find some wimp and marry him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she turned around and looked at me </v>

842
00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.780
<v Speaker 2>and smiled evilee and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Jordan,</v>

843
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.063
<v Speaker 2>do you want to get married?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course I'd heard the whole </v>

844
00:42:59.361 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 2>conversation and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knew I liked her obviously.</v>

845
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:03.224
<v Speaker 2>And so that was nice little comical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Desc she has a very vicious sense of </v>

846
00:43:05.751 --> 00:43:07.070
<v Speaker 2>humor and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

847
00:43:07.071 --> 00:43:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I kind of laughed and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

848
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.470
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

849
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fine.</v>

850
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 2>So then</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we were,</v>

851
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:19.310
<v Speaker 2>I was like 28 and she had come to see me</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Montreal and,</v>

852
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.713
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about getting married </v>

853
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:23.653
<v Speaker 2>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about what that would </v>

854
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:26.150
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>

855
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.430
<v Speaker 2>And then we started talking about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the name would be.</v>

856
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:29.151
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

857
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:31.010
<v Speaker 2>I've got a story for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

858
00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 2>you remember when you were 13 and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivering papers to your house.</v>

859
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.473
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

860
00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:40.310
<v Speaker 2>cause I suggested that she take my last </v>
<v Speaker 2>name and she wasn't so sure about that.</v>

861
00:43:40.311 --> 00:43:41.001
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

862
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:44.090
<v Speaker 2>you remember that little story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little episode that we had when you</v>

863
00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:44.924
<v Speaker 2>were 13 and I came over to your house </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you told me that you weren't going </v>

864
00:43:47.451 --> 00:43:50.750
<v Speaker 2>to take your husband's name and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to marry some wimp.</v>

865
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:51.651
<v Speaker 2>Said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

866
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:52.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

867
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.600
<v Speaker 2>here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

868
00:43:53.601 --> 00:43:55.580
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to get married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take my name.</v>

869
00:43:55.581 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's the end of that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

870
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had the good graces to go along with</v>

871
00:43:59.661 --> 00:44:00.830
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was actually,</v>

872
00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:03.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stored nearly comical and ridiculous.</v>

873
00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:04.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

874
00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.580
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a good one.</v>

875
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.230
<v Speaker 2>What's my advice to young men seeking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman for marriage and family?</v>

876
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

877
00:44:14.871 --> 00:44:15.704
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

878
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.930
<v Speaker 2>That's the same question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second question.</v>

879
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.520
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty straight forward,</v>

880
00:44:19.521 --> 00:44:20.354
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

881
00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.740
<v Speaker 2>you can't eliminate the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being attracted to one another.</v>

882
00:44:24.741 --> 00:44:27.200
<v Speaker 2>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's mysterious,</v>

883
00:44:27.201 --> 00:44:27.980
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

884
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.720
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a funny thing.</v>

885
00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the</v>

886
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.250
<v Speaker 1>things we know that attracts people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>one another is bilateral symmetry.</v>

887
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take men and you ranked </v>
<v Speaker 1>them by the symmetry of their faces,</v>

888
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.313
<v Speaker 1>and then you give the asymmetrical men </v>
<v Speaker 1>tee shirts to wear clean t shirts for a </v>

889
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 1>day and the symmetrical men clean t </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirts to wear for a day.</v>

890
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you give the tee shirts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and you have them rate the odor,</v>

891
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:56.783
<v Speaker 1>the women rate the odor of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical men as more attractive than </v>

892
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 1>the odor of the asymmetrical men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

893
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 1>and there were other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

894
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.233
<v Speaker 1>factors that determined sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness that are based on </v>

895
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:12.360
<v Speaker 1>biological factors that are so deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in terms of smell,</v>

896
00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:13.290
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

897
00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:16.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women also tend to,</v>

898
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:19.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be sexually attracted to the,</v>

899
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.620
<v Speaker 1>to the scent of men whose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have,</v>

900
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.573
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rh factors that would make for </v>

901
00:45:26.941 --> 00:45:29.910
<v Speaker 1>potential trouble in childbirth.</v>

902
00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:30.953
<v Speaker 1>And the often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that the women give for not </v>

903
00:45:33.781 --> 00:45:34.614
<v Speaker 1>preferring the scent of those men is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they smell too much like their </v>

904
00:45:36.811 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

905
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:41.730
<v Speaker 1>So there was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterious things that determine whether</v>

906
00:45:41.731 --> 00:45:44.310
<v Speaker 1>or not people are sexually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically attracted to each other.</v>

907
00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:48.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's very important that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of a marital relationship.</v>

908
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.390
<v Speaker 1>The next most important thing is trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

909
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:56.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no marriage that </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful without trust you guys.</v>

910
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:57.833
<v Speaker 1>You got to tell each other the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons that you don't </v>

911
00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:05.481
<v Speaker 1>believe that marriage as an an an oath </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Carl Jung as a bond was necessary.</v>

912
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 1>It's really wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

913
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth to someone is no </v>

914
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 1>simple thing because there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about all of us that are terrible</v>

915
00:46:14.611 --> 00:46:18.270
<v Speaker 1>and weak and reprehensible and shameful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things and they kind of</v>

916
00:46:18.271 --> 00:46:20.670
<v Speaker 1>have to be brought out into the open and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with.</v>

917
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:21.893
<v Speaker 1>And you're not going to tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>about yourself to someone who can run </v>

918
00:46:25.321 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 1>away screaming when you reveal who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

919
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.810
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marriage bond is something like,</v>

920
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.100
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal.</v>

921
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to handcuff myself to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to handcuff yourself to me.</v>

922
00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.250
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to tell each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth and neither of us are going to</v>

923
00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:43.230
<v Speaker 1>get to run away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so are,</v>

924
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.930
<v Speaker 1>once we know the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're either going to live together</v>

925
00:46:45.931 --> 00:46:46.764
<v Speaker 1>in mutual torment or we're going to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with that truth and straighten </v>

926
00:46:49.141 --> 00:46:51.870
<v Speaker 1>ourselves out and street in ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out jointly.</v>

927
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to make us more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and more resilient and more and</v>

928
00:46:57.571 --> 00:47:00.900
<v Speaker 1>deeper and wiser as we progress together</v>
<v Speaker 1>through life.</v>

929
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.153
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's absolutely brilliant </v>

930
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.880
<v Speaker 1>because if you leave the backdoor open </v>
<v Speaker 1>mat and you're going to use it,</v>

931
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:06.743
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

932
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:07.703
<v Speaker 1>And the oath is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was young's commentary on the </v>

933
00:47:10.321 --> 00:47:11.154
<v Speaker 1>spiritualization of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human pair boy and by Christian </v>

934
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:16.590
<v Speaker 1>marriage for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

935
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.120
<v Speaker 1>which emphasized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

936
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

937
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.310
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subordination of both members of the</v>

938
00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:27.720
<v Speaker 1>marital union to a higher order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

939
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.000
<v Speaker 1>personality that embodied in the figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the logos.</v>

940
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:34.720
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that an an an an an in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Christian marriage for example,</v>

941
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:38.140
<v Speaker 1>the man isn't the boss and the woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the boss.</v>

942
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:43.260
<v Speaker 1>The boss is the mutual personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed by the seeking of truth in both</v>

943
00:47:44.711 --> 00:47:47.380
<v Speaker 1>of them and that's conceptualized as </v>
<v Speaker 1>theirs,</v>

944
00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:51.460
<v Speaker 1>their joint subjugation to the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is absolutely dead on man.</v>

945
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:52.533
<v Speaker 1>It's like the ruler of your marital life</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be your vows to tell each other </v>

946
00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:57.664
<v Speaker 1>the truth because like in hard times </v>
<v Speaker 1>during your life when you've done </v>

947
00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.044
<v Speaker 1>something stupid and idiotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might take you down and you don't </v>

948
00:48:04.931 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 1>have anybody that you can turn to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

949
00:48:06.731 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 1>if you have a partner that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust,</v>

950
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:09.520
<v Speaker 1>you can go say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

951
00:48:09.521 --> 00:48:10.354
<v Speaker 1>you know I made a big financial mistake </v>
<v Speaker 1>man and it's really torturing me and I </v>

952
00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:15.790
<v Speaker 1>feel like a complete idiot and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really dangerous.</v>

953
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:16.623
<v Speaker 1>And the person there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to help you figure out what </v>

954
00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:21.070
<v Speaker 1>to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to know that when they</v>

955
00:48:21.071 --> 00:48:21.904
<v Speaker 1>make a stupid mistake and they're bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>well going to that they can come and </v>

956
00:48:24.161 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 1>talk to you and that you guys are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work your way through it.</v>

957
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:27.814
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a couple of things our </v>

958
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 1>culture gets really wrong and one is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>devalues marriage.</v>

959
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.640
<v Speaker 1>That's really a very bad idea because </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriages,</v>

960
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.863
<v Speaker 1>marriages like a third of your life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe more and kids are a third of your </v>

961
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 1>life and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

962
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:47.230
<v Speaker 1>your life outside of marriage and kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a third of your life,</v>

963
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately speaking and to miss any </v>

964
00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:53.950
<v Speaker 1>of that is a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive mistake.</v>

965
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

966
00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:57.483
<v Speaker 1>I will also say that for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing one or more of those is </v>

967
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 1>necessary because they have a reason.</v>

968
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.713
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're brilliantly creative </v>

969
00:49:05.951 --> 00:49:06.784
<v Speaker 1>artists and they need to devote </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves entirely to their career or </v>

970
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:11.260
<v Speaker 1>their outstanding in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they need,</v>

971
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.123
<v Speaker 1>they can justify the sacrifice of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that tryout of being to another </v>

972
00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:17.164
<v Speaker 1>part but for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally speaking it's a very </v>

973
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:20.800
<v Speaker 1>dangerous thing and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

974
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.430
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be duct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also kids get an absolutely terrible</v>

975
00:49:24.431 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 1>rap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

976
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:28.870
<v Speaker 1>because kids are delightful if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>well behaved.</v>

977
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.823
<v Speaker 1>One of the chapters in my new book is </v>
<v Speaker 1>called don't let your children do </v>

978
00:49:32.231 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 1>anything that makes you dislike them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>

979
00:49:35.111 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you discuss it thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your spouse.</v>

980
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:41.890
<v Speaker 1>You're the person that's helping you </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline the kids and children are the</v>

981
00:49:41.891 --> 00:49:45.580
<v Speaker 1>best company because they're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic about everything.</v>

982
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.593
<v Speaker 1>They love doing new things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really love you so they're happy </v>

983
00:49:49.121 --> 00:49:50.990
<v Speaker 1>that you're around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

984
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.580
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is make sure they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not too hot and they're not too cold and</v>

985
00:49:54.581 --> 00:49:55.414
<v Speaker 1>they've had something to eat and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too tired and you don't expect them </v>

986
00:49:58.811 --> 00:50:02.740
<v Speaker 1>to stay engaged in something for longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>than they can manage.</v>

987
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:03.583
<v Speaker 1>Because we used to take our kids when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were little out to restaurants for </v>

988
00:50:05.411 --> 00:50:06.244
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they could sit there and no problem </v>

989
00:50:07.241 --> 00:50:09.400
<v Speaker 1>and behave really nicely when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>two and three,</v>

990
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:12.100
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't do it for more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 45 minutes.</v>

991
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.113
<v Speaker 1>He can't push your luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also noticed with little kids is </v>

992
00:50:15.641 --> 00:50:16.474
<v Speaker 1>that they got antsy and unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>about five to 10 minutes before the </v>

993
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:21.304
<v Speaker 1>adults did too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the adults were too stupid to </v>

994
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:24.700
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids would notice right away.</v>

995
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:25.953
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

996
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.300
<v Speaker 1>so back to while you look for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're attracted to,</v>

997
00:50:29.301 --> 00:50:30.134
<v Speaker 1>that you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you look for someone that you </v>

998
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:35.350
<v Speaker 1>can bloody well trust and then you tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>them the truth and,</v>

999
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:36.303
<v Speaker 1>and that way maybe you can get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and you can have someone to weave </v>

1000
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.400
<v Speaker 1>the rope of your being with and together</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make,</v>

1001
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 1>to make your joint ropes stronger.</v>

1002
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.500
<v Speaker 1>And you can have some continuity in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and you can have children.</v>

1003
00:50:48.501 --> 00:50:52.520
<v Speaker 1>And then you can have grandchildren and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can have a life man and there's</v>

1004
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:53.354
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so fortunate if you can manage </v>

1005
00:50:55.461 --> 00:50:56.300
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1006
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:58.280
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's that one.</v>

1007
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:02.450
<v Speaker 1>So what's my advice to young men seeking</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman for marriage and family?</v>

1008
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:03.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1009
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:05.360
<v Speaker 1>and also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1010
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.313
<v Speaker 1>marry someone you think would be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and that has enough sense </v>

1011
00:51:08.781 --> 00:51:11.090
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know that she wants children.</v>

1012
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.103
<v Speaker 1>Now some women don't want children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough and some women perhaps </v>

1013
00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:18.890
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also possible.</v>

1014
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.500
<v Speaker 1>But the general rule of thumb is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially once a woman's,</v>

1015
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:24.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner mid twenties,</v>

1016
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.120
<v Speaker 1>if she doesn't know that she wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>children or won't admit it,</v>

1017
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.990
<v Speaker 1>unless she has a viciously important </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

1018
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:37.490
<v Speaker 1>then she's not oriented properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically she,</v>

1019
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she isn't,</v>

1020
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.820
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't know what's important in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1021
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Now that might also be the case with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it probably is,</v>

1022
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but as a rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good one.</v>

1023
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1024
00:51:49.221 --> 00:51:52.120
<v Speaker 1>another more spontaneous one here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1025
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.963
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1026
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.843
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your advice to high achieving </v>

1027
00:52:06.201 --> 00:52:07.680
<v Speaker 1>females for finding a man?</v>

1028
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:17.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough one.</v>

1029
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Do I want to do I want to answer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>

1030
00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.590
<v Speaker 1>See the problem that high achieving </v>
<v Speaker 1>women have.</v>

1031
00:52:25.591 --> 00:52:27.180
<v Speaker 1>And I've dealt with a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1032
00:52:27.181 --> 00:52:28.014
<v Speaker 1>because one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all I've have a clinical </v>

1033
00:52:29.401 --> 00:52:32.640
<v Speaker 1>practice as most of you may know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also had a consulting practice and</v>

1034
00:52:32.641 --> 00:52:34.140
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed,</v>

1035
00:52:34.141 --> 00:52:38.970
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things I did for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time was I served as a consultant to two</v>

1036
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.863
<v Speaker 1>people who were spectacularly successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their careers because I worked with </v>

1037
00:52:42.751 --> 00:52:43.584
<v Speaker 1>an agency whose sales pitch basically to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the companies or the law firms because </v>

1038
00:52:48.121 --> 00:52:48.954
<v Speaker 1>it was mostly law firms was give us your</v>
<v Speaker 1>really high achieving people and we'll </v>

1039
00:52:52.201 --> 00:52:53.034
<v Speaker 1>help them sort out their lives even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make them even more productive and </v>

1040
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:57.353
<v Speaker 1>valuable than they already are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't need much of an increment </v>

1041
00:52:59.551 --> 00:53:00.384
<v Speaker 1>in the value of someone who's high </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieving to justify that from an </v>

1042
00:53:02.611 --> 00:53:03.540
<v Speaker 1>economic perspective.</v>

1043
00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.373
<v Speaker 1>So I work with a lot of high achieving </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for like 15 years and I still do </v>

1044
00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:09.684
<v Speaker 1>it to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Lot of them were women and a lot of </v>

1045
00:53:13.261 --> 00:53:14.094
<v Speaker 1>them were female lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were very interesting to work </v>

1046
00:53:16.381 --> 00:53:19.140
<v Speaker 1>with because most of them were extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive and they were very,</v>

1047
00:53:19.141 --> 00:53:21.960
<v Speaker 1>very smart and they were tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1048
00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.780
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were very demanding when it came to</v>

1049
00:53:24.781 --> 00:53:28.260
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because women do tend to mate across and</v>

1050
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:29.094
<v Speaker 1>up dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're like very attractive and </v>

1051
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 1>you're very intelligent and you make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of money and you're very competent,</v>

1052
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:38.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's not a lot that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>across and there's even less that's up.</v>

1053
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:40.730
<v Speaker 1>And so that's hard on women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1054
00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 1>and it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

1055
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.610
<v Speaker 1>the way that that actually works out is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1056
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:45.803
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to Iq for women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the higher the Iq that a woman </v>

1057
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:51.204
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less likely it is that she's going </v>

1058
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:54.990
<v Speaker 1>to find a partner and they effect is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually quite pronounced.</v>

1059
00:53:54.991 --> 00:53:57.720
<v Speaker 1>And so that's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's my advice?</v>

1060
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first piece of advice probably would</v>

1061
00:54:13.371 --> 00:54:14.204
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pretend that it's not important </v>

1062
00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.890
<v Speaker 1>because it is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next piece of advice I would say</v>

1063
00:54:18.891 --> 00:54:21.500
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is practically speaking,</v>

1064
00:54:21.501 --> 00:54:22.334
<v Speaker 1>is it's a lot easier now for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find at least a potential partner than </v>

1065
00:54:26.871 --> 00:54:27.704
<v Speaker 1>it was 20 years ago because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this tremendous technology that's </v>

1066
00:54:30.981 --> 00:54:33.290
<v Speaker 1>available with regards to opening up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dating market.</v>

1067
00:54:33.291 --> 00:54:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And I would say finding the right mate </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like finding a good career,</v>

1068
00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.340
<v Speaker 1>the next good career move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's not a great analogy,</v>

1069
00:54:40.341 --> 00:54:42.860
<v Speaker 1>but a huge part of that is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>persistence.</v>

1070
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.920
<v Speaker 1>You have to kiss a lot of frogs before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find a prince,</v>

1071
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:46.783
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's one way of thinking </v>

1072
00:54:47.871 --> 00:54:49.220
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1073
00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.290
<v Speaker 1>and then I guess I would also say</v>

1074
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.690
<v Speaker 1>that's really about the best I can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1075
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.860
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1076
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:05.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a really complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look for someone that loves you and that</v>

1077
00:55:05.671 --> 00:55:06.504
<v Speaker 1>wants to take care of you and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is oriented to some degree </v>

1078
00:55:09.361 --> 00:55:12.510
<v Speaker 1>towards the same things that you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also helpful.</v>

1079
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:17.540
<v Speaker 1>But apart from the earlier things I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>about attractiveness and truth,</v>

1080
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about the best I can do.</v>

1081
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:21.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1082
00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Lauderdale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1083
00:55:22.981 --> 00:55:25.560
<v Speaker 1>this is a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I get over my fear of driving?</v>

1084
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm an adult and have no driver's </v>
<v Speaker 1>license and it's crippling.</v>

1085
00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Meet ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really important question.</v>

1086
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.140
<v Speaker 1>A lot of young adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if you're younger,</v>

1087
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:34.020
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1088
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:37.290
<v Speaker 1>don't have their driver's license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a catastrophe because</v>

1089
00:55:37.291 --> 00:55:39.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1090
00:55:39.001 --> 00:55:39.834
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's economically suicidal because it </v>

1091
00:55:41.281 --> 00:55:42.114
<v Speaker 1>makes it very difficult night if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in New York City or somewhere like </v>

1092
00:55:44.401 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1093
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.250
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you live anywhere else,</v>

1094
00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you sacrifice your autonomy by not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to drive.</v>

1095
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1096
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.913
<v Speaker 1>Kenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say take a driver's course and </v>

1097
00:55:55.501 --> 00:55:56.430
<v Speaker 1>do it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1098
00:55:56.431 --> 00:55:58.200
<v Speaker 1>who cares if you have to do it five </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

1099
00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:59.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go sit in a car for a while and pretend </v>

1100
00:56:00.901 --> 00:56:04.650
<v Speaker 1>to drive like you're a kid and then have</v>
<v Speaker 1>them drive you around the block and like</v>

1101
00:56:04.651 --> 00:56:05.484
<v Speaker 1>take it slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something that'll take you a </v>

1102
00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:08.930
<v Speaker 1>whole year to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

1103
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.823
<v Speaker 1>you're actually in a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation to advance yourself </v>

1104
00:56:12.601 --> 00:56:13.434
<v Speaker 1>psychologically because you know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something you should do that's </v>

1105
00:56:16.171 --> 00:56:17.580
<v Speaker 1>learned to drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1106
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.460
<v Speaker 1>That's challenging and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interfering with you.</v>

1107
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.653
<v Speaker 1>So you have a great opportunity right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to overcome that and to improve </v>

1108
00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:26.134
<v Speaker 1>your psychological functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say this is associated with </v>

1109
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 1>the Tarot card.</v>

1110
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.350
<v Speaker 1>The fool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look up that card,</v>

1111
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:35.890
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that the fool is often a </v>
<v Speaker 1>young man who's about in sunny day,</v>

1112
00:56:35.891 --> 00:56:38.140
<v Speaker 1>who's about to step off a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

1113
00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:39.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a good Carter,</v>

1114
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:40.293
<v Speaker 1>a bad card?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the symbolic meaning of that </v>

1115
00:56:42.731 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 1>card is that in order to make progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a fool.</v>

1116
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And you know you've already admitted </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fool,</v>

1117
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:50.500
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know how to drive.</v>

1118
00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Like you know how pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hahaha.</v>

1119
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1120
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:55.203
<v Speaker 1>The thing is you accept that is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what you're doing and you're </v>

1121
00:56:57.641 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 1>going to be a fool while you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1122
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.153
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're no where near as much of a </v>

1123
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 1>fool doing it as a fool than you are as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fool avoiding it.</v>

1124
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:09.970
<v Speaker 1>So I would say go find someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionally that can teach you how to</v>

1125
00:57:09.971 --> 00:57:10.450
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>

1126
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Find someone that's patient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them that you're nervous about it.</v>

1127
00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Start in a parking lot that's empty on </v>
<v Speaker 1>an early Sunday,</v>

1128
00:57:17.501 --> 00:57:19.210
<v Speaker 1>more sunny Sunday morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1129
00:57:19.211 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 1>where you're not going to kill anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get your damn driver's license.</v>

1130
00:57:22.241 --> 00:57:23.074
<v Speaker 1>It'll do you and unbelievably it'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll do you a tremendous amount of </v>

1131
00:57:25.901 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1132
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:28.990
<v Speaker 1>so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1133
00:57:28.991 --> 00:57:31.070
<v Speaker 1>you say there's this old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1134

1135
00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:37.383
<v Speaker 1>which means something like in filth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be found or it means what you </v>

1136
00:57:41.531 --> 00:57:42.364
<v Speaker 1>most want is where you to be found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you eat at least one look and you </v>

1137

<v Speaker 1>know where you least bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look man,</v>

1138
00:57:46.481 --> 00:57:49.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to look at your ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a driver.</v>

1139
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So go fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it'll really help you out,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're going to be often going to be </v>

1144
00:58:05.191 --> 00:58:06.024
<v Speaker 1>older people and often older guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>still know what the classic scholars </v>

1145
00:58:11.341 --> 00:58:14.400
<v Speaker 1>knew and stay away from the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists.</v>

1146
00:58:14.401 --> 00:58:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Like you might want to take a course </v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know what that sort of thing</v>

1147
00:58:17.611 --> 00:58:18.444
<v Speaker 1>is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see if you can find people who are </v>

1148
00:58:20.011 --> 00:58:22.170
<v Speaker 1>literate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really literate and who can teach you.</v>

1149
00:58:22.171 --> 00:58:23.004
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do is you shop around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to classes more than more classes </v>

1150
00:58:27.601 --> 00:58:30.270
<v Speaker 1>than you can take at least in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks of university.</v>

1151
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:31.343
<v Speaker 1>Listen to the professors and find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are telling you something </v>

1152
00:58:34.501 --> 00:58:38.040
<v Speaker 1>that you really need to know and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow them and stick with them.</v>

1153
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:42.300
<v Speaker 1>So you have to search out your own path </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be educated in university.</v>

1154
00:58:42.301 --> 00:58:44.790
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I would say is make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule.</v>

1155
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Treat university like it's a fulltime </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

1156
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Make a schedule the first week of </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

1157
00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Put in your exams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Google calendar.</v>

1158
00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Put in your assignments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a plan to,</v>

1159
00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:57.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the,</v>

1160
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.983
<v Speaker 1>to get the assignments done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start early because lots of kids end up </v>

1161
00:59:00.721 --> 00:59:03.870
<v Speaker 1>by Thanksgiving the first semester and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get so damn far behind,</v>

1162
00:59:03.871 --> 00:59:04.704
<v Speaker 1>they can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's a lot of work in </v>

1163
00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:06.840
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of reading,</v>

1164
00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.240
<v Speaker 1>and then they bail out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't make that mistake,</v>

1165
00:59:09.241 --> 00:59:10.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1166
00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:14.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a full time job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can go have fun at night,</v>

1167
00:59:14.731 --> 00:59:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more power to you.</v>

1168
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:16.793
<v Speaker 1>Go have fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what your responsibilities </v>

1169
00:59:19.981 --> 00:59:20.814
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay them out and make a plan and then </v>

1170
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 1>stay on top of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

1171
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:26.810
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll do yourself a great favor.</v>

1172
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1173
00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:29.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1174
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:37.430
<v Speaker 1>with the majority of your audience being</v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

1175
00:59:37.431 --> 00:59:38.264
<v Speaker 1>how would you characterize the few women</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are generally interested in your </v>

1176
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:41.234
<v Speaker 1>videos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it mean their masculine side might </v>

1177
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:43.154
<v Speaker 1>be preeminent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the answer to that mean </v>

1178
00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.150
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough one because it turns out that</v>

1179
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:55.151
<v Speaker 1>my primary audiences on youtube and </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube seems to be a place that's where</v>

1180
00:59:55.791 --> 00:59:58.040
<v Speaker 1>men are hanging out more than women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1181
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:59.023
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be because men are slightly </v>

1182
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:05.114
<v Speaker 1>more interested in nonfiction and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas per se than women who are more </v>

1183
01:00:09.831 --> 01:00:10.664
<v Speaker 1>interested in is fedex and fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how what the personality data </v>

1184
01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:14.264
<v Speaker 1>reveals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it might be that because youtube </v>

1185
01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has kind of an emphasis on,</v>

1186
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:23.890
<v Speaker 1>on ideas per se and non fiction ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that men more gravitate towards it.</v>

1187
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Although that is against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

1188
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't really understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1189
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:33.710
<v Speaker 1>are the women who are watching me more </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine in their orientation?</v>

1190
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

1191
01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1192
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:39.583
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not self evident to me why that </v>

1193
01:00:41.691 --> 01:00:42.524
<v Speaker 1>should be the case though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I also spend a lot of time </v>

1194
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:45.703
<v Speaker 1>talking about symbolic issues and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and aesthetics would you think would be </v>

1195
01:00:49.251 --> 01:00:50.084
<v Speaker 1>attractive to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I actually don't know the answer to </v>

1196
01:00:51.441 --> 01:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1197
01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.293
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should I do if every time I </v>

1198
01:00:56.121 --> 01:00:56.954
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily confront my problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get too overwhelmed with stress to </v>

1199
01:00:59.061 --> 01:01:00.950
<v Speaker 1>make progress solving them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1200
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1201
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:03.103
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing is take your </v>

1202
01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like let's say that,</v>

1203
01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.530
<v Speaker 1>let's take the driving example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too afraid to drive.</v>

1204
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>

1205
01:01:11.061 --> 01:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly does driving consist of?</v>

1206
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is,</v>

1207
01:01:15.021 --> 01:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>is that you have to establish some kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of relationship with a car.</v>

1208
01:01:18.081 --> 01:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1209
01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>you're not too afraid to go online and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a little investigation into what cars</v>

1210
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:24.044
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's a good car and how do they </v>

1211
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

1212
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.013
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the familiarize yourself with the car </v>

1213
01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>and then that makes you less afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

1214
01:01:31.581 --> 01:01:32.414
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I'll just go sit out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car and put my hands on the steering </v>

1215
01:01:35.301 --> 01:01:36.134
<v Speaker 1>wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't just kind of accustomed </v>

1216
01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:38.204
<v Speaker 1>myself to the idea of being in the car </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a customize accustom myself in my </v>

1217
01:01:42.171 --> 01:01:43.004
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drive around in the car and maybe I'll </v>

1218
01:01:44.691 --> 01:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>try some driving simulators online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1219
01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:49.123
<v Speaker 1>then the next thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I can find someone I can </v>

1220
01:01:50.691 --> 01:01:52.400
<v Speaker 1>trust to train me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we'll do is,</v>

1221
01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:53.293
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we'll go out to an empty parking lot </v>

1222
01:01:54.861 --> 01:01:59.480
<v Speaker 1>on a Sunday morning and I'll drive 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet and then stop.</v>

1223
01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:00.314
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be good enough for the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you want to do if you're </v>

1224
01:02:02.871 --> 01:02:03.704
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed with your problems is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to break the problems down and you </v>

1225
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.770
<v Speaker 1>and you do this by thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategically.</v>

1226
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:10.603
<v Speaker 1>You want to break the problems down into</v>
<v Speaker 1>units that are small enough so that you </v>

1227
01:02:14.781 --> 01:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>can confront them and master them with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>high degree of probability.</v>

1228
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can decompose almost every stressful</v>

1229
01:02:22.381 --> 01:02:23.214
<v Speaker 1>problem into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you have a stack of </v>

1230
01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:26.064
<v Speaker 1>paper on your desk and there's a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of monsters inside it that you don't </v>

1231
01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>want to face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1232
01:02:28.921 --> 01:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>like homework you haven't done or taxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you haven't finished your or,</v>

1233
01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:33.624
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble you're having with a </v>

1234
01:02:35.191 --> 01:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>bureaucratic enterprise that you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather avoid.</v>

1235
01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the things you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just the first day you might think,</v>

1236
01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>okay Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to avoid that.</v>

1237
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.453
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well would I be willing to take the </v>

1238
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:47.484
<v Speaker 1>papers downstairs and put them on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table and spend no more than 10 minutes </v>

1239
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>just looking at them and organizing them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might add then you ask yourself,</v>

1240
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>what would I do that?</v>

1241
01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1242
01:02:58.081 --> 01:02:59.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be good enough for today.</v>

1243
01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:02.550
<v Speaker 1>And then the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've knocked on the dragon store,</v>

1244
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1245
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:04.710
<v Speaker 1>and you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

1246
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

1247
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:06.383
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've eliminated the first part of the </v>

1248
01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:09.534
<v Speaker 1>avoidance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're on your way and the </v>

1249
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.360
<v Speaker 1>next day you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1250
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:14.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could I deal with the first page of that</v>

1251
01:03:14.731 --> 01:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

1252
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.820
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could at least look at it.</v>

1253
01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:18.654
<v Speaker 1>And the trick is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was what behavioral </v>

1254
01:03:19.981 --> 01:03:23.550
<v Speaker 1>psychologists do all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is identify the fear,</v>

1255
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:25.343
<v Speaker 1>break it down into its sub components,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay out a schedule for confronting the </v>

1256
01:03:28.591 --> 01:03:32.070
<v Speaker 1>sub components and don't burden yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than you can tolerate.</v>

1257
01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:32.904
<v Speaker 1>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make unbelievable progress that </v>

1258
01:03:34.501 --> 01:03:35.580
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1259
01:03:35.581 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 1>you have to be willing to give yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit for small achievements.</v>

1260
01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:44.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's fine because consistent small</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievements add up incrementally across</v>

1261
01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:48.690
<v Speaker 1>time into absolutely remarkable progress</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

1262
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:49.850
<v Speaker 1>it starts to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1263
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.890
<v Speaker 1>you start to get like compound interest </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it on it.</v>

1264
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1265
01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 1>so that's what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

1266
01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:56.243
<v Speaker 1>if that doesn't work and you're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed that you're just absolutely </v>

1267
01:03:58.951 --> 01:03:59.784
<v Speaker 1>in spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then one of the things that you should </v>

1268
01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>consider is that maybe you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorder,</v>

1269
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:04.674
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe things have just really </v>

1270
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:09.150
<v Speaker 1>collapsed in on you and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible problems.</v>

1271
01:04:09.151 --> 01:04:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1272
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.673
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're sick and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an ill relative and you're in </v>

1273
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.290
<v Speaker 1>real financial trouble and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployed.</v>

1274
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just too much.</v>

1275
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And so at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you need to go talk to someone and</v>

1276
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:24.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe you need to consider something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like temporary antianxiety medication or</v>

1277
01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:24.894
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant medication and to sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and strategize with someone about </v>

1278
01:04:28.621 --> 01:04:30.330
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to put your life back </v>
<v Speaker 1>on track.</v>

1279
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:31.283
<v Speaker 1>And I would say also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a situation like that and </v>

1280
01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you can't find a,</v>

1281
01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:36.670
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1282
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:37.503
<v Speaker 1>you can't find a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then try the self authoring program </v>

1283
01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:42.280
<v Speaker 1>because that's what we designed it for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1284
01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another live one.</v>

1285
01:04:44.051 --> 01:04:44.884
<v Speaker 1>Let's see here.</v>

1286
01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.610
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

1287
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I saw someone called the green bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to answer that question,</v>

1288
01:04:59.461 --> 01:05:00.294
<v Speaker 1>but it flashed by real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that a reference to bubbles' </v>

1289
01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.880
<v Speaker 1>wrestling persona?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1290
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>just out of curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering if you're a fellow trailer</v>

1291
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>park boys fan because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1292
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I love the trailer park boys and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1293
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:16.290
<v Speaker 1>because of my western Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>upbringing I suppose.</v>

1294
01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:17.350
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1295
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I missed your question,</v>

1296
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>but I like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1297
01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>your handle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1298
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.084
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1299
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:05:32.731 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>scholars who are grounded in western </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and traditional Islam?</v>

1302
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:38.620
<v Speaker 1>You should reach out to them before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>entered her z.</v>

1303
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Do sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it,</v>

1305
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:42.881

<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

1306
01:05:42.881 --> 01:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Ca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already talked to I and Hirsi Ali,</v>

1307
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to post my discussion with</v>

1308
01:05:48.371 --> 01:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>her very soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am,</v>

1309
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1310
01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>engaging in as broad a series of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogues as possible.</v>

1311
01:05:55.871 --> 01:05:56.704
<v Speaker 1>And so if you've got some people you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think are good and articulate and </v>

1312
01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:00.190
<v Speaker 1>willing to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1313
01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:01.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send their names.</v>

1314
01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Dot Peterson at U Toronto.</v>

1315
01:06:03.431 --> 01:06:04.264
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ca.</v>

1316
01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

1317
01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:08.633
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering if you have any advice </v>

1318
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:13.750
<v Speaker 1>for figuring out whether vengeance is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever a good thing or is it always bad?</v>

1319
01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.373
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1320
01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1321
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:19.343
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have clients very frequently who have </v>

1322
01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:21.624
<v Speaker 1>been seriously wronged by someone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life and maybe the wrong doing is </v>

1323
01:06:25.711 --> 01:06:26.544
<v Speaker 1>ongoing and so like they're often </v>
<v Speaker 1>possessed by the desire for revenge </v>

1324
01:06:29.881 --> 01:06:32.190
<v Speaker 1>sometimes to homicide levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1325
01:06:32.191 --> 01:06:35.970
<v Speaker 1>So then you got to think about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really carefully because you know,</v>

1326
01:06:35.971 --> 01:06:36.720
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1327
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.280
<v Speaker 1>you should forgive people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1328
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>well</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1329
01:06:41.001 --> 01:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>you should forgive people that repent.</v>

1330
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1331
01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:44.903
<v Speaker 1>And you should forgive people because be</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying the burden of the demand for </v>

1332
01:06:49.051 --> 01:06:49.884
<v Speaker 1>vengeance with you and being resentful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that is really hard on you and it </v>

1333
01:06:54.721 --> 01:06:55.554
<v Speaker 1>can cripple you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not a great move </v>

1334
01:06:56.851 --> 01:06:59.400
<v Speaker 1>psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having said that,</v>

1335
01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:01.470
<v Speaker 1>like it's not easy to distinguish the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand,</v>

1336
01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:04.170
<v Speaker 1>the desire for vengeance from the desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>for justice.</v>

1337
01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:05.273
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice system is so that you can </v>

1338
01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.980
<v Speaker 1>outsource your desire for vengeance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assist them.</v>

1339
01:07:10.981 --> 01:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>That alleviates your moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for,</v>

1340
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:15.450
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1341
01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:17.550
<v Speaker 1>going head to head with someone that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1342
01:07:17.551 --> 01:07:18.384
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a really complicated question </v>

1343
01:07:20.551 --> 01:07:24.480
<v Speaker 1>and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't answer it on a generic level.</v>

1344
01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to say it depends on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>particulars of your situation.</v>

1345
01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.153
<v Speaker 1>But vengeance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with vengeance generally </v>

1346
01:07:30.991 --> 01:07:32.640
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it produces</v>

1347
01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:33.973
<v Speaker 3>mmm</v>

1348
01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.530
<v Speaker 1>feuds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it spirals out of control.</v>

1349
01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:38.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit you,</v>

1350
01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:41.370
<v Speaker 1>you hit me twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate you four times,</v>

1351
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you stab me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1352
01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I kill your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you killed my family,</v>

1353
01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then soon the whole world's at war.</v>

1354
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:48.773
<v Speaker 1>And it's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the story of Cain and Abel </v>

1355
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:52.223
<v Speaker 1>really</v>

1356
01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:52.990
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

1357
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.823
<v Speaker 1>warns against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason that we </v>

1358
01:07:55.391 --> 01:07:56.224
<v Speaker 1>have a justice system is actually to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop people from taking vengeance on </v>

1359
01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:02.020
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know the demand.</v>

1360
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:05.020
<v Speaker 1>You remember years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Mactac to Cactus,</v>

1361
01:08:05.021 --> 01:08:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran for president.</v>

1362
01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:07.863
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he did that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really wrong is that when he was </v>

1363
01:08:10.271 --> 01:08:12.520
<v Speaker 1>governor of Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he released this guy,</v>

1364
01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I think his name was willy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

1365
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And once he was released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went out,</v>

1366
01:08:16.821 --> 01:08:17.790
<v Speaker 1>raped someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

1367
01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>if I've got the story right and Dukakis </v>
<v Speaker 1>was asked,</v>

1368
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>asked on national TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1369
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he would respond,</v>

1370
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>something like that if someone had raped</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

1371
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>like someone who was released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had raped his wife,</v>

1372
01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the right response to that question </v>

1373
01:08:32.481 --> 01:08:33.261
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1374
01:08:33.261 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to rip the guy's lungs out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1375
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'd stalk his house until I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to do that.</v>

1376
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because I'm a civilized person and I</v>

1377
01:08:42.861 --> 01:08:43.694
<v Speaker 1>understand the danger of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would cooperate with the justice </v>

1378
01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:47.534
<v Speaker 1>system and do everything I could to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that the person was brought to </v>

1379
01:08:49.641 --> 01:08:52.790
<v Speaker 1>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would do my best to reconcile</v>

1380
01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:53.624
<v Speaker 1>myself without outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though every cell in my body would </v>

1381
01:08:56.151 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 1>be crying out for vengeance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right answer.</v>

1382
01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.590
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1383
01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:02.690
<v Speaker 1>so I'll leave that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that.</v>

1384
01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave.</v>

1385
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave it at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1386
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:09.343
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1387
01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1388
01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to take good big five test.</v>

1389
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:15.104
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed there are many online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where can I find the most accurate test </v>

1390
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:18.201
<v Speaker 1>to take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1391
01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:19.034
<v Speaker 1>I would say wait three weeks or a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're going to release our </v>

1392
01:09:21.681 --> 01:09:25.060
<v Speaker 1>version of the big five aspect scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a scale that,</v>

1393
01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:26.023
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a student of mine called the young </v>

1394
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>developed while he was working in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>

1395
01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.220
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1396
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.850
<v Speaker 1>it was partly generated by an idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I had with,</v>

1397
01:09:34.851 --> 01:09:35.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

1398
01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>my business partner I mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Higgins.</v>

1399
01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:39.104
<v Speaker 1>Cause we had talked for years about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of developing a more </v>

1400
01:09:42.981 --> 01:09:46.250
<v Speaker 1>differentiated higher resolution version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the big five,</v>

1401
01:09:46.251 --> 01:09:48.530
<v Speaker 1>which had been attempted by the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1402
01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:49.490
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1403
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:52.040
<v Speaker 1>develop the neo pir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has a,</v>

1404
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.900
<v Speaker 1>which has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they call them?</v>

1405
01:09:53.901 --> 01:09:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Facets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't empirically derived.</v>

1406
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:57.163
<v Speaker 1>So if you wait a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to take the big five </v>

1407
01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 1>aspects scale test and it would give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 dimensions of personality output.</v>

1408
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good test.</v>

1409
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.713
<v Speaker 1>We've used it a lot and it's being used </v>
<v Speaker 1>very widely in the relevant scientific </v>

1410
01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:11.450
<v Speaker 1>domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The papers be very highly cited.</v>

1411
01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:14.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been cited like 600 times </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

1412
01:10:14.361 --> 01:10:15.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1413
01:10:15.601 --> 01:10:16.434
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep an eye out and that should be </v>

1414
01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:19.754
<v Speaker 1>coming real soon.</v>

1415
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.073
<v Speaker 1>So if psychedelics increase openness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness is correlated with </v>

1416
01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:26.780
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can psychedelics increase intelligence?</v>

1417
01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it.</v>

1418
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:29.743
<v Speaker 1>Most things don't increase fluid </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence really hard to get an </v>

1419
01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 1>increase in fluid intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1420
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:35.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those brain training games like </v>

1421
01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:38.480
<v Speaker 1>lumosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1422
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.943
<v Speaker 1>even if you play a lot of those games </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're very complex cognitive </v>

1423
01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:46.670
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't tend to experience an increase</v>

1424
01:10:46.671 --> 01:10:47.504
<v Speaker 1>in general intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get better at each game domain </v>

1425
01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:53.360
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem to generalize across</v>

1426
01:10:53.361 --> 01:10:55.550
<v Speaker 1>intelligence per se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1427
01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.033
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt that psychedelics increase </v>

1428
01:10:58.911 --> 01:11:02.240
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality dimension.</v>

1429
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:08.330
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question because it might be</v>

1430
01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:09.164
<v Speaker 1>that psychedelic use would increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like divergent thinking </v>

1431
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.240
<v Speaker 1>associated with like the torrance tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>of creativity.</v>

1432
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.430
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think anybody's ever tested </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1433
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And you could consider that a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

1434
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:22.470
<v Speaker 1>but I think the probability that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would increase,</v>

1435
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:25.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal intelligence is low.</v>

1436
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.033
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

1437
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.033
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements to openness that aren't </v>

1438
01:11:31.171 --> 01:11:35.200
<v Speaker 1>reducible to psychometric intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I doubt it.</v>

1439
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:36.643
<v Speaker 1>It would be wonderful if we could find </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that would increase </v>

1440
01:11:38.131 --> 01:11:38.964
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's turned out to be something </v>

1441
01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.050
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1442
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.193
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To what extent do you believe that </v>

1443
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:45.054
<v Speaker 1>discourse with moderate Muslims can lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reform of the ideology such that the </v>

1444
01:11:48.961 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 1>gap between Islamic and Western beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be bridged?</v>

1445
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're going to find out about </v>

1446
01:11:53.821 --> 01:11:54.654
<v Speaker 1>that because that's one of the things I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do over the next couple of </v>

1447
01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:57.653
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1448
01:11:57.810 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1449
01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I said this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1450
01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's worth saying again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

1451
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:08.040
<v Speaker 1>there's only three states of being there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is tyranny,</v>

1452
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:12.390
<v Speaker 1>there's slavery and there's negotiation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1453
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:15.120
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny and slavery are forms of war.</v>

1454
01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.130
<v Speaker 1>So we either enter into discourse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully with the moderate Muslims or</v>

1455
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1456
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:24.400
<v Speaker 1>where are the tyrants or they're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrants and we're the slaves,</v>

1457
01:12:24.401 --> 01:12:26.590
<v Speaker 1>or they're the slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's war.</v>

1458
01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.633
<v Speaker 1>And so we bloody well better have </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse because war is what happens </v>

1459
01:12:30.821 --> 01:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>when discourse fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1460
01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:35.710
<v Speaker 1>we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways,</v>

1461
01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:41.220
<v Speaker 1>we can't really go to war anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're so armed.</v>

1462
01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:44.200
<v Speaker 1>And increasingly that's also the case in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim world.</v>

1463
01:12:44.201 --> 01:12:45.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Pakistan,</v>

1464
01:12:45.231 --> 01:12:46.064
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's developing a pretty decent nuclear </v>

1465
01:12:47.081 --> 01:12:48.070
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our movement,</v>

1466
01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:49.083
<v Speaker 1>I'm nuclear a deterrent let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite terrifying because </v>

1467
01:12:52.391 --> 01:12:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan is one unstable and dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1468
01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

1469
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go to war with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have hydrogen bombs.</v>

1470
01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:01.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna work out very well.</v>

1471
01:13:01.361 --> 01:13:04.660
<v Speaker 1>So we bloody well better learn to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm hoping,</v>

1472
01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:06.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this biblical series,</v>

1473
01:13:06.761 --> 01:13:07.594
<v Speaker 1>which some of you may be no about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're also helping to ensure </v>

1474
01:13:10.781 --> 01:13:11.980
<v Speaker 1>that it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

1475
01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:14.290
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in parallel without,</v>

1476
01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:15.124
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do a very long series of </v>

1477
01:13:16.691 --> 01:13:20.260
<v Speaker 1>discussions with moderate Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theological,</v>

1478
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:22.210
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

1479
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:23.223
<v Speaker 1>practical to see if the gap between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic and western beliefs can be </v>

1480
01:13:26.981 --> 01:13:27.814
<v Speaker 1>bridged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better be able to be bridged because </v>

1481
01:13:29.441 --> 01:13:30.820
<v Speaker 1>we're all on the same planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1482
01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.920
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of both of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1483
01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.013
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitulation on either side isn't going </v>

1484
01:13:35.231 --> 01:13:36.460
<v Speaker 1>to work and,</v>

1485
01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:41.330
<v Speaker 1>and like blind ignorance of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dangers,</v>

1486
01:13:41.331 --> 01:13:43.880
<v Speaker 1>mutual dangers that our society's post </v>
<v Speaker 1>to one another.</v>

1487
01:13:43.881 --> 01:13:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean by that I mean,</v>

1488
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:49.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that Islam,</v>

1489
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Islamic societies are functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional societies,</v>

1490
01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:54.613
<v Speaker 1>they're threatened in that functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditionalism by radical western </v>

1491
01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:01.640
<v Speaker 1>technological and philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>

1492
01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:02.503
<v Speaker 1>just like worth threatened as Westerners</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves by our own technological and </v>

1493
01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.240
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary nature discourse,</v>

1494
01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 1>truthful</v>

1495
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.300
<v Speaker 2>discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1496
01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:15.670
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the hope for the salvation of the</v>

1497
01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:16.504
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so hopefully we'll put it into </v>

1498
01:14:17.951 --> 01:14:18.784
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1499
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:19.773
<v Speaker 2>I've met a number of moderate Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 2>already in Canada who are extremely </v>

1500
01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:24.760
<v Speaker 2>interested in this sort of thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some in the u s as well.</v>

1501
01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:27.250
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1502
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth a try,</v>

1503
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:30.670
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1504
01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.530
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another live one</v>

1505
01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>just tuned in says logic bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times should I clean my room?</v>

1506
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Clean your room until when you go in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1507
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:47.230
<v Speaker 2>you start doing things that are good for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1508
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.670
<v Speaker 2>So because cleaning it isn't just isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just organ,</v>

1509
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:54.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not just making sure that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>messy man.</v>

1510
01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.520
<v Speaker 2>It's organizing it so that it's a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're being can properly manifest</v>

1511
01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:00.604
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a place that should invite you to </v>

1512
01:15:01.961 --> 01:15:02.794
<v Speaker 2>do the things that are good for you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and show you should be </v>

1513
01:15:05.051 --> 01:15:08.200
<v Speaker 2>thinking when you have a room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're fortunate and I have to have a</v>

1514
01:15:08.201 --> 01:15:08.711
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1515
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:11.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to organize this room so that the</v>

1516
01:15:11.561 --> 01:15:12.394
<v Speaker 2>probability that all do the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I should do as maximumly </v>

1517
01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:16.240
<v Speaker 2>heightened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1518
01:15:16.241 --> 01:15:18.520
<v Speaker 2>get yourself good desk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you need a desk,</v>

1519
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.473
<v Speaker 2>get yourself a good bed that you liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like set the bloody place up so that </v>

1520
01:15:22.121 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 2>when you walk in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1521
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:24.183
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a civilized human being could really </v>

1522
01:15:25.151 --> 01:15:25.984
<v Speaker 2>live in here.</v>

1523
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.390
<v Speaker 2>And then every time you walk in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your room,</v>

1524
01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:29.224
<v Speaker 2>we'll remind you that the proper way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>behave in there is to behave as a </v>

1525
01:15:31.691 --> 01:15:33.850
<v Speaker 2>civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being responsible,</v>

1526
01:15:33.851 --> 01:15:35.230
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward looking,</v>

1527
01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:36.550
<v Speaker 2>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1528
01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:37.384
<v Speaker 2>concerned about doing what's good in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the most courageous and and </v>

1529
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:42.910
<v Speaker 2>responsible possible way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1530
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.793
<v Speaker 2>not as a two bit do gooder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's looked trying to look good in </v>

1531
01:15:45.731 --> 01:15:48.190
<v Speaker 2>front of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as someone who's tough and,</v>

1532
01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:50.140
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and able and,</v>

1533
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:53.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and caring and reliable and all of that,</v>

1534
01:15:53.561 --> 01:15:55.000
<v Speaker 2>and that's what your room should tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1535
01:15:55.001 --> 01:15:55.834
<v Speaker 2>So set the damn thing up until that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it screams at you when you walk in </v>

1536
01:15:58.781 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1537
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.620
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is my Iq?</v>

1538
01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Less than it used to be because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>declines as you age,</v>

1539
01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a lot.</v>

1540
01:16:11.071 --> 01:16:15.060
<v Speaker 2>So you start getting stupider from an Iq</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective at about 22 or 23.</v>

1541
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:16.343
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the best way to regulate that is to </v>

1542
01:16:17.821 --> 01:16:20.640
<v Speaker 2>engage in physical exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so you all know.</v>

1543
01:16:20.670 --> 01:16:21.870
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1544
01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:23.003
<v Speaker 2>both weightlifting and cardiovascular </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise are really good for the </v>

1545
01:16:25.231 --> 01:16:27.290
<v Speaker 2>maintenance of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1546
01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what my Iq is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1547
01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I had it tested at one point.</v>

1548
01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:32.493
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

1549
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:34.743
<v Speaker 2>It's in excess of 150,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know exactly where it lands </v>

1550
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.433
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>

1551
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1552
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:43.390
<v Speaker 2>what qualify that to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1553
01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:44.763
<v Speaker 2>as your intelligence increases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scatter between the different </v>

1554
01:16:47.621 --> 01:16:51.640
<v Speaker 2>subtypes of intelligence such as there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are increases.</v>

1555
01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:55.510
<v Speaker 2>So you might say that there's only one </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to be stupid,</v>

1556
01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.553
<v Speaker 2>but there's many ways to be intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm not overwhelmingly </v>

1557
01:17:01.001 --> 01:17:03.580
<v Speaker 2>intelligent from a quantitative </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

1558
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:04.833
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my gre scores for on the </v>

1559
01:17:07.061 --> 01:17:08.420
<v Speaker 2>quantitative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1560
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:11.120
<v Speaker 2>end of things for about 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>75th percentile,</v>

1561
01:17:11.121 --> 01:17:13.250
<v Speaker 2>which isn't too bad given that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1562
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:16.010
<v Speaker 2>you're competing against other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were going into graduate school,</v>

1563
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:19.990
<v Speaker 2>but there's a big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>75th percentile and 99th percentile.</v>

1564
01:17:19.991 --> 01:17:21.560
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's where it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>verbally,</v>

1565
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1566
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.850
<v Speaker 2>so I can certainly see that I have gaps </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my intelligence when it,</v>

1567
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.340
<v Speaker 2>when I'm discussing things with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have real,</v>

1568
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.380
<v Speaker 2>who are really quantitatively brilliant.</v>

1569
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:34.243
<v Speaker 2>My business partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Higgins is quantitatively </v>

1570
01:17:35.841 --> 01:17:37.020
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1571
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I've got an edge on a verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1572
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.660
<v Speaker 2>but he's definitely got an edge on me </v>
<v Speaker 2>quantitatively.</v>

1573
01:17:41.661 --> 01:17:44.600
<v Speaker 2>And I've had students like that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who like could pick up statistics.</v>

1574
01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:47.870
<v Speaker 2>I had one student who was little on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>artistic side that,</v>

1575
01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.170
<v Speaker 2>that she is a woman man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not woman.</v>

1576
01:17:51.171 --> 01:17:54.260
<v Speaker 2>She was so damn smart sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She learned how to write,</v>

1577
01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.210
<v Speaker 2>moved from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1578
01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.880
<v Speaker 2>credible writer to an excellent writer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and about four months,</v>

1579
01:17:58.881 --> 01:17:59.714
<v Speaker 2>which was stellar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she moved from not knowing a damn </v>

1580
01:18:01.071 --> 01:18:01.904
<v Speaker 2>thing about statistics to being able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach it to Harvard undergraduates had </v>

1581
01:18:04.431 --> 01:18:08.540
<v Speaker 2>an award winning level within a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that just made my jaw drop.</v>

1582
01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:09.673
<v Speaker 2>Now she had a hell of a time presenting </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself properly in public when she was </v>

1583
01:18:12.231 --> 01:18:13.790
<v Speaker 2>doing public presentations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1584
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had other gaps in her ability.</v>

1585
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:18.170
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1586
01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:20.023
<v Speaker 2>I can hold my own verbally and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>rarely in a situation where I feel like </v>

1587
01:18:23.241 --> 01:18:24.074
<v Speaker 2>I'm at a disadvantage verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's certainly not the case </v>

1588
01:18:26.721 --> 01:18:27.554
<v Speaker 2>quantitatively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel at a disadvantage very </v>

1589
01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:30.410
<v Speaker 2>frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantitatively.</v>

1590
01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1591
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.950
<v Speaker 2>I would love to hear you do a lecture </v>
<v Speaker 2>series on raising children properly.</v>

1592
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Is that something you would consider?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1593
01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:41.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1594
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:42.860
<v Speaker 2>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1595
01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm really curious to see what sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>response this book I'm going to publish </v>

1596
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:49.550
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially this chapter on,</v>

1597
01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.280
<v Speaker 2>don't let your children do anything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you dislike them.</v>

1598
01:18:52.281 --> 01:18:53.114
<v Speaker 2>Because in some sense I would say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the propositions I put forth aren't </v>

1599
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:59.840
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you would normally here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise,</v>

1600
01:18:59.841 --> 01:19:00.674
<v Speaker 2>surprise in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the cultural milieu that surrounds </v>

1601
01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:03.584
<v Speaker 2>children right now because everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their dog is afraid of disciplining </v>

1602
01:19:06.201 --> 01:19:08.060
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really stupid because,</v>

1603
01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:09.951
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

1604
01:19:09.951 --> 01:19:11.090
<v Speaker 2>His rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right word.</v>

1605
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:12.223
<v Speaker 2>Because undisciplined children are </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified and the reason they're </v>

1606
01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 2>terrified as they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1607
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:20.423
<v Speaker 2>Gotta change the battery.</v>

1608
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:23.443
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:35.360
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we're back.</v>

1610
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:37.613
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1611
01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1612
01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.233
<v Speaker 1>Mr Cuban says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it so important to have kids if </v>

1613
01:20:52.371 --> 01:20:54.920
<v Speaker 1>the world has an overpopulation problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1614
01:20:54.921 --> 01:20:57.020
<v Speaker 1>who says the world has an overpopulation</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem?</v>

1615
01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:58.573
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on whether you think that </v>

1616
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:02.143
<v Speaker 1>human brains are the kind of resource </v>
<v Speaker 1>that figures out how to do more with </v>

1617
01:21:05.301 --> 01:21:06.920
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is what I think.</v>

1618
01:21:06.921 --> 01:21:07.754
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a huge argument for years </v>

1619
01:21:08.751 --> 01:21:11.150
<v Speaker 1>between the economists and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologists.</v>

1620
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:14.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biologists often the pessimistic and</v>

1621
01:21:14.151 --> 01:21:17.000
<v Speaker 1>they basically adopt a Malthusian </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

1622
01:21:17.001 --> 01:21:17.834
<v Speaker 1>And that is that we'll continue to breed</v>
<v Speaker 1>until we exhaust the planet and doing </v>

1623
01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:24.020
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of our resources.</v>

1624
01:21:24.021 --> 01:21:25.970
<v Speaker 1>And the economists always counter that </v>
<v Speaker 1>by saying,</v>

1625
01:21:25.971 --> 01:21:26.804
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be forgetting that we can </v>

1626
01:21:28.461 --> 01:21:30.500
<v Speaker 1>constantly figure out how to do more </v>
<v Speaker 1>with less than that.</v>

1627
01:21:30.501 --> 01:21:33.860
<v Speaker 1>We're pretty damn smart and I'm afraid </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the side of the economists,</v>

1628
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:36.140
<v Speaker 1>but even more to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1629
01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:37.453
<v Speaker 1>the projections right now indicate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably peak somewhere around </v>

1630
01:21:39.891 --> 01:21:40.724
<v Speaker 1>nine or 10 billion something sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the middle of the 21st century and </v>

1631
01:21:44.031 --> 01:21:46.730
<v Speaker 1>then our population will start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decline pretty precipitously.</v>

1632
01:21:46.730 --> 01:21:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's every reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume,</v>

1633
01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:50.173
<v Speaker 1>especially at our current rate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological progress progression and </v>

1634
01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.710
<v Speaker 1>our increasing willingness to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader responsibility for the,</v>

1635
01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:01.430
<v Speaker 1>for the large scale health of the planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be able to manage that without</v>

1636
01:22:01.431 --> 01:22:02.264
<v Speaker 1>too much problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can certainly grow enough food to do </v>

1637
01:22:03.651 --> 01:22:04.484
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we put a little bit of effort into </v>

1638
01:22:05.241 --> 01:22:06.330
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1639
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:08.960
<v Speaker 1>we're going to squeeze out a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals on the way,</v>

1640
01:22:08.961 --> 01:22:09.794
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially some of the big predators </v>

1641
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.113
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mammals that are of approximately </v>

1642
01:22:13.401 --> 01:22:14.660
<v Speaker 1>our size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1643
01:22:14.661 --> 01:22:15.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1644
01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:16.773
<v Speaker 1>there's a price to be paid for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's more tigers now in </v>

1645
01:22:18.741 --> 01:22:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in case you're wondering the reason</v>

1646
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:23.840
<v Speaker 1>the wild and the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1647
01:22:23.841 --> 01:22:24.531
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1648
01:22:24.531 --> 01:22:27.740
<v Speaker 1>tigers tend to eat children and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of rough having them around.</v>

1649
01:22:28.130 --> 01:22:28.963
<v Speaker 1>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried that we're going to </v>

1650
01:22:31.371 --> 01:22:33.290
<v Speaker 1>overpopulate the planet and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1651
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:35.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and destroy everything.</v>

1652
01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.073
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically hasn't advanced since the </v>

1653
01:22:38.541 --> 01:22:40.880
<v Speaker 1>1960s because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1654
01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.373
<v Speaker 1>we are making tremendous progress in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pulling people out of the lower </v>

1655
01:22:46.191 --> 01:22:47.024
<v Speaker 1>echelons of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of terrible resource </v>

1656
01:22:49.371 --> 01:22:52.460
<v Speaker 1>misused at the lower echelons of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty distribution.</v>

1657
01:22:52.461 --> 01:22:55.330
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people have to cook with wood,</v>

1658
01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:57.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1659
01:22:57.410 --> 01:23:00.200
<v Speaker 1>that that produces a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of deforestation,</v>

1660
01:23:00.201 --> 01:23:01.700
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of thing.</v>

1661
01:23:01.701 --> 01:23:02.750
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1662
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll get her act together if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fortunate peak around 9 billion.</v>

1663
01:23:06.461 --> 01:23:07.294
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'll,</v>

1664
01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>we'll be worrying about deep population </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time some of the young,</v>

1665
01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:13.450
<v Speaker 1>younger people are old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1666
01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:18.580
<v Speaker 1>and besides you have kids cause that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of life.</v>

1667
01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:20.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1668
01:23:20.981 --> 01:23:21.814
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two things aren't related in some </v>

1669
01:23:23.741 --> 01:23:25.060
<v Speaker 1>sense as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1670
01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>So the trick is to have kids that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more good than harm.</v>

1671
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:31.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe because</v>

1672
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.740
<v Speaker 1>people aren't only consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also producers.</v>

1673
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:38.770
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of appalling that we regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves as consumers.</v>

1674
01:23:39.190 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to have kids,</v>

1675
01:23:40.751 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 1>have good kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them smart,</v>

1676
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.290
<v Speaker 1>make them tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help them be tough,</v>

1677
01:23:44.291 --> 01:23:46.420
<v Speaker 1>you don't really make them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help them be tough,</v>

1678
01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:49.510
<v Speaker 1>help them be smart health and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible and then,</v>

1679
01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'll do good and,</v>

1680
01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.230
<v Speaker 1>and that'll be good for the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and like I'm pro people man.</v>

1681
01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm not worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1682
01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:01.270
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1683
01:24:01.271 --> 01:24:02.104
<v Speaker 1>I heard a university professor once who </v>
<v Speaker 1>I also thought was completely </v>

1684
01:24:04.751 --> 01:24:05.584
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was like lecturing to a group of 18 </v>

1685
01:24:08.081 --> 01:24:08.914
<v Speaker 1>year old kids about how he and his wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>had only decided to have one child </v>

1686
01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:12.424
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to overpopulate the </v>

1687
01:24:13.361 --> 01:24:13.720
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1688
01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:18.280
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that if he'd only managed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reproduce one genetic copy of him,</v>

1689
01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:19.114
<v Speaker 1>that was probably for the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he told the whole room full of </v>

1690
01:24:21.941 --> 01:24:22.774
<v Speaker 1>18 year olds that they should really </v>
<v Speaker 1>think seriously about whether they have </v>

1691
01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:26.890
<v Speaker 1>kids and if they have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should just have one.</v>

1692
01:24:26.891 --> 01:24:28.480
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you son of a bitch,</v>

1693
01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:29.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're such a,</v>

1694
01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:30.693
<v Speaker 1>you're so dedicated to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the destruction of humanity and so </v>

1695
01:24:35.021 --> 01:24:35.854
<v Speaker 1>rife with hatred for the human race that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dare to stand in front of kids who </v>

1696
01:24:39.401 --> 01:24:41.830
<v Speaker 1>are just beginning their lives and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're such a,</v>

1697
01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:42.813
<v Speaker 1>you're a member of such a reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>species that the last thing you should </v>

1698
01:24:45.071 --> 01:24:46.720
<v Speaker 1>do is multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1699
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:47.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1700
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any wisdom in that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think the world does have an</v>

1701
01:24:51.401 --> 01:24:52.234
<v Speaker 1>overpopulation problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that there's any </v>

1702
01:24:53.861 --> 01:24:55.270
<v Speaker 1>evidence that it does now.</v>

1703
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:56.103
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that we're managing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that we should manage </v>

1704
01:24:58.271 --> 01:24:59.104
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're really wreaking havoc on the </v>

1705
01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:01.803
<v Speaker 1>oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Boyan Slat who's definitely worth </v>

1706
01:25:04.481 --> 01:25:05.710
<v Speaker 1>looking up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy on,</v>

1707
01:25:05.711 --> 01:25:10.711
<v Speaker 1>I think it's b o y a n and s l a t Dutch</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid has figured out he thinks how to get</v>

1708
01:25:12.401 --> 01:25:13.234
<v Speaker 1>rid of half the plastic in the oceans in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next five years so you can go </v>

1709
01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:17.650
<v Speaker 1>support him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a hell of a thing to do.</v>

1710
01:25:17.651 --> 01:25:18.484
<v Speaker 1>He's a real genius and there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that the burden that we're placing </v>

1711
01:25:23.171 --> 01:25:27.820
<v Speaker 1>on the our planetary resources is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be lifted and the trick is to get out</v>

1712
01:25:27.821 --> 01:25:29.110
<v Speaker 1>there and do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1713
01:25:29.111 --> 01:25:31.450
<v Speaker 1>like Elon Musk is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1714
01:25:31.451 --> 01:25:33.460
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe we're burning too many fossil</v>

1715
01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:34.294
<v Speaker 1>fields and maybe not because I think the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangers of carbon dioxide are actually </v>

1716
01:25:36.791 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 1>somewhat overstated and I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some decent evidence for that too.</v>

1717
01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.433
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard to sort it out because so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the climate change argument is </v>

1718
01:25:45.191 --> 01:25:49.360
<v Speaker 1>predicated on an underlying philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>such that if you're anticapitalist,</v>

1719
01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you believe that we're going to burn up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

1720
01:25:51.131 --> 01:25:51.964
<v Speaker 1>And that's just not helpful because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't tell if your science is right or </v>

1721
01:25:55.001 --> 01:25:57.490
<v Speaker 1>if you're just anti-western an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anticapitalist.</v>

1722
01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.593
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like I spent three years working on </v>

1723
01:26:00.941 --> 01:26:02.830
<v Speaker 1>a UN committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1724
01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:07.860
<v Speaker 1>that the Secretary Generals High Level </v>
<v Speaker 1>Panel on economic sustainability,</v>

1725
01:26:07.941 --> 01:26:08.774
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called and it produced a </v>
<v Speaker 1>report in 2013 and I spent about three </v>

1726
01:26:12.111 --> 01:26:14.570
<v Speaker 1>years reading everything I could get my </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands on,</v>

1727
01:26:14.571 --> 01:26:18.530
<v Speaker 1>on economic development and </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental sustainability and the,</v>

1728
01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.473
<v Speaker 1>the state of the planet is far less </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismal than the doomsayers would have </v>

1729
01:26:21.921 --> 01:26:24.710
<v Speaker 1>you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that the one thing that we're</v>

1730
01:26:24.711 --> 01:26:25.544
<v Speaker 1>doing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fishing out the oceans like </v>

1731
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.870
<v Speaker 1>idiotically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

1732
01:26:29.871 --> 01:26:30.530
<v Speaker 1>really awful.</v>

1733
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:34.850
<v Speaker 1>And trolling is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very damaging process.</v>

1734
01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:35.684
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that like if we left the </v>

1735
01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:40.130
<v Speaker 1>damn oceans alone for about 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd recover.</v>

1736
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:41.143
<v Speaker 1>Not The great thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The huge fish like tuna because they </v>

1737
01:26:42.861 --> 01:26:43.694
<v Speaker 1>take a long time to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But oceans would come back really </v>

1738
01:26:45.231 --> 01:26:47.930
<v Speaker 1>quickly and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we'll get smart enough to do</v>

1739
01:26:47.931 --> 01:26:50.750
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing over the next 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years because you know,</v>

1740
01:26:50.751 --> 01:26:51.584
<v Speaker 1>human beings aren't stupid and we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually only been worried about the </v>

1741
01:26:53.901 --> 01:26:58.730
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say since about 1960 it was only a</v>

1742
01:26:58.730 --> 01:27:01.580
<v Speaker 1>hundred years ago that it was more or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less self evident that the,</v>

1743
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:02.623
<v Speaker 1>the natural world was inexhaustible in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to the puny efforts of </v>

1744
01:27:05.931 --> 01:27:07.940
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1745
01:27:07.941 --> 01:27:08.774
<v Speaker 1>we only figured out that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of us to cause trouble by about </v>

1746
01:27:10.791 --> 01:27:13.880
<v Speaker 1>1960 for Christ's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long do you expect us to,</v>

1747
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:15.223
<v Speaker 1>how long do you expect it it to take us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to take care of a </v>

1748
01:27:18.141 --> 01:27:18.974
<v Speaker 1>whole planet?</v>

1749
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a pretty good job for people</v>

1750
01:27:21.861 --> 01:27:24.290
<v Speaker 1>who only stumbled onto the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be a problem,</v>

1751
01:27:24.291 --> 01:27:27.320
<v Speaker 1>something like 60 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we'll get it right,</v>

1752
01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:28.483
<v Speaker 1>especially if more and more people start</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act responsibly and truthfully and </v>

1753
01:27:31.491 --> 01:27:33.050
<v Speaker 1>all of that which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1754
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and start working for the betterment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things instead of trying to,</v>

1755
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:40.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undermine and hurt and,</v>

1756
01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:40.941
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1757
01:27:40.941 --> 01:27:44.300
<v Speaker 1>engage in identity politics and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of reprehensible,</v>

1758
01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:48.410
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1759
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.173
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts on using </v>

1760
01:27:51.531 --> 01:27:54.470
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics to help people overcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic experiences?</v>

1761
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:55.833
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1762
01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.890
<v Speaker 1>be careful because psychedelics can </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause traumatic experiences.</v>

1763
01:28:00.891 --> 01:28:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Like those things are no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1764
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:03.763
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we know enough about them </v>

1765
01:28:05.481 --> 01:28:09.890
<v Speaker 1>yet to make useful generalizations about</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hypothetical,</v>

1766
01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:11.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical utility.</v>

1767
01:28:11.571 --> 01:28:15.530
<v Speaker 1>There's some decent studies indicating </v>
<v Speaker 1>with psilocybin for example,</v>

1768
01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.410
<v Speaker 1>that it might have utility in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment of depression.</v>

1769
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's a really effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking cessation medication,</v>

1770
01:28:21.411 --> 01:28:23.360
<v Speaker 1>which is really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1771
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:24.583
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what happened was that when </v>

1772
01:28:26.571 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 1>the psychedelics burst onto the scene in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1960s,</v>

1773
01:28:29.121 --> 01:28:29.954
<v Speaker 1>they terrified us so much that like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>all recoil at their very existence and </v>

1774
01:28:34.131 --> 01:28:36.950
<v Speaker 1>then decided not to exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to figure out what they were.</v>

1775
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.903
<v Speaker 1>And I can understand that man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those things are seriously </v>

1776
01:28:39.771 --> 01:28:40.604
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're there in comprehensively </v>

1777
01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.280
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we understand them at all.</v>

1778
01:28:46.281 --> 01:28:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we understand them any </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than we understand consciousness.</v>

1779
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:52.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that they may have great </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic utility,</v>

1780
01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:56.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are viciously powerful medications</v>

1781
01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:59.210
<v Speaker 1>and weapons and so you use them at your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own peril.</v>

1782
01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jung said,</v>

1783
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I really liked because he talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic use a little bit,</v>

1784
01:29:03.781 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 1>although he was pretty old by the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychedelics burst on the scene.</v>

1785
01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:10.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said beware of unearned wisdom.</v>

1786
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.813
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked that because even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychedelics can open the gates of </v>

1787
01:29:15.571 --> 01:29:18.000
<v Speaker 1>perception and flood you momentarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1788
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:18.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with information of genuine cosmic </v>

1789
01:29:20.611 --> 01:29:21.444
<v Speaker 1>significance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that you're the sort </v>

1790
01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:23.814
<v Speaker 1>of character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not the sort of vessel that can </v>

1791
01:29:25.651 --> 01:29:29.070
<v Speaker 1>tolerate being filled with that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>divine fluid.</v>

1792
01:29:29.071 --> 01:29:30.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might just break and crack you.</v>

1793
01:29:30.931 --> 01:29:32.520
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1794
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:34.613
<v Speaker 1>approach those things with trepidation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have the same attitude </v>

1795
01:29:37.381 --> 01:29:38.214
<v Speaker 1>towards psychedelics that the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israelites had towards the Ark of the </v>

1796
01:29:40.621 --> 01:29:41.640
<v Speaker 1>covenant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that,</v>

1797
01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:43.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God was in there.</v>

1798
01:29:43.051 --> 01:29:46.030
<v Speaker 1>But if you touched it accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would die nuts.</v>

1799
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:50.580
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good general attitude.</v>

1800
01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Have with regards to any serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter with psychedelics,</v>

1801
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:57.210
<v Speaker 1>those things require respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not toys,</v>

1802
01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.220
<v Speaker 1>they're not games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not fun.</v>

1803
01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.320
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand what they are,</v>

1804
01:30:01.321 --> 01:30:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1805
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.960
<v Speaker 1>they're worth treating with tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

1806
01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:14.723
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have betrayed or let people down </v>

1807
01:30:15.721 --> 01:30:16.554
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does one move on without guilt </v>

1808
01:30:17.971 --> 01:30:19.590
<v Speaker 1>turning pathological?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1809
01:30:19.591 --> 01:30:22.260
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually fairly straightforward.</v>

1810
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:23.333
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I would say is you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>try using the past authoring program in </v>

1811
01:30:26.761 --> 01:30:28.260
<v Speaker 1>the cell for three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1812
01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:31.500
<v Speaker 1>sequence because it's actually designed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help people do that.</v>

1813
01:30:31.501 --> 01:30:33.030
<v Speaker 1>But here's the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1814
01:30:33.330 --> 01:30:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like you did something wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hurting you.</v>

1815
01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That hurts people.</v>

1816
01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.310
<v Speaker 1>And what you have to do is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out,</v>

1817
01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:42.520
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1818
01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.353
<v Speaker 1>what it was that you did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out how it was that </v>

1819
01:30:47.651 --> 01:30:48.484
<v Speaker 1>you got there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out how to change </v>

1820
01:30:50.981 --> 01:30:53.800
<v Speaker 1>your life so that you won't go there </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1821
01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.410
<v Speaker 1>You have to make amends for what you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

1822
01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.950
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily precisely to the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you did it too,</v>

1823
01:30:59.951 --> 01:31:00.784
<v Speaker 1>because maybe you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you need to start to live your life </v>

1824
01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.650
<v Speaker 1>in a way that makes amends for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done.</v>

1825
01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.633
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to let it go because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people make mistakes and torturing </v>

1826
01:31:10.271 --> 01:31:14.800
<v Speaker 1>yourself to death because you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something reprehensible and stupid isn't</v>

1827
01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:15.993
<v Speaker 1>as useful as using the experience to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform yourself into someone moral </v>

1828
01:31:20.201 --> 01:31:21.820
<v Speaker 1>and useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1829
01:31:23.530 --> 01:31:24.060
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1830
01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:26.410
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easier said than done obviously.</v>

1831
01:31:26.411 --> 01:31:28.870
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in the least taking it lightly.</v>

1832
01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.130
<v Speaker 1>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1833
01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.053
<v Speaker 1>you can do things in your life that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad and that are very hard to get </v>

1834
01:31:33.611 --> 01:31:34.480
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1835
01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1836
01:31:36.150 --> 01:31:39.960
<v Speaker 1>but adding your own misery to the misery</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world when you could be out there</v>

1837
01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:43.320
<v Speaker 1>doing good is probably not the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to atone for your,</v>

1838
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.600
<v Speaker 1>for your past sins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1839
01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.101
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1840
01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:49.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people make mistakes.</v>

1841
01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.093
<v Speaker 1>The trick is once you've made it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>admit that you've made it to learn why </v>

1842
01:31:52.351 --> 01:31:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you made it to transform yourself so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make it any more.</v>

1843
01:31:55.711 --> 01:31:58.200
<v Speaker 1>And then to go out there and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting like a proper person.</v>

1844
01:31:58.770 --> 01:32:01.310
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the reasons I'm also </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of attracted to,</v>

1845
01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.060
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some of the more fundamental elements</v>

1846
01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:04.894
<v Speaker 1>of the Christian doctrine because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a doctrine of universal forgiveness </v>

1847
01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:08.374
<v Speaker 1>that's embedded in that system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the idea there basically is that </v>

1848
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 1>when people are fallible in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a profound way,</v>

1849
01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>but if they atone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be redeemed.</v>

1850
01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:18.713
<v Speaker 1>And if they're penitent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's where the word </v>

1851
01:32:20.021 --> 01:32:21.700
<v Speaker 1>penitentiary comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from,</v>

1852
01:32:21.701 --> 01:32:23.290
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're penitent,</v>

1853
01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.453
<v Speaker 1>if they go over their conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they confess to what they've done to </v>

1854
01:32:28.421 --> 01:32:30.340
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to God in society,</v>

1855
01:32:30.341 --> 01:32:31.174
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they attempt to strike out on a </v>

1856
01:32:33.611 --> 01:32:35.380
<v Speaker 1>better path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all genuine.</v>

1857
01:32:35.381 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1858
01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:42.520
<v Speaker 1>if you don't allow people who've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes to move on,</v>

1859
01:32:42.521 --> 01:32:43.354
<v Speaker 1>then you just have to dispense with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone because everyone's made </v>

1860
01:32:45.251 --> 01:32:46.240
<v Speaker 1>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1861
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:47.103
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's difference between </v>

1862
01:32:48.641 --> 01:32:50.920
<v Speaker 1>categories of mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1863
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:57.390
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness after repentance is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral axiom.</v>

1864
01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.373
<v Speaker 1>As a female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had a great inclination start a </v>

1865
01:33:04.481 --> 01:33:05.314
<v Speaker 1>family after watching your material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm struggling with how much of that </v>

1866
01:33:07.301 --> 01:33:08.134
<v Speaker 1>drive is my own brainwashing is my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus brainwashing versus third wave </v>

1867
01:33:11.441 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 1>feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I parse that out?</v>

1868
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:19.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you parse that out?</v>

1869
01:33:20.710 --> 01:33:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1870
01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:22.323
<v Speaker 1>I would start two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would start by watching your dreams </v>

1871
01:33:25.511 --> 01:33:26.344
<v Speaker 1>and your fantasies because they can tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you things that you first of all might </v>

1872
01:33:29.981 --> 01:33:31.540
<v Speaker 1>not want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that you,</v>

1873
01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:32.523
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would also say try making a case </v>

1874
01:33:35.381 --> 01:33:36.940
<v Speaker 1>for both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1875
01:33:36.941 --> 01:33:40.480
<v Speaker 1>like a really intelligent case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that.</v>

1876
01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:41.613
<v Speaker 1>So you're trying to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you do is formulate </v>

1877
01:33:43.691 --> 01:33:44.524
<v Speaker 1>an argument where the proposition is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've been brainwashed by third </v>

1878
01:33:48.521 --> 01:33:49.354
<v Speaker 1>wave feminist and make the strongest </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible argument you can in support of </v>

1879
01:33:53.141 --> 01:33:53.974
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1880
01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:54.993
<v Speaker 1>And then put that aside and then do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse and make the strongest argument </v>

1881
01:33:58.391 --> 01:34:02.020
<v Speaker 1>you possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In favor of the idea that you're,</v>

1882
01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:05.530
<v Speaker 1>that this is your own idea and that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

1883
01:34:05.531 --> 01:34:08.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not inclined to start a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even do the third thing,</v>

1884
01:34:08.381 --> 01:34:09.214
<v Speaker 1>which is to do another argument writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about why you should have a family and </v>

1885
01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:15.280
<v Speaker 1>really like that's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1886
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:16.263
<v Speaker 1>You got three arguments there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to make each one of them is </v>

1887
01:34:18.041 --> 01:34:21.100
<v Speaker 1>strong as you possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really sweat over it.</v>

1888
01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.353
<v Speaker 1>And then what having made the arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow yourself to contemplate them for </v>

1889
01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.020
<v Speaker 1>as much time as you need and it'll start</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become clear to you.</v>

1890
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.153
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I follow your daughter's food blog </v>

1891
01:34:35.021 --> 01:34:36.880
<v Speaker 1>where she has recently talked about her </v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy.</v>

1892
01:34:36.881 --> 01:34:38.920
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts on becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather?</v>

1893
01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky me man.</v>

1894
01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:41.763
<v Speaker 1>I love kids and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get along really well with my </v>

1895
01:34:45.161 --> 01:34:46.810
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's so great.</v>

1896
01:34:46.811 --> 01:34:47.644
<v Speaker 1>I just can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they live near near me in Toronto </v>

1897
01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:54.520
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now there'd be another candidate and,</v>

1898
01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:55.633
<v Speaker 1>and that'll be great for my wife because</v>
<v Speaker 1>loves babies and my daughter will like </v>

1899
01:34:58.851 --> 01:35:00.770
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1900
01:35:01.170 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>as I said already about babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1901
01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:06.950
<v Speaker 1>they're not exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't regard myself as a baby expert,</v>

1902
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:11.420
<v Speaker 1>but once the kid is like nine months old</v>
<v Speaker 1>and older than that,</v>

1903
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:14.300
<v Speaker 1>and especially between like two and 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and teenagers too,</v>

1904
01:35:14.301 --> 01:35:16.110
<v Speaker 1>cause I like teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1905
01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:19.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like hooray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love kids.</v>

1906
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:22.620
<v Speaker 1>And so it's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I lived long enough to become a,</v>

1907
01:35:22.621 --> 01:35:24.320
<v Speaker 1>be a grandfather and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1908
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not three gorgeous dead yet or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

1909
01:35:26.871 --> 01:35:27.704
<v Speaker 1>And so hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great and hopefully it will happen </v>

1910
01:35:31.761 --> 01:35:33.080
<v Speaker 1>some more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1911
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1912
01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.900
<v Speaker 1>if dominance hierarchies select for </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes and breed them,</v>

1913
01:35:41.901 --> 01:35:46.100
<v Speaker 1>why then is Christ a celibate man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't celibacy and excuse for cowardice.</v>

1914
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>

1915
01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that's kind of odd about</v>

1917
01:35:55.161 --> 01:35:55.994
<v Speaker 1>Christ is an archetypal figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something you commented on </v>

1918
01:35:58.311 --> 01:35:59.360
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died pretty young.</v>

1919
01:35:59.361 --> 01:36:00.830
<v Speaker 1>He was only 32,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1920
01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:01.933
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and young actually attributed the </v>

1921
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:06.403
<v Speaker 1>obsession in our culture with youth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that our divine finger never </v>

1922
01:36:09.921 --> 01:36:11.510
<v Speaker 1>became mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you know,</v>

1923
01:36:11.511 --> 01:36:13.880
<v Speaker 1>we have the divine finger of God the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

1924
01:36:13.881 --> 01:36:16.790
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose would fill out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype to some degree.</v>

1925
01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is Christ a celibate man?</v>

1926
01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe you would say,</v>

1927
01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:33.213
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a situation where you can </v>

1928
01:36:34.971 --> 01:36:38.540
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice yourself for the redemption of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of mankind,</v>

1929
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.673
<v Speaker 1>maybe adding the responsibility of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual family to that is just a bit </v>

1930
01:36:42.771 --> 01:36:43.910
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1931
01:36:43.911 --> 01:36:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a bit of a Glib answer in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

1932
01:36:46.131 --> 01:36:47.900
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about it that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

1933
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:48.763
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned earlier that now and then </v>

1934
01:36:50.150 --> 01:36:50.983
<v Speaker 1>people have a calling of some sort that </v>
<v Speaker 1>supersedes other callings that they </v>

1935
01:36:54.921 --> 01:36:55.754
<v Speaker 1>could follow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in the archetypal </v>

1936
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:59.203
<v Speaker 1>representation of Christ that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that could definitely be that </v>

1937
01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:06.020
<v Speaker 1>case could be made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1938
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a sufficient answer</v>

1939
01:37:08.721 --> 01:37:09.554
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope that when I get to the point </v>

1940
01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.770
<v Speaker 1>in the biblical series that I plan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run until I get through the whole Bible,</v>

1941
01:37:15.771 --> 01:37:18.260
<v Speaker 1>if I can manage it and that upon to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years.</v>

1942
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:21.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the sort of question I'll be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to address more fully.</v>

1943
01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:22.543
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go back to the live question </v>

1944
01:37:24.051 --> 01:37:24.884
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1945
01:37:27.670 --> 01:37:28.503
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zoltan Zoltar ftw I'm a BA in political </v>

1946
01:37:31.631 --> 01:37:33.400
<v Speaker 1>science concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political theory.</v>

1947
01:37:33.401 --> 01:37:34.234
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had any job offers in anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than retail or all commission </v>

1948
01:37:36.881 --> 01:37:39.810
<v Speaker 1>sales in over a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should I be applying for?</v>

1949
01:37:40.330 --> 01:37:41.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would say is take the best job </v>

1950
01:37:44.801 --> 01:37:46.720
<v Speaker 1>you can find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be retail.</v>

1951
01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:49.270
<v Speaker 1>And I know retail jobs can be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable,</v>

1952
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but they may be better than no job at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1953
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:54.460
<v Speaker 1>If you have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a better position to find your</v>

1954
01:37:54.461 --> 01:37:55.294
<v Speaker 1>next job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would rather hire someone </v>

1955
01:37:56.911 --> 01:37:59.560
<v Speaker 1>employed that someone who isn't employed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1956
01:37:59.570 --> 01:38:02.100
<v Speaker 1>and then you're also employed and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some structure in your life.</v>

1957
01:38:02.101 --> 01:38:02.934
<v Speaker 1>And then I would also say don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimate the possibility of moving </v>

1958
01:38:06.511 --> 01:38:08.430
<v Speaker 1>up in a retail job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1959
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:09.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1960
01:38:09.451 --> 01:38:10.284
<v Speaker 1>if you're smart and hardworking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're with a company that's smart </v>

1961
01:38:12.751 --> 01:38:15.000
<v Speaker 1>enough to bloody well recognize someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1962
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.133
<v Speaker 1>the probability for advancement in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of corporate structure can be </v>

1963
01:38:18.631 --> 01:38:19.464
<v Speaker 1>really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say if you're going to </v>

1964
01:38:21.031 --> 01:38:21.864
<v Speaker 1>take a retail job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the damn thing seriously and don't </v>

1965
01:38:24.181 --> 01:38:27.710
<v Speaker 1>feel like it's beneath you because every</v>

1966
01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:29.020
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

1967
01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:29.853
<v Speaker 1>circumstance that you find yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a human being is rich enough so that </v>

1968
01:38:33.761 --> 01:38:37.690
<v Speaker 1>there's much that you can bring to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of,</v>

1969
01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:41.320
<v Speaker 1>of of useful commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1970
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:42.183
<v Speaker 1>like in a retail job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have the opportunity to learn </v>

1971
01:38:44.141 --> 01:38:47.230
<v Speaker 1>how to interact with customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the opportunity to learn how to</v>

1972
01:38:47.231 --> 01:38:48.064
<v Speaker 1>sell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are big bloody skills if you can </v>

1973
01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:52.330
<v Speaker 1>get them right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1974
01:38:52.331 --> 01:38:53.164
<v Speaker 1>you have the opportunity to learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be grateful that you're not starving to </v>

1975
01:38:55.391 --> 01:38:57.220
<v Speaker 1>death in a ditch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1976
01:38:57.221 --> 01:38:58.054
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not such a bad thing to start </v>

1977
01:39:00.431 --> 01:39:01.264
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom because then you learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the bottom is like can you learn </v>

1978
01:39:03.221 --> 01:39:06.520
<v Speaker 1>how to move forward?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say take the best job you can</v>

1979
01:39:06.521 --> 01:39:10.120
<v Speaker 1>find and then continue to look for other</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

1980
01:39:10.121 --> 01:39:11.860
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do the job right,</v>

1981
01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:14.110
<v Speaker 1>do it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things,</v>

1982
01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:15.610
<v Speaker 1>and I've had lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1983
01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:17.013
<v Speaker 1>what would you say,</v>

1984
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to call them low end jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

1985
01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:22.630
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1986
01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:23.673
<v Speaker 1>they're working class jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had lots of working class jobs in </v>

1987
01:39:25.721 --> 01:39:27.850
<v Speaker 1>my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dozens of them really.</v>

1988
01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.870
<v Speaker 1>And they're not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can learn a lot in a,</v>

1989
01:39:33.871 --> 01:39:37.060
<v Speaker 1>in a working class job and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn how to get along with your</v>

1990
01:39:37.061 --> 01:39:38.770
<v Speaker 1>employee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your peers.</v>

1991
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:39.663
<v Speaker 1>You can learn how to get along with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>supervisors and be useful to them and </v>

1992
01:39:42.821 --> 01:39:45.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe be drawn to the retention if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any sense.</v>

1993
01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a retail job and it's,</v>

1994
01:39:47.950 --> 01:39:51.400
<v Speaker 1>they're treating you like a miserable </v>
<v Speaker 1>slave and if you're doing a good job and</v>

1995
01:39:51.401 --> 01:39:52.234
<v Speaker 1>you get no credit for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like get the hell out of there as </v>

1996
01:39:53.561 --> 01:39:54.394
<v Speaker 1>fast as he can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you want to find somewhere where if </v>

1997
01:39:57.071 --> 01:39:59.050
<v Speaker 1>you work hard and you're a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

1998
01:39:59.051 --> 01:40:02.230
<v Speaker 1>that people are going to notice that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>open up doors of opportunity for you.</v>

1999
01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:04.540
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the definition of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy company.</v>

2000
01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:06.790
<v Speaker 1>And you can find that virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

2001
01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.670
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking that the retail </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs are necessarily,</v>

2002
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be there forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2003
01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:15.250
<v Speaker 1>And with a Ba you often have to start at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom,</v>

2004
01:40:15.251 --> 01:40:17.230
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that that's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to end up.</v>

2005
01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't,</v>

2006
01:40:19.091 --> 01:40:22.390
<v Speaker 1>don't feel too dismal about that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a start man.</v>

2007
01:40:22.391 --> 01:40:25.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could go into the retail job and</v>

2008
01:40:25.811 --> 01:40:26.501
<v Speaker 1>you could think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2009
01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:27.334
<v Speaker 1>like if I was really smart about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was really regarding this as an </v>

2010
01:40:29.501 --> 01:40:31.840
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I knock this out of the park?</v>

2011
01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:35.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good thing to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it beats the hell out of,</v>

2012
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:37.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there,</v>

2013
01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.040
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily doing this,</v>

2014
01:40:39.041 --> 01:40:41.200
<v Speaker 1>but feeling sorry for yourself because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2015
01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:44.350
<v Speaker 1>you've got a degree in the world isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>an opening itself up to you.</v>

2016
01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:45.603
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the retail job is opening itself </v>

2017
01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:50.410
<v Speaker 1>up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2018
01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.900
<v Speaker 1>and then you work hard on developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>your career.</v>

2019
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:55.480
<v Speaker 1>You've got a toehold in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that's,</v>

2020
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:58.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe you might regard that as naively </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic,</v>

2021
01:40:58.361 --> 01:41:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but that beats naively pessimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

2022
01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.240
<v Speaker 1>but I also do believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen this happen many times,</v>

2023
01:41:04.241 --> 01:41:06.490
<v Speaker 1>is that you can,</v>

2024
01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:07.590
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

2025
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:11.580
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your attitude is if you have yourself</v>

2026
01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:14.640
<v Speaker 1>put together properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say sorted out properly,</v>

2027
01:41:15.210 --> 01:41:16.043
<v Speaker 1>you can make a hell of a positive impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the world in a relatively low level </v>

2028
01:41:19.951 --> 01:41:21.210
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2029
01:41:21.211 --> 01:41:23.970
<v Speaker 1>cause you could make the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>walks into the store,</v>

2030
01:41:23.971 --> 01:41:24.804
<v Speaker 1>your retail operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make the next 10 minutes of </v>

2031
01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:30.750
<v Speaker 1>their life a hell of a lot more pleasant</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they might be if you were miserable</v>

2032
01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:31.584
<v Speaker 1>and resentful and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'll come back again and maybe </v>

2033
01:41:33.721 --> 01:41:34.554
<v Speaker 1>the store will thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's especially true if you start </v>

2034
01:41:36.271 --> 01:41:37.104
<v Speaker 1>working for a smaller business man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have a big effect on a small </v>

2035
01:41:39.241 --> 01:41:40.074
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking that there's no </v>

2036
01:41:41.581 --> 01:41:42.960
<v Speaker 1>opportunity there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2037
01:41:42.961 --> 01:41:46.020
<v Speaker 1>it might be your inability to construe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as opportunity.</v>

2038
01:41:46.021 --> 01:41:48.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what's interfering with it.</v>

2039
01:41:48.330 --> 01:41:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that,</v>

2040
01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:51.373
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially chain retail jobs and </v>

2041
01:41:53.461 --> 01:41:57.030
<v Speaker 1>especially if you have a dismal </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian manager,</v>

2042
01:41:57.031 --> 01:41:58.650
<v Speaker 1>that those jobs can just be hell.</v>

2043
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:59.783
<v Speaker 1>But so I wouldn't recommend staying in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>job that's hell and where there's no </v>

2044
01:42:04.741 --> 01:42:07.230
<v Speaker 1>further movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't necessarily think that you not</v>

2045
01:42:07.231 --> 01:42:10.560
<v Speaker 1>being an offer offered an opportunity if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take any job at all.</v>

2046
01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:12.870
<v Speaker 1>You got to start somewhere man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2047
01:42:12.871 --> 01:42:14.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bottom,</v>

2048
01:42:14.101 --> 01:42:14.934
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom started bad place to start </v>

2049
01:42:16.171 --> 01:42:19.710
<v Speaker 1>because he learned down there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who gets really good at business</v>

2050
01:42:19.711 --> 01:42:20.970
<v Speaker 1>across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

2051
01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.990
<v Speaker 1>knows whatever enterprise they're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom up.</v>

2052
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:27.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes them competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2053
01:42:27.661 --> 01:42:28.950
<v Speaker 1>and they don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2054
01:42:28.951 --> 01:42:29.784
<v Speaker 1>well the things that the Baltimore too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not good enough for me because </v>

2055
01:42:33.421 --> 01:42:36.120
<v Speaker 1>the things at the bottom are really what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business rests on.</v>

2056
01:42:36.121 --> 01:42:38.040
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know how those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2057
01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:39.203
<v Speaker 1>And then you also have some sympathy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are maybe stuck in those </v>

2058
01:42:41.521 --> 01:42:43.530
<v Speaker 1>positions forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you wouldn't be,</v>

2059
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be.</v>

2060
01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:46.523
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2061
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.500
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2062
01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2063
01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:52.300
<v Speaker 1>let's see here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What time is it?</v>

2064
01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Nine oh two and we started at seven 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to nine 30.</v>

2065
01:42:56.291 --> 01:42:59.140
<v Speaker 1>That's probably good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's about 20 more minutes.</v>

2066
01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fab fab.</v>

2067
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:08.280
<v Speaker 1>You ballinger advice for a breakup after</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years?</v>

2068
01:43:08.281 --> 01:43:11.460
<v Speaker 1>It's been 1.5 years and I still believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the one,</v>

2069
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:17.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say she's at one and look,</v>

2070
01:43:17.971 --> 01:43:20.280
<v Speaker 1>some people really pair bond hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2071
01:43:20.281 --> 01:43:21.114
<v Speaker 1>to put it in crass biological terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if she's moved on and that's </v>

2072
01:43:25.171 --> 01:43:26.190
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2073
01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:31.020
<v Speaker 1>then I would say start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start going out with other people,</v>

2074
01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really and,</v>

2075
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:33.833
<v Speaker 1>and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because she's the one doesn't </v>

2076
01:43:36.821 --> 01:43:39.220
<v Speaker 1>necessarily mean she's the only one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2077
01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:40.353
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and a half years that's long enough </v>

2078
01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:46.020
<v Speaker 1>so that you should be starting to</v>

2079
01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.080
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2080
01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:47.913
<v Speaker 1>To Act as if you're getting over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're having real trouble with </v>

2081
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.883
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think you should probably find </v>

2082
01:43:52.971 --> 01:43:56.420
<v Speaker 1>someone to talk to and talk that out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what your strategy is.</v>

2083
01:43:56.421 --> 01:43:58.190
<v Speaker 1>But I would say get the hell back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

2084
01:43:58.191 --> 01:43:59.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2085
01:43:59.391 --> 01:44:00.224
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's part of you that still </v>

2086
01:44:02.661 --> 01:44:07.340
<v Speaker 1>thinks that there's some possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rekindling the relationship and fry.</v>

2087
01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:08.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's possible.</v>

2088
01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 1>It seems unlikely because I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would.</v>

2089
01:44:12.730 --> 01:44:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2090
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:14.303
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you would be asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that question if you thought that was a </v>

2091
01:44:16.291 --> 01:44:17.124
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would say I'm going go find some </v>

2092
01:44:21.090 --> 01:44:22.030
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2093
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:23.083
<v Speaker 1>and admit to the possibility that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be someone else out there that </v>

2094
01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:29.093
<v Speaker 1>will work with you and get on with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life because you're going to be old a </v>

2095
01:44:31.741 --> 01:44:32.574
<v Speaker 1>lot faster than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to be stuck in </v>

2096
01:44:35.041 --> 01:44:35.874
<v Speaker 1>stacy's any longer than necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you've lost the woman and </v>

2097
01:44:38.761 --> 01:44:43.080
<v Speaker 1>you've lost your time and losing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman is bad enough.</v>

2098
01:44:43.081 --> 01:44:46.170
<v Speaker 1>But losing the woman and your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really not good at all.</v>

2099
01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:50.470
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2100
01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:51.413
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get over hiding something </v>

2101
01:44:53.851 --> 01:44:54.684
<v Speaker 1>because of the fear that people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of you differently or treat you </v>

2102
01:44:56.401 --> 01:44:58.470
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for family members and others</v>

2103
01:44:58.471 --> 01:44:59.304
<v Speaker 1>close to you.</v>

2104
01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2105
01:45:01.170 --> 01:45:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Quintin good width.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2106
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:06.423
<v Speaker 1>Quentin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to say about that </v>

2107
01:45:07.411 --> 01:45:10.050
<v Speaker 1>because it depends on what your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you're hiding,</v>

2108
01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:12.540
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2109
01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not detailed enough.</v>

2110
01:45:19.090 --> 01:45:21.280
<v Speaker 1>The devil with questions like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2111
01:45:21.281 --> 01:45:23.980
<v Speaker 1>the devil is often really seriously in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the details.</v>

2112
01:45:23.981 --> 01:45:25.840
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2113
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:29.170
<v Speaker 1>if you think that you're hiding it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of cowardice,</v>

2114
01:45:29.171 --> 01:45:31.420
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like you might have a real problem,</v>

2115
01:45:31.421 --> 01:45:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're hiding something that really</v>

2116
01:45:33.191 --> 01:45:34.024
<v Speaker 1>would cause serious repercussions in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your social circumstances and in your </v>

2117
01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:38.620
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case,</v>

2118
01:45:38.621 --> 01:45:39.454
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hell of a tough thing to deal </v>

2119
01:45:40.151 --> 01:45:42.520
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say you need to find someone</v>

2120
01:45:42.521 --> 01:45:43.354
<v Speaker 1>that you can talk to that you trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wise and maybe that'll be a </v>

2121
01:45:45.821 --> 01:45:46.780
<v Speaker 1>professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2122
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:48.383
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I would say the same thing that I </v>

2123
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:52.143
<v Speaker 1>mentioned earlier to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to someone who had a similar question </v>

2124
01:45:53.951 --> 01:45:57.130
<v Speaker 1>about strategy is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down a strategy.</v>

2125
01:45:57.490 --> 01:46:01.900
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>too that's useful is imagine the worst.</v>

2126
01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:02.733
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you reveal whatever this is and </v>

2127
01:46:04.571 --> 01:46:07.720
<v Speaker 1>the worst happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lay out the worst.</v>

2128
01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:09.360
<v Speaker 1>So you understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2129
01:46:09.361 --> 01:46:13.780
<v Speaker 1>it'd be be realistic about it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how you would handle it.</v>

2130
01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:15.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2131
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:16.383
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well everyone now hates me so much I </v>

2132
01:46:18.101 --> 01:46:22.330
<v Speaker 1>have to move to a new town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you could do that,</v>

2133
01:46:22.331 --> 01:46:23.164
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once you know that you could do </v>

2134
01:46:24.701 --> 01:46:25.534
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you wouldn't be so afraid </v>

2135
01:46:26.591 --> 01:46:27.424
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's often the case that people are </v>

2136
01:46:29.801 --> 01:46:30.634
<v Speaker 1>terrified about the terrible things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might happen is cause they won't really </v>

2137
01:46:33.221 --> 01:46:36.220
<v Speaker 1>think through what the terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and what they would do.</v>

2138
01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:37.653
<v Speaker 1>And so think it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think the catastrophe through and think </v>

2139
01:46:40.991 --> 01:46:42.910
<v Speaker 1>about how you would cope with it if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

2140
01:46:42.911 --> 01:46:44.650
<v Speaker 1>And that should encourage you to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

2141
01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:48.790
<v Speaker 1>So Benjamin would question what's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with maslow's?</v>

2142
01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.633
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with maslow's hierarchy in </v>

2143
01:46:51.661 --> 01:46:52.494
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just writing about that yesterday </v>

2144
01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:56.100
<v Speaker 1>day before and in my new book by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2145
01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:57.413
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maslow presumes that you have to meet </v>

2146
01:47:00.241 --> 01:47:02.700
<v Speaker 1>your material needs before you can meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>your spiritual needs.</v>

2147
01:47:02.701 --> 01:47:04.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not right.</v>

2148
01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:06.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

2149
01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:07.843
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the read Viktor Frankl's man's search </v>

2150
01:47:10.771 --> 01:47:12.660
<v Speaker 1>for meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good antidote to that.</v>

2151
01:47:12.930 --> 01:47:13.763
<v Speaker 1>And also again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say read Social Knutson's Gulag </v>

2152
01:47:16.051 --> 01:47:16.884
<v Speaker 1>archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially volume two because Social </v>

2153
01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:20.813
<v Speaker 1>Knutsen has done a tremendous job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispelling the idea that material </v>

2154
01:47:25.171 --> 01:47:26.004
<v Speaker 1>security and comfort is a prerequisite </v>
<v Speaker 1>to higher order psychological and </v>

2155
01:47:31.171 --> 01:47:33.240
<v Speaker 1>spiritual being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2156
01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:38.430
<v Speaker 1>so I think what's wrong with maslow's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

2157
01:47:38.431 --> 01:47:39.264
<v Speaker 1>the idea of maslow's hierarchy is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's far too materialistic and its </v>

2158
01:47:43.711 --> 01:47:46.530
<v Speaker 1>fundamental orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now having said that,</v>

2159
01:47:46.531 --> 01:47:47.364
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that there's nothing </v>

2160
01:47:48.151 --> 01:47:48.984
<v Speaker 1>useful in maslow's thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that his discussions of self </v>

2161
01:47:52.351 --> 01:47:56.190
<v Speaker 1>actualized persons are actually very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and the idea that,</v>

2162
01:47:56.490 --> 01:47:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are higher levels of human,</v>

2163
01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:59.393
<v Speaker 1>human psychological and spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and he was thinking about </v>

2164
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:05.010
<v Speaker 1>more secularly I think is also extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

2165
01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:10.050
<v Speaker 1>But I think the idea of the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you progress through the hierarchy</v>

2166
01:48:10.051 --> 01:48:10.884
<v Speaker 1>is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's a socialist idea in </v>

2167
01:48:12.961 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 1>some sense because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a utopian idea,</v>

2168
01:48:15.871 --> 01:48:16.704
<v Speaker 1>because the idea is the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring about the perfect human societies </v>

2169
01:48:19.381 --> 01:48:22.920
<v Speaker 1>by making sure that everyone's material </v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing is,</v>

2170
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:23.843
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2171
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:25.500
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2172
01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:28.230
<v Speaker 1>is established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

2173
01:48:28.231 --> 01:48:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I know people need to eat and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they need security and all of that.</v>

2174
01:48:31.591 --> 01:48:32.424
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But assuming that that's a prerequisite </v>

2175
01:48:36.151 --> 01:48:36.984
<v Speaker 1>for spiritual development is an error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and assuming that it's a necessary </v>

2176
01:48:40.921 --> 01:48:43.420
<v Speaker 1>prerequisite is even a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2177
01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:45.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>egregious error,</v>

2178
01:48:45.661 --> 01:48:46.494
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you further explain your </v>

2179
01:48:49.411 --> 01:48:52.890
<v Speaker 1>disapproval of Ayn Rand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really disapprove of Ayn rand.</v>

2180
01:48:52.891 --> 01:48:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I liked reading her novels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2181
01:48:54.421 --> 01:48:59.421
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's funny because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>given Ayn rand's novels by a woman named</v>

2182
01:48:59.521 --> 01:49:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Rachel Notley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the mother,</v>

2183
01:49:01.351 --> 01:49:02.184
<v Speaker 1>was the mother of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because unfortunately she's deceased of </v>

2184
01:49:04.741 --> 01:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>the current socialist premier of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alberta.</v>

2185
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Rachel Notley who was a friend of mine </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was kid and it was her mother who</v>

2186
01:49:13.561 --> 01:49:14.394
<v Speaker 1>has an avowed socialist of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the pro working class classical type </v>

2187
01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:18.923
<v Speaker 1>who gave me Ayn rand as well as George </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orwell and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and </v>

2188
01:49:23.581 --> 01:49:24.414
<v Speaker 1>eldest Huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole raft of really high quality </v>

2189
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.900
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literary books.</v>

2190
01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:30.670
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wanted to be,</v>

2191
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:32.890
<v Speaker 1>she wanted to expose me to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

2192
01:49:32.891 --> 01:49:36.000
<v Speaker 1>And like I found Ayn rand's books I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really liked reading of,</v>

2193
01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:38.190
<v Speaker 1>they're really romantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2194
01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:39.120
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2195
01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:41.670
<v Speaker 1>they're interesting adventure stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

2196
01:49:41.671 --> 01:49:43.500
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ayn rand had a point.</v>

2197
01:49:43.501 --> 01:49:44.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a hell.</v>

2198
01:49:44.731 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Her family had a hell of a time with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>communists in the Soviet Union.</v>

2199
01:49:48.041 --> 01:49:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Like she had reasons for doing what she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>

2200
01:49:49.961 --> 01:49:50.794
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with Ayn rand as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>literary figure is that all here heroes </v>

2201
01:49:55.031 --> 01:49:58.240
<v Speaker 1>are the same people and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely heroic.</v>

2202
01:49:58.450 --> 01:50:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her villains are the same people,</v>

2203
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.550
<v Speaker 1>the same person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in different bodies.</v>

2204
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:06.580
<v Speaker 1>And they're all almost completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible.</v>

2205
01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2206
01:50:08.050 --> 01:50:08.883
<v Speaker 1>one of the hallmarks of high quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature is that the battle between </v>

2207
01:50:12.761 --> 01:50:17.761
<v Speaker 1>good and evil isn't just fought out </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the good guys and the bad guys.</v>

2208
01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:19.173
<v Speaker 1>Like at a cultural level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be an identity politics </v>

2209
01:50:21.551 --> 01:50:26.551
<v Speaker 1>issues say and that it's not the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy as an individual who's like the next</v>

2210
01:50:26.981 --> 01:50:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Messiah in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2211
01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:30.610
<v Speaker 1>in Ayn rand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the capitalist Messiah.</v>

2212
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.470
<v Speaker 1>And then the evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible,</v>

2213
01:50:32.471 --> 01:50:34.990
<v Speaker 1>satanic figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2214
01:50:34.991 --> 01:50:35.824
<v Speaker 1>all of the good traits are embodied in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one and all of the bad traits in the </v>

2215
01:50:38.081 --> 01:50:40.870
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in really sophisticated literature.</v>

2216
01:50:40.871 --> 01:50:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I would say that even the villains have </v>
<v Speaker 1>good qualities.</v>

2217
01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Like villains are way more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're also interestingly good and</v>

2218
01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:53.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk the cove in crime and punishment is</v>

2219
01:50:53.381 --> 01:50:54.214
<v Speaker 1>a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of dusty huskies villains for </v>

2220
01:50:55.871 --> 01:50:59.650
<v Speaker 1>that matter because they have deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>admirable qualities.</v>

2221
01:50:59.650 --> 01:51:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Like Ivan for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's not exactly a villain but,</v>

2222
01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:04.810
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he certainly atheistic,</v>

2223
01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:07.690
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which put them at Owens with Dostoyevsky</v>

2224
01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:10.000
<v Speaker 1>in the brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karamazov I mean,</v>

2225
01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Ivan has everything going for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's good looking.</v>

2226
01:51:12.221 --> 01:51:13.360
<v Speaker 1>He's dashing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's young,</v>

2227
01:51:13.361 --> 01:51:14.230
<v Speaker 1>he's brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2228
01:51:14.231 --> 01:51:14.981
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2229
01:51:14.981 --> 01:51:16.930
<v Speaker 1>he's got military training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

2230
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.003
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2231
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:20.110
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's clearheaded,</v>

2232
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:25.600
<v Speaker 1>he's a hell of a villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great villain man and Ayn rand.</v>

2233
01:51:25.601 --> 01:51:26.434
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just too formulaic in my </v>

2234
01:51:30.551 --> 01:51:31.384
<v Speaker 1>estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it starts to verge on the </v>

2235
01:51:32.501 --> 01:51:33.334
<v Speaker 1>ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was primarily motivated by </v>

2236
01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:38.830
<v Speaker 1>making a political point rather than by </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing literature in my estimation.</v>

2237
01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.050
<v Speaker 1>So that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2238
01:51:41.051 --> 01:51:43.750
<v Speaker 1>and having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say I got great pleasure in</v>

2239
01:51:43.751 --> 01:51:46.390
<v Speaker 1>reading Ayn rand's books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not,</v>

2240
01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't precisely disapprove of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She isn't,</v>

2241
01:51:49.481 --> 01:51:50.314
<v Speaker 1>she just isn't a top rate philosopher </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's also not a top rate literary </v>

2242
01:51:54.911 --> 01:51:55.300
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>

2243
01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:56.133
<v Speaker 1>And those are the reasons she's little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit to propaganda stick and her </v>

2244
01:52:00.641 --> 01:52:04.660
<v Speaker 1>characters are too unidimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2245
01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:08.110
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2246
01:52:08.111 --> 01:52:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Let's see here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2247
01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:12.460
<v Speaker 1>fresh sweet says Jordan is a mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>midget.</v>

2248
01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tall,</v>

2249
01:52:14.441 --> 01:52:18.610
<v Speaker 1>so I at least I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got some elements of me that aren't</v>

2250
01:52:18.611 --> 01:52:20.200
<v Speaker 1>entirely midget likes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2251
01:52:20.590 --> 01:52:21.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2252
01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:23.673
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what else do I have to say about </v>

2253
01:52:24.641 --> 01:52:25.870
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2254
01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:30.430
<v Speaker 1>while it's conceivable that fresh sweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a mental giant by comparison,</v>

2255
01:52:30.431 --> 01:52:31.264
<v Speaker 1>but I doubt if he or she would have used</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in salt if that happened to be the </v>

2256
01:52:35.501 --> 01:52:37.780
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see,</v>

2257
01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:42.850
<v Speaker 1>someone said please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I say their name?</v>

2258
01:52:43.930 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is no,</v>

2259
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.843
<v Speaker 2>because I've</v>

2260
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:48.303
<v Speaker 3>mmm,</v>

2261
01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:52.880
<v Speaker 2>lost your question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I read your question,</v>

2262
01:52:52.881 --> 01:52:55.310
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to say your name so </v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

2263
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:57.590
<v Speaker 2>that's ironic I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2264
01:52:57.591 --> 01:52:58.550
<v Speaker 2>sharp girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sikhs.</v>

2265
01:52:58.551 --> 01:53:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Are there evil persons with no redeeming</v>
<v Speaker 2>qualities?</v>

2266
01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:04.773
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2267
01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.030
<v Speaker 2>that would be just too simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2268
01:53:11.150 --> 01:53:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be nice if that was the case,</v>

2269
01:53:12.951 --> 01:53:13.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2270
01:53:13.821 --> 01:53:14.654
<v Speaker 2>Not exactly nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but know that it just isn't how life </v>

2271
01:53:16.371 --> 01:53:17.204
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2272
01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.640
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as social knits and said,</v>

2273
01:53:19.641 --> 01:53:21.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the best person,</v>

2274
01:53:21.141 --> 01:53:24.770
<v Speaker 2>there's still some uprooted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uprooted corner of evil.</v>

2275
01:53:24.771 --> 01:53:28.880
<v Speaker 2>And even in the person who's gone as far</v>
<v Speaker 2>down the rabbit hole as you can possibly</v>

2276
01:53:28.881 --> 01:53:31.760
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some still shining element of,</v>

2277
01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:32.773
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the divine quality of humanity that </v>

2278
01:53:34.761 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 2>could be communicated with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at least that's how it looks to me.</v>

2279
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:41.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2280
01:53:44.230 --> 01:53:46.360
<v Speaker 2>How do you make time to read for </v>
<v Speaker 2>leisure?</v>

2281
01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now I don't,</v>

2282
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:49.263
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't make enough time to read period </v>

2283
01:53:51.550 --> 01:53:52.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hope to rectify that.</v>

2284
01:53:52.991 --> 01:53:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Sue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and mostly I'm writing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but when I do read most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read before I go to bed,</v>

2288
01:54:03.070 --> 01:54:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I go to bed and I read for half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour or something like that.</v>

2289
01:54:06.281 --> 01:54:07.114
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

<v Speaker 2>the services to get me through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm glad I found you online.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hmm,</v>

2316
01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:11.870
<v Speaker 2>what do I do for fun?</v>

2317
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I build things in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like doing that.</v>

2318
01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I play ping pong with my son,</v>

2319
01:55:21.591 --> 01:55:24.400
<v Speaker 2>except I taught him how to play ping </v>
<v Speaker 2>pong and now he's way better than me,</v>

2320
01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:27.560
<v Speaker 2>just stumps me in and that any laughs a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot about that.</v>

2321
01:55:27.561 --> 01:55:29.570
<v Speaker 2>So that's very annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2322
01:55:29.630 --> 01:55:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I spend time with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although not enough,</v>

2323
01:55:31.611 --> 01:55:35.570
<v Speaker 2>especially in the last seven months </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've been completely overwhelmed</v>

2324
01:55:35.571 --> 01:55:37.290
<v Speaker 2>by all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2325
01:55:41.250 --> 01:55:42.570
<v Speaker 2>what else do I do for fun?</v>

2326
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Snack on social justice warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of entertaining.</v>

2327
01:55:48.130 --> 01:55:48.963
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

2328
01:55:53.410 --> 01:55:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Spend time with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the biggest thing.</v>

2329
01:55:55.781 --> 01:55:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I talk with my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2330
01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard sorts of things like that.</v>

2331
01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:01.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find most of what I do in my life </v>

2332
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:06.940
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily engaging and </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining.</v>

2333
01:56:06.941 --> 01:56:08.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2334
01:56:08.650 --> 01:56:11.950
<v Speaker 1>except when I'm overwhelmed by it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been,</v>

2335
01:56:12.130 --> 01:56:15.010
<v Speaker 1>that's happened to be partly because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mood issues I talked about,</v>

2336
01:56:15.011 --> 01:56:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but also partly because like the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven or eight months,</v>

2337
01:56:17.711 --> 01:56:21.970
<v Speaker 1>it's really been</v>
<v Speaker 1>both surreal and overwhelming.</v>

2338
01:56:22.150 --> 01:56:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually so engaged in what I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2339
01:56:24.190 --> 01:56:25.540
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2340
01:56:27.410 --> 01:56:28.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2341
01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I'm not looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding exactly.</v>

2342
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:33.990
<v Speaker 1>It's that I have a bunch of it already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle Mitchel says,</v>

2343
01:56:33.991 --> 01:56:37.020
<v Speaker 1>what should I do if my girlfriend isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfying me sexually?</v>

2344
01:56:37.170 --> 01:56:38.880
<v Speaker 1>How do I get her to progress with me?</v>

2345
01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2346
01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:45.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a place that you can usually use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really use both discourse and reward.</v>

2347
01:56:45.701 --> 01:56:46.241
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2348
01:56:46.241 --> 01:56:47.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

2349
01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:50.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the first question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2350
01:56:51.370 --> 01:56:56.370
<v Speaker 1>could you make your wants known and are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there ways that you can express the fact</v>

2351
01:56:56.651 --> 01:57:01.651
<v Speaker 1>that you're happy about that that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be compatible with the person's desires?</v>

2352
01:57:01.811 --> 01:57:02.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of,</v>

2353
01:57:02.531 --> 01:57:05.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of that is often lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

2354
01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:06.393
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could also do what skinner did when </v>

2355
01:57:09.821 --> 01:57:13.150
<v Speaker 1>he was training rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is watch your partner,</v>

2356
01:57:14.530 --> 01:57:16.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during sexual encounters and otherwise,</v>

2357
01:57:16.631 --> 01:57:19.690
<v Speaker 1>and when they do something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like and really want them to keep</v>

2358
01:57:19.691 --> 01:57:20.980
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let them know,</v>

2359
01:57:21.010 --> 01:57:22.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's intelligent use of reward.</v>

2360
01:57:22.871 --> 01:57:26.470
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of it is just discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2361
01:57:26.471 --> 01:57:27.304
<v Speaker 1>it's like first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what you want and discuss </v>

2362
01:57:29.591 --> 01:57:31.750
<v Speaker 1>with the person what you want and find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what,</v>

2363
01:57:31.751 --> 01:57:34.690
<v Speaker 1>why they're objecting and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some negotiation.</v>

2364
01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:37.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a good rule of thumb.</v>

2365
01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I think for especially for young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are engaging in new relationships is</v>

2366
01:57:41.651 --> 01:57:42.484
<v Speaker 1>it don't do anything sexually with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone that you couldn't talk to them </v>

2367
01:57:46.361 --> 01:57:49.420
<v Speaker 1>about before you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a funny one.</v>

2368
01:57:49.421 --> 01:57:52.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's true too.</v>

2369
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

2370
01:57:59.651 --> 01:58:02.620
<v Speaker 1>what are your thoughts on George Orwell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

2371
01:58:02.890 --> 01:58:04.810
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more power to him.</v>

2372
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:07.480
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was really something like he,</v>

2373
01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:10.120
<v Speaker 1>he was a major influence on me and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2374
01:58:10.121 --> 01:58:10.954
<v Speaker 1>he was beating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was climbing the warning bell about </v>

2375
01:58:13.991 --> 01:58:15.610
<v Speaker 1>communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2376
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:21.100
<v Speaker 1>a good 30 years before the corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 1>French intellectuals woke up,</v>

2377
01:58:21.101 --> 01:58:22.810
<v Speaker 1>had admitted that they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>worshiping,</v>

2378
01:58:22.811 --> 01:58:23.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2379
01:58:23.701 --> 01:58:24.534
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a murderous tyrant for the last almost </v>

2380
01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:30.213
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really go George Orwell man and he's </v>

2381
01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:34.840
<v Speaker 1>such a clear writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great scs.</v>

2382
01:58:34.841 --> 01:58:35.674
<v Speaker 1>Like a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real example for anyone who wants to </v>

2383
01:58:37.541 --> 01:58:39.790
<v Speaker 1>learn to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Orwell like hemingway,</v>

2384
01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2385
01:58:41.410 --> 01:58:45.100
<v Speaker 1>although I think that or Orwell was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater figure than hemingway.</v>

2386
01:58:45.101 --> 01:58:45.934
<v Speaker 1>All things considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway could really write it tight </v>

2387
01:58:47.981 --> 01:58:49.570
<v Speaker 1>sentence man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he could,</v>

2388
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:50.583
<v Speaker 1>he could say a lot with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with very few words and that's really </v>

2389
01:58:53.261 --> 01:58:55.630
<v Speaker 1>something worth worth taking a look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2390
01:58:57.610 --> 01:59:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tjf Advice.</v>

2391
01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:01.053
<v Speaker 1>Advice for aspiring academics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically philosophy graduate </v>

2392
01:59:03.311 --> 01:59:06.730
<v Speaker 1>students that read every God damn thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get your hands on.</v>

2393
01:59:06.731 --> 01:59:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read all the great philosophers and,</v>

2394
01:59:09.821 --> 01:59:10.654
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make notes and write about them as </v>

2395
01:59:12.701 --> 01:59:13.534
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Till you understand them until you have </v>

2396
01:59:14.411 --> 01:59:16.090
<v Speaker 1>them under your belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2397
01:59:16.150 --> 01:59:16.983
<v Speaker 1>and do that at the same time while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going through getting your </v>

2398
01:59:19.001 --> 01:59:20.050
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2399
01:59:20.051 --> 01:59:20.884
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of the education that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get in university at graduate level </v>

2400
01:59:24.221 --> 01:59:25.054
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to be very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The courses are generally not very good </v>

2401
01:59:27.821 --> 01:59:30.850
<v Speaker 1>in my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

2402
01:59:30.970 --> 01:59:33.310
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's great people to read.</v>

2403
01:59:33.311 --> 01:59:34.780
<v Speaker 1>So start at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2404
01:59:34.810 --> 01:59:37.450
<v Speaker 1>go back to socrates and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2405
01:59:37.810 --> 01:59:41.210
<v Speaker 1>and read everything you can get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands on and,</v>

2406
01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:42.153
<v Speaker 1>and do the work necessary so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the philosophers and you can </v>

2407
01:59:44.921 --> 01:59:45.754
<v Speaker 1>start like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found real useful way to start </v>

2408
01:59:47.621 --> 01:59:48.454
<v Speaker 1>introducing yourself to philosophers is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickup and this is good for everyone </v>

2409
01:59:52.031 --> 01:59:54.390
<v Speaker 1>else who's out there to pick up like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2410
01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:57.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plato for dummies or,</v>

2411
01:59:57.321 --> 01:59:59.560
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Nicha for dummies or you know,</v>

2412
01:59:59.561 --> 02:00:01.600
<v Speaker 1>one of those illustrated introductions.</v>

2413
02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good start.</v>

2414
02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:06.250
<v Speaker 1>You start slow and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start building up your expertise and</v>

2415
02:00:06.251 --> 02:00:08.050
<v Speaker 1>move towards the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual,</v>

2416
02:00:08.110 --> 02:00:08.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual difficult writings </v>

2417
02:00:09.731 --> 02:00:11.260
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2418
02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:14.523
<v Speaker 1>how do you motivate yourself to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you do not enjoy but you </v>

2419
02:00:16.901 --> 02:00:19.000
<v Speaker 1>deem important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like studying for exams?</v>

2420
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2421
02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:25.840
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself what would motivate you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2422
02:00:25.841 --> 02:00:26.674
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be studying eight hours a day </v>

2423
02:00:29.081 --> 02:00:31.420
<v Speaker 1>cause that isn't going to work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do it anyways.</v>

2424
02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:32.493
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start studying five minutes a </v>

2425
02:00:34.361 --> 02:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

2426
02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:36.393
<v Speaker 1>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you bring it up to 10 minutes a </v>

2427
02:00:37.481 --> 02:00:38.314
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you have to do for yourself </v>

2428
02:00:40.301 --> 02:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>to get yourself to sit down for half an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour a day and,</v>

2429
02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>and study intently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you'd have to,</v>

2430
02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what you'd have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have a beer at six o'clock at night</v>

2431
02:00:49.901 --> 02:00:50.380
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

2432
02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you'd have to go for a walk in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the park or go out for coffee.</v>

2433
02:00:53.141 --> 02:00:53.974
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're sitting down with a </v>

2434
02:00:55.271 --> 02:00:56.104
<v Speaker 1>stupid undisciplined child who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to get that child to </v>

2435
02:01:00.341 --> 02:01:01.510
<v Speaker 1>do something useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

2436
02:01:01.511 --> 02:01:02.344
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2437
02:01:02.770 --> 02:01:04.990
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do x.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary,</v>

2438
02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:07.300
<v Speaker 1>but you can pick how much of it you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>

2439
02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you what you want if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it well,</v>

2440
02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself that and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't try to tyrannized yourself,</v>

2441
02:01:14.771 --> 02:01:15.604
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to negotiate with yourself and use </v>

2442
02:01:16.841 --> 02:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>some reward and see how that works and </v>
<v Speaker 1>start slow.</v>

2443
02:01:19.871 --> 02:01:20.704
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

2444
02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:21.633
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not very disciplined and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best you can do is half an hour of </v>

2445
02:01:23.891 --> 02:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>studying a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2446
02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>start with half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Increase that five minutes a week.</v>

2447
02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that,</v>

2448
02:01:30.701 --> 02:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

2449
02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>if you do that for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll,</v>

2450
02:01:33.970 --> 02:01:36.520
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be studying four hours a day.</v>

2451
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2452
02:01:38.330 --> 02:01:41.030
<v Speaker 1>that's just with five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just with five minutes a week,</v>

2453
02:01:41.031 --> 02:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's 250 minutes in a year.</v>

2454
02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>So start ridiculously pathetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2455
02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:53.620
<v Speaker 1>study for five minutes a day for a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then move it to 10.</v>

2456
02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>You'll be able to do that and don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheat.</v>

2457
02:01:57.981 --> 02:01:58.814
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things people do is </v>

2458
02:01:59.721 --> 02:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>they make a deal with themselves like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2459
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:02.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to study for 10 minutes a day </v>

2460
02:02:03.801 --> 02:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>each day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

2461
02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:06.770
<v Speaker 1>they get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>

2462
02:02:06.771 --> 02:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going really good.</v>

2463
02:02:08.001 --> 02:02:08.834
<v Speaker 1>So they study for two hours and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they broke the contract with themselves </v>

2464
02:02:11.541 --> 02:02:12.374
<v Speaker 1>and they don't trust themselves anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they don't study for a whole </v>

2465
02:02:15.110 --> 02:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>year or well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not for a month.</v>

2466
02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but set your contract,</v>

2467
02:02:20.690 --> 02:02:21.890
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2468
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.903
<v Speaker 1>what could I do to move myself forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>to my goal that I would do and then how </v>

2469
02:02:29.211 --> 02:02:30.044
<v Speaker 1>can I improve that incrementally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the right way of going about </v>

2470
02:02:32.841 --> 02:02:34.010
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2471
02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:35.233
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the line that's </v>

2472
02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:42.440
<v Speaker 1>often fed to young people to do what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>love and follow your dreams?</v>

2473
02:02:43.670 --> 02:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2474
02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>there's something to be said for doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what grips you,</v>

2475
02:03:01.211 --> 02:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to Lr that with discipline.</v>

2476
02:03:04.630 --> 02:03:05.463
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to ally with </v>

2477
02:03:07.631 --> 02:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2478
02:03:10.210 --> 02:03:11.043
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would also say that that advice </v>

2479
02:03:12.371 --> 02:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2480
02:03:13.630 --> 02:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>which I think has been most popularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with Joseph Campbell,</v>

2481
02:03:17.171 --> 02:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>was actually to some degree something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was at least initiated by young.</v>

2482
02:03:21.791 --> 02:03:26.791
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you said was more </v>
<v Speaker 1>like follow what grips and compels you.</v>

2483
02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:27.933
<v Speaker 1>And it will take you into the underworld</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you will encounter your shadow </v>

2484
02:03:30.461 --> 02:03:33.680
<v Speaker 1>when the dragon and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when,</v>

2485
02:03:33.681 --> 02:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>when you put it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot more realistic.</v>

2486
02:03:36.810 --> 02:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just to a naive and,</v>

2487
02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2488
02:03:43.690 --> 02:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>and too good to be true to be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine.</v>

2489
02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Although I think there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an element of truth in it.</v>

2490
02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:50.973
<v Speaker 1>You do want to follow your dreams but </v>
<v Speaker 1>not if your dream changes every 30 </v>

2491
02:03:56.261 --> 02:03:57.094
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

2492
02:03:57.520 --> 02:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with the future authoring program,</v>

2493
02:03:59.531 --> 02:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we get people to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to detail out a vision for the future.</v>

2494
02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>If you could have the future that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreamed of having,</v>

2495
02:04:07.961 --> 02:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>what would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would that dream be?</v>

2496
02:04:09.581 --> 02:04:10.414
<v Speaker 1>That's really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the next part of the exercise </v>

2497
02:04:12.341 --> 02:04:13.174
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2498
02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to do the hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>

2499
02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:17.493
<v Speaker 1>multiyear work necessarily necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring that dream into reality and how </v>

2500
02:04:20.921 --> 02:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>are you going to make that realistic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>implementable on a day to day,</v>

2501
02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a day to day on a day to day level.</v>

2502
02:04:30.970 --> 02:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>So you got to bring your dream down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth,</v>

2503
02:04:33.461 --> 02:04:35.490
<v Speaker 1>man and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2504
02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>and act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to disciplined to do that.</v>

2505
02:04:38.490 --> 02:04:39.323
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the part that's missing there is </v>

2506
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:42.283
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what you love and discipline </v>

2507
02:04:44.191 --> 02:04:46.650
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good combination.</v>

2508
02:04:46.890 --> 02:04:47.723
<v Speaker 1>That's a good combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts on sleep </v>

2509
02:04:49.201 --> 02:04:49.890
<v Speaker 1>paralysis?</v>

2510
02:04:49.890 --> 02:04:53.490
<v Speaker 1>That happens to me all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it exists.</v>

2511
02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often have,</v>

2512
02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.650
<v Speaker 1>it happened to me this weekend for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

2513
02:04:58.651 --> 02:04:59.910
<v Speaker 1>It's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite</v>

2514
02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:04.740
<v Speaker 1>comical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I go to sleep on my back,</v>

2515
02:05:04.741 --> 02:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I will dream that I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to wake up,</v>

2516
02:05:07.651 --> 02:05:08.484
<v Speaker 1>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I am trying to wake up but I'm </v>

2517
02:05:10.501 --> 02:05:11.334
<v Speaker 1>asleep and I'm still paralyzed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get paralyzed when you're in rem </v>

2518
02:05:14.971 --> 02:05:18.120
<v Speaker 1>sleep so you don't run around and act </v>
<v Speaker 1>out your dreams and smash your nose into</v>

2519
02:05:18.121 --> 02:05:21.060
<v Speaker 1>a wall like cats do if you take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of their brain out.</v>

2520
02:05:21.570 --> 02:05:26.570
<v Speaker 1>And so I often dreamed that I'm kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>semi comatose and I know I can't wake up</v>

2521
02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:30.893
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like grabbing out my daughters </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeve too and saying throw cold water </v>

2522
02:05:36.841 --> 02:05:40.020
<v Speaker 1>on me or shake me or something or push </v>
<v Speaker 1>me out of bed because I can't wake up.</v>

2523
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And then she'll ignore me and then I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>try and get my wife to do it in my dream</v>

2524
02:05:43.051 --> 02:05:45.060
<v Speaker 1>and it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it lasts an hour.</v>

2525
02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And then finally I'll shake myself awake</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm often end up when I wake up like</v>

2526
02:05:49.681 --> 02:05:51.630
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm often annoyed because I'd be telling</v>

2527
02:05:51.631 --> 02:05:52.464
<v Speaker 1>my family members as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned for like half an hour </v>

2528
02:05:54.631 --> 02:05:56.970
<v Speaker 1>desperately to wake me up and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>been ignoring me.</v>

2529
02:05:57.240 --> 02:05:58.073
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's probably only taken five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and they don't have any idea </v>

2530
02:06:00.421 --> 02:06:03.180
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it often,</v>

2531
02:06:03.450 --> 02:06:07.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it has something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah synergic malfunction and it's that</v>

2532
02:06:07.681 --> 02:06:10.080
<v Speaker 1>might be related to this mood disorder </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I described,</v>

2533
02:06:10.081 --> 02:06:10.914
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also much more likely to occur </v>

2534
02:06:12.721 --> 02:06:15.240
<v Speaker 1>if you lay on your back and sleep on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your back.</v>

2535
02:06:15.241 --> 02:06:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And also if you do it in the afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2536
02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:18.613
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people can have quite horrifying </v>

2537
02:06:19.711 --> 02:06:21.330
<v Speaker 1>experiences with sleep paralysis.</v>

2538
02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:23.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a good book called the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2539
02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:24.083
<v Speaker 1>the terror that comes in the night about</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep paralysis and nightmares and it's </v>

2540
02:06:29.521 --> 02:06:31.950
<v Speaker 1>quite an interesting investigation into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that phenomena.</v>

2541
02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:33.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2542
02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:35.933
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your essay writing guidance has proven </v>

2543
02:06:37.231 --> 02:06:38.250
<v Speaker 1>invaluable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2544
02:06:38.251 --> 02:06:40.410
<v Speaker 1>thank you that that refers to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2545
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:41.383
<v Speaker 1>that writing exercise that you can find </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my psychiatry psychology for 30 </v>

2546
02:06:44.791 --> 02:06:45.624
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to find a better place to put </v>

2547
02:06:47.221 --> 02:06:48.400
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2548
02:06:48.630 --> 02:06:51.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll tweet about it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad it's invaluable.</v>

2549
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:53.550
<v Speaker 1>It's taken a long time to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to write it.</v>

2550
02:06:53.551 --> 02:06:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any guidance round taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>notes from books and lectures?</v>

2551
02:06:55.981 --> 02:06:56.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2552
02:06:56.431 --> 02:06:57.264
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like don't be taking notes during the </v>

2553
02:07:00.691 --> 02:07:01.950
<v Speaker 1>lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2554
02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Because then you're not listening to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture.</v>

2555
02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:08.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like listen to the lecture and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>take notes afterwards.</v>

2556
02:07:08.191 --> 02:07:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't work for every </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>

2557
02:07:09.810 --> 02:07:10.643
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly works for disciplines </v>

2558
02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:15.180
<v Speaker 1>like students in my lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell them,</v>

2559
02:07:15.181 --> 02:07:19.620
<v Speaker 1>don't take notes during the lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to the damn lecture.</v>

2560
02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:20.693
<v Speaker 1>You can take notes afterwards because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that does is force you to practice </v>

2561
02:07:23.611 --> 02:07:26.970
<v Speaker 1>remembering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with regards to books,</v>

2562
02:07:26.971 --> 02:07:30.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't highlight,</v>

2563
02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:33.930
<v Speaker 1>don't underline like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's just rubbish.</v>

2564
02:07:33.931 --> 02:07:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pseudo read a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraphs or maybe an essay,</v>

2565
02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.570
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the density of the book.</v>

2566
02:07:40.690 --> 02:07:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Close the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

2567
02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Write down what you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down what you remember.</v>

2568
02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:46.683
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2569
02:07:46.810 --> 02:07:51.640
<v Speaker 1>but in the context of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about because that instantiates</v>

2570
02:07:51.641 --> 02:07:54.190
<v Speaker 1>it into your memory and give and puts it</v>
<v Speaker 1>at hand.</v>

2571
02:07:54.191 --> 02:07:55.024
<v Speaker 1>Like people ask me for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is that I can remember all the </v>

2572
02:07:57.671 --> 02:08:00.490
<v Speaker 1>things that I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>extemporaneously when I'm lecturing.</v>

2573
02:08:00.491 --> 02:08:04.300
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought them through,</v>

2574
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:06.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read them and I think,</v>

2575
02:08:06.281 --> 02:08:06.851
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2576
02:08:06.851 --> 02:08:08.560
<v Speaker 1>well that's an interesting idea.</v>

2577
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:12.220
<v Speaker 1>How does it relate to all these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that I know?</v>

2578
02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:13.251
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

2579
02:08:13.251 --> 02:08:14.084
<v Speaker 1>significance for this idea and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>its significance for this idea and do I </v>

2580
02:08:16.781 --> 02:08:18.670
<v Speaker 1>believe it and how my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I criticize it.</v>

2581
02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:19.533
<v Speaker 1>So it's Kinda like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm attaching little memory hooks to it </v>

2582
02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:25.180
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in five different ways and then I've got</v>

2583
02:08:25.181 --> 02:08:26.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of me.</v>

2584
02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:30.250
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be part of recall </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than,</v>

2585
02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:31.383
<v Speaker 1>so rather than recognition and recall is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spontaneous act of remembering </v>

2586
02:08:36.791 --> 02:08:39.400
<v Speaker 1>something complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you recall something,</v>

2587
02:08:39.401 --> 02:08:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you're actually practicing remembering </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and that's what you need to do if you</v>

2588
02:08:43.211 --> 02:08:48.211
<v Speaker 1>want that to be part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say separate out the function</v>

2589
02:08:48.761 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 1>of reading and note taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So read,</v>

2590
02:08:51.370 --> 02:08:54.700
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write or read.</v>

2591
02:08:54.701 --> 02:08:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think though,</v>

2592
02:08:56.050 --> 02:08:59.710
<v Speaker 1>because the last two things are quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar but don't like read the book and</v>

2593
02:08:59.711 --> 02:09:02.800
<v Speaker 1>then read a sentence and then write down</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sentence.</v>

2594
02:09:02.801 --> 02:09:05.860
<v Speaker 1>That's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could read the sentence,</v>

2595
02:09:05.861 --> 02:09:06.694
<v Speaker 1>close the book and then reformulate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence so that now it's your sentence </v>

2596
02:09:09.581 --> 02:09:10.780
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll remember it.</v>

2597
02:09:10.781 --> 02:09:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That works really well.</v>

2598
02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:14.193
<v Speaker 1>What a postmodernist have right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an infinite number of ways to </v>

2599
02:09:17.051 --> 02:09:18.010
<v Speaker 1>perceive the world.</v>

2600
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2601
02:09:19.410 --> 02:09:20.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2602
02:09:20.431 --> 02:09:21.264
<v Speaker 1>And that's bloody major discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the same discovery that blew the </v>

2603
02:09:24.661 --> 02:09:28.860
<v Speaker 1>slats out of artificial intelligence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>its early instantiation in the 1960s.</v>

2604
02:09:29.130 --> 02:09:29.963
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that the world is so complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is in principle in infinite </v>

2605
02:09:34.171 --> 02:09:35.970
<v Speaker 1>number of ways to perceive it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>

2606
02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:37.553
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that there is no order of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rank difference between those modes of </v>

2607
02:09:41.641 --> 02:09:42.840
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>

2608
02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:45.750
<v Speaker 1>that's where the postmodernist went </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely off the rails.</v>

2609
02:09:46.110 --> 02:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>So they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2610
02:09:47.850 --> 02:09:48.683
<v Speaker 1>they got the problem right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't take their thinking </v>

2611
02:09:50.491 --> 02:09:52.290
<v Speaker 1>about it nearly far enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2612
02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:55.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2613
02:09:55.651 --> 02:09:56.484
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you mentioned switching to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paleo Diet some time ago and from the </v>

2614
02:09:59.371 --> 02:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>way your physical appearance seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve,</v>

2615
02:10:01.170 --> 02:10:02.003
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's working quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could we have more details into your </v>

2616
02:10:04.471 --> 02:10:05.700
<v Speaker 1>diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2617
02:10:07.150 --> 02:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2618
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:11.920
<v Speaker 1>for a year and a half I basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't eaten any carbohydrates,</v>

2619
02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:14.990
<v Speaker 1>so I wouldn't recommend it though cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not it,</v>

2620
02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:19.270
<v Speaker 1>it's hard and it also makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpopular.</v>

2621
02:10:19.330 --> 02:10:20.163
<v Speaker 1>I can't really go to restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for me to go to </v>

2622
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:24.530
<v Speaker 1>other people's places to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2623
02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:27.110
<v Speaker 1>it makes traveling a real pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2624
02:10:27.550 --> 02:10:29.230
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you if you want to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>

2625
02:10:29.231 --> 02:10:32.110
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is really why I did this by the</v>

2626
02:10:32.111 --> 02:10:33.890
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to lose weight,</v>

2627
02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:39.280
<v Speaker 1>if you cut carbohydrates out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet and go on a paleo diet,</v>

2628
02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:40.603
<v Speaker 1>heavy protein and Greens and that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing and you can eat a lot of that </v>

2629
02:10:44.781 --> 02:10:47.610
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to be hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My experience has been,</v>

2630
02:10:47.611 --> 02:10:49.220
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same with everyone,</v>

2631
02:10:49.221 --> 02:10:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but I also know other people who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried this out.</v>

2632
02:10:51.530 --> 02:10:56.450
<v Speaker 1>My brother in law who's actually quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great genius has he's 60 now and he's in</v>

2633
02:10:56.451 --> 02:10:58.970
<v Speaker 1>better shape than he was when he was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>45 45.</v>

2634
02:10:58.970 --> 02:11:01.460
<v Speaker 1>He's a bloody monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy really tough,</v>

2635
02:11:01.461 --> 02:11:03.470
<v Speaker 1>really physically put together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super smart.</v>

2636
02:11:03.471 --> 02:11:04.304
<v Speaker 1>And he's followed a Paleo Diet for about</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years and like he doesn't have an </v>

2637
02:11:07.101 --> 02:11:10.010
<v Speaker 1>ounce of fat on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to lose weight,</v>

2638
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:11.383
<v Speaker 1>drop the carbs and you'll lose weight so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast you won't believe it and you don't </v>

2639
02:11:14.631 --> 02:11:18.110
<v Speaker 1>have to be hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to go into it more depth</v>

2640
02:11:18.111 --> 02:11:21.590
<v Speaker 1>because it's Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've spent so much time talking about my</v>

2641
02:11:21.591 --> 02:11:24.950
<v Speaker 1>bloody diet over the last year that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just bored me to death.</v>

2642
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:26.323
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny because it's so funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>because just before last September when </v>

2643
02:11:31.010 --> 02:11:31.843
<v Speaker 1>I made those first videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting around for my family and </v>

2644
02:11:33.741 --> 02:11:34.574
<v Speaker 1>we'd been talking about Diet God nonstop</v>
<v Speaker 1>because partly because of my daughter's </v>

2645
02:11:37.731 --> 02:11:38.564
<v Speaker 1>health problems and elsa mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like every day discussion about </v>

2646
02:11:41.391 --> 02:11:42.224
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was just paralyzing me and I </v>

2647
02:11:44.421 --> 02:11:45.021
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2648
02:11:45.021 --> 02:11:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish that we could find something else</v>

2649
02:11:48.050 --> 02:11:50.090
<v Speaker 1>to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2650
02:11:50.091 --> 02:11:50.924
<v Speaker 1>well that's your happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is your advice for people that </v>

2651
02:11:54.381 --> 02:11:56.930
<v Speaker 1>aren't very social and have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 1>making friends?</v>

2652
02:11:59.570 --> 02:12:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Get the hell out there and practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2653
02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I had a client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very introverted,</v>

2654
02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:08.300
<v Speaker 1>very introverted person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very badly served by her parents.</v>

2655
02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very well socialized,</v>

2656
02:12:09.831 --> 02:12:10.664
<v Speaker 1>extremely socially anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward in her social interactions as </v>

2657
02:12:14.001 --> 02:12:15.200
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not skilled.</v>

2658
02:12:15.590 --> 02:12:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she d and also alone,</v>

2659
02:12:18.501 --> 02:12:21.680
<v Speaker 1>she didn't have an intimate relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>or really any family.</v>

2660
02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:22.573
<v Speaker 1>So quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite isolated person and terrified of </v>

2661
02:12:24.321 --> 02:12:27.290
<v Speaker 1>social interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she couldn't even go out and have a</v>

2662
02:12:27.291 --> 02:12:28.124
<v Speaker 1>coffee with me as her therapists as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice exercise when we first met and </v>

2663
02:12:31.881 --> 02:12:32.714
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's made progress like you wouldn't </v>

2664
02:12:34.191 --> 02:12:37.130
<v Speaker 1>believe like terror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable progress.</v>

2665
02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2666
02:12:38.421 --> 02:12:42.080
<v Speaker 1>doing public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing public appearances on stage,</v>

2667
02:12:42.081 --> 02:12:44.120
<v Speaker 1>even um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold.</v>

2668
02:12:44.121 --> 02:12:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Go take a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to toastmasters,</v>

2669
02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:48.320
<v Speaker 1>do some public speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2670
02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:52.050
<v Speaker 1>join meetup.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2671
02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:54.080
<v Speaker 1>ask people questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2672
02:12:54.081 --> 02:12:56.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not very social and,</v>

2673
02:12:56.570 --> 02:12:57.403
<v Speaker 1>and you'll get self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about yourself and </v>

2674
02:13:00.381 --> 02:13:02.300
<v Speaker 1>how stupid you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really bad idea.</v>

2675
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:05.240
<v Speaker 1>You should be paying attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person.</v>

2676
02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:06.313
<v Speaker 1>So if you get nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that you have to stop being </v>

2677
02:13:09.651 --> 02:13:11.000
<v Speaker 1>nervous because that isn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2678
02:13:11.001 --> 02:13:13.520
<v Speaker 1>What you have to do is start paying more</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the other person.</v>

2679
02:13:13.521 --> 02:13:15.440
<v Speaker 1>You have to force your attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>outward.</v>

2680
02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:17.720
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ask people questions,</v>

2681
02:13:17.721 --> 02:13:18.554
<v Speaker 1>listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they say something interesting </v>

2682
02:13:21.051 --> 02:13:22.820
<v Speaker 1>or they say something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

2683
02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:23.743
<v Speaker 1>ask them a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people love that man because they </v>

2684
02:13:26.691 --> 02:13:29.120
<v Speaker 1>know you're listening to them and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>love being listened to.</v>

2685
02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:30.223
<v Speaker 1>So if you're learn to listen better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to ask questions and there's no </v>

2686
02:13:36.961 --> 02:13:39.180
<v Speaker 1>stupid questions if you're paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

2687
02:13:40.110 --> 02:13:40.943
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't have to worry about </v>

2688
02:13:41.671 --> 02:13:43.260
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know something,</v>

2689
02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:44.573
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know something and you ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>an honest question and someone treats </v>

2690
02:13:46.771 --> 02:13:47.604
<v Speaker 1>you badly because of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should just go away from that </v>

2691
02:13:49.471 --> 02:13:51.120
<v Speaker 1>person because they don't have a clue.</v>

2692
02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:54.530
<v Speaker 1>So get out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2693
02:13:54.630 --> 02:13:57.960
<v Speaker 1>forget about trying to not be nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to be nervous.</v>

2694
02:13:57.961 --> 02:14:00.690
<v Speaker 1>But when you're nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay more attention to other people.</v>

2695
02:14:00.930 --> 02:14:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Listen to them carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch them,</v>

2696
02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:04.793
<v Speaker 1>because then your natural social </v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities will kick in and ask them </v>

2697
02:14:08.130 --> 02:14:10.050
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2698
02:14:10.110 --> 02:14:10.943
<v Speaker 1>your assuming it'll take you three or </v>
<v Speaker 1>four years to get decently good at it </v>

2699
02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:15.180
<v Speaker 1>and that you'll really have to work at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2700
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:16.650
<v Speaker 1>But it's worth it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2701
02:14:16.651 --> 02:14:19.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just go out there and do it and,</v>

2702
02:14:19.380 --> 02:14:20.580
<v Speaker 1>and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll figure it out.</v>

2703
02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:25.640
<v Speaker 1>You'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all right guys and girls and,</v>

2704
02:14:26.910 --> 02:14:30.900
<v Speaker 1>and assorted others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nine 30 and uh,</v>

2705
02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:34.200
<v Speaker 1>well that was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it was fun for you.</v>

2706
02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And I would like to say in closing two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2707
02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for the,</v>

2708
02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:42.360
<v Speaker 1>not just for the monetary support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2709
02:14:42.361 --> 02:14:45.000
<v Speaker 1>although I hope to put that to good use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2710
02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:45.933
<v Speaker 1>that is definitely my plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also the public support I've </v>

2711
02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:54.381
<v Speaker 1>received has been extremely practically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and psychologically useful to me.</v>

2712
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:58.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was a lot of stress in the</v>

2713
02:14:58.680 --> 02:14:59.513
<v Speaker 1>last year and,</v>

2714
02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and my job was definitely in danger at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the University of Toronto.</v>

2715
02:15:05.711 --> 02:15:07.820
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly my autonomy as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor was,</v>

2716
02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:08.893
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that I received all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>public support was extraordinarily </v>

2717
02:15:14.361 --> 02:15:15.194
<v Speaker 1>useful for me to buttress my sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pursuing the right course of </v>

2718
02:15:20.271 --> 02:15:22.700
<v Speaker 1>action even though I wasn't doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>

2719
02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:25.460
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very,</v>

2720
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:29.300
<v Speaker 1>it helped me protect myself to a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree practically.</v>

2721
02:15:29.301 --> 02:15:30.134
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that university had </v>

2722
02:15:31.401 --> 02:15:32.234
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the opportunity to back </v>

2723
02:15:34.191 --> 02:15:35.024
<v Speaker 1>off in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the face of all the objections that </v>

2724
02:15:37.401 --> 02:15:38.234
<v Speaker 1>were raised by the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior types is because there was a </v>

2725
02:15:40.551 --> 02:15:44.750
<v Speaker 1>counter protest from the general public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so thank you very much for that.</v>

2726
02:15:44.751 --> 02:15:48.170
<v Speaker 1>It's much appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with regards to the money man,</v>

2727
02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:49.273
<v Speaker 1>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my plan is to while a to remain very </v>

2728
02:15:52.221 --> 02:15:54.140
<v Speaker 1>grateful for it and not to take it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

2729
02:15:54.141 --> 02:15:54.974
<v Speaker 1>but the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to do some viciously </v>

2730
02:15:56.721 --> 02:15:58.790
<v Speaker 1>good things with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2731
02:15:59.090 --> 02:16:04.070
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I freed up my time for the next year and</v>

2732
02:16:04.430 --> 02:16:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I want to capitalize on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to capitalize on this opportunity</v>

2733
02:16:08.361 --> 02:16:09.194
<v Speaker 1>and I want to bring classical humanities</v>
<v Speaker 1>education to millions of people and </v>

2734
02:16:12.351 --> 02:16:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a good deal.</v>

2735
02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:15.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
