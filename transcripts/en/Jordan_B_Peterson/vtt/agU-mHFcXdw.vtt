00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.363
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of you may have heard about the </v>

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Google memo at his been circulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>virally around the Internet for the last</v>

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was written by James Damore who was</v>

4
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:21.201
<v Speaker 1>fired for it last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a colleague of his reached out to me</v>

5
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:22.734
<v Speaker 1>and put us together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to talk to James today </v>

6
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>about exactly what happened and why and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps what should be done about it.</v>

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.403
<v Speaker 1>So all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what we're going to do in the </v>

8
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 1>interview I had with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which finished at about three o'clock on</v>

9
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.263
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>August 8th follows immediately after </v>

10
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>this introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi everybody.</v>

11
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:49.434
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking today with James Demore and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an unidentified google employee who </v>

12
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>wishes to remain anonymous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.953
<v Speaker 1>reasons that I think are obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And James last week put his hand in a </v>

14
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:06.774
<v Speaker 1>blender by circulating an internal memo </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would say has become somewhat </v>

15
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>infamous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So James,</v>

16
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.064
<v Speaker 1>let's start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with a bit of discussion </v>

17
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>about you to tell us who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about your background,</v>

18
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>and about what you were doing at Google.</v>

19
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

20
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I was actually just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

21
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.743
<v Speaker 2>I'm really interested in science and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and stuff and then I really </v>

22
00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:34.450
<v Speaker 2>like puzzles and that's how I got into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>

23
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did one of their coding competitions.</v>

24
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 2>They just recruited me out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I Google,</v>

25
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I was mostly working on search and image</v>
<v Speaker 2>and video search in particular.</v>

26
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.643
<v Speaker 1>So what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell us about your educational </v>

27
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:50.614
<v Speaker 1>background a bit.</v>

28
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just did a random science and math </v>

30
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 2>and undergrad and I ended up with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>

31
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really know what I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

32
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 2>So I started doing research at Mit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

33
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to a systems biology at Harvard.</v>

34
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I initially wanted to work with Martin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nowak.</v>

35
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 2>He's really great at and evolution and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Game Theory.</v>

36
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.370
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

37
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 2>then I started working on other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>So tell us a bit about systems biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that exactly?</v>

39
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>What kind of research were you doing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mit?</v>

40
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it sounds,</v>

41
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:31.484
<v Speaker 2>biology has many different meanings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's generally just mathematical </v>

42
00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:36.554
<v Speaker 2>biology and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess seeing biological systems as a </v>

43
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 2>whole rather than just individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules.</v>

44
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.610
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked looking at populations and so my</v>

45
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 2>interest in evolution.</v>

46
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>So why did that make you a viable </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate and doodle?</v>

47
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.323
<v Speaker 1>It's eight.</v>

48
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they just</v>

49
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Speaker 1>saw a smart guy that could code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've been there three years,</v>

50
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also has an intern before that.</v>

51
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So about four years total.</v>

52
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.483
<v Speaker 1>And so how would you say you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>performed as an employee and doable and </v>

53
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>people being happy with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or have you been here?</v>

54
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got promoted twice.</v>

55
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 2>My last review was the highest possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Superb,</v>

56
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.450
<v Speaker 2>which is the top few percent aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

57
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 2>it definitely wasn't based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance that they fired me.</v>

58
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Have you enjoyed working at Google?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has it been a good experience?</v>

59
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I love Google then.</v>

60
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>That's horrible part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've always been the biggest google</v>

61
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 2>fanboy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all like,</v>

62
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I've never had an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always tried to convince my friends</v>

63
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 2>to use android and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

64
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.150
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is just puts a sour taste in</v>

65
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 2>my mouth.</v>

66
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

67
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a good educational </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

68
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>You were interested in things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google would be interested in.</v>

69
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.613
<v Speaker 1>You're a good coder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've worked with them for a number of </v>

70
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.983
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done an excellent job and you're </v>

71
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>pretty pro google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the background.</v>

72
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now last week you wrote a memo which has</v>

73
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 1>attracted a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and in that memo you,</v>

74
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>you made a number of claims and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>claims were,</v>

75
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.440
<v Speaker 1>and please correct me if I've got this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not summarizing this properties,</v>

76
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>you were attempting to describe reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>why there might,</v>

77
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.370
<v Speaker 1>why a lack of gender parity might exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>within Google for example with an NGO in</v>

78
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>engineering or broadly but also in </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients more broadly.</v>

79
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.023
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you laid out in a very elaborated </v>

80
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>document and I reviewed it and as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell,</v>

81
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.990
<v Speaker 1>your opinions are well supported by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant psychological science.</v>

82
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think what I'll do in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of this video when I link it</v>

83
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>is putting the references so that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can decide for themselves.</v>

84
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to put up a web page about gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in general,</v>

85
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>but I'll try to hit the highlights for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular document.</v>

86
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>So why did you do this?</v>

87
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so about a month and a half ago,</v>

88
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.783
<v Speaker 2>I went to one of our diversity summits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it unrecorded and to proceed </v>

89
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:25.074
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they told me a lot of things that I </v>

90
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 2>thought just were not right.</v>

91
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.703
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean unrecorded in super </v>

92
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>secret?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.663
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were telling us about a lot </v>

94
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:37.824
<v Speaker 2>of these potentially illegal practices </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they've been doing to try to </v>

95
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 2>increase diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

96
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.010
<v Speaker 1>what kind of practices?</v>

97
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.473
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well basically treating people </v>

98
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>differently based on what their race or </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender ours.</v>

99
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

100
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

101
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.761
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

102
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:00.880
<v Speaker 1>and it was ultra secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an unrecorded.</v>

103
00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And in what manner?</v>

104
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

105
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.130
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most meetings I Google,</v>

106
00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I recorded anyone at Google come watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

107
00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to be really open about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything except for this.</v>

108
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.450
<v Speaker 2>They don't want any paper trail for any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these things.</v>

109
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.943
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

110
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Because I think it's illegal and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as some of the internal polls showed,</v>

111
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.920
<v Speaker 2>there were a large percent of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that agreed with me on the document.</v>

112
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.580
<v Speaker 2>And so if everyone got to see this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

113
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.100
<v Speaker 2>then they would really bringing up some </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism.</v>

114
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A large number of people in Google and a</v>

115
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>very large number of well-informed </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological scientists we might also add.</v>

116
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.363
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it was quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was quite struck by your document </v>

117
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 1>given that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a decent document for</v>

118
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>a well informed psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>research psychologists to write,</v>

119
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>but it was somewhat of an outsider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you've got the,</v>

120
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you got the highlights accurate as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned.</v>

121
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

122
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:04.274
<v Speaker 1>So you went to this diversity meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you weren't happy with the sorts of </v>

123
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.830
<v Speaker 1>things that you were being told and with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practices is,</v>

124
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>is that both correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>And what were you mean tool?</v>

126
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.911
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

127
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:17.744
<v Speaker 2>so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of ways in which </v>

128
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>they pressure people to increase the </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity of their team.</v>

129
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.493
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to do that besides </v>

130
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 2>actually choosing someone based on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>race or gender.</v>

131
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:33.164
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

132
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't lucidity precisely,</v>

133
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I more women or underrepresented racial </v>

134
00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:43.980
<v Speaker 2>minorities.</v>

135
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.920
<v Speaker 4>Can I jump in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

136
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.040
<v Speaker 4>I would hesitate to say that that's 100%</v>
<v Speaker 4>true across 100%.</v>

137
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.410
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the organization that I'm in,</v>

138
00:07:56.411 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 4>I have not personally seen anything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would deem crossed the line.</v>

139
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

140
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.363
<v Speaker 4>I personally believe that there are a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good amount of synergies to be found if </v>

141
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:08.800
<v Speaker 4>you can combine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

142
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.220
<v Speaker 4>slightly different ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

143
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.600
<v Speaker 4>into a room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is the,</v>

144
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.750
<v Speaker 4>the thesis that some groups are working </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards.</v>

145
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:17.883
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously there's going to be a </v>

146
00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:22.930
<v Speaker 4>distribution of how people follow the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules.</v>

147
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

148
00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:28.030
<v Speaker 4>it's unfortunate to hear that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

149
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:31.690
<v Speaker 4>it could be that some people fall to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong side of that distribution,</v>

150
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.140
<v Speaker 4>but that's certainly wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would not apply to everybody.</v>

151
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.543
<v Speaker 1>It certainly also distressing to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is acceptance of the idea </v>

152
00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:44.910
<v Speaker 1>that diversity can be mapped on to race </v>
<v Speaker 1>and gender,</v>

153
00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:45.744
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no evidence for that </v>

154
00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:49.740
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

155
00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:50.574
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you went to this meeting and then </v>

156
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.573
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just started to write this document </v>

157
00:08:54.091 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

158
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>how long had you been working on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he released it?</v>

159
00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.451
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

160
00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:03.590
<v Speaker 2>So I was doing it like throughout my </v>
<v Speaker 2>free time.</v>

161
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just wanted to clarify my thoughts</v>

162
00:09:07.161 --> 00:09:10.580
<v Speaker 2>on this and I really just want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>proven wrong because you know,</v>

163
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.400
<v Speaker 2>if what I was saying was right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then something bad is happening.</v>

164
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.953
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a month ago I submitted it to </v>

165
00:09:17.811 --> 00:09:22.010
<v Speaker 2>feedback to that program and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that people looked at it,</v>

166
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.170
<v Speaker 2>but no one actually said anything.</v>

167
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.400
<v Speaker 1>And what's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then did you submit,</v>

168
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I basically said what I said in the,</v>

169
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.380
<v Speaker 2>in the document and then I linked to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>document itself.</v>

170
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.593
<v Speaker 2>And so I actually published this about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>month ago and it was only after it got </v>

171
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 2>viral and then we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the news that Google started caring.</v>

172
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.353
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how did it go viral and do you know </v>

173
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:50.270
<v Speaker 1>and how was it leaked?</v>

174
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

175
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.770
<v Speaker 2>there was a group at Google called </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptics and so I was like,</v>

176
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there'll be able to prove me wrong</v>

177
00:10:00.561 --> 00:10:01.394
<v Speaker 2>in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's Scott's a rule about </v>

178
00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:03.380
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

179
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.230
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

180
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.810
<v Speaker 2>And so I sent them a message like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

181
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.673
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Google in some sort of echo chamber </v>

182
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:16.240
<v Speaker 2>or I'm crying and echo chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

183
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.890
<v Speaker 2>then it just exploded after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

184
00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:23.450
<v Speaker 2>our internal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

185
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.840
<v Speaker 2>It was just spread throughout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've all of Google.</v>

186
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you and do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it the,</v>

187
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.970
<v Speaker 1>was it the skeptic's group that started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spread it around?</v>

188
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there were a lot of upper </v>

189
00:10:36.281 --> 00:10:39.340
<v Speaker 2>management that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.183
<v Speaker 2>specifically called it out and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying how harmful it is and how is </v>

191
00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:48.080
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sort of viewpoint is not allowed at</v>

192
00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>

193
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of viewpoint,</v>

194
00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:51.184
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there were differences </v>

195
00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 1>between men and women that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>might play a role in,</v>

196
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.613
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

197
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.500
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

198
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.333
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the corporate world that that's an </v>

199
00:10:59.831 --> 00:11:01.480
<v Speaker 1>opinion that's not acceptable.</v>

200
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems,</v>

201
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:05.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

202
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understandably it is,</v>

203
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 1>these issues are tricky morally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>

204
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.013
<v Speaker 1>but thing that was disturbing to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>about watching the response to you is </v>

205
00:11:16.231 --> 00:11:17.064
<v Speaker 1>that as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't anything that you said in </v>

206
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:20.400
<v Speaker 1>that paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

207
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:21.234
<v Speaker 1>that is in fact biased in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 1>should open you up to the sorts of </v>

208
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:25.644
<v Speaker 1>charges that had been opened up against </v>
<v Speaker 1>you or that violates the scientific </v>

209
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:33.930
<v Speaker 1>literature as it currently stands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So both of those are rather distressing.</v>

210
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a lot of misrepresentation</v>

211
00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:42.040
<v Speaker 2>by upper management just to silence may </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think?</v>

212
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that do you think?</v>

213
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.454
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it the Google couldn't have </v>

214
00:11:46.541 --> 00:11:47.374
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that Google couldn't have </v>

215
00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:51.070
<v Speaker 1>come out and have an intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about this instead of,</v>

216
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

217
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 1>releasing like Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Read Danielle Brown's response to you,</v>

218
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling,</v>

219
00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 1>down to appalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they fired you,</v>

220
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be like really bad pr </v>
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>

221
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:06.400
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't actually deal with the issues</v>

222
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 1>at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

223
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 1>they're basically saying something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

224
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 1>what was the rationale for firing you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

225
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>What was the excuse that was given?</v>

226
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.490
<v Speaker 2>So the official excuse was that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetuating gender stereotypes</v>

227
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.320
<v Speaker 1>that you were perpetuating gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes.</v>

228
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

229
00:12:23.761 --> 00:12:24.594
<v Speaker 1>did they say anything else about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance or about anything else that </v>

230
00:12:26.971 --> 00:12:27.804
<v Speaker 1>you had done?</v>

231
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

232
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

233
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.620
<v Speaker 2>that was the only reason.</v>

234
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.681
<v Speaker 1>And who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

235
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:34.470
<v Speaker 1>who fired you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically?</v>

236
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.193
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was my hr representative and my </v>

237
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:40.624
<v Speaker 2>director.</v>

238
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you end,</v>

239
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.773
<v Speaker 1>do you have any idea on who's ordered as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were acting or if this was </v>

240
00:12:47.431 --> 00:12:50.040
<v Speaker 1>something that they conjured up </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves or,</v>

241
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.703
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I probably went from higher up </v>

242
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.440
<v Speaker 2>than that because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a huge pr move.</v>

243
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.640
<v Speaker 2>So they would need approval from higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>ups.</v>

244
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the CEO,</v>

245
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.283
<v Speaker 1>the CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually made some comments about the </v>

246
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:07.783
<v Speaker 1>issue today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'll probably cut into this video </v>

247
00:13:09.891 --> 00:13:11.600
<v Speaker 1>as we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I edited.</v>

248
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

249
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

250
00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:18.110
<v Speaker 1>So the first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing?</v>

251
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

252
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:22.923
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of messages that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to sort through and just trying </v>

253
00:13:26.701 --> 00:13:28.770
<v Speaker 2>to figure out what I should do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

254
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.933
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been given some interesting job </v>

255
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 1>offers as far as I can tell.</v>

256
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten a surprising amount as a </v>

257
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

258
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

259
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:39.934
<v Speaker 1>I suspect I'm sacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm virtually certain that you have a </v>

260
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:43.444
<v Speaker 1>majority viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just at the people who hold the </v>

261
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:46.654
<v Speaker 1>alternative perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the radical social </v>

262
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:50.134
<v Speaker 1>constructionist types who insist that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is a consequence of </v>

263
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:53.194
<v Speaker 1>socialization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a little bit more organized </v>

264
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are clearly wrong,</v>

265
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:57.694
<v Speaker 1>scientifically they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually the wrong ethically for </v>

266
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:02.170
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

267
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.663
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably have more support than you </v>

268
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 1>sake and it'll be very interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how that turns out.</v>

269
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.393
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think about having </v>

270
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:12.274
<v Speaker 1>written this are mean now your life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be turned upside down and for </v>

271
00:14:15.491 --> 00:14:16.324
<v Speaker 1>quite a while I suspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you put yourself out on the line </v>

272
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about that?</v>

273
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.020
<v Speaker 2>It definitely sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean at least I was proven right.</v>

274
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:33.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

275
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.140
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by proven right?</v>

276
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.583
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that the whole culture just tries </v>

277
00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:43.820
<v Speaker 2>to silence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need a dissenting view</v>

278
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.840
<v Speaker 2>and then we really need some more </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective way of looking at these.</v>

279
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I felt the same way with the </v>

280
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 1>University of Toronto decided to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.590
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to shut me down after I need </v>
<v Speaker 1>my videos.</v>

282
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that just proves my point.</v>

283
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I mean to me the video saying well</v>

284
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:05.954
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the climate that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing and it's making it very </v>

285
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 1>difficult to have conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>

286
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And your examples even more egregious I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think because you know,</v>

287
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:19.721
<v Speaker 1>I at least objected to a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation that in principle would have</v>

288
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:24.590
<v Speaker 1>been a benefit to an identifiable group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But say the transgender group,</v>

289
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it is of any benefit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

290
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:29.540
<v Speaker 1>but you could make a case that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

291
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:33.500
<v Speaker 1>all you did as far as I can tell it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>review the modern personality literature</v>

292
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:34.903
<v Speaker 1>and the literature on individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences relating to men and women </v>

293
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.183
<v Speaker 1>and other groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's actually not very much </v>

294
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.693
<v Speaker 1>opinion in your piece at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that does is that it is not </v>

295
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:50.741
<v Speaker 1>possible to actually have a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the scientific literature on these</v>

296
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.184
<v Speaker 1>issues without putting yourself at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a hell of a thing for an </v>

297
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:59.621
<v Speaker 1>engineer because being engineers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rely on the facts as far as I can tell,</v>

298
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:01.934
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I liked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers is that they tend to stick </v>

299
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:07.910
<v Speaker 1>fairly closely to the facts that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a very political group.</v>

300
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

301
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.070
<v Speaker 1>they're much more practical.</v>

302
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

303
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.713
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that can expect a </v>

304
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:23.171
<v Speaker 1>silence so many engineers then </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent people and just</v>

305
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.960
<v Speaker 5>deny science.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like</v>

306
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.580
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

307
00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Well the question too is what are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters within Google going to do?</v>

308
00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:31.044
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're a great warning then </v>

309
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.850
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you showed what happened,</v>

310
00:16:38.851 --> 00:16:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you showed exactly what happens if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have enough,</v>

311
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you'd call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity and courage I suppose,</v>

312
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.550
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mostly curiosity to lay out what you</v>

313
00:16:53.551 --> 00:16:55.740
<v Speaker 1>think for discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

314
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.620
<v Speaker 1>you opened this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said that,</v>

315
00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't jumping up and down and </v>

316
00:17:01.411 --> 00:17:02.244
<v Speaker 1>insisting you were right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were trying to lay out what you </v>

317
00:17:04.231 --> 00:17:07.090
<v Speaker 1>understood from doing a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading and,</v>

318
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.980
<v Speaker 1>and make the case that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these facts,</v>

319
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.053
<v Speaker 1>the facts about the differences between </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women and employment choice and </v>

320
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.653
<v Speaker 1>payment and all that aren't being </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed and they're not being </v>

321
00:17:18.061 --> 00:17:20.130
<v Speaker 1>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we know for example,</v>

322
00:17:20.131 --> 00:17:20.964
<v Speaker 1>and I'll put this citation in down in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the description that's been very </v>

323
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:27.240
<v Speaker 1>difficult for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Swedes for example,</v>

324
00:17:27.241 --> 00:17:28.074
<v Speaker 1>to flatten out the gender distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>for engineers in Sweden and in and in </v>

325
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.260
<v Speaker 1>and in the Scandinavian countries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

326
00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:37.680
<v Speaker 1>despite their advanced social </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>

327
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:38.280
<v Speaker 1>let's call it.</v>

328
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.900
<v Speaker 1>And they also can't get male nurses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

329
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's four out of five nurses in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia,</v>

330
00:17:44.041 --> 00:17:46.020
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are female.</v>

331
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>And the reverse number are our engineers</v>
<v Speaker 1>are male.</v>

332
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.953
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be associated with this </v>

333
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 1>quite well founded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

334
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.033
<v Speaker 1>scientific observation that women tilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards interest in people and men tilt </v>

335
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:04.194
<v Speaker 1>towards interest in things and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with testosterone </v>

336
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:10.870
<v Speaker 1>exposure in utero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so much science.</v>

337
00:18:10.871 --> 00:18:11.704
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't anybody beating an ideological </v>

338
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:14.274
<v Speaker 1>trump because most of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that most of the people who </v>

339
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 1>are publishing this would have been even</v>
<v Speaker 1>happier.</v>

340
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 1>How did turn out the other way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

341
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.603
<v Speaker 1>the findings actually run contrary to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their biases because academia is </v>

342
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.290
<v Speaker 1>generally full of people whose biases </v>
<v Speaker 1>are left and now and then,</v>

343
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific findings emerged to dispute,</v>

344
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:35.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

345
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:36.773
<v Speaker 1>nydia logical proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not certainly the case with the role of </v>

346
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 1>biology versus society in establishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender differences.</v>

347
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.064
<v Speaker 1>So the science is very credible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's completely beyond </v>

348
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:48.174
<v Speaker 1>dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the point either because </v>

349
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:51.594
<v Speaker 1>your survey was actually pretty decent </v>
<v Speaker 1>survey of the current state of affairs </v>

350
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:57.600
<v Speaker 1>with regards to individual differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it's right.</v>

351
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

352
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your,</v>

353
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.600
<v Speaker 1>what are your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does your family think about all of</v>

354
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:04.434
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

355
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely support me,</v>

356
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 2>but they don't really know what I should</v>
<v Speaker 2>do from here.</v>

357
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:12.504
<v Speaker 2>They don't want me to just go to a ton </v>
<v Speaker 2>of news corporations and do all these </v>

358
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:20.310
<v Speaker 2>interviews and stuff and because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just want a twist,</v>

359
00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:23.740
<v Speaker 2>whatever I say towards their agenda to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

360
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not really clear what I should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

361
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's certainly no shortage of </v>

362
00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:29.420
<v Speaker 1>people that want to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

363
00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:33.740
<v Speaker 1>I'd been contacted by four or five </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists who would like to speak with</v>

364
00:19:33.741 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

365
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.670
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about that afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could like to know who they are,</v>

366
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.620
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

367
00:19:39.621 --> 00:19:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a,</v>

368
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you've got a conundrum on your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

369
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a,</v>

370
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.780
<v Speaker 1>you're a very straightforward person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously not grinding any acts,</v>

371
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:58.760
<v Speaker 1>at least not in any obvious way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my suspicions are that talking to the</v>

372
00:19:58.761 --> 00:20:01.250
<v Speaker 1>right people could be of substantial use</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

373
00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:05.240
<v Speaker 1>But I guess it also depends on what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you want me.</v>

374
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's something we can talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've,</v>

375
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.593
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

376
00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.443
<v Speaker 1>you've rattled up the cages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair number of people and a fairly </v>

377
00:20:13.661 --> 00:20:16.120
<v Speaker 1>large organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>

378
00:20:16.121 --> 00:20:16.954
<v Speaker 1>just on the heels of Google and Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>is announcement about the new free </v>

379
00:20:19.421 --> 00:20:21.940
<v Speaker 1>speech restrictions on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube,</v>

380
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.833
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when and their incorporation of NGOs </v>

381
00:20:24.311 --> 00:20:25.144
<v Speaker 1>into that sensor set process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's been quite a week for Google I </v>

382
00:20:28.211 --> 00:20:32.080
<v Speaker 1>would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've opened up this can of worms.</v>

383
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.560
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

384
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.970
<v Speaker 1>So imagine if you're looking six months </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road and say,</v>

385
00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:41.440
<v Speaker 1>and things happened that were good </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of what you did,</v>

386
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.110
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you would like to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

387
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

388
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.590
<v Speaker 2>I at the very least I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I do still care about google.</v>

389
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:51.424
<v Speaker 2>I want some conversation to be had and </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the ideologues to not just have </v>

390
00:20:57.701 --> 00:21:01.270
<v Speaker 2>their way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

391
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:06.271
<v Speaker 2>I still don't have a clear vision on how</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly this will happen and how,</v>

392
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 2>how this can spread farther than just </v>
<v Speaker 2>google.</v>

393
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.880
<v Speaker 1>You spread it farther than just google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

394
00:21:14.881 --> 00:21:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

395
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.761
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

396
00:21:16.761 --> 00:21:17.594
<v Speaker 1>I would say my experiences with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise is that the first thing that </v>

397
00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:27.531
<v Speaker 1>happens that will happen is that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>get jumped on by people who call you the</v>

398
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.454
<v Speaker 1>sorts of epithets that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate if you were a bad guy and </v>

399
00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:34.680
<v Speaker 1>you should just shut up and go away.</v>
