<v Speaker 1>Professor Jordan Peterson is a clinical </v>

3
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>licensed in Massachusetts and Ontario.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's also a professor at the University </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Toronto and has been so since 1998.</v>

5
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Professor beaters in is currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in the formula assessment and</v>

6
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:40.784
<v Speaker 1>theoretical nature of self deception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>construing it as the voluntary failure </v>

7
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>of exploration rather than as </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression.</v>

8
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>He's also doing experimental work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>

9
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>achievement,</v>

13
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Welcome to this edition of Astoria </v>
<v Speaker 3>magazine and Web radio.</v>

14
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.930
<v Speaker 3>We're delighted to have here with us </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinical psychologist,</v>

15
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.803
<v Speaker 3>professor Jordan Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be telling us about his </v>

16
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 3>amazing book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maps of meaning.</v>

17
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.610
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

18
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Professor Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>welcome.</v>

19
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 3>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

20
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 3>Could you please tell us a bit first of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all about your background?</v>

21
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.883
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a clinical psychologist trained at </v>

22
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 4>mcgill university.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been working as a professor.</v>

23
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.613
<v Speaker 4>I</v>
<v Speaker 4>taught at Harvard University in the </v>

24
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 4>psychology department for six years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I moved to Toronto.</v>

25
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 4>I also do consulting work for a variety </v>
<v Speaker 4>of different companies.</v>

26
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.053
<v Speaker 3>Probably the most widely read book on </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychology for the novice reader was </v>

27
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.143
<v Speaker 3>young's masterpiece man and his symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you approaching a general audience </v>

28
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 3>with this book or your book maps of </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning,</v>

29
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 3>or is this more suited to the students </v>
<v Speaker 3>of psychology?</v>

30
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's suited for people who would</v>

31
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.223
<v Speaker 4>like assembled and</v>
<v Speaker 4>even the ones that were written for a </v>

32
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:35.094
<v Speaker 4>general audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not particularly simple because </v>

33
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 4>they're so different in conception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would say maps of meaning is aimed</v>

34
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:45.680
<v Speaker 4>at the same audience that those books </v>
<v Speaker 4>were aimed at.</v>

35
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Other similar to two books by Eric </v>
<v Speaker 4>Norman,</v>

36
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:50.874
<v Speaker 4>who was a very astute student of youngs </v>
<v Speaker 4>and who took kills thought farther in </v>

37
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:57.654
<v Speaker 4>some directions than young had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I guess I see my work in part as an </v>

38
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 4>extension of a young's work and Norman's</v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

39
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm partly into the domain of </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuropsychology</v>

40
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.200
<v Speaker 3>luminaries such as when a</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophical investigations in 1953,</v>

41
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where again,</v>

42
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.233
<v Speaker 3>he attempted to layout the apparent </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of the mind and the </v>

43
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 3>conditioning with cultural and </v>
<v Speaker 3>historical variables.</v>

44
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Would that be true to say you've moved </v>
<v Speaker 3>on from that and expanded it even more</v>

45
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.473
<v Speaker 4>contributions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was the idea that was more like a a </v>

46
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.710
<v Speaker 4>piece in a chess game than it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>label for an object and</v>

47
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.183
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Words were always to do things with </v>

48
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.013
<v Speaker 4>rather than to label things with and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conception that I share because most of </v>

49
00:03:57.931 --> 00:03:58.764
<v Speaker 4>our concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists like to think that our </v>

50
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 4>concepts are very much like theories </v>
<v Speaker 4>about object.</v>

51
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.480
<v Speaker 4>But in reality our concepts are much </v>
<v Speaker 4>more action oriented that not.</v>

52
00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:09.744
<v Speaker 4>I mean we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that when you look at even our simple </v>

53
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:13.674
<v Speaker 4>object like a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain areas that are involved in </v>

54
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.430
<v Speaker 4>motor action are activated at the level </v>
<v Speaker 4>of perception.</v>

55
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.860
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at a cup,</v>

56
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.993
<v Speaker 4>the gripping action that your hand would</v>
<v Speaker 4>make if you lifted up the cop is </v>

57
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.590
<v Speaker 4>partially activated merely when your </v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes a settle on the cup itself.</v>

58
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.053
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Vichtenstein was the first </v>

59
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.763
<v Speaker 4>philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although Nisha knew this to some degree </v>

60
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:39.954
<v Speaker 4>to can spend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was the first philosopher to really </v>

61
00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:45.780
<v Speaker 4>point out the functional quality of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>object categories.</v>

62
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.273
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

63
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.233
<v Speaker 4>my work overlaps with his ideas to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>degree because one of my preconceptions </v>

64
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.190
<v Speaker 4>that mythological ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas and concepts are functional.</v>

65
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Speaker 4>They're to do things with their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to act about.</v>

66
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.560
<v Speaker 4>They're not to label,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not descriptive.</v>

67
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 4>Like scientific concept is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why religious mythology has to do</v>

68
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 4>with morality because morality is about </v>
<v Speaker 4>action.</v>

69
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.660
<v Speaker 3>What is the relationship to human </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness in say,</v>

70
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 3>the treatment of mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

71
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:29.521
<v Speaker 3>of what we classify in the western </v>
<v Speaker 3>concept as mental illness?</v>

72
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

73
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.343
<v Speaker 4>let's start with a question about dreams</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean there's a lot of debate in the </v>

74
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:40.080
<v Speaker 4>scientific literature about the meaning </v>
<v Speaker 4>of dreams.</v>

75
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.790
<v Speaker 4>And perhaps there's even debate about </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether to have meaning.</v>

76
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.093
<v Speaker 4>I think partly the debate exists because</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do dream analysis properly as young </v>

77
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 4>in particular pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

78
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.403
<v Speaker 4>you need a vast body of knowledge in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dream interpreter about comparative </v>

79
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:06.431
<v Speaker 4>mythology and ritual and symbol and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and art history and so forth.</v>

80
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:08.594
<v Speaker 4>Because dreams of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use images as their primary means of </v>

81
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 4>conceptualization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

82
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.873
<v Speaker 4>in order to understand what what dreams </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean and how they can be useful in </v>

83
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:20.984
<v Speaker 4>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart from appreciating the fact that </v>

84
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.303
<v Speaker 4>the interpreter needs a broad body of </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge that scientists generally </v>

85
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:30.044
<v Speaker 4>don't develop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also important to know what it is </v>

86
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 4>that scientists have discovered about </v>
<v Speaker 4>dreams.</v>

87
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.613
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that dreams occur during rapid </v>

88
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 4>eye movement sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cycle into rapid eye movement,</v>

89
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 4>sleep about every 90 minutes when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>asleep,</v>

90
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.990
<v Speaker 4>when you're in rapid eye movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep,</v>

91
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.543
<v Speaker 4>your motor centers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so your action centers are very much </v>

92
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:56.714
<v Speaker 4>activated in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your body is paralyzed so that you </v>

93
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 4>can't move around.</v>

94
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.433
<v Speaker 4>Your eyes are moving because of course </v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really matter if your eyes </v>

95
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 4>move while you're asleep because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>won't take you anywhere,</v>

96
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.090
<v Speaker 4>but if your legs were moving while you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were asleep,</v>

97
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 4>you run into walls while you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>dreaming,</v>

98
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:14.474
<v Speaker 4>and scientists have actually managed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>damage the motor inhibition systems in </v>

99
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:26.741
<v Speaker 4>cats so that they do move around when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're dreaming anyways.</v>

100
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.263
<v Speaker 4>If you wake up when someone's dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their brain is about as active as it is </v>

101
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 4>when they're awake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a tremendous amount of neural</v>

102
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:35.714
<v Speaker 4>processing going on in the dream state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you wake someone up when they're </v>

103
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:39.974
<v Speaker 4>dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's about an 80 percent chance that </v>

104
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:42.944
<v Speaker 4>they'll report the emotion of anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dreams tend to focus on threat </v>

105
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 4>processing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

106
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.990
<v Speaker 4>a threat is anything that might hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

107
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.453
<v Speaker 4>but it's more than that to a threat is </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that doesn't fit into your </v>

108
00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:58.634
<v Speaker 4>current conceptual scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so imagine that you have a theory about </v>

109
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:02.444
<v Speaker 4>the way the world is and then you act on</v>
<v Speaker 4>that theory and sometimes things work </v>

110
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 4>out the way you'd like them to work out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but often they don't,</v>

111
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 4>and every time things work out in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't how you would like or how you</v>

112
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:16.214
<v Speaker 4>predicted that indicates that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>some more about the world that you have </v>

113
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:25.510
<v Speaker 4>to learn about and that fact first </v>
<v Speaker 4>manifests itself in anxiety.</v>

114
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 4>Now the dream focuses on anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then it loosens up.</v>

115
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 4>It's the normal conceptual constraints </v>
<v Speaker 4>that characterize waking thinking and it</v>

116
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.134
<v Speaker 4>starts to a play in a sense or </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothesize about how your current </v>

117
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:45.614
<v Speaker 4>categorical structure could be shifted </v>
<v Speaker 4>around so that that threat could be </v>

118
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.260
<v Speaker 4>accounted for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

119
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 4>now that means the dream is dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that you need to understand,</v>

120
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 4>but you don't yet understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you wake up and you remember the</v>

121
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:01.254
<v Speaker 4>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dream doesn't really make sense </v>

122
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 4>because it's about something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

123
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.593
<v Speaker 4>Now it's your brain's best guess at </v>
<v Speaker 4>configuring or understanding the </v>

124
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:11.724
<v Speaker 4>unknowable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like it's like the first layer </v>

125
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:15.894
<v Speaker 4>of a multilayered process which </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually would culminate in fully </v>

126
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 4>developed thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe over months or maybe over years,</v>

127
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 4>or maybe you would never manage it at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

128
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.643
<v Speaker 4>The unknown thing or the threat is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>too great to really come to any terms </v>

129
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 4>with it whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

130
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:36.950
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine that you're dreaming about </v>
<v Speaker 4>something and it produces enough emotion</v>

131
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.903
<v Speaker 4>with the threat produces enough emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only to produce a very vivid dream </v>

132
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 4>but to wake you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you wake up,</v>

133
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 4>you remember the dream and then you go </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell someone about it.</v>

134
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:48.803
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dream is about something you don't </v>

135
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 4>yet understand that it's upsetting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you tell a bunch of people about it,</v>

136
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:55.164
<v Speaker 4>they're going to give you all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinions on the dream and that's a way </v>

137
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 4>that you can gather more information </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the threat,</v>

138
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 5>which is known as a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cynthia dream,</v>

139
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:11.781
<v Speaker 5>which is I'm traveling all puzzling </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's so abstract.</v>

140
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 5>Could you differentiate?</v>

141
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 4>I think it's clearer in the case of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nightmares and often too,</v>

142
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:20.640
<v Speaker 4>because nightmares tend to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>archetipal themes.</v>

143
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People for example,</v>

144
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:23.424
<v Speaker 4>are often threatened by monsters at </v>
<v Speaker 4>night and a monster is a chi mirror </v>

145
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.570
<v Speaker 4>that's made up of the different parts of</v>
<v Speaker 4>different parts of frightening things.</v>

146
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 4>A dragon is a camera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

147
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:35.694
<v Speaker 4>because it's made out of reptilian parts</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it also includes the idea of fire </v>

148
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:41.964
<v Speaker 4>and transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a nightmare is that a dream that </v>

149
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:47.304
<v Speaker 4>tends to use archetypal imagery to </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptualize a fairly powerful threat </v>

150
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:57.110
<v Speaker 4>and if you recount a nightmare to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person with no specific training,</v>

151
00:10:57.391 --> 00:10:58.224
<v Speaker 4>they're going to have some opinion about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and their opinion might be useful in </v>

152
00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 4>terms of information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Katherine,</v>

153
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.703
<v Speaker 4>but if you recount a dream to someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's psychologically trained and his </v>

154
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:08.364
<v Speaker 4>also symbolically trained and who has </v>
<v Speaker 4>great great depth of knowledge with </v>

155
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 4>regards to the structure of religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking and comparative literature,</v>

156
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.933
<v Speaker 4>the light that they're going to shed on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your dream is much brighter and more </v>

157
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:24.880
<v Speaker 4>profound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes a,</v>

158
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.430
<v Speaker 4>a dream interpretation can offer the </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who's had the dream,</v>

159
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.563
<v Speaker 4>a leap forward in knowledge that might </v>
<v Speaker 4>have taken them five or six years to </v>

160
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 4>conceptualize by themselves.</v>

161
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.120
<v Speaker 5>You might say that they wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>ordinarily have had.</v>

162
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:45.121
<v Speaker 5>Because the person who's the expert </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's had the knows and says,</v>

163
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.813
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know of that place that had been to </v>

164
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.820
<v Speaker 5>that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've had that symbol and it's.</v>

165
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.333
<v Speaker 5>And the bubble,</v>

166
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 3>what it feels like because of surely it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

167
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people say that me included,</v>

168
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.713
<v Speaker 3>I'm that one way to interpret a dream </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you wake up is just to just like </v>

169
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:11.131
<v Speaker 3>you would taste a sip of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just hold the flavor and,</v>

170
00:12:12.441 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 3>and hold the feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it feel like?</v>

171
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 3>What does feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what feels the same in your real life?</v>

172
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.023
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the dreams trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you with a collage of singles and </v>

173
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.550
<v Speaker 3>memories as well that is drawn on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>recent,</v>

174
00:12:26.551 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm conscious experience to try and put </v>
<v Speaker 3>it together.</v>

175
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Hence the dream can be very abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you say that's the case sometimes?</v>

176
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.523
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's two things about your </v>

177
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 4>comments that are really worth </v>
<v Speaker 4>highlighting in.</v>

178
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:40.984
<v Speaker 4>The first is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the category is that a dream uses are </v>

179
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 4>generally based on emotional similarity </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than logical similarity.</v>

180
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

181
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.263
<v Speaker 4>So a dream for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might represent fear or the fear of </v>

182
00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:56.274
<v Speaker 4>something unknown by using a </v>
<v Speaker 4>juxtaposition of a variety of images of </v>

183
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:00.894
<v Speaker 4>frightening thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So imagine that in the dream world the </v>

184
00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:08.391
<v Speaker 4>basic rule is all things that produced </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same emotion are the same thing.</v>

185
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.373
<v Speaker 4>And so you're a description of a dream </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation process that relies on </v>

186
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:19.290
<v Speaker 4>identifying similarities in emotional </v>
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>

187
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.130
<v Speaker 4>gets right to the core of how dream </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought works.</v>

188
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:24.840
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>secondarily,</v>

189
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:25.674
<v Speaker 4>I also believe that if you are able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>help someone or construct a dream </v>

190
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:36.960
<v Speaker 4>interpretation that fits there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>also able to feel that it fits,</v>

191
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.323
<v Speaker 4>it clicks or it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or it's like the punchline of a joke in </v>

192
00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:44.930
<v Speaker 4>some way they can tell that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation have,</v>

193
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.093
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put some missing pieces of the puzzle </v>

194
00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:49.014
<v Speaker 4>into place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think it's important to rely on </v>

195
00:13:51.661 --> 00:13:52.494
<v Speaker 4>that as an indicator of whether the </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation is actually derived from </v>

196
00:13:56.971 --> 00:14:01.290
<v Speaker 4>the dream or sort of just a theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 4>imposition on its structure.</v>

197
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.373
<v Speaker 4>Now we can go underneath that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mentioned already that basic </v>

198
00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:09.630
<v Speaker 4>categories are more action oriented than</v>
<v Speaker 4>object oriented.</v>

199
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.913
<v Speaker 4>So basic categories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the basic categories of the human mind </v>

200
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.920
<v Speaker 4>are categories to do things with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

201
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.053
<v Speaker 4>by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there also motivational and emotional </v>

202
00:14:20.671 --> 00:14:23.430
<v Speaker 4>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the primordial mind,</v>

203
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.840
<v Speaker 4>like the animal mind thinks sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>axiomatically,</v>

204
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.350
<v Speaker 4>that all things that produces the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion are the same thing.</v>

205
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.053
<v Speaker 4>So there's things that make you happy or</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's things that make you sad or </v>

206
00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:40.410
<v Speaker 4>there's things that make you anxious and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that all those things share the</v>

207
00:14:40.411 --> 00:14:45.411
<v Speaker 4>capacity to evoke that emotion speaks of</v>
<v Speaker 4>some essential identity between them.</v>

208
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:52.850
<v Speaker 4>Now the identity is in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the experiencer and not necessarily with</v>

209
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 4>regards to similarity between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>objects,</v>

210
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.013
<v Speaker 4>but it's still how we naturally think </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's certainly how mythologies </v>

211
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.780
<v Speaker 4>thinks and it's how drama thinks and how</v>
<v Speaker 4>religion things.</v>

212
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.653
<v Speaker 4>And we've lost sight of that in part </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we've become scientifically </v>

213
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:09.494
<v Speaker 4>trained to some degree and we tend to </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe that the real categories of the </v>

214
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:16.270
<v Speaker 4>world or object and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

215
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.133
<v Speaker 4>that just strikes me as it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about it that's wrong </v>

216
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.790
<v Speaker 4>and it's wrong because we have to act</v>

217
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.270
<v Speaker 5>emotional reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People</v>

218
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.670
<v Speaker 5>response.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For instance,</v>

219
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.760
<v Speaker 5>if you take the base emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she only one could go way,</v>

220
00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:39.664
<v Speaker 5>way back to the door.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Navarra beginnings when we came down </v>

221
00:15:42.821 --> 00:15:46.060
<v Speaker 5>from the trees and move through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>forest out onto the plains.</v>

222
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.340
<v Speaker 5>Hunter gatherers and animals do share </v>
<v Speaker 5>this with us because,</v>

223
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:52.570
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

224
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.570
<v Speaker 5>the everyday dog and cat does have </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotions.</v>

225
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.380
<v Speaker 5>Our emotions born out of originally just</v>
<v Speaker 5>pure instinct.</v>

226
00:16:01.511 --> 00:16:03.910
<v Speaker 5>Is this where the emotions came from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think?</v>

227
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.660
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because instinct cools is a reaction.</v>

228
00:16:07.661 --> 00:16:12.460
<v Speaker 5>You have the old adage of a fight or </v>
<v Speaker 5>flight for instance,</v>

229
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.920
<v Speaker 5>depending on what you make a decision to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

230
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let,</v>

231
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 4>let's make a conceptual definition here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We agree on the terminology.</v>

232
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:29.610
<v Speaker 4>Let's say that motivations are states of</v>
<v Speaker 4>being that indicated that are indicative</v>

233
00:16:32.561 --> 00:16:34.210
<v Speaker 4>of a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

234
00:16:34.211 --> 00:16:35.044
<v Speaker 4>if you get hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's a motivational state </v>

235
00:16:37.391 --> 00:16:38.224
<v Speaker 4>rather than an emotional state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a motivational state that sets </v>

236
00:16:41.741 --> 00:16:44.620
<v Speaker 4>the acquisition and ingestion of food as</v>
<v Speaker 4>the goal.</v>

237
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.740
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there's a variety of motivational</v>

238
00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:49.160
<v Speaker 4>states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunger,</v>

239
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.110
<v Speaker 4>thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual desire,</v>

240
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.280
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially defensive aggression,</v>

241
00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.330
<v Speaker 4>predatory aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

242
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.860
<v Speaker 4>and the desire to eliminate essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

243
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 4>the desire to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are all motivational states.</v>

244
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.700
<v Speaker 4>And then there's emotional states and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the primary emotional states or positive</v>

245
00:17:10.701 --> 00:17:11.534
<v Speaker 4>and negative and positive emotional </v>
<v Speaker 4>states are experienced when you're </v>

246
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:20.291
<v Speaker 4>moving towards a desired goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And negative emotional states occur when</v>

247
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.380
<v Speaker 4>the goal becomes uncertain or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pursuit is somehow frustrated or,</v>

248
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.600
<v Speaker 4>or interfered with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

249
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Now you asked about instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

250
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 4>I would say both motivations and </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotions or instincts,</v>

251
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.343
<v Speaker 4>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very archaic if you think about the </v>

252
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 4>positive and negative emotions as being </v>
<v Speaker 4>approach versus withdrawal.</v>

253
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.020
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals going all the way back to single</v>

254
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:52.230
<v Speaker 4>celled organisms have approach versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>withdrawal systems.</v>

255
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 4>So they're unbelievably archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go way back before,</v>

256
00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we split evolutionarily from,</v>

257
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.360
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our chimpanzee like ancestors.</v>

258
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.930
<v Speaker 4>So they are instincts and they're very </v>
<v Speaker 4>deep and they,</v>

259
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.523
<v Speaker 4>the fact that those instincts exist has </v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of strange and that their </v>

260
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary based have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has all sorts of strange implications.</v>

261
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.033
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can understand the dog and </v>

262
00:18:22.261 --> 00:18:23.094
<v Speaker 4>communicate with the dog because the dog</v>
<v Speaker 4>shares motivational and emotional </v>

263
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:29.120
<v Speaker 4>structure with you to great degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a pack animal,</v>

264
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.760
<v Speaker 4>knows about dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it knows about dominant striving,</v>

265
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.880
<v Speaker 4>it feels anxiety and pain and it knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to play and he likes to play.</v>

266
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot about a human being </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the dog through the same,</v>

267
00:18:42.631 --> 00:18:46.950
<v Speaker 4>which is why we can live together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you can go way down the evolutionary</v>

268
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:47.784
<v Speaker 4>chain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So say if you go all the way down to </v>

269
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:50.754
<v Speaker 4>lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lobsters know about dominance </v>

270
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:57.951
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies and they have approach and </v>
<v Speaker 4>withdraw systems and the lobster nervous</v>

271
00:18:59.071 --> 00:18:59.904
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is very primitive compared to the </v>

272
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:06.561
<v Speaker 4>human nervous system is so similar to </v>
<v Speaker 4>ours that you can give lobsters,</v>

273
00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:12.111
<v Speaker 4>antidepressants and it stops them from </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling hurt after that been defeated in</v>

274
00:19:13.371 --> 00:19:15.980
<v Speaker 4>a physical dominance dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

275
00:19:15.981 --> 00:19:16.814
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So typically if two lobsters are in a </v>

276
00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:26.021
<v Speaker 4>dominance dispute and one loses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will withdraw and then it'll,</v>

277
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 4>it kind of folds its body up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

278
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.030
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes into a depressed light crouch,</v>

279
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.450
<v Speaker 4>whereas the winter will expand his body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked bigger.</v>

280
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.000
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when the harvesters defeated,</v>

281
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.330
<v Speaker 4>it won't fight with any other lobster </v>
<v Speaker 4>for at least 20 minutes,</v>

282
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.430
<v Speaker 4>even one that it had defeated before.</v>

283
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.510
<v Speaker 4>But if you give it antidepressants in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the aftermath of its defeat,</v>

284
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.170
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't contract.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plus it'll fight right away.</v>

285
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.400
<v Speaker 4>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

286
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.600
<v Speaker 4>it just shows you the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

287
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.740
<v Speaker 4>the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of evolutionarily determined instincts,</v>

288
00:19:57.741 --> 00:20:00.200
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not a theory at all.</v>

289
00:20:00.201 --> 00:20:01.034
<v Speaker 4>It's an absolutely self evident fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it manifests itself in all sorts of </v>

290
00:20:05.841 --> 00:20:07.880
<v Speaker 4>strange ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

291
00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:12.881
<v Speaker 4>we know with chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzees basically go to war.</v>

292
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.603
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're wired up to regard chimpanzee </v>

293
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.590
<v Speaker 4>conspecifics who aren't in their tribe </v>
<v Speaker 4>as</v>

294
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.770
<v Speaker 4>something to react against with fear and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hostility.</v>

295
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.963
<v Speaker 4>And if a wandering group of chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 4>say numbering three or four at the </v>

296
00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:37.604
<v Speaker 4>periphery of their territory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes across an isolated individual or </v>

297
00:20:41.091 --> 00:20:41.924
<v Speaker 4>two from another group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll tear them into shreds and that </v>

298
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.033
<v Speaker 4>that primordial response to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stranger sheds substantial light on how </v>

299
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:59.791
<v Speaker 4>it is that human beings demonize and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then persecute their so called enemy</v>

300
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.320
<v Speaker 3>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hatred as well.</v>

301
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 3>And that can be demonization is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

302
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 3>is that correct?</v>

303
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:20.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can break it up into two aspects.</v>

304
00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:20.874
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is something I go into great </v>

305
00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:26.961
<v Speaker 4>detail about</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the book is about.</v>

306
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.470
<v Speaker 4>I was interested in territoriality and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cruelty</v>

307
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.650
<v Speaker 4>to animals are territorial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if another animal</v>

308
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.570
<v Speaker 4>trespasses onto a complex animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>territory,</v>

309
00:21:42.571 --> 00:21:45.540
<v Speaker 4>there'll be a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's really understandable</v>

310
00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:50.541
<v Speaker 4>because animals need territory and human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings are clearly territorial,</v>

311
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.880
<v Speaker 4>territorial about our actual physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>

312
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.013
<v Speaker 4>And we're also territorial about our </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideological or cultural space and it's </v>

313
00:21:59.131 --> 00:22:03.280
<v Speaker 4>because we need to inhabit the physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>territory and we need to inhabit and the</v>

314
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.123
<v Speaker 4>illogical territory and we react to </v>
<v Speaker 4>challenges to the integrity of our </v>

315
00:22:09.031 --> 00:22:12.960
<v Speaker 4>territory with fear and with defensive </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggression.</v>

316
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.770
<v Speaker 4>And I think that can be understood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

317
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:17.783
<v Speaker 4>quite appropriately using analogs from </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal behavior and animal </v>

318
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:22.674
<v Speaker 4>neurophysiology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you talked about resentment and </v>

319
00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:27.630
<v Speaker 4>hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

320
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.710
<v Speaker 4>those emotions I think are much more </v>
<v Speaker 4>specifically human.</v>

321
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.203
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of examples from 20th </v>
<v Speaker 4>century history of the persecution of </v>

322
00:22:38.641 --> 00:22:39.474
<v Speaker 4>enemies going far beyond what was merely</v>
<v Speaker 4>needed to ensure territorial integrity </v>

323
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.493
<v Speaker 4>on examples of course have that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior abound in the Holocaust </v>

324
00:22:50.611 --> 00:22:55.611
<v Speaker 4>literature where the Nazis went out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their way not only to eradicate the Jews</v>

325
00:22:59.731 --> 00:23:03.900
<v Speaker 4>and the Gypsies and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to torment them and torture them and</v>

326
00:23:03.901 --> 00:23:04.734
<v Speaker 4>crushed them in ways that were even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that weren't even in the best interests </v>

327
00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:10.554
<v Speaker 4>of the persecutor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a lot more difficult to </v>

328
00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:14.094
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

329
00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:24.640
<v Speaker 3>Treat them as no better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals as they called them,</v>

330
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.603
<v Speaker 3>but not forgetting that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier examples before when the </v>

331
00:23:30.761 --> 00:23:33.070
<v Speaker 3>Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms of numbers.</v>

332
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.080
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

333
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.920
<v Speaker 3>and its scale and its cold bloodiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we go back to,</v>

334
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>times of say,</v>

335
00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:45.991
<v Speaker 3>one of the earlier ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sirens that I thought were horrific</v>

336
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.273
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

337
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.113
<v Speaker 5>vlad the impaler who used to enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting eating his breakfast and having </v>

338
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.370
<v Speaker 5>his victims in paled before him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

339
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.850
<v Speaker 5>and that's psychopathic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

340
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.370
<v Speaker 5>really is there a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 5>that and say,</v>

341
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.890
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crimes or the Nazis.</v>

342
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:10.410
<v Speaker 4>I also think that kind of behavior is </v>
<v Speaker 4>far more normative</v>

343
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.860
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

344
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:14.893
<v Speaker 4>in modern times the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of become archetipal of </v>

345
00:24:18.181 --> 00:24:21.780
<v Speaker 4>totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil more than just brutality.</v>

346
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.150
<v Speaker 4>But my sense after having researched </v>
<v Speaker 4>this for,</v>

347
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.063
<v Speaker 4>for a lengthy period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that the whole behavior that </v>

348
00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:34.020
<v Speaker 4>characterize people who were involved in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Holocaust was</v>

349
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.520
<v Speaker 4>essentially normative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even in 20th century history,</v>

350
00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the numbers that the numbers involved in</v>

351
00:24:45.661 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 4>the Holocaust per se aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

352
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.570
<v Speaker 4>of any order of magnitude there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're special.</v>

353
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:55.410
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>

354
00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.350
<v Speaker 4>they're not immense by any stretch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the imagination.</v>

355
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:00.503
<v Speaker 4>Solzhenitsyn estimated that Stalin's </v>
<v Speaker 4>brutality killed something in the </v>

356
00:25:03.331 --> 00:25:04.164
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood of $60 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's estimates from mile that he </v>

357
00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:12.610
<v Speaker 4>killed 100 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in Cambodia,</v>

358
00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:15.010
<v Speaker 4>we know that at least 4 million people </v>
<v Speaker 4>died</v>

359
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.183
<v Speaker 4>like the Holocaust is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the prime exemplar of that kind </v>

360
00:25:24.481 --> 00:25:25.314
<v Speaker 4>of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it typified the 20th century and as </v>

361
00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:29.874
<v Speaker 4>you already pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like it arose in the 20th </v>

362
00:25:32.461 --> 00:25:33.060
<v Speaker 4>century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

363
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.940
<v Speaker 4>it's part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's part of our nature</v>

364
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.850
<v Speaker 5>victims into the gas chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

365
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:52.933
<v Speaker 5>the guy who press the release button on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the first atomic bomb fell on that </v>

366
00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:56.774
<v Speaker 5>aircraft that he knew would school to </v>
<v Speaker 5>thousands or hundreds of thousands of </v>

367
00:26:01.071 --> 00:26:05.180
<v Speaker 5>people because both those two people </v>
<v Speaker 5>believed in something.</v>

368
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.910
<v Speaker 5>Is this where it really boils down to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the difference between good and evil,</v>

369
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.220
<v Speaker 4>their claim that they believe in </v>
<v Speaker 4>something</v>

370
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.120
<v Speaker 4>to protect what they believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

371
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.540
<v Speaker 4>using the same mechanisms that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>protect territory.</v>

372
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.170
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you own your house and</v>

373
00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:35.600
<v Speaker 4>under English common law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have the right to say,</v>

374
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.690
<v Speaker 4>and then you have the right to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>leave.</v>

375
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.700
<v Speaker 4>I have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a gun and fire a warning shot.</v>

376
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 4>And then if they don't leave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have the right to shoot them and you</v>

377
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:50.530
<v Speaker 4>can't be prosecuted for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

378
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 4>And everyone would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

379
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 4>you are within your rights because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were protecting your territory.</v>

380
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.323
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think people have a right to </v>

381
00:26:59.131 --> 00:26:59.964
<v Speaker 4>protect their territory and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>right to protect their radiological </v>

382
00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:03.564
<v Speaker 4>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there is rules of engagement that </v>

383
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

384
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:11.290
<v Speaker 4>govern disputes of that nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you're,</v>

385
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.263
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's other sorts of act and many of </v>

386
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:19.131
<v Speaker 4>those characterized behavior in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentration camps in the Nazi era that</v>

387
00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 4>can't be explained by mere </v>
<v Speaker 4>territoriality.</v>

388
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 4>And that's when it's necessary as far as</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm concerned,</v>

389
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.320
<v Speaker 4>to bring in conceptions to rive from </v>
<v Speaker 4>mythology,</v>

390
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Speaker 4>like the difference between good and </v>
<v Speaker 4>evil.</v>

391
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.693
<v Speaker 4>And I think that you can define evil and</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil is an act that is designed to </v>

392
00:27:39.481 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 4>produce a negative outcome for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's involved.</v>

393
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.350
<v Speaker 4>That includes the victim and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>perpetrator.</v>

394
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.133
<v Speaker 4>Because if you look at the first few </v>
<v Speaker 4>chapters in genesis is a very clear </v>

395
00:27:58.931 --> 00:28:01.080
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let me tell you one of the stories.</v>

396
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.410
<v Speaker 4>It's really worth knowing as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>

397
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.760
<v Speaker 4>When Adam and eve eat the fruit of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tree,</v>

398
00:28:09.761 --> 00:28:14.761
<v Speaker 4>of the knowledge of good and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing that happens is that</v>

399
00:28:17.291 --> 00:28:20.590
<v Speaker 4>they noticed that their naked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does that mean?</v>

400
00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:25.260
<v Speaker 4>It means they're illuminated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>regards to their own vulnerable nature.</v>

401
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.413
<v Speaker 4>Because to be naked and to know your </v>
<v Speaker 4>naked is to be exposed and vulnerable </v>

402
00:28:29.561 --> 00:28:32.110
<v Speaker 4>and to know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And often people,</v>

403
00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:32.944
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will dream that they've been stripped </v>

404
00:28:34.301 --> 00:28:39.301
<v Speaker 4>naked in front of a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means their material vulnerability is</v>

405
00:28:40.421 --> 00:28:45.421
<v Speaker 4>exposed for everyone to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing Adam and eve do,</v>

406
00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.660
<v Speaker 4>once they discovered that they're naked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to close themselves.</v>

407
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:50.603
<v Speaker 4>They cover themselves up and human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings are the only creatures that were </v>

408
00:28:53.741 --> 00:28:54.574
<v Speaker 4>clothes and clothes separate our </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerability from the natural and </v>

409
00:28:59.291 --> 00:29:00.400
<v Speaker 4>social worlds.</v>

410
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.450
<v Speaker 4>They're protective in reality and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're protective symbolically.</v>

411
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.243
<v Speaker 4>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next thing that happens is that God </v>

412
00:29:09.491 --> 00:29:12.010
<v Speaker 4>comes walking through the garden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see in the morning,</v>

413
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:17.550
<v Speaker 4>and he looks for Adam and Adam is hiding</v>
<v Speaker 4>behind a Bush and God says,</v>

414
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.110
<v Speaker 4>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are you?</v>

415
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm used to walking with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Adam says,</v>

416
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.353
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm too afraid to come out because I </v>

417
00:29:27.221 --> 00:29:30.640
<v Speaker 4>found out that I'm naked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And God says,</v>

418
00:29:30.641 --> 00:29:33.850
<v Speaker 4>who told you that you were naked?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Adam blames the woman.</v>

419
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.070
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then you think,</v>

420
00:29:36.071 --> 00:29:38.170
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would adam hide from God?</v>

421
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.780
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so imagine God,</v>

422
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.440
<v Speaker 4>a</v>
<v Speaker 4>God symbolizes a transcendent totality.</v>

423
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.133
<v Speaker 4>And this story indicates that at some </v>
<v Speaker 4>point in human history there was an </v>

424
00:29:54.251 --> 00:29:55.084
<v Speaker 4>unbroken relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transcendent totality and the </v>

425
00:29:58.031 --> 00:29:58.864
<v Speaker 4>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when the individual became self </v>

426
00:30:01.131 --> 00:30:04.330
<v Speaker 4>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that totality was threatened.</v>

427
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 4>So why does Adam Hyde?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

428
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:11.560
<v Speaker 4>he knows he's naked and vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we hide from.</v>

429
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 4>He hides from the demands of of </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday.</v>

430
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 4>He hides from what's best in himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he looks at himself and thinks,</v>

431
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm weak.</v>

432
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:25.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can be easily hurt.</v>

433
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 4>And therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when God calls,</v>

434
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 4>if I have to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

435
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:35.110
<v Speaker 4>the next thing that happens is that Adam</v>
<v Speaker 4>and eve are thrown out of paradise.</v>

436
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.520
<v Speaker 4>And God says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

437
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life is going to be difficult now.</v>

438
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.220
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

439
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.153
<v Speaker 4>that's the issue up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next chapter starts with the birth </v>

440
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:47.044
<v Speaker 4>of Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now cain and Abel are the first two </v>

441
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.810
<v Speaker 4>humans born in history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

442
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:53.703
<v Speaker 4>Because everything that happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>garden of Eden prehistorical human </v>

443
00:30:58.901 --> 00:30:59.734
<v Speaker 4>history starts with the fall of man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rise of self consciousness and Cain </v>

444
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:04.834
<v Speaker 4>and Abel are the first two humans and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're symbolic of two attitudes </v>

445
00:31:09.431 --> 00:31:13.090
<v Speaker 4>towards the revelation of vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

446
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.860
<v Speaker 4>Abel is a shepherd</v>
<v Speaker 4>and came raises vegetables,</v>

447
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.890
<v Speaker 4>and they're both required to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifices to God.</v>

448
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.170
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

449
00:31:26.171 --> 00:31:27.760
<v Speaker 4>why would you make a sacrifice?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

450
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 4>it's an archaic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You burn something,</v>

451
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.970
<v Speaker 4>smoke rises up to heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God's in heaven,</v>

452
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:39.270
<v Speaker 4>and he can judge the quality of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice by evaluating the smoke.</v>

453
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.631
<v Speaker 4>Let me think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

454
00:31:40.631 --> 00:31:41.464
<v Speaker 4>that's a very archaic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what could a modern person do with </v>

455
00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:45.130
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

456
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 4>a modern person could give these archaic</v>
<v Speaker 4>people some credit first.</v>

457
00:31:49.721 --> 00:31:52.600
<v Speaker 4>So let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is God in heaven?</v>

458
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because when you look at the sky at</v>

459
00:31:55.511 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 4>night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it fills you with awe.</v>

460
00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:58.203
<v Speaker 4>You see an unlimited expanse of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's the closest you get to </v>

461
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.710
<v Speaker 4>directly experiencing the unnameable </v>
<v Speaker 4>totality.</v>

462
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why should you make sacrifices to God?</v>

463
00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.043
<v Speaker 4>Why would he be pleased with sacrifices?</v>
<v Speaker 4>While I would say you already know that </v>

464
00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:20.560
<v Speaker 4>because if I asked you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

465
00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:24.760
<v Speaker 4>what sacrifices have you made to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>things better in your life?</v>

466
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.193
<v Speaker 4>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could immediately tell me now are </v>

467
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:29.883
<v Speaker 4>people had to act that out because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't really have the philosophical </v>

468
00:32:32.681 --> 00:32:33.514
<v Speaker 4>conceptions and verbalized bubble form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they still had an intuition that it </v>

469
00:32:37.691 --> 00:32:38.524
<v Speaker 4>was necessary to make the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice in order to maintain an </v>

470
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 4>appropriate relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>totality of being okay,</v>

471
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.660
<v Speaker 4>so able make some sacrifices and cane </v>
<v Speaker 4>make some sacrifices.</v>

472
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 4>Now able takes the best things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has an offers them to God,</v>

473
00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.080
<v Speaker 4>so they're the firstborn of his flock </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the choices.</v>

474
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.460
<v Speaker 4>Cuts of meat with ables called on to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a sacrifice.</v>

475
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:02.623
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't hold anything back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He puts himself on the line and he </v>

476
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:11.381
<v Speaker 4>sacrifices a courageously and clearly </v>
<v Speaker 4>and cane.</v>

477
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:14.360
<v Speaker 4>By contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he brings in some ratty little,</v>

478
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wrinkly,</v>

479
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:17.534
<v Speaker 4>old vegetables and sacrifices those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So God smiles on unable sacrifices and </v>

480
00:33:23.841 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 4>frowns on canes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what does that mean?</v>

481
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>labels making the right sacrifices.</v>

482
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.280
<v Speaker 4>So everyone likes him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this,</v>

483
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:35.720
<v Speaker 4>his enterprises flourish?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has good intimate relationships.</v>

484
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

485
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:37.874
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>produces a thriving family because he </v>

486
00:33:40.071 --> 00:33:42.620
<v Speaker 4>makes the right decisions and cane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the other hand,</v>

487
00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 4>everything goes wrong for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this makes them mad.</v>

488
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:48.810
<v Speaker 4>It says in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his countenance falls.</v>

489
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:49.663
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets bitter and resentful and angry </v>

490
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:53.743
<v Speaker 4>and depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's mad about how things are turning </v>

491
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:59.810
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it goes and he has a little chat with</v>

492
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:01.100
<v Speaker 4>God and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

493
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.660
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's going on here.</v>

494
00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm working myself to the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm making sacrifices left,</v>

495
00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:09.440
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and center and everything is not turning</v>

496
00:34:09.441 --> 00:34:11.060
<v Speaker 4>out for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what gifts?</v>

497
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.600
<v Speaker 4>And God says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay attention here.</v>

498
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.610
<v Speaker 4>It's your problem that things aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>going well.</v>

499
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.170
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

500
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:25.880
<v Speaker 4>the monster of sin crouches at your door</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you welcome it in.</v>

501
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.280
<v Speaker 4>You could reject it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do things right.</v>

502
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.130
<v Speaker 4>You know exactly what the right thing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do is,</v>

503
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.810
<v Speaker 4>yet you refuse to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all the trouble you're having is your</v>

504
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:37.970
<v Speaker 4>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't come along and blame me.</v>

505
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:41.060
<v Speaker 4>Just get yourself put together properly </v>
<v Speaker 4>and do things right.</v>

506
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.000
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

507
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't what cain wants to hear.</v>

508
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.520
<v Speaker 4>He wants to hear that the world is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>miserable place and that the reason that</v>

509
00:34:49.521 --> 00:34:52.550
<v Speaker 4>he's failing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is because of the structure of reality.</v>

510
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.560
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't want to hear that it's his </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

511
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:55.993
<v Speaker 4>so this just makes them absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 4>boiling map and the first thing he does </v>

512
00:34:59.211 --> 00:35:01.940
<v Speaker 4>is go and kill Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

513
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.583
<v Speaker 4>that's the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>territoriality and evil and he wants </v>

514
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:09.590
<v Speaker 4>what April has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He even wants to be able,</v>

515
00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:14.540
<v Speaker 4>but instead he destroys them out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>spite and resentment and revenge against</v>

516
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.280
<v Speaker 4>the nature of reality.</v>

517
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:20.670
<v Speaker 4>Well then God gets wind of it and mark </v>
<v Speaker 4>cane,</v>

518
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.670
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one killed him,</v>

519
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:23.990
<v Speaker 4>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

520
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:24.824
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's God who says an eye for an </v>

521
00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:28.160
<v Speaker 4>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

522
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 4>the next little bit of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is barely there anymore,</v>

523
00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:33.650
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so edited out,</v>

524
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:38.900
<v Speaker 4>explains exactly why cain wanders away </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he gets married and he has a family.</v>

525
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 4>But if you mess around with any of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Keynes family,</v>

526
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:49.260
<v Speaker 4>if you annoy them or bother them or make</v>
<v Speaker 4>them resentful or angry,</v>

527
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:50.094
<v Speaker 4>they don't just kill one person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They killed seven and then those </v>

528
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 4>children have children and if you annoy </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

529
00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:56.994
<v Speaker 4>they kill 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at the end of that acceleration of </v>

530
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.950
<v Speaker 4>revenge oriented killing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God comes along and floods everything.</v>

531
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:10.920
<v Speaker 4>And that's when the story of Noah and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Ark Kicks in,</v>

532
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.770
<v Speaker 4>and the story is very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says this,</v>

533
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:16.703
<v Speaker 4>if you act in properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you do the things that you know </v>

534
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:22.110
<v Speaker 4>to be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't make the right sacrifices,</v>

535
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.370
<v Speaker 4>your life will not turn out well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll be punished all the time for your</v>

536
00:36:26.371 --> 00:36:30.150
<v Speaker 4>foolishness and your weakness and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>will make you resentful,</v>

537
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.590
<v Speaker 4>twisted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitter,</v>

538
00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:35.010
<v Speaker 4>and murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you act on those,</v>

539
00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:36.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivations,</v>

540
00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:39.810
<v Speaker 4>because of spite and resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

541
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:44.990
<v Speaker 4>you'll initiate a cataclysm of revenge </v>
<v Speaker 4>oriented killings.</v>

542
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:46.883
<v Speaker 4>And if no stop is put to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that will spread through the entire </v>

543
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 4>society and invite the apocalypse.</v>

544
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.640
<v Speaker 4>And that's the second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>third major story in genesis.</v>

545
00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:01.923
<v Speaker 4>Exactly right.</v>

546
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Would you call it moral teaching there </v>
<v Speaker 5>or was it more than that?</v>

547
00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.720
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

548
00:37:14.721 --> 00:37:15.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

549
00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:16.970
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

550
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.670
<v Speaker 4>it's moral in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

551
00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:20.504
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

552
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.900
<v Speaker 4>it's more like a description of moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>

553
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.820
<v Speaker 4>Then a story that says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

554
00:37:25.821 --> 00:37:28.280
<v Speaker 4>you should act like this because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be good.</v>

555
00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.220
<v Speaker 4>If you imagine this story of Cain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Abel,</v>

556
00:37:31.221 --> 00:37:35.420
<v Speaker 4>this is a really old story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been around for we have no idea how</v>

557
00:37:35.421 --> 00:37:36.254
<v Speaker 4>long I'm in written form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been around for several thousand </v>

558
00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.453
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's undoubtedly part of a larger oral </v>

559
00:37:42.171 --> 00:37:45.830
<v Speaker 4>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was edited by many,</v>

560
00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:46.664
<v Speaker 4>many people and told and retold and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's left of that story is what's </v>

561
00:37:51.711 --> 00:37:56.711
<v Speaker 4>intensely memorable because otherwise it</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't have been forgotten and it just</v>

562
00:37:57.081 --> 00:38:00.380
<v Speaker 4>says something blatantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says that</v>

563
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.343
<v Speaker 4>you can accept your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can accept the need to make </v>

564
00:38:07.431 --> 00:38:12.431
<v Speaker 4>sacrifices in order to keep your life on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the right track or you can fight against</v>

565
00:38:14.451 --> 00:38:16.370
<v Speaker 4>that and act improperly.</v>

566
00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 4>If you fight against that inactive </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>

567
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:20.203
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to compromise your </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with the totality of big </v>

568
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:25.123
<v Speaker 4>and as soon as you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might as well essentially you're </v>

569
00:38:28.251 --> 00:38:33.251
<v Speaker 4>living in a hell if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you subject yourself chronically to a</v>

570
00:38:33.531 --> 00:38:34.364
<v Speaker 4>hellish existence that will make you </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn your thoughts towards really </v>

571
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:42.040
<v Speaker 4>towards revenge against existence </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

572
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

573
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.513
<v Speaker 4>Stellan was setting himself up to blow </v>
<v Speaker 4>up the entire planet and there's good </v>

574
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:52.140
<v Speaker 4>evidence from the KGB archivist in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>late 19 fifties,</v>

575
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.983
<v Speaker 4>but he was gearing up with his multiple </v>
<v Speaker 4>pre a pre apocalyptic genocidal </v>

576
00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:05.131
<v Speaker 4>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was gearing up enough courage to turn</v>

577
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:09.550
<v Speaker 4>the whole world into a conflagration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

578
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.773
<v Speaker 4>this is no a trivial matter and the only</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories that I know that have enough </v>

579
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:19.774
<v Speaker 4>profundity to lay out the real </v>
<v Speaker 4>seriousness of the issue are these </v>

580
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:28.310
<v Speaker 4>archaic stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing in modern culture has the</v>

581
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:30.860
<v Speaker 6>requisite profundity</v>

<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Www Dot astraea magazine don't coma.</v>

592
00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.830
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a trivial matter,</v>

593
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:26.943
<v Speaker 4>and the only stories that I know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have enough profundity to lay out the </v>

594
00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:37.240
<v Speaker 4>real seriousness of the issue are these </v>
<v Speaker 4>archaic stories.</v>

595
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.400
<v Speaker 4>Nothing in modern culture has the </v>
<v Speaker 4>requisite profundity</v>

596
00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.340
<v Speaker 5>we do have as you get out of life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you put into it,</v>

597
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:52.400
<v Speaker 5>and another one that comes to mind is he</v>
<v Speaker 5>who lives by the sword dies by the sword</v>

598
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:55.163
<v Speaker 5>in the east.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have the concept of a tradition of </v>

599
00:40:58.711 --> 00:40:59.544
<v Speaker 5>Karma.</v>

600
00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:00.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

601
00:41:00.031 --> 00:41:00.864
<v Speaker 4>Karma Karma is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Karma is a really good example because </v>

602
00:41:03.391 --> 00:41:06.300
<v Speaker 4>the idea behind Karma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very interesting.</v>

603
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.553
<v Speaker 4>I think from a neuropsychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective because Karma is predicated </v>

604
00:41:12.391 --> 00:41:13.224
<v Speaker 4>on the idea that it is fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible for you to get away with </v>

605
00:41:16.351 --> 00:41:20.790
<v Speaker 4>anything and there's an idea in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Christianity that's like that too.</v>

606
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.750
<v Speaker 4>It's a little more archaic and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>dramatic than the idea of Karma.</v>

607
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:29.700
<v Speaker 4>Now idea in Christianity is that all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your actions and motivations are in some</v>

608
00:41:29.701 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 4>manner recorded and that you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought to for them,</v>

609
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:39.610
<v Speaker 4>but and modern people look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when it's</v>

610
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.800
<v Speaker 4>represented metaphorically as say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wise old man writing in a book.</v>

611
00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:46.634
<v Speaker 4>I may just discounted entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've certainly come to believe as a </v>

612
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:55.250
<v Speaker 4>consequences of studying what I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>studied that you you.</v>

613
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.720
<v Speaker 4>It is absolutely impossible for you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get away with anything.</v>

614
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you make a mistake and you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a mistake,</v>

615
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:05.960
<v Speaker 4>you will eventually pay for it.</v>

616
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:06.943
<v Speaker 4>You might not notice that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're paying for because often the </v>

617
00:42:10.551 --> 00:42:15.551
<v Speaker 4>punishment and the crime are so distant </v>
<v Speaker 4>in time from one another that the causal</v>

618
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:19.160
<v Speaker 4>connection is virtually impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 4>identify,</v>

619
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean it isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

620
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.013
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I attempted to lay out</v>
<v Speaker 4>in maps of meaning in some detail was </v>

621
00:42:27.481 --> 00:42:32.481
<v Speaker 4>soldier and instance insights into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>processes that lead to the establishment</v>

622
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:37.160
<v Speaker 4>of the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Prison camps in the Soviet Union were so</v>

623
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:39.890
<v Speaker 4>many tens of millions of people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed.</v>

624
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:41.803
<v Speaker 4>It was Solzhenitsyn's a belief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a belief that you share </v>

625
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.360
<v Speaker 4>Sheridan and as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eric Norman,</v>

626
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:49.693
<v Speaker 4>that it was the cumulative sins of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals that made up a population </v>

627
00:42:56.570 --> 00:43:01.100
<v Speaker 4>that culminated in these absolute </v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarian catastrophes.</v>

628
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:02.923
<v Speaker 4>So just as keynes unwillingness to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>the appropriate sacrifices in his </v>

629
00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:09.284
<v Speaker 4>individual day to day life culminated in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the degeneration of his entire society </v>

630
00:43:14.481 --> 00:43:17.010
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the uh,</v>

631
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

632
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 4>and the bringing forth an apocalypse.</v>

633
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:23.083
<v Speaker 4>So in everyday life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>each individual's moral errors </v>

634
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.453
<v Speaker 4>accumulate and manifest themselves at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>social level and play themselves out in </v>

635
00:43:34.491 --> 00:43:37.580
<v Speaker 4>this immense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this immense,</v>

636
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.653
<v Speaker 4>a forum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we don't like to think that way </v>

637
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:42.403
<v Speaker 4>because no individual likes to feel that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're localized foolishness and </v>

638
00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:48.224
<v Speaker 4>weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conscious foolishness and weakness </v>

639
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:53.600
<v Speaker 4>reverberates through the entire social </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure.</v>

640
00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:59.110
<v Speaker 4>But everything that I've ever read that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was serious with regards to this subject</v>

641
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.120
<v Speaker 4>indicated precisely that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean even Hannah run,</v>

642
00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:10.130
<v Speaker 4>she wrote the banality of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

643
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:11.323
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the evil of banality </v>

644
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.380
<v Speaker 4>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she,</v>

645
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.660
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

646
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:18.770
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the architect of the,</v>

647
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.920
<v Speaker 4>of the final solution was a meek,</v>
<v Speaker 4>negligible,</v>

648
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.730
<v Speaker 4>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nonentity.</v>

649
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:30.163
<v Speaker 4>And what that shows you is just how </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrifying it is morally to be a week </v>

650
00:44:35.341 --> 00:44:37.110
<v Speaker 4>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>judgemental,</v>

651
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:38.690
<v Speaker 4>non entity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

652
00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:39.603
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so catastrophic that under the </v>

653
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.690
<v Speaker 4>appropriate conditions it can endanger </v>
<v Speaker 4>the structure of being.</v>

654
00:44:55.510 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 3>You talk about the fact that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfortable with the known what is known</v>

655
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:06.910
<v Speaker 3>around which we build all our cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditions and from which,</v>

656
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:09.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>propagated,</v>

657
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.080
<v Speaker 3>and then there's exploration of the new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>

658
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.320
<v Speaker 3>and how we can act on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you tell us a bit more about that?</v>

659
00:45:17.321 --> 00:45:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Because you're insinuating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in your,</v>

660
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:25.120
<v Speaker 3>your work that in your book that to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>so I can make one some kind of a,</v>

661
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.260
<v Speaker 3>some kind of heroic action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

662
00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.213
<v Speaker 3>you've mapped out something whereby we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can reach out for what is unknown to </v>

663
00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:38.920
<v Speaker 3>explore a potential and creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that correct?</v>

664
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.380
<v Speaker 4>That's a good summary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

665
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.770
<v Speaker 4>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine that in life you have,</v>

666
00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:48.370
<v Speaker 4>you have some one obvious thing to rely </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and the obvious thing,</v>

667
00:45:48.371 --> 00:45:53.371
<v Speaker 4>you have to rely on it as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>traditional knowledge and wealth of your</v>

668
00:45:53.561 --> 00:45:54.394
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It contains most of the knowledge that </v>

669
00:45:57.251 --> 00:45:58.084
<v Speaker 4>you have and allows you to make your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life as comfortable as it has been made </v>

670
00:46:04.721 --> 00:46:05.554
<v Speaker 4>within it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there are other sources of strength </v>

671
00:46:09.251 --> 00:46:14.251
<v Speaker 4>too and they're more subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your culture provides you with what's</v>

672
00:46:14.501 --> 00:46:15.334
<v Speaker 4>known and what's knowable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but culture is never mapped everything </v>

673
00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:23.230
<v Speaker 4>out perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's many things that remain to be to</v>

674
00:46:23.231 --> 00:46:27.610
<v Speaker 4>be known and many of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>remain to be known are valuable.</v>

675
00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:32.200
<v Speaker 4>And what that means is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>search after what is yet unknown,</v>

676
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:33.303
<v Speaker 4>you can also derive strength from that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's the domain in which new </v>

677
00:46:38.021 --> 00:46:39.130
<v Speaker 4>discoveries are made.</v>

678
00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:43.240
<v Speaker 4>And so if I face you with evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're wrong about something,</v>

679
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:45.303
<v Speaker 4>which means there's something that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know that you're not taking into </v>

680
00:46:47.561 --> 00:46:48.394
<v Speaker 4>account that can frighten you because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>shows you that the knowledge structures </v>

681
00:46:52.511 --> 00:46:53.344
<v Speaker 4>that you rely on are dangerously </v>
<v Speaker 4>incomplete and that can make you very </v>

682
00:46:56.411 --> 00:46:59.770
<v Speaker 4>angry and that can make you very </v>
<v Speaker 4>resentful or you can say,</v>

683
00:46:59.771 --> 00:47:01.360
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that so fascinating?</v>

684
00:47:01.361 --> 00:47:02.194
<v Speaker 4>The fact that something isn't known here</v>
<v Speaker 4>means that I could go and discover that </v>

685
00:47:05.711 --> 00:47:06.544
<v Speaker 4>I could voluntarily encountered that and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could derive something new and </v>

686
00:47:09.841 --> 00:47:10.674
<v Speaker 4>valuable and I could use that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the hero in methodology is the </v>

687
00:47:15.431 --> 00:47:18.280
<v Speaker 4>person who voluntarily encounters the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown.</v>

688
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:22.540
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a unbelievably old concept,</v>

689
00:47:22.541 --> 00:47:27.400
<v Speaker 4>is the oldest concept we know that human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings have created it stems all the way</v>

690
00:47:27.401 --> 00:47:31.120
<v Speaker 4>back to the Enuma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>

691
00:47:31.121 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 4>which is the oldest written document we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

692
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:34.563
<v Speaker 4>and it's the Enuma elish is the story on</v>
<v Speaker 4>which the first story in genesis is </v>

693
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:40.114
<v Speaker 4>based.</v>

694
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:41.163
<v Speaker 4>Now here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a way of thinking about things </v>

695
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 4>and this is a mythological way and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely useful.</v>

696
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.513
<v Speaker 4>So forget for a minute the idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world is made out of matter and forget </v>

697
00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:56.800
<v Speaker 4>that it's made out of objects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at it from a different perspective.</v>

698
00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:01.870
<v Speaker 4>We'll say the world of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the world you inhabit,</v>

699
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:07.180
<v Speaker 4>is made out of three things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's made out of the fact that no matter</v>

700
00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:08.014
<v Speaker 4>how much you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are going to be phenomenon </v>

701
00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.920
<v Speaker 4>occurrences that exceed your capacity </v>
<v Speaker 4>for comprehension,</v>

702
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:16.683
<v Speaker 4>and that's always going to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we're going to call that a </v>

703
00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:25.000
<v Speaker 4>category.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the category of the unknown.</v>

704
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.510
<v Speaker 4>And then there are always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that you know and understand,</v>

705
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.060
<v Speaker 4>and that's part of your tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to call that the known,</v>

706
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:33.790
<v Speaker 4>so wherever you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever you are,</v>

707
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.670
<v Speaker 4>there's a balance between the known and </v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown</v>

708
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.270
<v Speaker 4>and then the third thing is the fact of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

709
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.133
<v Speaker 4>There's a conscious observer there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the conscious observer is the place </v>

710
00:48:45.341 --> 00:48:47.500
<v Speaker 4>where the known and the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 4>interact.</v>

711
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:51.040
<v Speaker 4>That's the mythological actors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the known.</v>

712
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:52.263
<v Speaker 4>That's the great father unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the great mother and the </v>

713
00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:56.044
<v Speaker 4>individual and the Taoists represent </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as yin and Yang or chaos versus </v>

714
00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:03.544
<v Speaker 4>order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People think about that as masculine </v>

715
00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:08.710
<v Speaker 4>versus feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gives us a bad interpretation or an</v>

716
00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.680
<v Speaker 4>insufficient interpretation of Dallas </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>

717
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:12.783
<v Speaker 4>The Dallas say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences made of chaos and order and </v>

718
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:18.484
<v Speaker 4>the proper place to stand is right </v>
<v Speaker 4>between them and you can tell when </v>

719
00:49:23.201 --> 00:49:24.034
<v Speaker 4>you're standing right between chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 4>order because that's when you feel that </v>

720
00:49:27.461 --> 00:49:28.294
<v Speaker 4>things are meaningful and that means </v>
<v Speaker 4>that meaning is the instinct that tells </v>

721
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:34.240
<v Speaker 4>you that you're standing in the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

722
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.513
<v Speaker 4>Now people are vulnerable and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>afraid because of that and they can be </v>

723
00:49:39.131 --> 00:49:43.030
<v Speaker 4>challenged and hurt and they can be made</v>
<v Speaker 4>angry and murderous,</v>

724
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 4>but I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

725
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:48.190
<v Speaker 4>if you stand between chaos and order </v>
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>

726
00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:50.163
<v Speaker 4>your life can become so meaningful that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the meaning gives you confidence and </v>

727
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:59.020
<v Speaker 4>power and the ability to overcome your </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of shameful vulnerability,</v>

728
00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.790
<v Speaker 4>and I would also say that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious stories or telling you to do.</v>

729
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:07.690
<v Speaker 4>Now we go back to genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the beginning,</v>

730
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.393
<v Speaker 4>God makes order out of chaos and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>story is based on an older architecture </v>

731
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:17.710
<v Speaker 4>derived from the Enuma Elish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Enuma Elish,</v>

732
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:18.693
<v Speaker 4>a god named Marduk cuts up the dragon of</v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos and makes the world out of her </v>

733
00:50:24.101 --> 00:50:24.934
<v Speaker 4>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While the dragon of chaos recurs as a </v>

734
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.110
<v Speaker 4>mythological motifs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frequently,</v>

735
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:36.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm generally in the guise of Leviathan </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

736
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:38.803
<v Speaker 4>and Yahuah is envisioned as the deity </v>
<v Speaker 4>that derives order habitable order from </v>

737
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:49.180
<v Speaker 4>chaos and immediately after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

738
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:51.320
<v Speaker 4>what derives happened to Florida from </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos.</v>

739
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.243
<v Speaker 4>He announces he makes human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then he announces that they are made in </v>

740
00:50:56.061 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 4>his image,</v>
<v Speaker 4>male and female,</v>

741
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.670
<v Speaker 4>made in his image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

742
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.920
<v Speaker 4>we think that means that God is like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>human being,</v>

743
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:08.480
<v Speaker 4>but what it really means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>human being is like God,</v>

744
00:51:08.481 --> 00:51:12.170
<v Speaker 4>isn't that the human being has the </v>
<v Speaker 4>capacity to make order out of chaos,</v>

745
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:14.023
<v Speaker 4>and when we say that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>divine about a person that gives them </v>

746
00:51:16.761 --> 00:51:21.761
<v Speaker 4>intrinsic rights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we mean is the fact that each human</v>

747
00:51:21.801 --> 00:51:26.801
<v Speaker 4>being can make order out of chaos means </v>
<v Speaker 4>that every single person is deserving of</v>

748
00:51:28.371 --> 00:51:31.760
<v Speaker 4>a certain kind of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they're murderous,</v>

749
00:51:31.761 --> 00:51:32.594
<v Speaker 4>even if they're criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if they're prostitutes and tax </v>

750
00:51:35.241 --> 00:51:37.520
<v Speaker 4>collectors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're still,</v>

751
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:38.503
<v Speaker 4>they're still embodied with the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dignity that only identity with God can </v>

752
00:51:43.131 --> 00:51:43.964
<v Speaker 4>provide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that identity is the capacity to </v>

753
00:51:45.591 --> 00:51:49.130
<v Speaker 4>make order out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not just a metaphor.</v>

754
00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:05.730
<v Speaker 3>What's happening with those sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals is very suppressed or has it</v>

755
00:52:06.341 --> 00:52:07.174
<v Speaker 3>really died?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something in them died as spark gone </v>

756
00:52:09.041 --> 00:52:09.874
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

757
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.440
<v Speaker 4>That's such a difficult question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

758
00:52:13.441 --> 00:52:15.600
<v Speaker 4>because we know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

759
00:52:15.601 --> 00:52:19.170
<v Speaker 4>that certain kinds of extreme brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>damage,</v>

760
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:25.870
<v Speaker 4>criminal behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your prefrontal cortex is damaged,</v>

761
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:30.900
<v Speaker 4>then that can make you impulsive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>criminal.</v>

762
00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.860
<v Speaker 4>From a scientific perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's very difficult to judge</v>

763
00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:38.963
<v Speaker 4>the culpability of certain people </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they've been damaged in some </v>

764
00:52:42.511 --> 00:52:45.570
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't really understand the limits on</v>

765
00:52:45.571 --> 00:52:50.160
<v Speaker 4>their capacity to choose are compromised</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's very,</v>

766
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.560
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

767
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.633
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a situation that has to be judged </v>

768
00:52:54.811 --> 00:52:59.811
<v Speaker 4>carefully in each individual case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then mythologically I would say what</v>

769
00:53:00.031 --> 00:53:03.780
<v Speaker 4>Solzhenitsyn said and what he said was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in every person,</v>

770
00:53:03.781 --> 00:53:04.614
<v Speaker 4>no matter how good there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little corner of corruption and evil </v>

771
00:53:08.521 --> 00:53:12.150
<v Speaker 4>that still hasn't been overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in everyone,</v>

772
00:53:12.151 --> 00:53:12.984
<v Speaker 4>no matter how evil and corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a little bit of a little corner </v>

773
00:53:15.811 --> 00:53:18.390
<v Speaker 4>of good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's still a possibility that might be</v>

774
00:53:18.391 --> 00:53:19.224
<v Speaker 4>made manifest itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't exactly know how to </v>

775
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.030
<v Speaker 4>reconcile those two viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

776
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think each of them are right,</v>

777
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 4>even though they're juxtaposition makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

778
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 4>makes a paradox.</v>

779
00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.290
<v Speaker 3>So looking at</v>

780
00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:43.330
<v Speaker 4>read about Ted Bundy in all about Ted </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bundy.</v>

781
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:44.720
<v Speaker 3>What was that last?</v>

782
00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:50.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very good looking young man and uh,</v>

783
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:52.103
<v Speaker 4>he raped and murdered a number of young </v>
<v Speaker 4>women and one of his tricks was to put </v>

784
00:53:56.881 --> 00:54:01.881
<v Speaker 4>on a fake cast and to elicit a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sympathetic to stop someone,</v>

785
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.073
<v Speaker 4>someone young and beautiful who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving a vehicle to use their sympathy </v>

786
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:13.371
<v Speaker 4>as a means of getting them compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a terrible person,</v>

787
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:19.520
<v Speaker 4>but I read about his journey down hill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

788
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:24.800
<v Speaker 4>and he said he first started to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in violent pornography and that</v>

789
00:54:25.201 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 4>as far as he was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was what opened the door.</v>

790
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's a good metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

791
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:31.763
<v Speaker 4>one of the things you've talked about </v>
<v Speaker 4>continually when he was attempting to </v>

792
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:37.920
<v Speaker 4>explain what had happened in Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany was the fact that</v>

793
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:40.263
<v Speaker 4>a person moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving downhill to some horrific </v>

794
00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.480
<v Speaker 4>endpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a concentration camp guards say,</v>

795
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.300
<v Speaker 4>makes a little mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows it's a mistake,</v>

796
00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:52.173
<v Speaker 4>makes a little mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little compromise and that puts them in </v>

797
00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:58.050
<v Speaker 4>a position where another compromise is </v>
<v Speaker 4>more likely.</v>

798
00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.233
<v Speaker 4>And then that puts them in a position </v>
<v Speaker 4>where another compromise is more likely </v>

799
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.780
<v Speaker 4>and 300 compromises later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

800
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:10.530
<v Speaker 4>there's a great book called ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>

801
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.530
<v Speaker 4>It's a study of a police battalion and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pool,</v>

802
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:17.610
<v Speaker 4>and these men started out as normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle aged policemen,</v>

803
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:22.500
<v Speaker 4>most of them adults before Hitler even </v>
<v Speaker 4>came to power,</v>

804
00:55:22.501 --> 00:55:27.501
<v Speaker 4>so not victims of hitlarian propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 4>in their maturing phase.</v>

805
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.823
<v Speaker 4>They went from perfectly ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 4>policeman to men who were taking naked </v>

806
00:55:31.921 --> 00:55:36.270
<v Speaker 4>pregnant women out into fields and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting them behind the head and</v>

807
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:43.580
<v Speaker 4>the book details their descent into this</v>
<v Speaker 4>hellish place step by step.</v>

808
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's how people defend,</v>

809
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:48.383
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's step by step and I believe under </v>

810
00:55:50.491 --> 00:55:54.180
<v Speaker 4>most circumstances that every step is </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious.</v>

811
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.720
<v Speaker 4>Even though the memory of making this </v>
<v Speaker 4>step might fade into unconsciousness and</v>

812
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:01.524
<v Speaker 4>the full cataclysmic consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 4>each moral error aren't necessarily </v>

813
00:56:06.601 --> 00:56:07.434
<v Speaker 4>evident.</v>

814
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:13.000
<v Speaker 3>In the case of looking at the individual</v>
<v Speaker 3>as to the</v>

815
00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:15.483
<v Speaker 3>very quickly when someone has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's known as a nervous breakdown is </v>

816
00:56:19.551 --> 00:56:22.780
<v Speaker 3>that when they just can't make order out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of anything,</v>

817
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 3>just can't cope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just a withdrawal.</v>

818
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:32.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean what we could look at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuropsychologically or we could look at</v>

819
00:56:32.341 --> 00:56:36.510
<v Speaker 4>it descriptively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's what happens.</v>

820
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:37.413
<v Speaker 4>Neuropsychologically there is a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain organ called the hippocampus and </v>

821
00:56:42.511 --> 00:56:45.810
<v Speaker 4>the hippocampus helps you know where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>are and what you're doing,</v>

822
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:51.740
<v Speaker 4>and it inhibits a whole array of more </v>
<v Speaker 4>primordial emotional structures,</v>

823
00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:57.180
<v Speaker 4>particularly the Amygdala and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypothalamus.</v>

824
00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.193
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Amygdala is responsible for anxiety </v>

825
00:56:59.731 --> 00:57:00.564
<v Speaker 4>and fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the hypothalamus is responsible for </v>

826
00:57:02.971 --> 00:57:06.000
<v Speaker 4>all different kinds of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

827
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:09.000
<v Speaker 4>as long as you know where you are and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're doing,</v>

828
00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:10.043
<v Speaker 4>which means that when you act,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the outcome you desire occurs because </v>

829
00:57:13.621 --> 00:57:16.620
<v Speaker 4>that sort of defines knowing where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were and what you're doing.</v>

830
00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:21.210
<v Speaker 4>Then the Amygdala and the hypothalamus </v>
<v Speaker 4>remained inhibited.</v>

831
00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as things aren't turning out the</v>

832
00:57:24.901 --> 00:57:29.160
<v Speaker 4>way you expect them to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the Amygdala is disinhibited and so</v>

833
00:57:29.161 --> 00:57:29.994
<v Speaker 4>as I elements and then the Hypo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you get afraid and paralyzed and </v>

834
00:57:34.591 --> 00:57:38.370
<v Speaker 4>the hypothalamus starts to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 4>stress hormone called Cortisol.</v>

835
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:42.510
<v Speaker 4>Now Cortisol is in some ways a </v>
<v Speaker 4>stimulant.</v>

836
00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.393
<v Speaker 4>It'll stimulate exploratory behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in small doses it's pretty good for </v>

837
00:57:47.041 --> 00:57:47.874
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in large doses it hyperactivates </v>

838
00:57:52.711 --> 00:57:55.590
<v Speaker 4>your physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shuts off your immune system.</v>

839
00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.660
<v Speaker 4>It compromises your longterm cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability and it's toxic.</v>

840
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:06.260
<v Speaker 4>It starts to destroy the hippocampus and</v>
<v Speaker 4>other destroys the hippocampus.</v>

841
00:58:06.871 --> 00:58:07.704
<v Speaker 4>The ability of the hippocampus to </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhibit your negative emotional </v>

842
00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:12.954
<v Speaker 4>responses is increasingly compromised </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that turns into a cycle and if the </v>

843
00:58:18.271 --> 00:58:19.104
<v Speaker 4>cycle gets instantiated with enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>intensity than the entire negative </v>

844
00:58:23.851 --> 00:58:28.851
<v Speaker 4>emotional system can get this inhibit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the knowledge structures start start</v>

845
00:58:29.371 --> 00:58:30.204
<v Speaker 4>to become demolished.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When people talk about a nervous </v>

846
00:58:34.231 --> 00:58:37.350
<v Speaker 4>breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is usually a post traumatic stress</v>

847
00:58:37.351 --> 00:58:39.720
<v Speaker 4>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chronic repeating depression,</v>

848
00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:42.030
<v Speaker 4>that's basically what they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

849
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:43.853
<v Speaker 3>If you have a conversation with someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who goes through the regular bouts of </v>

850
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:52.850
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the perception of reality is distorted.</v>

851
00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:57.420
<v Speaker 3>They just see everything negative about </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything you can think about.</v>

852
00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:58.701
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

853
00:58:58.701 --> 00:59:00.770
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what happens is you may imagine,</v>

854
00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:03.620
<v Speaker 4>imagine if you're doing some small task,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

855
00:59:03.621 --> 00:59:08.090
<v Speaker 4>let's say you're cutting up a broccoli </v>
<v Speaker 4>for dinner and you,</v>

856
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:11.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cut your finger</v>

857
00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.860
<v Speaker 4>and I say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>

858
00:59:15.861 --> 00:59:18.030
<v Speaker 4>what is the fact that you cut your </v>
<v Speaker 4>finger mean,</v>

859
00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:24.260
<v Speaker 4>here's some possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means you should be more careful when</v>

860
00:59:24.261 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 4>you're cutting broccoli.</v>

861
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:26.710
<v Speaker 7>Okay?</v>

862
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:30.190
<v Speaker 4>It means that you're actually not very </v>
<v Speaker 4>careful.</v>

863
00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:32.563
<v Speaker 4>The fact that you're not very careful </v>
<v Speaker 4>about cutting broccoli indicates you're </v>

864
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:39.800
<v Speaker 4>probably not as careful as you should be</v>
<v Speaker 4>about most things you do.</v>

865
00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:42.093
<v Speaker 4>The fact that your daughter is careful </v>
<v Speaker 4>about most things you do as you should </v>

866
00:59:45.251 --> 00:59:48.850
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is an explanation for why all the things</v>

867
00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:52.300
<v Speaker 4>that have gone wrong in your life up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this point have actually gone wrong.</v>

868
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.473
<v Speaker 4>People like you who have had lots of </v>
<v Speaker 4>good things go wrong and who aren't </v>

869
00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:04.650
<v Speaker 4>sufficiently careful tend to go downhill</v>
<v Speaker 4>over time.</v>

870
01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.900
<v Speaker 4>Plus they're very not very good people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they shouldn't even be around.</v>

871
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:13.650
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how a depressed person thinks.</v>

872
01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:18.863
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens is that their ability to </v>

873
01:00:20.551 --> 01:00:25.551
<v Speaker 4>inhibit the spread of the meaning of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>negative event is completely compromised</v>

874
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 4>because they're nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're nervous system has its.</v>

875
01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:36.300
<v Speaker 4>They're supposed to be a threshold for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the transmission of negative information</v>

876
01:00:36.301 --> 01:00:41.301
<v Speaker 4>across different levels of abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to be somewhat resistant</v>

877
01:00:41.311 --> 01:00:43.130
<v Speaker 4>to that spread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

878
01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:43.973
<v Speaker 4>it could easily be that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could easily be true that the fact </v>

879
01:00:45.901 --> 01:00:46.734
<v Speaker 4>that you cut yourself is an indication </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're not living your life </v>

880
01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:50.124
<v Speaker 4>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't necessarily the first </v>

881
01:00:52.591 --> 01:00:56.760
<v Speaker 4>conclusion that you should leap too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for a depressed person,</v>

882
01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.433
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

883
01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.380
<v Speaker 4>That's often inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't help it.</v>

884
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:09.520
<v Speaker 5>Slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're overwhelmed by chaos</v>

885
01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:12.953
<v Speaker 4>explanation.</v>

886
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.713
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were just at a major conference on </v>

887
01:01:17.641 --> 01:01:21.000
<v Speaker 5>consciousness in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gather now.</v>

888
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:26.130
<v Speaker 5>What new ideas did you see presented in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this field that you found interesting at</v>

889
01:01:26.131 --> 01:01:27.540
<v Speaker 5>that conference?</v>

890
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:29.503
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been to that conference several </v>

891
01:01:33.081 --> 01:01:38.081
<v Speaker 4>times and</v>
<v Speaker 4>directly relevant.</v>

892
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.380
<v Speaker 4>So let me give you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me give you an example of</v>

893
01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:51.420
<v Speaker 4>who has been investigating the mechanism</v>
<v Speaker 4>of action of hallucinogenic drugs.</v>

894
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.103
<v Speaker 4>Hallucinogenic drugs have been used </v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout history to produce mystical </v>

895
01:01:58.861 --> 01:01:59.694
<v Speaker 4>experiences of one form or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and vollenweider actually provided an </v>

896
01:02:04.621 --> 01:02:09.270
<v Speaker 4>explanation of why that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was very interesting to me.</v>

897
01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.613
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

898
01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.153
<v Speaker 4>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your senses are each somewhat </v>

899
01:02:14.941 --> 01:02:18.570
<v Speaker 4>independent systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

900
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.153
<v Speaker 4>the content of your sensory experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>is unified in a brain area called the </v>

901
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Thalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

902
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.613
<v Speaker 4>so imagine you're your site and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>vision and your touch and your sense of </v>

903
01:02:33.091 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 4>your body in space are all integrated in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the elements,</v>

904
01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:39.660
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of information coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>in from all of your senses.</v>

905
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine that your prefrontal Cortex,</v>

906
01:02:43.351 --> 01:02:45.420
<v Speaker 4>which is a relatively new part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

907
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:49.830
<v Speaker 4>it sets up a plan what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do next,</v>

908
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:55.040
<v Speaker 4>and it tells the hypothalamus only lead </v>
<v Speaker 4>information relevant to the plan through</v>

909
01:02:56.131 --> 01:02:59.220
<v Speaker 4>into consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

910
01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:02.460
<v Speaker 4>if you walk into the kitchen and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to make yourself something to eat,</v>

911
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:03.893
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to notice the floor and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to notice the paint on </v>

912
01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:07.734
<v Speaker 4>the ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to notice the refrigerator </v>

913
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:10.374
<v Speaker 4>and the stove and the few implements </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you need to undertake the task </v>

914
01:03:13.921 --> 01:03:14.754
<v Speaker 4>related to eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the prefrontal cortex gates the </v>

915
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:18.743
<v Speaker 4>Thalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a million things you could </v>

916
01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:21.864
<v Speaker 4>pay attention to in the kitchen because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the kitchen is a very complex visual </v>

917
01:03:24.871 --> 01:03:26.820
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

918
01:03:26.821 --> 01:03:31.540
<v Speaker 4>if you take a hallucinogenic drug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inhibits the prefrontal Cortex,</v>

919
01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:32.374
<v Speaker 4>has capacity to gate the Thalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all sorts of sensory information </v>

920
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:37.560
<v Speaker 4>flows through.</v>

921
01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:40.413
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time when you look at the </v>

922
01:03:41.171 --> 01:03:43.630
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hardly see any of it.</v>

923
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

924
01:03:45.991 --> 01:03:49.410
<v Speaker 4>You're your brain is exactly as Aldous </v>
<v Speaker 4>Huxley proposed.</v>

925
01:03:49.411 --> 01:03:52.410
<v Speaker 4>Your brain is actually a sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme,</v>

926
01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:53.423
<v Speaker 4>extremely complex filtering mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 4>and most of what's out there is </v>

927
01:03:58.051 --> 01:04:02.550
<v Speaker 4>eliminated well following on </v>
<v Speaker 4>vollenweider.</v>

928
01:04:02.551 --> 01:04:03.384
<v Speaker 4>I would say that the ground of mystical </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience is the partial apprehension </v>

929
01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:12.951
<v Speaker 4>of the richness of potential experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond</v>

930
01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.500
<v Speaker 4>beyond what's expected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you look at the world,</v>

931
01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.573
<v Speaker 4>what you see is mostly relevant to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>current plan and shape to a tremendous </v>

932
01:04:23.631 --> 01:04:24.464
<v Speaker 4>degree by your memory and if if those </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems are inhibited or shut down in </v>

933
01:04:30.051 --> 01:04:34.190
<v Speaker 4>some way and you have the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>apprehend what's actually there,</v>

934
01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.373
<v Speaker 4>what's the sensation it produces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the disinhibition of certain </v>

935
01:04:39.081 --> 01:04:44.081
<v Speaker 4>kinds of emotion is very much associated</v>
<v Speaker 4>with what people describe as all.</v>

936
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:49.000
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say to her,</v>

937
01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.080
<v Speaker 4>here's something interesting in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>regard.</v>

938
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:53.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people say,</v>

939
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:56.810
<v Speaker 4>people ask themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

940
01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.453
<v Speaker 4>do you believe in God?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would say that's actually a </v>

941
01:05:02.571 --> 01:05:03.404
<v Speaker 4>nonsensical question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say whether or not you believe </v>

942
01:05:08.391 --> 01:05:12.170
<v Speaker 4>in God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're more or less stuck with him.</v>

943
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:15.710
<v Speaker 4>He's there whether you believe it or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

944
01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:19.150
<v Speaker 4>and it has nothing to do with belief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'll tell you why.</v>

945
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.510
<v Speaker 4>It's actually straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

946
01:05:22.511 --> 01:05:26.320
<v Speaker 4>so let's go back to the ancient Israelis</v>
<v Speaker 4>Israel lights.</v>

947
01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:27.903
<v Speaker 4>Now they had some rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They believed that there was a unity </v>

948
01:05:31.781 --> 01:05:35.890
<v Speaker 4>behind everything and that unity was </v>
<v Speaker 4>unnameable,</v>

949
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.610
<v Speaker 4>so it was against the rules to speak the</v>
<v Speaker 4>name of God.</v>

950
01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:42.520
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

951
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 4>because as soon as you speak the name of</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

952
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:45.964
<v Speaker 4>you categorize it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as soon as it's categorizable and </v>

953
01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.940
<v Speaker 4>understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's not the totality.</v>

954
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.450
<v Speaker 4>It's something you've parceled off and </v>
<v Speaker 4>made into a concept.</v>

955
01:05:56.230 --> 01:06:00.130
<v Speaker 4>The totality of being is beyond all </v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptualization.</v>

956
01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then you might ask yourself,</v>

957
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a totality of being.</v>

958
01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:08.710
<v Speaker 4>While the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well obviously,</v>

959
01:06:08.711 --> 01:06:13.711
<v Speaker 4>because everything there is sums up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>one totality.</v>

960
01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:17.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the nature of that totality?</v>

961
01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:18.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an honorable.</v>

962
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 4>You can't say it's too complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too rich.</v>

963
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:25.960
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not within human ability to grasp.</v>

964
01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:27.820
<v Speaker 4>Is it there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

965
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:32.230
<v Speaker 4>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like a room contains the objects in</v>

966
01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:34.990
<v Speaker 4>the room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's there for sure.</v>

967
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:37.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there is a totality.</v>

968
01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:40.450
<v Speaker 4>That's unnameable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next question would be,</v>

969
01:06:40.451 --> 01:06:42.220
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have a relationship with it?</v>

970
01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the answer to that is,</v>

971
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:48.550
<v Speaker 4>of course you have a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>it because every part has a relationship</v>

972
01:06:48.551 --> 01:06:49.384
<v Speaker 4>to the whole.</v>

973
01:06:52.070 --> 01:06:55.980
<v Speaker 4>When</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're inside the totality,</v>

974
01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.080
<v Speaker 4>then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

975
01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:00.850
<v Speaker 4>what's the nature of your relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that totality?</v>

976
01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:02.190
<v Speaker 4>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

977
01:07:02.191 --> 01:07:03.024
<v Speaker 4>you tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to know if your life rich and </v>

978
01:07:06.421 --> 01:07:10.530
<v Speaker 4>meaningful and worthy of sustaining and </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your own.</v>

979
01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.880
<v Speaker 4>From your own perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you believe that life is worthwhile?</v>

980
01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.260
<v Speaker 4>You live it in a manner that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 4>worthwhile,</v>

981
01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:18.960
<v Speaker 4>and if the answer to that is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then I would say,</v>

982
01:07:18.961 --> 01:07:19.794
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have the proper relationship with </v>

983
01:07:21.061 --> 01:07:25.900
<v Speaker 4>the totality and if the answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you doubt the value of life.</v>

984
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.200
<v Speaker 4>You're hostile and resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're bored,</v>

985
01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.120
<v Speaker 4>you're afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're hurt.</v>

986
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.170
<v Speaker 4>Well then there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your relationship with the totality.</v>

987
01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's what's so complicated about that?</v>

988
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.233
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

989
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:40.103
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's self evident and it's stunning to </v>

990
01:07:43.231 --> 01:07:46.860
<v Speaker 4>me that it's the subject of so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>constant dispute.</v>

991
01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.620
<v Speaker 4>Now you might object,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

992
01:07:49.621 --> 01:07:51.570
<v Speaker 4>you have a relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>totality,</v>

993
01:07:51.571 --> 01:07:52.404
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a personal relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what the ancient Israel Israel </v>

994
01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.473
<v Speaker 4>lights are claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course what the product Modern </v>

995
01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:03.060
<v Speaker 4>Protestants claim even more dramatically</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would say,</v>

996
01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.920
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't be right,</v>

997
01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.920
<v Speaker 4>but let's consider it an experiment.</v>

998
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:13.740
<v Speaker 4>Here's the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try to establish a personal relationship</v>

999
01:08:13.741 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 4>with this totality and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the criteria.</v>

1000
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:21.530
<v Speaker 4>I will say that whenever you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's intensely meaningful,</v>

1001
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.053
<v Speaker 4>then you've established a personal </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship with this totality and if </v>

1002
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.500
<v Speaker 4>all you ever did were things that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>intensely personally meaningful,</v>

1003
01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:31.813
<v Speaker 4>while you'd live in ideal life and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be afraid of death and you </v>

1004
01:08:34.731 --> 01:08:39.410
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't become bitter and resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's also doable.</v>

1005
01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:40.244
<v Speaker 4>I think with every choice you make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you decide whether you're going to do </v>

1006
01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 4>that or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's difficult to do meaningful things.</v>

1007
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.500
<v Speaker 4>Everybody doesn't always agree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1008
01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:49.723
<v Speaker 4>They're kind of idiosyncratic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no necessary reason that you'll </v>

1009
01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.040
<v Speaker 4>be rewarded by the culture with material</v>
<v Speaker 4>success if you do meaningful things.</v>

1010
01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.430
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a shot in the dark,</v>

1011
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:07.730
<v Speaker 4>which is a leap of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's right within your grasp.</v>

1012
01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:09.860
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do it just by deciding to,</v>

1013
01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:13.110
<v Speaker 4>well what I learned from writing maps of</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningless,</v>

1014
01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:13.944
<v Speaker 4>that the fate of the world literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>depends on the choice that each </v>

1015
01:09:18.981 --> 01:09:23.690
<v Speaker 4>individual makes with regards to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship to the totality of being.</v>

1016
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:26.840
<v Speaker 4>And that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what,</v>

1017
01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:28.183
<v Speaker 4>that's the central message of profound </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious system says there's more to </v>

1018
01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:34.510
<v Speaker 4>you than you think a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more that,</v>

1019
01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.070
<v Speaker 4>more for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way more than you think,</v>

1020
01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.670
<v Speaker 4>and there's way more for good and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you know it or not,</v>

1021
01:09:40.671 --> 01:09:42.530
<v Speaker 4>you're always choosing between those </v>
<v Speaker 4>two.</v>

1022
01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:43.543
<v Speaker 4>And whether you know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fate of being itself rests on your </v>

1023
01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 4>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1024
01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.420
<v Speaker 4>who the hell wants to believe that?</v>

1025
01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:53.420
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too weighty.</v>

1026
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:55.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't care if it's way too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not.</v>

1027
01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:57.503
<v Speaker 4>When you're trying to investigate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons behind something like the </v>

1028
01:10:00.001 --> 01:10:03.720
<v Speaker 4>Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things get weighty very rapidly.</v>

1029
01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.330
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a group experience.</v>

1030
01:10:15.331 --> 01:10:20.280
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a just purely individually experience.</v>

1031
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:25.470
<v Speaker 3>How do you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>we handled that?</v>

1032
01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:27.813
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you can think of two recent </v>

1033
01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:30.884
<v Speaker 4>events.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nine slash 11 would be one and the </v>

1034
01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:41.340
<v Speaker 4>flooding of New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So with regards to nine slash 11,</v>

1035
01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:47.360
<v Speaker 4>the most interesting thing to note about</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's responses to that catastrophe.</v>

1036
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:52.130
<v Speaker 4>Was there an unconscious need for </v>
<v Speaker 4>repetition?</v>

1037
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:58.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean everyone I know watched the trade</v>
<v Speaker 4>towers fall 50 times 100 times in shock,</v>

1038
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:03.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unable not to watch.</v>

1039
01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:08.650
<v Speaker 4>And I think the reason that that's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>illuminating is because it shows you how</v>

1040
01:11:08.991 --> 01:11:12.860
<v Speaker 4>complicated it is to see what you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand.</v>

1041
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.843
<v Speaker 4>So mythologically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fall of the towers was equivalent </v>

1042
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 4>both to the death of the king and to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>reemergence of chaos.</v>

1043
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:26.000
<v Speaker 4>And when the king dies and chaos </v>
<v Speaker 4>reemergence,</v>

1044
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.863
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to see what's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not speaking metaphorically </v>

1045
01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:32.154
<v Speaker 4>precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People wouldn't have had to watch the </v>

1046
01:11:34.471 --> 01:11:39.471
<v Speaker 4>towers fall over and over if they could </v>
<v Speaker 4>see them fall and on a trivial level,</v>

1047
01:11:41.491 --> 01:11:43.140
<v Speaker 4>a building collapsed.</v>

1048
01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:44.693
<v Speaker 4>But what the events that characterized </v>
<v Speaker 4>nine slash 11 were far more than merely </v>

1049
01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:53.700
<v Speaker 4>a building falling when the event </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

1050
01:11:53.701 --> 01:11:54.534
<v Speaker 4>No one knew what fail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one knew if the financial system </v>

1051
01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.440
<v Speaker 4>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one knew if the economic system fail.</v>

1052
01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.740
<v Speaker 4>No one knew if the world order had </v>
<v Speaker 4>collapsed.</v>

1053
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.233
<v Speaker 4>And everyone watching those buildings </v>
<v Speaker 4>fall was trying to perceive all those </v>

1054
01:12:11.491 --> 01:12:14.220
<v Speaker 4>others have levels of reality at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same time.</v>

1055
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really,</v>

1056
01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:18.450
<v Speaker 4>really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1057
01:12:18.451 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 4>and then Bush offered people in easy out</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a prepared way out.</v>

1058
01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:24.121
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1059
01:12:24.121 --> 01:12:24.954
<v Speaker 4>the people who did this were evil and </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps they were the people who did </v>

1060
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:29.970
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're evil,</v>

1061
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:32.070
<v Speaker 4>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There should be a war.</v>

1062
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.280
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

1063
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.413
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a mythological explanation and </v>

1064
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:38.874
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1065
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:39.953
<v Speaker 4>it's very easy for people to instantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>put forth a mythological explanation </v>

1066
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:48.660
<v Speaker 4>when chaos makes itself manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1067
01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:49.494
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem with our response to nine </v>

1068
01:12:51.031 --> 01:12:55.500
<v Speaker 4>slash 11 was that almost every bit of it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a lie.</v>

1069
01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that the American government</v>

1070
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:05.623
<v Speaker 4>utilize the events of nine slash 11 to </v>
<v Speaker 4>justify an invasion on Iraq that had </v>

1071
01:13:10.101 --> 01:13:10.934
<v Speaker 4>been planned at least 10 years before </v>
<v Speaker 4>that historical documentation of that </v>

1072
01:13:14.751 --> 01:13:17.750
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is available from the people who did the</v>

1073
01:13:17.751 --> 01:13:19.730
<v Speaker 4>planning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're still part of bushes,</v>

1074
01:13:19.731 --> 01:13:20.564
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

1075
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.200
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>you asked about our response.</v>

1076
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:30.730
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

1077
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:33.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when,</v>

1078
01:13:33.421 --> 01:13:36.160
<v Speaker 4>when Bush went into Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1079
01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:36.994
<v Speaker 4>I had a legitimate debate about what </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be done about tyrants like Sadam </v>

1080
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:41.623
<v Speaker 4>Hussein because he was obviously a </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible person and his sons were even </v>

1081
01:13:44.301 --> 01:13:48.590
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the idea of that</v>

1082
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:51.303
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe consisting of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reemergence of chaos could be met by </v>

1083
01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.170
<v Speaker 4>dissimulation and conscious lies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1084
01:13:59.171 --> 01:14:01.340
<v Speaker 4>that would work out successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1085
01:14:01.341 --> 01:14:06.260
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that's willfully blind,</v>

1086
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:10.130
<v Speaker 4>a corrupt and naive all at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1087
01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.580
<v Speaker 4>And that's what characterized our </v>
<v Speaker 4>response,</v>

1088
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.903
<v Speaker 5>wasn't that response plan by a group who</v>
<v Speaker 5>were disciples and followers of a </v>

1089
01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.840
<v Speaker 5>philosopher called Strauss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that correct?</v>

1090
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:22.230
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

1091
01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:22.851
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1092
01:14:22.851 --> 01:14:27.851
<v Speaker 4>and they had put a manifesto together </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in the mid 19 nineties</v>

1093
01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:34.640
<v Speaker 4>had written Clinton expressing their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their need to invade Iraq.</v>

1094
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:36.383
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

1095
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:38.730
<v Speaker 4>which I don't really think is the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1096
01:14:38.731 --> 01:14:39.564
<v Speaker 4>because Saddam Hussein was a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>person and it isn't clear that the </v>

1097
01:14:43.141 --> 01:14:47.730
<v Speaker 4>international community exactly knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>what to do with barbaric dictators.</v>

1098
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:49.463
<v Speaker 4>The problem wasn't necessarily the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that going after Saddam Hussein was </v>

1099
01:14:55.261 --> 01:14:56.094
<v Speaker 4>justified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem was that an event that had </v>

1100
01:14:59.311 --> 01:15:00.144
<v Speaker 4>absolutely nothing to do with him was </v>
<v Speaker 4>utilized in it absolutely deceitful </v>

1101
01:15:06.061 --> 01:15:06.894
<v Speaker 4>manner by people who had a preexistent </v>
<v Speaker 4>agenda to deceive their entire populous </v>

1102
01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.193
<v Speaker 4>and to justify and to use that as </v>
<v Speaker 4>justification for doing something that </v>

1103
01:15:16.351 --> 01:15:17.910
<v Speaker 4>they had other reasons for doing it.</v>

1104
01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.780
<v Speaker 5>When the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the justification for judging,</v>

1105
01:15:23.781 --> 01:15:28.781
<v Speaker 5>it seems that you have to be in order to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be able to judge as in Nuremberg,</v>

1106
01:15:30.891 --> 01:15:33.030
<v Speaker 5>the victors judged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1107
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:35.450
<v Speaker 5>the judge saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1108
01:15:35.451 --> 01:15:37.730
<v Speaker 5>they put him on trial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But otherwise,</v>

1109
01:15:37.731 --> 01:15:38.960
<v Speaker 5>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world community,</v>

1110
01:15:38.961 --> 01:15:41.820
<v Speaker 5>you don't seem to know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise with a,</v>

1111
01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.700
<v Speaker 5>it seems complicated</v>

1112
01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.451
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1113
01:15:44.451 --> 01:15:45.284
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's part of the problem we're talking </v>

1114
01:15:46.191 --> 01:15:50.720
<v Speaker 4>about is what's the appropriate response</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the manifestation of evil.</v>

1115
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:53.840
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say generally speaking,</v>

1116
01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.290
<v Speaker 4>evil is something best corralled in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>own life.</v>

1117
01:15:58.190 --> 01:16:01.880
<v Speaker 4>And once you more or less corralled in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own life,</v>

1118
01:16:01.881 --> 01:16:04.880
<v Speaker 4>if you have in fact manage that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is a very,</v>

1119
01:16:04.881 --> 01:16:05.714
<v Speaker 4>very difficult thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then maybe you have something to </v>

1120
01:16:08.361 --> 01:16:10.970
<v Speaker 4>say about it on a social level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1121
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1122
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:18.020
<v Speaker 4>we con</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

1123
01:16:18.021 --> 01:16:18.854
<v Speaker 4>put the cart before the horse and many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many individuals who are unable to make </v>

1124
01:16:23.181 --> 01:16:24.014
<v Speaker 4>peace in their own house are perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to go out and try to make peace </v>

1125
01:16:26.751 --> 01:16:28.310
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1126
01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:33.060
<v Speaker 4>there's more Brisson ideology and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>then there is intelligence.</v>

1127
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:34.240
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1128
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:35.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and portia,</v>

1129
01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.393
<v Speaker 5>and this is something else you want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>add about either Jordan or whether you </v>

1130
01:16:41.911 --> 01:16:46.911
<v Speaker 5>want to talk more about you ideas you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>working on.</v>

1131
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:48.303
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just a,</v>

1132
01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.173
<v Speaker 4>just one thing I wanted to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mentioned nine slash 11 and New </v>

1133
01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Orleans.</v>

1134
01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:55.550
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>New Orleans</v>

1135
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:56.383
<v Speaker 4>is another example of the death of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>king and the reemergence of chaos being </v>

1136
01:17:01.641 --> 01:17:02.474
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The chaos in genesis is watery and it's </v>

1137
01:17:08.331 --> 01:17:09.164
<v Speaker 4>watery chaos that causes flood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the flood that God caused with </v>

1138
01:17:13.561 --> 01:17:18.300
<v Speaker 4>regards to Noah was the reemergence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos because of a corrupt social order.</v>

1139
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:21.030
<v Speaker 4>On the same thing happened in New </v>
<v Speaker 4>Orleans,</v>

1140
01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:25.710
<v Speaker 4>on the one hand it was a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the storm caused the flooding,</v>

1141
01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.190
<v Speaker 4>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had the levies been four feet higher,</v>

1142
01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.353
<v Speaker 4>there wouldn't have been a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the fact that there was a flood of </v>

1143
01:17:33.451 --> 01:17:34.284
<v Speaker 4>New Orleans is as much evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>order was insufficient to hold chaos </v>

1144
01:17:40.441 --> 01:17:41.274
<v Speaker 4>back as it is evidenced that the chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand of God is perfectly capable of </v>

1145
01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:48.090
<v Speaker 4>causing natural disasters.</v>

1146
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:54.403
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1147
01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:57.490
<v Speaker 4>And it was not just disorder but </v>
<v Speaker 4>corruption,</v>

1148
01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:01.780
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's archaic cultural systems,</v>

1149
01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:02.763
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the levies there were too old and </v>

1150
01:18:04.511 --> 01:18:06.280
<v Speaker 4>starting to deteriorate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's,</v>

1151
01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.173
<v Speaker 4>they deteriorate of their own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plus the deterioration is sped along by </v>

1152
01:18:11.591 --> 01:18:12.424
<v Speaker 4>the fact that the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>punitively in charge of them aren't </v>

1153
01:18:14.321 --> 01:18:16.150
<v Speaker 4>taking their responsibility seriously.</v>

1154
01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:22.340
<v Speaker 5>Metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That reminds me in Australia,</v>

1155
01:18:24.481 --> 01:18:25.314
<v Speaker 5>on the beaches that have been shark </v>
<v Speaker 5>attacks where they have short sentences </v>

1156
01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:32.280
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1157
01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.113
<v Speaker 5>in the sea which has not been repaired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there are holes in the fences are </v>

1158
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:41.310
<v Speaker 5>getting through and attacking surface is</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same.</v>

1159
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:43.343
<v Speaker 5>The same</v>

1160
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:45.663
<v Speaker 4>example</v>
<v Speaker 4>popped into your mind is because of the </v>

1161
01:18:49.451 --> 01:18:54.430
<v Speaker 4>mythological equivalence you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the underwater creature,</v>

1162
01:18:54.431 --> 01:18:59.431
<v Speaker 4>that terrible human devouring underwater</v>
<v Speaker 4>creature is a prime,</v>

1163
01:18:59.741 --> 01:19:02.130
<v Speaker 4>mythological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool representation of chaos.</v>

1164
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.650
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a mat in the Enuma elish who's basically</v>

1165
01:19:07.651 --> 01:19:11.100
<v Speaker 4>the model for the Leviathan is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>underwater drag,</v>

1166
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:16.170
<v Speaker 4>an underwater devouring dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's the prime symbol of chaos.</v>

1167
01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.393
<v Speaker 4>And so I would say your example was </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought to mind by the mythological </v>

1168
01:19:20.731 --> 01:19:24.240
<v Speaker 4>equivalent between the two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>between the two occurrences</v>

1169
01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:32.890
<v Speaker 5>hearing you discuss your ideas and your </v>
<v Speaker 5>work maps of meaning.</v>

1170
01:19:32.891 --> 01:19:35.500
<v Speaker 5>Could you please tell us where this book</v>
<v Speaker 5>is available?</v>

1171
01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:36.553
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say the simplest place to find </v>

1172
01:19:38.601 --> 01:19:42.920
<v Speaker 4>it at Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go to my website,</v>

1173
01:19:42.921 --> 01:19:45.490
<v Speaker 4>which is maps of meaning Dotcom,</v>

1174
01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.200
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1175
01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:51.200
<v Speaker 4>There are lectures on the book televised</v>
<v Speaker 4>by Canadian Public Television and,</v>

1176
01:19:52.171 --> 01:19:53.004
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>links to places the book can be </v>

1177
01:19:54.211 --> 01:19:58.320
<v Speaker 4>purchased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's probably the simplest thing to</v>

1178
01:19:58.321 --> 01:19:59.154
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1179
01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 5>You'll your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1180
01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:09.570
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lecturing,</v>

1181
01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:12.450
<v Speaker 3>or are you touring or what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

1182
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.843
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've written recently a few papers on </v>

1183
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:21.750
<v Speaker 4>the nature of self deception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a very paradoxical concept.</v>

1184
01:20:22.411 --> 01:20:23.244
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>self deception implies that at least in </v>

1185
01:20:26.241 --> 01:20:27.074
<v Speaker 4>its classical formulations that a person</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows something and doesn't know </v>

1186
01:20:30.381 --> 01:20:31.214
<v Speaker 4>something at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a problematic conceptually for </v>

1187
01:20:35.601 --> 01:20:38.660
<v Speaker 4>a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to crack that problem.</v>

1188
01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:39.803
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've also been attempting to recast our </v>

1189
01:20:44.151 --> 01:20:46.940
<v Speaker 4>models of neuropsychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>functioning.</v>

1190
01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:48.243
<v Speaker 4>I'm starting from the presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 4>that what the mind encounters is much </v>

1191
01:20:54.231 --> 01:20:59.231
<v Speaker 4>more properly conceptualized as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>information rich matrix of relationships</v>

1192
01:21:00.621 --> 01:21:04.460
<v Speaker 4>than it is conceptualized as a place of </v>
<v Speaker 4>material objects.</v>

1193
01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:10.060
<v Speaker 4>And that's following to some degree the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas of the physicist wheeler who was a</v>

1194
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:15.470
<v Speaker 4>student of nails for I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

1195
01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:16.453
<v Speaker 4>who has hypothesized that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental elements of matter are more </v>

1196
01:21:22.101 --> 01:21:27.050
<v Speaker 4>like bit more like computer bits of </v>
<v Speaker 4>information than they are.</v>

1197
01:21:27.051 --> 01:21:29.390
<v Speaker 4>Like something classically material.</v>

1198
01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:43.490
<v Speaker 5>The causes is the events that happen.</v>

1199
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:45.383
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does seem related to that in some </v>

1200
01:21:47.351 --> 01:21:48.184
<v Speaker 4>manner</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I described earlier about the </v>

1201
01:21:55.241 --> 01:21:59.260
<v Speaker 4>capacity of human consciousness to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>order out of chaos.</v>

1202
01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:00.783
<v Speaker 4>I personally believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is partly because of what I've </v>

1203
01:22:03.491 --> 01:22:05.620
<v Speaker 4>learned from reading religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>mythology,</v>

1204
01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:11.040
<v Speaker 4>that human consciousness realizes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world in some non metaphorical sense.</v>

1205
01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:15.190
<v Speaker 4>I cry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a materialist,</v>

1206
01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:20.610
<v Speaker 4>and I truly believe that if human </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness did not exist,</v>

1207
01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:27.450
<v Speaker 4>the idea that there would be existence </v>
<v Speaker 4>is in some manner wrong.</v>

1208
01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:28.803
<v Speaker 4>I think existence is dependent on </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and I've been trying to </v>

1209
01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:34.324
<v Speaker 4>work out the implications of that idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a scientifically rigorous manner and </v>

1210
01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:44.650
<v Speaker 4>that constitutes partly what I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>writing about recently.</v>

1211
01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:54.180
<v Speaker 5>Granted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can sit here and talk about,</v>

1212
01:22:54.690 --> 01:22:56.430
<v Speaker 5>let's talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

1213
01:22:56.431 --> 01:22:57.880
<v Speaker 5>think of the first world</v>

1214
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.823
<v Speaker 3>war</v>

1215
01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:03.740
<v Speaker 5>and we think that this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that happened,</v>

1216
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:04.743
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can think about the great </v>

1217
01:23:05.741 --> 01:23:06.574
<v Speaker 5>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Neither you nor I were alive at the </v>

1218
01:23:09.761 --> 01:23:10.594
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1219
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:11.883
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1220
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:16.000
<v Speaker 5>but we take it for granted that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

1221
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:19.500
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you go from now,</v>

1222
01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:24.710
<v Speaker 5>today and you go forward 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>neither you nor I will be alive then,</v>

1223
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:29.080
<v Speaker 5>but that shouldn't worry us should it?</v>

1224
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:31.893
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that the are being would </v>

1225
01:23:34.061 --> 01:23:37.030
<v Speaker 4>still be embedded in the matrix of </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality,</v>

1226
01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:37.973
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1227
01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:44.370
<v Speaker 4>Because the things fulled up in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>the past folds up and it's still present</v>

1228
01:23:47.951 --> 01:23:51.760
<v Speaker 4>in the present and the future is not yet</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfolded.</v>

1229
01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:52.753
<v Speaker 4>Implicit in the present,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I would say just as none of your </v>

1230
01:23:58.481 --> 01:23:59.314
<v Speaker 4>deeds do you just as you cannot escape </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the consequences of any of your </v>

1231
01:24:04.391 --> 01:24:09.391
<v Speaker 4>deeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the record of your being and the and the</v>

1232
01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:14.911
<v Speaker 4>nature of that being is embedded in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fabric of reality permanently,</v>

1233
01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:22.020
<v Speaker 5>possibly what we can of a manmade </v>
<v Speaker 5>abstraction.</v>

1234
01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.210
<v Speaker 5>Maybe there is no such thing as time.</v>

1235
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.863
<v Speaker 4>Well there is for us and what that means</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some ultimate sense is obviously not </v>

1236
01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:32.953
<v Speaker 4>a conceptually accessible to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's part of the reason why </v>

1237
01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:40.223
<v Speaker 4>it's possible to realize that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>implications of your behavior and your </v>

1238
01:24:43.561 --> 01:24:44.394
<v Speaker 4>conceptions reverberate far past you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things are not necessarily precisely </v>

1239
01:24:50.701 --> 01:24:51.600
<v Speaker 4>what they seem.</v>

1240
01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.713
<v Speaker 5>Professors</v>
<v Speaker 5>has been marvelous discussing these </v>

1241

<v Speaker 5>views.</v>
