1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.470
<v Speaker 1>On Tuesday I started to talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about trait theory and now I'm going to</v>

2
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>make a jump to biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's a strange jump in some</v>

3
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>sense because the two levels of analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>are relatively disconnected.</v>

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>But what's happening right now at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the sort of outer echelons of</v>

5
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>personality research is that</v>

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.853
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

7
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.890
<v Speaker 1>the workers at the forefront of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>field are trying to integrate what's</v>

8
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>been established at the statistical</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis with what's known at</v>

9
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>the psychobiological level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this emerging science is known as</v>

10
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.610
<v Speaker 1>personality neuroscience.</v>

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.453
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

12
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It's developed in a rather strange way</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>the traits that were identified that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed with you on Tuesday,</v>

14
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:55.571
<v Speaker 1>the big five traits all emerged as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the statistical analysis</v>

15
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of descriptors characteristic mostly of</v>

16
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>the English language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's been duplicated in other</v>

17
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:07.271
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense it was in a theoretical</v>

18
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:13.511
<v Speaker 1>It just came out of the linguistic data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was no real initial inferences</v>

20
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>about brain area or neurological</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity or,</v>

21
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.800
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that to drive the</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulation of the big five model.</v>

22
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>And instead the big five model came</v>
<v Speaker 1>first and then people started thinking,</v>

23
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can this be put into alignment with what</v>

24
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>we know about the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people have been hitting that</v>

25
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say over about the last,</v>

26
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>it's probably 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that because Hans Isaac</v>

27
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>and his student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey Gray,</v>

28
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty far along on this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking by say 1982 when gray published</v>

29
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuropsychology of anxiety,</v>

30
00:01:55.461 --> 00:02:00.461
<v Speaker 1>which the paper you're reading now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a model of the limbic system and Basal</v>

31
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Ganglia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basal Ganglia application stay anxiety</v>

32
00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>and schizophrenia.</v>

33
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a very short summary of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gray published in 1982 which has</v>

34
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:13.030
<v Speaker 1>been incredibly influential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

36
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>especially on the scientific end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would say pretty much regardless</v>

37
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

38
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very useful book to tackle.</v>

39
00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a newer version and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>published by gray and Mcnaughton and I</v>

40
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Speaker 1>think 2000 something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard going,</v>

41
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you may have found the paper that we</v>

42
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:35.330
<v Speaker 1>too gray was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

43
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died a few years ago.</v>

44
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 1>He was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart person.</v>

45
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>And he knew the animal literature on</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

46
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>

47
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 1>neuroanatomy and neuropsychopharmacology</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside out and backwards.</v>

48
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever he defined a term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he always made sure that the term was</v>

49
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>intelligible at a behavioral level and</v>
<v Speaker 1>at an anatomical level.</v>

50
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>And at a pharmacological level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had to,</v>

51
00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

52
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

53
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that he were developing had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense that these multiple levels of</v>

54
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>analysis before he would accept them as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as genuine and gray did a remarkable job</v>

55
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:13.501
<v Speaker 1>of extending our knowledge of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and the evolutionary basis of</v>

56
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>at least the first two personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>traits,</v>

57
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>say extroversion and neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly corresponding to positive and</v>

58
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.334
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>

59
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.653
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>so that's partly why you're reading grey</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grey theories.</v>

61
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Also cybernetic theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cybernetic theory is a,</v>

62
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.140
<v Speaker 1>is a variation of a theory developed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>an mit cognitive scientist named Norbert</v>

63
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.013
<v Speaker 1>Wiener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

64
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>who was an early ai artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence researcher.</v>

65
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.810
<v Speaker 1>And he proposed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

66
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>that intelligent entities were goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>directed and that they organize their</v>

67
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>behavior around reducing deviations from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a goal.</v>

68
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Well they were approaching it once they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had decided what it would be.</v>

69
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Now that's also proved to be incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>influential.</v>

70
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk a fair bit about cybernetic</v>

71
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:07.790
<v Speaker 1>models as we progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>so gray is sort of a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence,</v>

73
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>cybernetic theorizing and then an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible amount of data that's come in</v>

74
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 1>from animal behavioral research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>

75
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>most of the things that we know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain have been derived from animal</v>

76
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:23.400
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>the animal researchers tended to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily careful scientists.</v>

78
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>They were influenced by um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

79
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>be bf skinner who established the sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the initial</v>

80
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>theoretical basis for understanding how</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals learn.</v>

81
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk about that a little bit next</v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

82
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

83
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>that's the context within which gray is</v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>

84
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Luddu these are all papers you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to read except the third one,</v>

85
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>which is optional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luddu is also an emotional,</v>

86
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>he's an effect of neuroscientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's a someone who studies emotions</v>

87
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.451
<v Speaker 1>mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

88
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:03.451
<v Speaker 1>animals and Luddu has done a lot to sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of add some of the pieces that were</v>

89
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 1>missing in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in gray gray probably concentrated a</v>

90
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>little bit too much on a brain area</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the hippocampus,</v>

91
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.270
<v Speaker 1>which is the brain area that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lets you know if it's reasonable to be</v>

92
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>calm where you're currently situated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what the hippocampus does in some</v>

93
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>sense is compare what it is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have happen with what is</v>

94
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

95
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>And if the two things are the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're comp.</v>

96
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's a match mismatch detector and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has access not only to memory but also</v>

97
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>two formulations of say the desired</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

98
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson,</v>

99
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I had people read the Swanson paper last</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

100
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I put it in your reading list is</v>
<v Speaker 1>optional.</v>

101
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth hacking through if you can</v>

102
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard paper though,</v>

103
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>which is why it took it out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>required reading list.</v>

104
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>The reason I like Swanson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk fair bit about him</v>

105
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 1>today is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson's not a psychologist.</v>

106
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.611
<v Speaker 1>He's actually a developmental neuro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never say this properly.</v>

107
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>he studies developmental anatomy,</v>

108
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that.</v>

109
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he's very interested in how the</v>

110
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>brain unfolds across time during</v>
<v Speaker 1>embryonic development and then up into</v>

111
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 1>maturity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he understands the brain</v>

112
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>differently than a psychologist would</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a psychologist tends to analyze</v>

113
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:27.400
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.270
<v Speaker 1>as a sort of mature thing usually in</v>
<v Speaker 1>adulthood but,</v>

115
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>but for Swanson it's a much more living</v>
<v Speaker 1>and transforming system and he's trying</v>

116
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:40.931
<v Speaker 1>to set forth a Schema for understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain anatomy and also associating that</v>

117
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>with function.</v>

118
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think that that's a well</v>

119
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:50.801
<v Speaker 1>advanced science already that we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to segment up the brain and we know,</v>

120
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>you know roughly what the piece is due.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we haven't even really managed to</v>

121
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 1>establish the terminology pro property</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

122
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It's very neuro neuroscience is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>new field and,</v>

123
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>and there's no limit to the number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we don't know about it,</v>

124
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>including even the basic classification</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

125
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Now Swanson has put forth a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent basic classification</v>

126
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that I think it's</v>

127
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:20.381
<v Speaker 1>so relevant to a personality class is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it maps in a beautiful way onto</v>

128
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that we've already</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

129
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 1>especially piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a nice direct mapping of</v>

130
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:32.411
<v Speaker 1>Piaget's developmental theory onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson's theory of neurodevelopment and</v>

131
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 1>then of neural function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's completely accidental because</v>

132
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Swanson never cites piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're non overlapping literature.</v>

133
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of liked that because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

134
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>if something pops up in one place with</v>
<v Speaker 1>one method and pops up another place</v>

135
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 1>with a completely different method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if those two places are</v>

136
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:51.770
<v Speaker 1>distinct in terms of their historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

137
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>you might start thinking there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually something there.</v>

138
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like seeing something in</v>

139
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time you've got two</v>

140
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>independent sources of data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like triangulation in a sense.</v>

141
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And so it was very exciting to me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come across this paper by Swanson.</v>

142
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's one of only two scientists</v>

143
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I ever wrote a fan letter too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:13.430
<v Speaker 1>really it's a brilliant paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

145
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

146
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>there's other reasons why it maps onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to talk about too,</v>

147
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 1>because Swanson also points out quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly the function of the,</v>

148
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of roughly separates the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus into two halves.</v>

149
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:27.523
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.860
<v Speaker 1>he points out that they have quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct functions and the functions</v>

151
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>also map onto some of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been talking about it in a very</v>

152
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:36.560
<v Speaker 1>lovely way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a lot of reasons to,</v>

153
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 1>to go through Swanson's paper carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

154
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like 50 pages long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guy put it in some sense,</v>

155
00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>his whole life's work is in those 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>pages.</v>

156
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>even if it takes you 12 hours or 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours to read it,</v>

158
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not too bad.</v>

159
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to extract out like 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>years solid research.</v>

160
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Gray's book is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

161
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.880
<v Speaker 1>do you read that book you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read it and understand it,</v>

162
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you've basically got a fair chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuro anatomy,</v>

163
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>a lot of animal behavioral analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

164
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:12.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviorism in general,</v>

165
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.930
<v Speaker 1>a lot of psychopharmacology and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the functional</v>

166
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>significance of the brain's major.</v>

167
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Neurotransmitter systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get all of that from gray's</v>

168
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

169
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a killer book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

170
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:30.390
<v Speaker 1>if you can extract all that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

171
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>carver and Scheier also take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cybernetic perspective.</v>

172
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more cognitive scientists.</v>

173
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find their paper a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit farther down the road,</v>

174
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 1>but they're also very interested in how</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures,</v>

175
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 1>human beings in particular select goals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then align themselves with those</v>

176
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for our purposes,</v>

177
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk a fair bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation today.</v>

178
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 1>And the distinction between motivation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and emotion is not clear.</v>

179
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 1>They're both words that sort of function</v>
<v Speaker 1>within an linguistic context.</v>

180
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 1>But for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course all the emotions aren't</v>

181
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:06.060
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's one circuit that</v>

182
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:08.790
<v Speaker 1>subsumes emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's multiple circuits that subsume</v>

183
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:11.610
<v Speaker 1>emotion and they're not identical</v>
<v Speaker 1>circuits,</v>

184
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't like every emotion is a</v>

185
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 1>variant of the same thing.</v>

186
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with the motivation.</v>

187
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:21.420
<v Speaker 1>So they're very loose groupings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and emotion.</v>

188
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.700
<v Speaker 1>But for the purposes of our argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make this case roughly</v>

189
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.850
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set goals and roughly emotions orient</v>

190
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you in relationship to those goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

191
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those categories overlap.</v>

192
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Anger is usually considered an emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it often has a goal,</v>

193
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goal is to hit something or hurt</v>

194
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:45.960
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one possible goal.</v>

195
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 1>So emotions can segway quite easily into</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational states,</v>

196
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to use a category system of some</v>

197
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>sort to clear clarify things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what we're going to,</v>

198
00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.370
<v Speaker 1>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

199
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 1>pursue motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set goals.</v>

200
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 1>It's actually more complicated than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

201
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed you that little oval diagram</v>

202
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:09.000
<v Speaker 1>with a desired future and unbearable</v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

203
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motivations actually don't just set</v>

204
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also prime behavior and they also</v>

205
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 1>set up the perceptual frame within which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you interpret the world.</v>

206
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're hungry and isn't just that</v>

207
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you're driven to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

208
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:29.340
<v Speaker 1>eating is a very complex behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's associated with food</v>

209
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 1>preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say you're the,</v>

210
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:36.651
<v Speaker 1>the systems that you've used in the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>to procure food and then to ingest it</v>

211
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 1>are sort of disinhibited by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational state.</v>

212
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So they're at the ready and then your</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory system is tuned so that it's</v>

213
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 1>going to focus on those things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant to eating and tune out</v>

214
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the motivational state also does</v>

215
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 1>perceptual tuning and there's a felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>component of it as well.</v>

216
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

217
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not reasonable to only say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation sets goals or that it drives</v>

218
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does three things,</v>

219
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>goal setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral driving,</v>

220
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 1>plus it provides a perceptual schema</v>
<v Speaker 1>within which those other two things make</v>

221
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a motivated state in some sense</v>

222
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 1>is like a little micro personality.</v>

223
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>It's only got one aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a one eyed micro</v>

224
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 1>so it's only aiming at one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still has all the other aspects</v>

226
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 1>of personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

227
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.890
<v Speaker 1>for me that that aligns nicely with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic idea that you know,</v>

229
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.743
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

230
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a loose aggregation of multiple</v>

231
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.290
<v Speaker 1>fragmented personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

232
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of coherently tied together</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the highest level of analysis,</v>

233
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>but they can go off and do their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

234
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.010
<v Speaker 1>You see that in situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

235
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 1>like eating disorders where the hunger</v>
<v Speaker 1>system itself starts to become almost a</v>

236
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:56.020
<v Speaker 1>spun off part of the personality and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the personality.</v>

237
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Then wars with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of in some sense that's</v>

238
00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:02.530
<v Speaker 1>like cortex versus hypothalamus and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>never win.</v>

239
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.100
<v Speaker 1>CORTEX does not win over hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus is what keeps you</v>

240
00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:06.934
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

241
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the things that keeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>you alive.</v>

242
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 1>You could do without your cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you cannot do without your</v>

243
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:16.000
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the connections stretching upwards</v>

244
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 1>from the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very old brain area,</v>

245
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.020
<v Speaker 1>are much more powerful than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections coming down from the cortex</v>

246
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:26.200
<v Speaker 1>to modulate the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another indication of just</v>

247
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:28.510
<v Speaker 1>exactly who's in charge when the chips</v>
<v Speaker 1>are down,</v>

248
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.280
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's so hard for you to</v>

249
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 1>override your basic emotions or</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational states.</v>

250
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like the system evolved to keep you</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and it's not particularly willing</v>

251
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:43.531
<v Speaker 1>to give up control in a sense given that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your survival is staked on its function.</v>

252
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to know that because you</v>

253
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:47.951
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

254
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:48.784
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

255
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 1>if you pursue psychology and you stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the human side of psychology,</v>

256
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 1>say instead of wandering off into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal behavioral research,</v>

257
00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that most human psychologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and neuropsychologists are very cortical</v>

258
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 1>centric.</v>

259
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.320
<v Speaker 1>They really like to think that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>newly evolved parts of the brain that</v>

260
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:09.640
<v Speaker 1>are in charge and that's just not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The newly evolved parts of the brain are</v>

261
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:13.120
<v Speaker 1>in charge only when nothing is bothering</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

262
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're not hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not thirsty,</v>

263
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.040
<v Speaker 1>you're not too excited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not too curious.</v>

264
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:19.960
<v Speaker 1>You're not too terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

265
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 1>you're not too cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not too warm any of those,</v>

266
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.900
<v Speaker 1>then the cortex is in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you deviate substantially across</v>

267
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 1>any of those dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that control over your</v>

268
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:35.740
<v Speaker 1>behavioral output in your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to devolve down the</v>

269
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:39.580
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary hierarchy to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial brain areas is extremely</v>

270
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:40.660
<v Speaker 1>likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

271
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 1>and you see the same thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

272
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:44.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're having a discussion with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

273
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they exhaust the limits of your</v>

274
00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:51.130
<v Speaker 1>rational knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means basically they out argue,</v>

275
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 1>well what happens?</v>

276
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Well usually what happens is that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>cry or they get angry and it's like</v>

277
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.380
<v Speaker 1>they're out of cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bang right down to the more,</v>

278
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.580
<v Speaker 1>the lower and more primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily determined systems.</v>

279
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to,</v>

280
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take a look at how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain functions in general.</v>

281
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to start pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>general and then we're going to go</v>

282
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 1>narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing that you might want</v>

283
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 1>to think about is what problem exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the brain wrestling with.</v>

284
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And the major problem is that reality is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so complicated.</v>

285
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.760
<v Speaker 1>It has so many layers and so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnected causal links that it's</v>

286
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 1>complex beyond comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>

287
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:38.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about all the subatomic</v>

288
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 1>complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a horrible thing.</v>

289
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the complexity at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>atomic level and that's,</v>

290
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty overwhelming.</v>

291
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:48.290
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the molecular level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes the atomic level looks</v>

292
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:49.124
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

293
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.080
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all the comp</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceedingly complex structures that</v>

294
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 1>emerge out of the molecular level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in living organisms.</v>

295
00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:59.960
<v Speaker 1>So that would be roughly at the organ</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of existence,</v>

296
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's you as a totality with</v>

297
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

298
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:08.030
<v Speaker 1>and the brain is so much more complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>than everything else in the universe</v>

299
00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:11.450
<v Speaker 1>that it's not even in the same category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are estimates,</v>

300
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:13.040
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Gerard Edelman,</v>

301
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:15.050
<v Speaker 1>that there are more connections in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

302
00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:18.890
<v Speaker 1>more patterns of connections in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain than there are subatomic particles</v>

303
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:20.300
<v Speaker 1>in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

304
00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:22.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one major league complex thing</v>

305
00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of them around and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

306
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 1>they're all integrated into families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

307
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

308
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.370
<v Speaker 1>roughly tribal grouping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of which get large enough to be</v>

309
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:36.680
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's all embedded inside of</v>

310
00:16:36.681 --> 00:16:40.010
<v Speaker 1>some biological system and so on and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>

311
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 1>all the way out to the limits of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmos.</v>

312
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one complicated place and you</v>

313
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:47.630
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job in,</v>

314
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 1>in large part is to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also not to become overwhelmed by it</v>

315
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:56.540
<v Speaker 1>because you have to simplify it down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where you can sort of think</v>

316
00:16:56.541 --> 00:17:00.200
<v Speaker 1>about one thing and do one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to screen all of that</v>

317
00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:05.201
<v Speaker 1>out so that the complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity doesn't overwhelm you when</v>

318
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:09.920
<v Speaker 1>you're attempting to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything simple even to look at yourself</v>

319
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:12.830
<v Speaker 1>in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a very complicated thing</v>

320
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the problem your brain is,</v>

321
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.560
<v Speaker 1>is always facing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can I ignore?</v>

322
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.550
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

323
00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:25.180
<v Speaker 1>you need to ignore almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

324
00:17:25.181 --> 00:17:27.530
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem because of course it's</v>

325
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 1>not always obvious what it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's okay for you to ignore,</v>

326
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.430
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that changes on you suddenly too,</v>

327
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.010
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have imperfect knowledge,</v>

328
00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>you may think something's irrelevant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be of critical</v>

329
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:41.360
<v Speaker 1>importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's deadly.</v>

330
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a deadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadly difficult problem.</v>

331
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the ways that we solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is we're actually blind to,</v>

332
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to almost everything.</v>

333
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our sensory</v>

334
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.040
<v Speaker 1>input is limited by our physiological</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations,</v>

335
00:17:58.041 --> 00:17:59.210
<v Speaker 1>certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's like,</v>

336
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 1>in terms of vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only see a very small,</v>

337
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:05.870
<v Speaker 1>just a little slice of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic spectrum.</v>

338
00:18:05.871 --> 00:18:08.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same with sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

339
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.880
<v Speaker 1>we can only touch things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically within our reach.</v>

340
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:14.810
<v Speaker 1>And so that limits things substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are also things we can't</v>

341
00:18:14.811 --> 00:18:16.820
<v Speaker 1>detect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're not very good at detecting,</v>

342
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we don't have the same ability that</v>

343
00:18:19.581 --> 00:18:24.581
<v Speaker 1>say it was said platypuses and some fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>can detect electromagnetic disturbances</v>

344
00:18:24.831 --> 00:18:27.530
<v Speaker 1>around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their skin and like their senses that</v>

345
00:18:27.531 --> 00:18:30.080
<v Speaker 1>we don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'reZ ,</v>

346
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.410
<v Speaker 1>we're narrowed a fair bit by what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're able to perceive.</v>

347
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're actually narrowed,</v>

348
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:36.720
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

349
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.420
<v Speaker 1>In what we can perceive far more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody ever.</v>

350
00:18:39.421 --> 00:18:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to show you a little video</v>

351
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:42.320
<v Speaker 1>here and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

352
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.660
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it will be loud enough so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear it.</v>

353
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 passes.</v>

354
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Did you spot the gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people who hadn't seen or heard</v>

355
00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:39.260
<v Speaker 2>about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you like this before?</v>

356
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.560
<v Speaker 2>About half miss the gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you knew about the gorilla,</v>

357
00:19:45.681 --> 00:19:48.710
<v Speaker 2>you probably saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but did you notice the curtain changing</v>

358
00:19:48.711 --> 00:19:51.350
<v Speaker 2>color or the player on the black team</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving the game?</v>

359
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:59.410
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

360
00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.620
<v Speaker 2>there goes a player is changing from red</v>
<v Speaker 2>to gold.</v>

361
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.790
<v Speaker 2>You've offered this other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the invisible gorilla.com.</v>

362
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.930
<v Speaker 1>So how many of you saw the gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

363
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.611
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

364
00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:40.070
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

365
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you had known about this</v>

366
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:45.450
<v Speaker 1>video beforehand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

367
00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:46.470
<v Speaker 1>the gorilla part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

368
00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 1>So you guys don't count now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

369
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get someone who's seen it before and</v>

370
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 1>they still miss the damn gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty funny.</v>

371
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.470
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

372
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 1>but of course Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Simon set this up because his</v>

373
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:59.410
<v Speaker 1>original video got so popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.620
<v Speaker 1>virally popular that everybody has seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>the invisible gorilla.</v>

375
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:03.790
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 1>now he's showing you that while you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're smart,</v>

377
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:09.070
<v Speaker 1>you've been clued in to how blind you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and it turns out you're not any</v>

378
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 1>smarter than you are to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

379
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 1>So how many people saw all three things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that changed?</v>

380
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen it before.</v>

381
00:21:16.861 --> 00:21:17.281
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

382
00:21:17.281 --> 00:21:18.240
<v Speaker 1>And how many didn't?</v>

383
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

384
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:19.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

385
00:21:19.951 --> 00:21:23.630
<v Speaker 1>So the vast majority of you missed one</v>
<v Speaker 1>or more of the things that change?</v>

386
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:23.941
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

387
00:21:23.941 --> 00:21:27.960
<v Speaker 1>not really trivial things like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappearance of a person from six</v>

388
00:21:27.961 --> 00:21:31.950
<v Speaker 1>people that's fairly major and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole background changed color and</v>

389
00:21:31.951 --> 00:21:34.530
<v Speaker 1>you might think you'd clue into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

390
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:39.360
<v Speaker 1>so the weird thing is even when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>primed to notice what you're supposed to</v>

391
00:21:39.361 --> 00:21:42.360
<v Speaker 1>notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to say count the balls and you</v>

392
00:21:42.361 --> 00:21:44.280
<v Speaker 1>know that something weird is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

393
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.010
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's still doesn't prime you enough so</v>

394
00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:49.410
<v Speaker 1>that you can keep track of all the weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are happening.</v>

395
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.930
<v Speaker 1>And like this was an absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>staggering experiment when,</v>

396
00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:56.820
<v Speaker 1>when it was first shown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychologist were just like knocked</v>

397
00:21:56.821 --> 00:22:01.020
<v Speaker 1>over by it because the hypothesis up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that point had been always that,</v>

398
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could concentrate on what you were</v>

399
00:22:03.241 --> 00:22:06.000
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if something anomalous or unexpected</v>

400
00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:08.160
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your attention would be automatically</v>

401
00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:09.000
<v Speaker 1>devoted towards it.</v>

402
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.530
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

403
00:22:10.531 --> 00:22:12.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think that if you're watching</v>

404
00:22:12.151 --> 00:22:17.100
<v Speaker 1>people play basket ball and a gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 1>walks into the you know,</v>

405
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:21.520
<v Speaker 1>area and it's not small that of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be surprised and you'd see it and</v>

406
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.790
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that that's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

407
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.730
<v Speaker 1>it tells you a lot about how your</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system is set up.</v>

408
00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.580
<v Speaker 1>So you're focusing on counting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>balls.</v>

409
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And so for some reason getting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct answer to the question,</v>

410
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.620
<v Speaker 1>how many times are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the ball thrown back and forth turns</v>

411
00:22:37.621 --> 00:22:40.020
<v Speaker 1>out to be motivationally significant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

412
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

413
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

414
00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:43.500
<v Speaker 1>why did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

415
00:22:43.501 --> 00:22:45.150
<v Speaker 1>you got the instructions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

416
00:22:45.151 --> 00:22:50.151
<v Speaker 1>But why did you listen to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure it does.</v>

417
00:22:51.231 --> 00:22:54.200
<v Speaker 1>But the question is why did you even</v>
<v Speaker 1>comply with the instructions?</v>

418
00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who said that?</v>

419
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Because you want to get the answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

420
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Why did you care if you got the answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

421
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Well think about it for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what yes means yes.</v>

422
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:12.471
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

423
00:23:12.471 --> 00:23:14.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's one possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like instantly you sort of</v>

424
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:17.660
<v Speaker 1>interpreted as a little cognitive tasks</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

425
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.550
<v Speaker 1>and then you want to see if you can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

426
00:23:19.551 --> 00:23:22.640
<v Speaker 1>And you know also that taps into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of values.</v>

427
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Part of your value is I want to be maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smart and competent person or I want</v>

428
00:23:26.721 --> 00:23:30.350
<v Speaker 1>to be at least as smart and competent as</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else is playing this game.</v>

429
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.890
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the instruction taps into a preexistent</v>

430
00:23:33.891 --> 00:23:35.690
<v Speaker 1>value structure and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivating.</v>

431
00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Yup.</v>

432
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:38.930
<v Speaker 1>What compliance as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

433
00:23:38.931 --> 00:23:40.500
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the,</v>

434
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room in some ways it's set up to</v>

435
00:23:43.911 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 1>ensure a degree of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

436
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Because there's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an implicit story in the room,</v>

437
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:52.310
<v Speaker 1>which is if I'm at the front of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that sort of makes me at the top</v>

438
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 1>of the dominance hierarchy and the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're here means you've already</v>

439
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 1>bought into that presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a logical thing to do to</v>

440
00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:02.090
<v Speaker 1>play along with the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>

441
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

442
00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.700
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's more like the playing a game</v>

443
00:24:09.701 --> 00:24:10.301
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

444
00:24:10.301 --> 00:24:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Is that while maybe something</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting will happen.</v>

445
00:24:12.431 --> 00:24:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

446
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.440
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

447
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a variety of reasons why you</v>

448
00:24:16.241 --> 00:24:19.960
<v Speaker 1>might listen to the instructions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is the instructions</v>

449
00:24:19.961 --> 00:24:24.910
<v Speaker 1>actually tap into your motivation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your intrinsic motivation enough so that</v>

450
00:24:24.911 --> 00:24:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you will in fact attempt to play the</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

451
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.400
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as you play the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens while you focus your very</v>

452
00:24:33.401 --> 00:24:37.510
<v Speaker 1>limited attentional resources precisely</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what it is that you're supposed to</v>

453
00:24:37.511 --> 00:24:39.460
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we could talk a little bit about how</v>

454
00:24:39.461 --> 00:24:40.810
<v Speaker 1>the visual field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's set up.</v>

455
00:24:40.811 --> 00:24:41.980
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

456
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:44.920
<v Speaker 1>you notice that like if I'm looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the room,</v>

457
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.530
<v Speaker 1>if I want to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you,</v>

458
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I can't just stand here and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight ahead because all you people</v>

459
00:24:51.431 --> 00:24:52.570
<v Speaker 1>over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

460
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't see if I'm looking straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

461
00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't see the faces of anyone past</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and I can only see them sort of as</v>

462
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.010
<v Speaker 1>blurs and unless they move and if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>move up something then I can see the</v>

463
00:25:06.011 --> 00:25:07.000
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can't,</v>

464
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.420
<v Speaker 1>it's not clear to me what's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same for the people over</v>

465
00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:12.100
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only person I can really see right</v>

466
00:25:12.101 --> 00:25:14.950
<v Speaker 1>now is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the woman who's sitting there in the</v>

467
00:25:14.951 --> 00:25:16.930
<v Speaker 1>white sweater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the rest of you are like,</v>

468
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.410
<v Speaker 1>and the person to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can more or less,</v>

469
00:25:20.411 --> 00:25:23.350
<v Speaker 1>as long as I look at her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could more or less see that he's</v>

470
00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:26.800
<v Speaker 1>dressed in gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't see his face at all now as</v>

471
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.390
<v Speaker 1>he nodded his head and I could pick that</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

472
00:25:28.391 --> 00:25:32.740
<v Speaker 1>So what's very strange about your visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and your sensory systems are like</v>

473
00:25:32.741 --> 00:25:33.730
<v Speaker 1>this in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

474
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:34.923
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

475
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you know all your sensory systems are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is that you have a tiny little</v>

476
00:25:39.191 --> 00:25:42.400
<v Speaker 1>point of focus where the information is</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>

477
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the center of your eye is the full vr</v>

478
00:25:46.631 --> 00:25:48.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's most densely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

479
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.090
<v Speaker 1>it's most densely packed with cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>

480
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.420
<v Speaker 1>each of the cells in your phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the very center of your vision,</v>

481
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.650
<v Speaker 1>you can tell when someone's pointing</v>
<v Speaker 1>their full view for via at you because</v>

482
00:25:59.651 --> 00:26:00.431
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:26:00.431 --> 00:26:03.820
<v Speaker 1>you have the sense that they're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at you and human beings are unbelievably</v>

484
00:26:03.821 --> 00:26:08.800
<v Speaker 1>good at figuring out when someone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing their full via at u w we can,</v>

485
00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:12.570
<v Speaker 1>we can detect I um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

486
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Deviation from direct gaze with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>accuracy that's absolutely remarkable.</v>

487
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Now each of those little cells in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phobia is connected.</v>

488
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Each of the one sells is connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20,000 cells at the first level of</v>

489
00:26:26.531 --> 00:26:31.531
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy of the visual system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason that your whole high</v>

490
00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:34.870
<v Speaker 1>isn't full vs cause your head would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be this big to manage it.</v>

491
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.870
<v Speaker 1>So you know w what's evolved is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a compromise is that in the center of</v>

492
00:26:40.271 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 1>your vision it's the center of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision is very detailed.</v>

493
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what you do is you zip that</v>

494
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>center around like snap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snap,</v>

495
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:50.011
<v Speaker 1>snap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snap,</v>

496
00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:50.731
<v Speaker 1>snap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snap.</v>

497
00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And your brain sorta makes a amalgamated</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture out of all those little</v>

498
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 1>snapshots and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it weaves it together.</v>

499
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:02.721
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to you like it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuous what a continuous movie of</v>

500
00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 1>consciousness even though it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

501
00:27:04.951 --> 00:27:08.790
<v Speaker 1>And then the sides of your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the periphery of your eyes.</v>

502
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't have the same potency as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the full via and so they,</v>

503
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 1>they kind of play a triage game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

504
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.630
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see if I'm looking straight</v>

505
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:20.010
<v Speaker 1>ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see everything.</v>

506
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 1>What might I use as an indication that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should move my gaze from where I'm</v>

507
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 1>looking to somewhere else.</v>

508
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.120
<v Speaker 1>And one answer to that is movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the periphery is pretty good at</v>

509
00:27:30.121 --> 00:27:33.270
<v Speaker 1>picking up movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so often if you see movement in the</v>

510
00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 1>periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll move your fovial vision to</v>

511
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:38.400
<v Speaker 1>where the movement was and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

512
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.280
<v Speaker 1>then you can keep track of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>

513
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.870
<v Speaker 1>So what your brain sort of assumes is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you're looking at something,</v>

514
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.680
<v Speaker 1>everything else is irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>

515
00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:53.730
<v Speaker 1>it also sort of fades into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

516
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.100
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what's happening with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla video.</v>

517
00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:00.030
<v Speaker 1>And so the part of the reason you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the damn gorillas cause he's dressed</v>

518
00:28:00.031 --> 00:28:03.210
<v Speaker 1>in black like the players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're focusing on the</v>

519
00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:07.350
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the block moving things look the</v>

520
00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:09.150
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

521
00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Speaker 1>there's no distinction between them at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

522
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.920
<v Speaker 1>And then the background of the curtain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

523
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:18.921
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you be primed to see the</v>

524
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:19.980
<v Speaker 1>curtain change color?</v>

525
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Like things just don't do that in real</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

526
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:23.843
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

527
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 1>big objects don't suddenly change color</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

528
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:27.840
<v Speaker 1>very seldomly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

529
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:32.700
<v Speaker 1>and Bob and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the gorilla shows up,</v>

530
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:37.980
<v Speaker 1>the fact that one player leaves and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that the curtains change color has</v>

531
00:28:37.981 --> 00:28:40.950
<v Speaker 1>no bearing whatsoever on whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can complete the task.</v>

532
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter if you ignore the</v>

533
00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:49.350
<v Speaker 1>information and that's because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant in terms of the interpretive</v>

534
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:51.330
<v Speaker 1>frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motivated interpretive frame that</v>

535
00:28:51.331 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you're applying to the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the rule for perception is don't</v>

536
00:28:55.711 --> 00:28:58.800
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to anything that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly relevant to the desired</v>

537
00:28:58.801 --> 00:29:02.910
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now exactly how you calculate what you</v>

538
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:06.600
<v Speaker 1>can pay attention to and what you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very complicated.</v>

539
00:29:06.601 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

540
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.860
<v Speaker 1>you build that knowledge bit by bit over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and,</v>

541
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.810
<v Speaker 1>and you can be wrong about it too.</v>

542
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.063
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

543
00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the old idea was,</v>

544
00:29:16.261 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all that you were very</v>

545
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:22.110
<v Speaker 1>much conscious of the environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>

546
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:24.840
<v Speaker 1>which you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second idea was,</v>

547
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're being conscious of the</v>

548
00:29:28.021 --> 00:29:30.390
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything changes radically,</v>

549
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you will definitely focus your attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

550
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.380
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what turned out to be the case is,</v>

551
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not very conscious of the</v>

552
00:29:38.761 --> 00:29:42.730
<v Speaker 1>environment and radical things can</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and you won't notice them unless</v>

553
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:46.780
<v Speaker 1>they interfere with what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something that emerges that</v>

554
00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 1>interferes with what you're doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't expect,</v>

555
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 1>you will instantly orient towards and</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on.</v>

556
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't a normally or novelty that</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracts your attention.</v>

557
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 1>It's the unexpected disruption of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between your behaviors and</v>

558
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:05.740
<v Speaker 1>the desired outcome of those behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a much narrower claim.</v>

559
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Only pay attention to things that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fail.</v>

560
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.330
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least additionally,</v>

561
00:30:13.331 --> 00:30:15.280
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to things that make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>

562
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

563
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.410
<v Speaker 1>that's also associated with an emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

564
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:22.850
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're doing something and,</v>

565
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.520
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you know how to do it,</v>

566
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 1>and so you're doing it and then all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden something unexpected happens,</v>

567
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have an emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

568
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk more about the emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions in the next class.</v>

569
00:30:32.891 --> 00:30:37.480
<v Speaker 1>But the emotional reaction partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepares you for the worst in case this</v>

570
00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:39.520
<v Speaker 1>unexpected thing is bigger than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it is.</v>

571
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.660
<v Speaker 1>And sort of also primes you to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>curious and to start to explore,</v>

572
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.590
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what it is so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstruct your expectations and</v>

573
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 1>desires in accordance with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming world.</v>

574
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:55.890
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>this slide is an elaboration in some</v>

575
00:30:57.061 --> 00:31:00.690
<v Speaker 1>sense of what I was telling you a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit earlier about the multiple levels of</v>

576
00:31:00.691 --> 00:31:01.461
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

577
00:31:01.461 --> 00:31:04.050
<v Speaker 1>so the idea is that the thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

578
00:31:04.051 --> 00:31:06.480
<v Speaker 1>which in this particular schema would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the computer</v>

579
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:13.460
<v Speaker 1>is nested inside all of these systems or</v>
<v Speaker 1>has other systems nested inside of it.</v>

580
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of an indication of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity of things.</v>

581
00:31:16.321 --> 00:31:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

582
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.860
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you might think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

583
00:31:19.861 --> 00:31:21.810
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're using your computer,</v>

584
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.060
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

585
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you might ask yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

586
00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:30.520
<v Speaker 1>why is your computer a black rectangle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are like a silver rectangle.</v>

587
00:31:30.521 --> 00:31:32.980
<v Speaker 1>It's all smooth and shiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

588
00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not clear.</v>

589
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.130
<v Speaker 1>First it's not transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

590
00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:42.080
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's got this smooth cover.</v>

591
00:31:42.081 --> 00:31:44.870
<v Speaker 1>And it wouldn't necessarily have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

592
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that's appealing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

593
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's familiar.</v>

594
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:53.224
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

595
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:54.850
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's familiar.</v>

596
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else is,</v>

597
00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.780
<v Speaker 1>it's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

598
00:31:58.781 --> 00:32:01.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to interact with the</v>

599
00:32:01.301 --> 00:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>computer at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to attract with little pictures</v>

600
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.650
<v Speaker 1>on the screen and then you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to interact with those.</v>

601
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.190
<v Speaker 1>You want to interact with some subset of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that picture is doing on the</v>

602
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:14.140
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're very,</v>

603
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 1>very rarely using the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

604
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.930
<v Speaker 1>You're just paying attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's say the screen and the</v>

605
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:23.530
<v Speaker 1>keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the computer is whatever's underneath</v>

606
00:32:23.531 --> 00:32:24.191
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what,</v>

607
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:27.280
<v Speaker 1>what that is is a collection of parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are so bloody complicated that you</v>

608
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:30.670
<v Speaker 1>don't want to have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that are nested inside a whole</v>

609
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:33.640
<v Speaker 1>network of things that are so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to have anything to do</v>

610
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:34.474
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

611
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.990
<v Speaker 1>so you know what happens when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>using a computer is all of a sudden it</v>

612
00:32:37.991 --> 00:32:38.830
<v Speaker 1>stops working.</v>

613
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Well then it's a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as it stops working,</v>

614
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:45.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that it was whatever it was you</v>

615
00:32:45.561 --> 00:32:48.290
<v Speaker 1>were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as it turns into a computer,</v>

616
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.840
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

617
00:32:51.841 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stupidly hit the on and off button</v>

618
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.500
<v Speaker 1>and they'd be a plug it in and and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know and out or something and maybe you</v>

619
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:02.501
<v Speaker 1>checked your switches to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fuse didn't burn out or a break or go</v>

620
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:07.190
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty much the end of you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of your ability to deal with the</v>

621
00:33:07.191 --> 00:33:08.600
<v Speaker 1>actual entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:33:08.601 --> 00:33:13.601
<v Speaker 1>and then you curse with your primate</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and then you send it out to be</v>

623
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:17.530
<v Speaker 1>fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's,</v>

624
00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:21.950
<v Speaker 1>that's that's worth considering because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this will also help us understand what</v>

625
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:26.450
<v Speaker 1>happens in terms of brain function as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>go along is that as long as things are</v>

626
00:33:26.451 --> 00:33:29.060
<v Speaker 1>going according to how you want them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

627
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.000
<v Speaker 1>you can really pretend that the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably simple.</v>

628
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.110
<v Speaker 1>All the world consists of is those few</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're doing in your little</v>

629
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:40.820
<v Speaker 1>bounded perceptual frame and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else is zero.</v>

630
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:46.490
<v Speaker 1>And then unfortunately now and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis that everything else is zero</v>

631
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.960
<v Speaker 1>is radically wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when your computer crashes and then</v>

632
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you actually actually for awhile have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with at least some of the</v>

633
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:58.520
<v Speaker 1>complexity that's actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's usually extremely anxiety</v>

634
00:33:58.521 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 1>provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

635
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:05.201
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine in the same situation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're in your nice smooth car and</v>

636
00:34:05.331 --> 00:34:06.590
<v Speaker 1>you're on the highway and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>

637
00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear a horrible grinding noise and</v>

638
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:12.020
<v Speaker 1>smoke comes out of the back and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're off pulled over to the side.</v>

639
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was merely a means of getting from</v>

640
00:34:16.551 --> 00:34:18.980
<v Speaker 1>point a to B and comfort like two</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds ago,</v>

641
00:34:18.981 --> 00:34:22.310
<v Speaker 1>is now a collection of extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>troublesome parts,</v>

642
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 1>none of which you know anything about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's disrupted your day,</v>

643
00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.500
<v Speaker 1>plus it's disrupted your pocket book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you have to now deal with a bunch</v>

644
00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:33.620
<v Speaker 1>of people who are going to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with your vehicle and maybe</v>

645
00:34:33.621 --> 00:34:38.621
<v Speaker 1>fix it for some completely unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money and with dubious</v>

646
00:34:39.051 --> 00:34:40.730
<v Speaker 1>utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so poof,</v>

647
00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 1>the car turns into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

648
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.640
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to overestimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which we live within a</v>

649
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:54.641
<v Speaker 1>world that's bounded by our expectations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and desires and how much time we spend</v>

650
00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:02.120
<v Speaker 1>keeping everything that's complex away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from us so that we don't have to deal</v>

651
00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:02.661
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

652
00:35:02.661 --> 00:35:05.480
<v Speaker 1>so now we might want to think about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do that.</v>

653
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:10.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the little Schema that might be</v>

654
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:12.200
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like</v>

655
00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I made this little diagram of dots</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to make an ambiguous</v>

656
00:35:20.731 --> 00:35:23.850
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping that when you look at that</v>

657
00:35:23.851 --> 00:35:26.910
<v Speaker 1>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you see when you look at it?</v>

658
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:34.410
<v Speaker 1>The center and what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

659
00:35:34.411 --> 00:35:38.420
<v Speaker 1>What shape is the center</v>
<v Speaker 1>across?</v>

660
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can see across.</v>

661
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.550
<v Speaker 1>What else can you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a rectangle.</v>

662
00:35:43.551 --> 00:35:44.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

663
00:35:44.121 --> 00:35:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Can you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What square?</v>

664
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.820
<v Speaker 1>It's four squares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

665
00:35:46.821 --> 00:35:48.620
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what else can you see?</v>

666
00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen that one.</v>

667
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll take your word for it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else can you see?</v>

668
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you some of the things you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

669
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

670
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:08.940
<v Speaker 3>You see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

671
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.790
<v Speaker 3>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that?</v>

672
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:21.870
<v Speaker 3>You could see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see that.</v>

673
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that you might know</v>

674
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.860
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing in the beginning,</v>

675
00:36:29.861 --> 00:36:33.820
<v Speaker 1>the thing in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you can see milk multiple</v>

676
00:36:33.821 --> 00:36:35.980
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly that.</v>

677
00:36:35.981 --> 00:36:38.890
<v Speaker 1>You have an opinion about what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

678
00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.170
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually see those different</v>

679
00:36:41.171 --> 00:36:44.440
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it manifesting those</v>

680
00:36:44.441 --> 00:36:47.170
<v Speaker 1>different perceptual objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

681
00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:50.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a strange thing because you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how people always think that arguments</v>

682
00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:54.520
<v Speaker 1>are about opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some facts and you have one set</v>

683
00:36:54.521 --> 00:36:56.380
<v Speaker 1>of opinions about them and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

684
00:36:56.381 --> 00:36:59.080
<v Speaker 1>and then you argue about the opinions</v>
<v Speaker 1>till you get to the facts.</v>

685
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot worse than that because the</v>

686
00:37:01.751 --> 00:37:06.751
<v Speaker 1>facts themselves are often reasonably</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to debate.</v>

687
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.210
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might ask for example,</v>

688
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:15.040
<v Speaker 1>which of the five ways that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that initial thing is the right way</v>

689
00:37:15.041 --> 00:37:15.874
<v Speaker 1>to see it.</v>

690
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.380
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a pragmatic answer,</v>

691
00:37:20.381 --> 00:37:22.690
<v Speaker 1>is it depends on what you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your perception.</v>

692
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.910
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to,</v>

693
00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.490
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted the highest resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>that captures as much detail as</v>

694
00:37:30.491 --> 00:37:32.890
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you want something as close to the</v>

695
00:37:32.891 --> 00:37:35.830
<v Speaker 1>thing in itself as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that'd probably be object fives</v>

696
00:37:35.831 --> 00:37:37.210
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

697
00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.570
<v Speaker 1>if you want to know the rough area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that's a map of an orchard,</v>

698
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.440
<v Speaker 1>you might think about object one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's an orchard from the top right</v>

699
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.420
<v Speaker 1>and you want it to walk from north to</v>
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>

700
00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.380
<v Speaker 1>you might want to think about it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of object three you know,</v>

701
00:37:50.381 --> 00:37:53.260
<v Speaker 1>and so those are different ways you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive that object.</v>

702
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.650
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say that what happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the next level of abstraction,</v>

703
00:37:56.651 --> 00:37:59.320
<v Speaker 1>and that's where you've got the numbers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and words down here,</v>

704
00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:02.980
<v Speaker 1>is that you have the thing in itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is complex and can be seen many</v>

705
00:38:02.981 --> 00:38:03.670
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

706
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Then you have the things you see which</v>
<v Speaker 1>are partial,</v>

707
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.270
<v Speaker 1>sort of low resolution representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the thing itself.</v>

708
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:15.630
<v Speaker 1>And then there are words which are at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least in part references to the image of</v>

709
00:38:15.911 --> 00:38:18.430
<v Speaker 1>the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so by the time you get to the word,</v>

710
00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:22.270
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty compressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really liked the metaphor of</v>

711
00:38:22.271 --> 00:38:23.320
<v Speaker 1>compression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

712
00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.400
<v Speaker 1>so cause a lot of the things you see are</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like thumbnails and why our</v>

713
00:38:27.401 --> 00:38:29.800
<v Speaker 1>thumbnails useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys have done some,</v>

714
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>image processing.</v>

715
00:38:32.291 --> 00:38:37.291
<v Speaker 1>Say like obviously a thumbnail lacks</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things that a 16 megabyte is that</v>

716
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:40.870
<v Speaker 1>about right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big are cameras?</v>

717
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 1>16 megabytes for a single photo.</v>

718
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.163
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

719
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think the new cameras are up.</v>

720
00:38:49.531 --> 00:38:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I think they're up to 16 the newest</v>
<v Speaker 1>iteration.</v>

721
00:38:51.481 --> 00:38:51.841
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

722
00:38:51.841 --> 00:38:55.710
<v Speaker 1>So why have thumbnail if you have a 16</v>
<v Speaker 1>megabyte picture?</v>

723
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.823
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

724
00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.330
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why not use the picture,</v>

725
00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it is that there's a</v>

726
00:39:04.521 --> 00:39:09.521
<v Speaker 1>trade off between detailed</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation and time utilization time</v>

727
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.540
<v Speaker 1>and resource utilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know like,</v>

728
00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.470
<v Speaker 1>like a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have limited time and resources</v>

729
00:39:15.471 --> 00:39:18.680
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't actually want to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>any more than you need to see in order</v>

730
00:39:18.681 --> 00:39:21.410
<v Speaker 1>to get what you're supposed to get done</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

731
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise it's just a waste of</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

732
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.960
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is always trying to figure out in</v>

733
00:39:26.961 --> 00:39:31.961
<v Speaker 1>some sense what's the simplest way I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent this so that I can undertake</v>

734
00:39:32.181 --> 00:39:34.190
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that I'm planning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>undertake next.</v>

735
00:39:34.191 --> 00:39:35.270
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

736
00:39:35.271 --> 00:39:38.150
<v Speaker 1>from a philosophical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually something pragmatic.</v>

737
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask yourself,</v>

738
00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.540
<v Speaker 1>you organize your perceptions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your goals,</v>

739
00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.800
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

740
00:39:45.801 --> 00:39:47.180
<v Speaker 1>where do those goals come from?</v>

741
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.390
<v Speaker 1>And when we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've heard from thinkers like say Freud</v>

742
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:55.850
<v Speaker 1>who talked about the ied functions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ed is sort of the seat of primordial</v>

743
00:39:55.851 --> 00:39:56.900
<v Speaker 1>impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

744
00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And so you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might think about the Ed as the</v>

745
00:39:59.811 --> 00:40:03.800
<v Speaker 1>producer of primary goals or drives and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

746
00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I did think about them as drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were things that led to,</v>

747
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:11.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relatively rigid behavioral algorithm</v>

748
00:40:11.511 --> 00:40:14.570
<v Speaker 1>once the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state had arisen.</v>

749
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned before,</v>

750
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's a flawed viewpoint</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the motivational state is more</v>

751
00:40:21.441 --> 00:40:25.810
<v Speaker 1>than merely a drive because the drive is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that say triggers a</v>

752
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:30.080
<v Speaker 1>preprogrammed sequence of behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the early behaviorists</v>

753
00:40:30.081 --> 00:40:31.900
<v Speaker 1>thought about animal behavior in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>

754
00:40:31.901 --> 00:40:33.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd say the animal encounter a</v>

755
00:40:33.321 --> 00:40:37.730
<v Speaker 1>stimulus and the stimulus would produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>a response and then the responses would</v>

756
00:40:37.731 --> 00:40:40.490
<v Speaker 1>get chained together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when the animal look</v>

757
00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.510
<v Speaker 1>encountered the stimulus again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just those change responses would</v>

758
00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:45.620
<v Speaker 1>automatically run.</v>

759
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.690
<v Speaker 1>And one of the famous experiments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed that that was wrong was a rat was</v>

760
00:40:50.691 --> 00:40:53.390
<v Speaker 1>trained to run through a maze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could sort of train your out pretty</v>

761
00:40:53.391 --> 00:40:56.510
<v Speaker 1>quickly if you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put them in the maze and there's</v>

762
00:40:56.511 --> 00:40:59.840
<v Speaker 1>like he can go this way or this way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put some cheese over here,</v>

763
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you do that three or four times the rat</v>
<v Speaker 1>learns to turn right.</v>

764
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.210
<v Speaker 1>And then you add another piece to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maze and you know,</v>

765
00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:08.180
<v Speaker 1>then the rattlers to turn left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get it turning,</v>

766
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:10.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely in an extremely complicated</v>

767
00:41:10.641 --> 00:41:14.540
<v Speaker 1>way to walk through the maze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what they did was they took a</v>

768
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:17.690
<v Speaker 1>rat and they wrapped up its hind legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

769
00:41:17.691 --> 00:41:19.910
<v Speaker 1>like with tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it couldn't use them.</v>

770
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:24.470
<v Speaker 1>And then they put its little rear end on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cart and then they had the little rat</v>

771
00:41:24.471 --> 00:41:26.630
<v Speaker 1>scoot through the maze on the cart.</v>

772
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:30.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's obvious that a scooting route</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a running route don't use the same</v>

773
00:41:30.141 --> 00:41:31.880
<v Speaker 1>motor output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>

774
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.720
<v Speaker 1>And the rat could still get the maze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that all the route had done</v>

775
00:41:35.721 --> 00:41:39.200
<v Speaker 1>was chained together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned automatic responses,</v>

776
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rats,</v>

777
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 1>it's more like rats learn what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and can generalize from it just like</v>

778
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:48.030
<v Speaker 1>you do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

779
00:41:48.031 --> 00:41:50.750
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the notion that the drive just</v>

780
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.190
<v Speaker 1>instantiates a sequence of preprogrammed</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors in most cases,</v>

781
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.010
<v Speaker 1>in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with complex behavior,</v>

782
00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some limited circumstances under</v>

783
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:03.380
<v Speaker 1>which it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

784
00:42:03.381 --> 00:42:08.381
<v Speaker 1>So the first hypothesis we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertain is the idea that you have to</v>

785
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:10.400
<v Speaker 1>frame the world in order to interact</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

786
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:13.370
<v Speaker 1>And this is sort of a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological diagram that I whipped up a</v>

787
00:42:13.371 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the bottom thing that's a neuro</v>

788
00:42:16.521 --> 00:42:17.331
<v Speaker 1>bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

789
00:42:17.331 --> 00:42:19.220
<v Speaker 1>which is a dragon that eats its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>tail.</v>

790
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:24.140
<v Speaker 1>It's an ancient symbol of chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos is what you see when you don't</v>

791
00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:27.890
<v Speaker 1>know what you're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say in some sense chaos</v>

792
00:42:27.891 --> 00:42:30.740
<v Speaker 1>is all the complexity that surrounds you</v>

793
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:32.533
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

794
00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.460
<v Speaker 1>could possibly intrude on your little</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe world.</v>

795
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:37.923
<v Speaker 3>And then</v>

796
00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.370
<v Speaker 1>to grasp that k also to operate within</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

797
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.120
<v Speaker 1>you have to put it within a framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the great father there.</v>

798
00:42:45.121 --> 00:42:49.140
<v Speaker 1>That's actually God you see in God's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun behind him because God is like</v>

799
00:42:49.141 --> 00:42:50.960
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's you know,</v>

800
00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.870
<v Speaker 1>reliable and he's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and then he sorta ruling</v>

801
00:42:54.871 --> 00:42:57.870
<v Speaker 1>over this city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for me that was a good symbol of</v>

802
00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.260
<v Speaker 1>culture and put in part culture is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's outside of you.</v>

803
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:05.790
<v Speaker 1>But in part culture is also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frameworks that you've learned to use by</v>

804
00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:08.910
<v Speaker 1>being with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The frameworks that you've learned to</v>

805
00:43:08.911 --> 00:43:13.911
<v Speaker 1>use to narrow and specify the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in my motive thinking that framing</v>

806
00:43:15.811 --> 00:43:19.590
<v Speaker 1>is a associated with security on the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand because it tells you what you can</v>

807
00:43:19.591 --> 00:43:21.960
<v Speaker 1>do and you know it makes things safe for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

808
00:43:21.961 --> 00:43:24.930
<v Speaker 1>And tyranny on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it can get out of control and you</v>

809
00:43:24.931 --> 00:43:26.550
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can start to get too rigid,</v>

810
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:30.360
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the pros and cons of</v>

811
00:43:30.361 --> 00:43:31.194
<v Speaker 1>framing.</v>

812
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.640
<v Speaker 1>If you see something one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't see it another,</v>

813
00:43:35.641 --> 00:43:39.000
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to see it another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the corn side of framing the</v>

814
00:43:39.001 --> 00:43:42.270
<v Speaker 1>pros side of framing is while it then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to do something.</v>

815
00:43:42.271 --> 00:43:45.360
<v Speaker 1>If it's unframed you're in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's existential anxiety,</v>

816
00:43:45.361 --> 00:43:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to move ahead at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to frame things,</v>

817
00:43:47.911 --> 00:43:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you have to simplify them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really in some sense you even have</v>

818
00:43:51.331 --> 00:43:55.140
<v Speaker 1>to oversimplify them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what you mean by that.</v>

819
00:43:55.141 --> 00:43:58.710
<v Speaker 1>But what you're really trying to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to never make your perceptual task any</v>

820
00:43:58.711 --> 00:44:02.100
<v Speaker 1>more complex than that has to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to get done what you need to get</v>

821
00:44:02.101 --> 00:44:05.010
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you frame things?</v>

822
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we should point out is</v>

823
00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:10.860
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of framing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even happen psychologically,</v>

824
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here you are sitting in this</v>

825
00:44:13.501 --> 00:44:17.580
<v Speaker 1>classroom and you're not overwhelmed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

826
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Well why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

827
00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:22.530
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a city that's helpful.</v>

828
00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.800
<v Speaker 1>There's electricity here and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural gas and there's people to fix</v>

829
00:44:25.801 --> 00:44:28.620
<v Speaker 1>all the plumbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact that you're in a city</v>

830
00:44:28.621 --> 00:44:30.660
<v Speaker 1>makes life much simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right off the bat.</v>

831
00:44:30.661 --> 00:44:33.990
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing trying to eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to contend with the fact</v>

832
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:35.850
<v Speaker 1>that it's like minus 20 for three</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

833
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a whole bunch of complexity</v>

834
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:41.550
<v Speaker 1>that the were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the civilized world is just taken care</v>

835
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.160
<v Speaker 1>of for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

836
00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're in the university in the city</v>

837
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 1>and that eliminates a whole bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other hassles.</v>

838
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:50.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things you have to do,</v>

839
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of things you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do and then you're inside this</v>

840
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:55.170
<v Speaker 1>building and wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

841
00:44:55.171 --> 00:44:56.700
<v Speaker 1>There's electric light here and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

842
00:44:56.701 --> 00:44:59.820
<v Speaker 1>and the chairs work and there's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be an earthquake.</v>

843
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And probably the whole building isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to fall down.</v>

844
00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:04.680
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you sitting in your chair</v>

845
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:09.120
<v Speaker 1>here also with your clothing on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've screened a lot of complexity out</v>

846
00:45:09.121 --> 00:45:11.340
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can sit there fairly calmly.</v>

847
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And so that's all external.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now part of the reason,</v>

848
00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 1>and this is this is where thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

849
00:45:16.231 --> 00:45:19.710
<v Speaker 1>because this isn't only psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys will hear a fair bit about</v>

850
00:45:19.711 --> 00:45:23.070
<v Speaker 1>terror management theories as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress through your education.</v>

851
00:45:23.071 --> 00:45:28.071
<v Speaker 1>And so Karen Management theories are</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories that attempt to account for why</v>

852
00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:30.330
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

853
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.810
<v Speaker 1>say patriotic in their beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they adopt belief systems.</v>

854
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that a belief system</v>
<v Speaker 1>protects you from death anxiety.</v>

855
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.490
<v Speaker 1>And so Freud's are sorta said that about</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious systems.</v>

856
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:44.700
<v Speaker 1>That was his critique of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are afraid of death.</v>

857
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 1>And so they have this infant title</v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to have that fear go away.</v>

858
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:49.770
<v Speaker 1>So they turned to religion and religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

859
00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:50.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death isn't permanent.</v>

860
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's why people are religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the extension of that is,</v>

861
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:56.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also why they have belief systems</v>

862
00:45:56.821 --> 00:45:58.680
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to protect themselves</v>

863
00:45:58.681 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 1>against this deep shaking anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to some degree,</v>

864
00:46:02.431 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you should also remember that when</v>

865
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:10.020
<v Speaker 1>you're protecting your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if you identify with it,</v>

866
00:46:10.021 --> 00:46:12.930
<v Speaker 1>you're patriotic or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you think that your culture is worth</v>

867
00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:15.180
<v Speaker 1>defending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not just defending something</v>

868
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:18.540
<v Speaker 1>psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the culture,</v>

869
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 1>the function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key functioning culture keeps the</v>

870
00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:23.400
<v Speaker 1>lights on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

871
00:46:23.401 --> 00:46:25.740
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't just protect you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>death anxiety.</v>

872
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.150
<v Speaker 1>It also protects you from death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's even more important most of</v>

873
00:46:30.151 --> 00:46:32.220
<v Speaker 1>the time than being protected from death</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

874
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a psychological component to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it too,</v>

875
00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:38.880
<v Speaker 1>but you don't ever want to underestimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the practical utility of being</v>

876
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:39.870
<v Speaker 1>nested inside.</v>

877
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.290
<v Speaker 1>You know what piaget would consider a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively functional game.</v>

878
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like your words a lot simpler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

879
00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:47.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to work to maintain it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

880
00:46:47.641 --> 00:46:50.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of a drag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the tyrannical element of</v>

881
00:46:50.551 --> 00:46:51.390
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

882
00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:53.250
<v Speaker 1>the payoff's pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

883
00:46:53.251 --> 00:46:57.480
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at medieval cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a well preserved medieval city</v>

884
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.490
<v Speaker 1>in France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of medieval cities that</v>

885
00:46:59.491 --> 00:47:02.460
<v Speaker 1>still exist in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see this is a typical sort of</v>

886
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:06.420
<v Speaker 1>human habitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like inside there's order and</v>

887
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:10.230
<v Speaker 1>outside there's chaos and barbarians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a couple of walls to keep</v>

888
00:47:10.231 --> 00:47:13.110
<v Speaker 1>the chaos and the barbarians out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then inside,</v>

889
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:14.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a dominance hierarchy and</v>

890
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:18.960
<v Speaker 1>everybody can live their relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive and relatively peaceful</v>

891
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inside of that,</v>

892
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.210
<v Speaker 1>it's all framing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of complexity,</v>

893
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with houses.</v>

894
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:29.740
<v Speaker 1>They do the same for you.</v>

895
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 4>And then social institutions do the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing too.</v>

896
00:47:33.161 --> 00:47:33.994
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

897
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:34.930
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

898
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.260
<v Speaker 4>is it Kennedy there and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Obama?</v>

899
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 4>I think so this is part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>transition in power from George Bush to</v>

900
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

901
00:47:43.331 --> 00:47:46.840
<v Speaker 4>that's a pretty scary thing to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're the leader of your dominance</v>

902
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy replaced by another leader and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

903
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:54.520
<v Speaker 4>among chimpanzees for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's often the occasion for a fair bit</v>

904
00:47:54.521 --> 00:47:58.450
<v Speaker 4>of mayhem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's also the case often for people</v>

905
00:47:58.451 --> 00:47:59.470
<v Speaker 4>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

906
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:02.800
<v Speaker 4>that that occurs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we still have that in the form of</v>

907
00:48:02.801 --> 00:48:05.590
<v Speaker 4>political corruption and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But all things considered,</v>

908
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:08.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the power transition from Obama or from</v>

909
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Bush to Obama was far more peaceful than</v>
<v Speaker 4>such.</v>

910
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Power transitions generally are if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>look across the history of mankind.</v>

911
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.320
<v Speaker 4>And so that means you're also protected</v>
<v Speaker 4>by your social institutions.</v>

912
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:23.260
<v Speaker 4>They screen out a lot of potential</v>
<v Speaker 4>complexity as well,</v>

913
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.990
<v Speaker 4>as long as they're functional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

914
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:29.530
<v Speaker 4>and also I think as long as they follow</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the Piaget and rules.</v>

915
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.490
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the PSG in rules for a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a playable game is there's some</v>

916
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:34.960
<v Speaker 4>reciprocity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

917
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:39.961
<v Speaker 4>you regard the system roughly speaking</v>
<v Speaker 4>as either fair or fairer than any other</v>

918
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:44.120
<v Speaker 4>system you can think up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

919
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.540
<v Speaker 4>it boils down to the same thing because</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's not fair,</v>

920
00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:48.340
<v Speaker 4>but you can't come up with a better</v>
<v Speaker 4>fantasy,</v>

921
00:48:48.341 --> 00:48:51.790
<v Speaker 4>well it's as good as it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

922
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sociological or sociopolitical</v>

923
00:48:55.511 --> 00:48:59.230
<v Speaker 4>structures that keep complexity away</v>
<v Speaker 4>from us can only operate under a certain</v>

924
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 4>limited number of constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But still they perform their function,</v>

925
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

926
00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:05.630
<v Speaker 4>and very admirably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

927
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.980
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I see people in my clinical</v>

928
00:49:08.981 --> 00:49:10.220
<v Speaker 4>practice all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

929
00:49:10.221 --> 00:49:13.990
<v Speaker 4>and most people that I see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think this is true of most people</v>

930
00:49:13.991 --> 00:49:18.190
<v Speaker 4>in the world have at least one serious</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem,</v>

931
00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:20.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it might be they have an illness</v>

932
00:49:20.531 --> 00:49:21.850
<v Speaker 4>that's just god awful.</v>

933
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:26.200
<v Speaker 4>Or if or if they don't have an illness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of their immediate family has an</v>

934
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:27.820
<v Speaker 4>illness that's god awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or they're,</v>

935
00:49:27.821 --> 00:49:29.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really old and they're,</v>

936
00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 4>and they need to be taken care of or</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're suffering from some insane</v>

937
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:36.220
<v Speaker 4>economic problem or they've just been</v>
<v Speaker 4>unemployed or whatever.</v>

938
00:49:36.221 --> 00:49:36.671
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

939
00:49:36.671 --> 00:49:40.000
<v Speaker 4>there's something in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their immediate circle that's really,</v>

940
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:43.870
<v Speaker 4>really difficult to grapple with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet people still go out and maintain</v>

941
00:49:43.871 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 4>their place in the world and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing roughly works.</v>

942
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:51.970
<v Speaker 4>And to me that's just a con continual</v>
<v Speaker 4>source of amazement that people can pull</v>

943
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:52.870
<v Speaker 4>that off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

944
00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.740
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a lot of the screening that you do to</v>

945
00:49:56.741 --> 00:50:01.420
<v Speaker 4>get rid of that complexity is external</v>
<v Speaker 4>and part of that is a consequence of</v>

946
00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:02.560
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well functioning,</v>

947
00:50:02.561 --> 00:50:04.030
<v Speaker 4>sociological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

948
00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:08.350
<v Speaker 4>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the next thing that sorta screens</v>

949
00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.180
<v Speaker 4>things out for you is your body.</v>

950
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.800
<v Speaker 4>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

951
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.670
<v Speaker 4>you kind of naturally see things at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>particular level of resolution,</v>

952
00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no obvious reason why that</v>

953
00:50:18.461 --> 00:50:20.680
<v Speaker 4>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

954
00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.620
<v Speaker 4>you see the front of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't see the back of them.</v>

955
00:50:23.621 --> 00:50:27.010
<v Speaker 4>You see their external covering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their skin in their clothes,</v>

956
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.570
<v Speaker 4>can't see inside them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look closely at them,</v>

957
00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:32.450
<v Speaker 4>you can't see their cellular structure</v>
<v Speaker 4>or their molecular structure,</v>

958
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:36.140
<v Speaker 4>their atomic structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't really see the social</v>

959
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 4>situations that they're embedded in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I look at you,</v>

960
00:50:39.741 --> 00:50:41.560
<v Speaker 4>I can't see your family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

961
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:42.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I presume you have one.</v>

962
00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.240
<v Speaker 4>I can't really see the political</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation that surrounds you either.</v>

963
00:50:47.241 --> 00:50:50.960
<v Speaker 4>I have to know that abstractly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the ecological level is almost</v>

964
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:55.961
<v Speaker 4>completely imperceptible to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so part of the way that complexity</v>

965
00:50:56.031 --> 00:50:59.720
<v Speaker 4>is screened out is that your body just</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't allow you to pick a lot of it</v>

966
00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:00.530
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

967
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:05.390
<v Speaker 4>You're just blind to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you see at one level of resolution,</v>

968
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:09.020
<v Speaker 4>and that's the human level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see things of approximately our</v>

969
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:11.300
<v Speaker 4>size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see things that are approximately</v>

970
00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:14.180
<v Speaker 4>the size that we can grip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are sort of the things that you're</v>

971
00:51:14.181 --> 00:51:18.680
<v Speaker 4>likely to come to think of as objects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like clearly a mountain isn't exactly an</v>

972
00:51:18.681 --> 00:51:20.150
<v Speaker 4>object,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

973
00:51:20.151 --> 00:51:25.151
<v Speaker 4>so usability is part of what defines</v>
<v Speaker 4>perceptibility.</v>

974
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:30.310
<v Speaker 4>And so that also screens things out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you're left with while what</v>

975
00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:36.620
<v Speaker 4>it is that you have to deal with once</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's been screened out.</v>

976
00:51:36.621 --> 00:51:37.640
<v Speaker 4>And then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

977
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.280
<v Speaker 4>there's still a lot of complexity left</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

978
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:42.350
<v Speaker 4>Like they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's plenty of complexity within the</v>

979
00:51:42.351 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 4>average family and there's plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 4>complexity in the mating domain,</v>

980
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:49.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to find a partner and to establish a</v>

981
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.460
<v Speaker 4>reasonable longterm relationship and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have children and to raise them.</v>

982
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:57.670
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty of complexity left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the question is how did</v>

983
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.310
<v Speaker 4>biology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did biology come to solve those</v>

984
00:52:01.311 --> 00:52:03.810
<v Speaker 4>problems?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Given that there are almost infinite and</v>

985
00:52:03.811 --> 00:52:05.780
<v Speaker 4>complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can you do it?</v>

986
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.900
<v Speaker 4>And the answer to that is fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Darwinian answer.</v>

987
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.470
<v Speaker 4>You start simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's back in the days of the</v>

988
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:15.320
<v Speaker 4>one celled organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have no idea how those things got</v>

989
00:52:15.321 --> 00:52:16.131
<v Speaker 4>their start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

990
00:52:16.131 --> 00:52:18.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual beginning of life is a</v>

991
00:52:18.981 --> 00:52:21.290
<v Speaker 4>serious mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'll tell you,</v>

992
00:52:21.291 --> 00:52:24.230
<v Speaker 4>it's such a serious mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is completely unbelievable.</v>

993
00:52:24.231 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 4>But one of the people who discovered</v>
<v Speaker 4>DNA,</v>

994
00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:28.520
<v Speaker 4>I think it was Francis Crick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>

995
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:32.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm virtually certain it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he actually believed that DNA came from</v>

996
00:52:32.271 --> 00:52:35.090
<v Speaker 4>an alien civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote a whole book about that.</v>

997
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.870
<v Speaker 4>It's called Panspermia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he believes that believed</v>

998
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:43.820
<v Speaker 4>posited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's possible for DNA to drift</v>

999
00:52:43.821 --> 00:52:48.821
<v Speaker 4>through space for millions of years and</v>
<v Speaker 4>to land on planets and to start living.</v>

1000
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 4>And that to God only knows how old DNA</v>
<v Speaker 4>is because he just couldn't figure out</v>

1001
00:52:53.931 --> 00:52:55.730
<v Speaker 4>at all how it could have possibly</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolved.</v>

1002
00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.060
<v Speaker 4>So scientists are a lot weirder than you</v>
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

1003
00:52:59.061 --> 00:53:02.030
<v Speaker 4>When you start to read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know about what the scientists who</v>

1004
00:53:02.031 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 4>discovered things really thought they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>completely,</v>

1005
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of their mind.</v>

1006
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:10.010
<v Speaker 4>But whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll assume that DNA got there somehow.</v>

1007
00:53:10.011 --> 00:53:13.400
<v Speaker 4>And then evolution took over after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what does evolution do?</v>

1008
00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:15.500
<v Speaker 4>It basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1009
00:53:15.501 --> 00:53:20.300
<v Speaker 4>here is a terribly complex problem that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've sort of partially solved and</v>

1010
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:23.900
<v Speaker 4>partially solved means we've lived long</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to produce another copy of</v>

1011
00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:27.000
<v Speaker 4>ourselves that constitutes the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1012
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:33.120
<v Speaker 4>So we've lived lived long enough so that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we could conceivably duplicate</v>

1013
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 4>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How should we do that?</v>

1014
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a variety of different ways.</v>

1015
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.370
<v Speaker 4>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should produce variance.</v>

1016
00:53:38.371 --> 00:53:42.270
<v Speaker 4>So that might be multiple offspring or</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be,</v>

1017
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 4>it might also be facilitated by random</v>
<v Speaker 4>mutation.</v>

1018
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mutations are random,</v>

1019
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.350
<v Speaker 4>although there's increasing evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1020
00:53:52.351 --> 00:53:57.351
<v Speaker 4>that organisms are much more complex at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the genetic level than anyone ever</v>

1021
00:53:57.781 --> 00:53:59.490
<v Speaker 4>assumed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And bacteria,</v>

1022
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>swap DNA back and forth with other</v>

1023
00:54:01.861 --> 00:54:05.970
<v Speaker 4>bacteria all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there are experiences that you can</v>

1024
00:54:05.971 --> 00:54:09.750
<v Speaker 4>have that will change your genetic</v>
<v Speaker 4>structure sufficiently so that you will</v>

1025
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:13.610
<v Speaker 4>transmit that to your children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know the idea that everything's</v>

1026
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:17.220
<v Speaker 4>purely Darwinian and it's only mutation</v>
<v Speaker 4>that drives randomness,</v>

1027
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:22.490
<v Speaker 4>that's clearly likely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not not complete.</v>

1028
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.080
<v Speaker 4>These other mechanisms are clearly</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1029
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:25.960
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1030
00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.840
<v Speaker 4>the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that what you do is you,</v>

1031
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.320
<v Speaker 4>you start with something that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>works and then you produce micro</v>

1032
00:54:31.321 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 4>variants of it and then the world around</v>
<v Speaker 4>you changes a little bit and hopefully</v>

1033
00:54:36.091 --> 00:54:40.020
<v Speaker 4>one of those micro variants manages to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do the same thing and then it produces a</v>

1034
00:54:40.021 --> 00:54:43.840
<v Speaker 4>bunch of micro variants and then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>managed to do the same thing.</v>

1035
00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:47.640
<v Speaker 4>And so what's happening is there's an</v>
<v Speaker 4>arms race between the environment which</v>

1036
00:54:47.641 --> 00:54:51.420
<v Speaker 4>is always changing and the organisms</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are trying to keep up with it in</v>

1037
00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:54.060
<v Speaker 4>that arms race just goes on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1038
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:56.220
<v Speaker 4>different life forms proliferate as</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1039
00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.700
<v Speaker 4>As that occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of like life is always playing</v>

1040
00:54:59.701 --> 00:55:03.990
<v Speaker 4>catch up and you never get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot get it right.</v>

1041
00:55:03.991 --> 00:55:08.991
<v Speaker 4>The best you can do is get it right long</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to live long enough to reproduce.</v>

1042
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:13.080
<v Speaker 4>That constitutes the sum total of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge.</v>

1043
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.170
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so what that means,</v>

1044
00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:18.060
<v Speaker 4>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you guys are all the</v>

1045
00:55:18.061 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 4>beneficiary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1046
00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:24.180
<v Speaker 4>of a evolutionary process that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically been going on since the</v>

1047
00:55:24.181 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 4>beginning of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's about 3.5 billion years ago.</v>

1048
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:31.860
<v Speaker 4>And so your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your psychophysiology has been in an</v>

1049
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:35.370
<v Speaker 4>arms race with the transforming</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment for three and a half billion</v>

1050
00:55:35.371 --> 00:55:40.371
<v Speaker 4>years trying to keep up and poof,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're the stellar consequence of three</v>

1051
00:55:40.471 --> 00:55:44.400
<v Speaker 4>and a half billion years of like effort</v>
<v Speaker 4>and death.</v>

1052
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.200
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1053
00:55:46.201 --> 00:55:49.370
<v Speaker 4>you might thank the cosmos about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think about this,</v>

1054
00:55:49.371 --> 00:55:54.371
<v Speaker 4>say every single one of your female</v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestors successfully reproduced like</v>

1055
00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:57.870
<v Speaker 4>it's mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's mind boggling.</v>

1056
00:55:57.871 --> 00:55:59.850
<v Speaker 4>You're so unlikely that you would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1057
00:55:59.851 --> 00:56:00.900
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's,</v>

1058
00:56:00.901 --> 00:56:05.670
<v Speaker 4>that it's almost incalculable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So good for us.</v>

1059
00:56:05.671 --> 00:56:06.510
<v Speaker 4>Here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1060
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.540
<v Speaker 4>how successful can you get?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my,</v>

1061
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.720
<v Speaker 4>my point is that part of the way that</v>
<v Speaker 4>complexity is dealt with is,</v>

1062
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:16.020
<v Speaker 4>is haphazard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't ever really dealt with.</v>

1063
00:56:16.021 --> 00:56:21.021
<v Speaker 4>That's why you die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can only manage it to a limited</v>

1064
00:56:21.301 --> 00:56:22.260
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for us,</v>

1065
00:56:22.261 --> 00:56:25.210
<v Speaker 4>that's like three kids in a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1066
00:56:25.211 --> 00:56:26.710
<v Speaker 4>If you're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

1067
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:29.830
<v Speaker 4>that's hard knowledge after three and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>half billion years.</v>

1068
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 4>So the complexity problem is a rough</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

1069
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.930
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's your body.</v>

1070
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Now let's look inside your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you might think that,</v>

1071
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have this sort of idea that's kind of</v>

1072
00:56:41.321 --> 00:56:45.520
<v Speaker 4>a leftover car Tz and that there's a you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a your body and the you is</v>

1073
00:56:45.521 --> 00:56:48.670
<v Speaker 4>in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so just out of curiosity,</v>

1074
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:53.980
<v Speaker 4>how many of you have the subjective</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense that the EU is in your head?</v>

1075
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1076
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 4>How many of you would locate you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like for me,</v>

1077
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can locate me somewhere seems to be</v>

1078
00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:02.920
<v Speaker 4>about there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's where I am.</v>

1079
00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:08.260
<v Speaker 4>And so how many of people think have</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the center of their sense of</v>

1080
00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:10.900
<v Speaker 4>subjectivity in their head?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people are like that?</v>

1081
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:14.710
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people are different than that?</v>

1082
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:17.150
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so all good.</v>

1083
00:57:17.151 --> 00:57:19.250
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So where like where do you feel the</v>

1084
00:57:19.251 --> 00:57:21.380
<v Speaker 4>center of your subjectivity?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where would it be?</v>

1085
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:26.083
<v Speaker 2>That's hard.</v>

1086
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking more about how?</v>

1087
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.780
<v Speaker 4>About how it feels fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough.</v>

1088
00:57:34.781 --> 00:57:36.880
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that that's a perfectly</v>

1089
00:57:36.881 --> 00:57:38.560
<v Speaker 4>reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking of it more as a subjective</v>

1090
00:57:38.561 --> 00:57:39.460
<v Speaker 4>experience though.</v>

1091
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.113
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1092
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:46.200
<v Speaker 4>And so you're kind of located here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.510
<v Speaker 4>How many people would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would agree with that?</v>

1094
00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:50.041
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So quite,</v>

1095
00:57:50.041 --> 00:57:50.970
<v Speaker 4>quite a few of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

1096
00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:52.710
<v Speaker 4>so that's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same for you.</v>

1097
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.800
<v Speaker 4>More like here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1098
00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:56.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1099
00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:58.290
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any other places?</v>

1100
00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:03.950
<v Speaker 4>Any other places you can talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1101
00:58:04.201 --> 00:58:05.034
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1102
00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.960
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any other places?</v>

1103
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:15.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not good.</v>

1104
00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.120
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1105
00:58:18.121 --> 00:58:19.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kidding.</v>

1106
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:20.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1107
00:58:20.701 --> 00:58:21.271
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1108
00:58:21.271 --> 00:58:23.220
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we kind of gone hand in heart and you</v>

1109
00:58:23.221 --> 00:58:24.900
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really kind of historically</v>

1110
00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:27.240
<v Speaker 4>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Greeks seem to look have located</v>

1111
00:58:27.241 --> 00:58:29.250
<v Speaker 4>themselves sort of in their heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1112
00:58:29.251 --> 00:58:33.000
<v Speaker 4>and there's some theory that as people</v>
<v Speaker 4>became more intellectualized that that</v>

1113
00:58:33.001 --> 00:58:36.870
<v Speaker 4>feeling sort of went up to their head</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe before the heart there was the</v>

1114
00:58:36.871 --> 00:58:37.830
<v Speaker 4>stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1115
00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.840
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might think that you're your stomach</v>

1116
00:58:39.841 --> 00:58:41.490
<v Speaker 4>if you are hungry all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1117
00:58:41.491 --> 00:58:42.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just not ever hungry.</v>

1118
00:58:42.871 --> 00:58:44.580
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why the hell would you think you or your</v>

1119
00:58:44.581 --> 00:58:46.050
<v Speaker 4>stomach?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1120
00:58:46.051 --> 00:58:49.320
<v Speaker 4>that's another way that culture sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps complexity at bay.</v>

1121
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:51.010
<v Speaker 4>You don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1122
00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:55.050
<v Speaker 4>that's almost like a motivational state</v>
<v Speaker 4>that modern people don't even have to</v>

1123
00:58:55.051 --> 00:58:57.450
<v Speaker 4>contend with because you're never really</v>
<v Speaker 4>hungry.</v>

1124
00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many of you have gone without food</v>

1125
00:58:59.431 --> 00:59:02.840
<v Speaker 4>for more than 24 hours?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1126
00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:05.330
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of you in voluntarily went</v>

1127
00:59:05.331 --> 00:59:07.970
<v Speaker 4>without food for more than 24 hours?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1128
00:59:07.971 --> 00:59:09.200
<v Speaker 4>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's rough.</v>

1129
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:10.700
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about a week?</v>

1130
00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:12.053
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1131
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:14.170
<v Speaker 4>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about three days?</v>

1132
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:17.451
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1133
00:59:17.451 --> 00:59:19.490
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a couple of people who've gone</v>

1134
00:59:19.491 --> 00:59:23.410
<v Speaker 4>for reasonable periods of time eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but fundamentally you can tell we can,</v>

1135
00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:26.450
<v Speaker 4>we kind of got that problem under</v>
<v Speaker 4>control so you don't have to worry too</v>

1136
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:29.120
<v Speaker 4>much about your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about you being your stomach.</v>

1137
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:31.340
<v Speaker 4>But I'll tell you if you were starving</v>
<v Speaker 4>at some point,</v>

1138
00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.550
<v Speaker 4>that's probably where you'd locate</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

1139
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now you're inside the body.</v>

1140
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:38.840
<v Speaker 4>And so let's take a look at how the body</v>
<v Speaker 4>works inside.</v>

1141
00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:41.570
<v Speaker 4>So you kind of feel that you're in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

1142
00:59:41.571 --> 00:59:43.340
<v Speaker 4>most of you anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1143
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you kind of think your brain is in your</v>

1144
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:47.360
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But really that's not right.</v>

1145
00:59:47.361 --> 00:59:52.361
<v Speaker 4>I don't really understand ever why we</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of decided that our brains were in</v>

1146
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:53.300
<v Speaker 4>our head because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1147
00:59:53.301 --> 00:59:54.111
<v Speaker 4>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1148
00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:56.990
<v Speaker 4>there's the nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's not in your hand.</v>

1149
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:58.970
<v Speaker 4>It's distributed through your whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

1150
00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.900
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of it up in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's the whole spinal cord that's</v>

1151
01:00:02.901 --> 01:00:05.450
<v Speaker 4>an important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it has all these branching</v>

1152
01:00:05.451 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 4>nerves that allow you to move your hands</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to feel things.</v>

1153
01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 4>And it's like your nervous system is</v>
<v Speaker 4>distributed all the way through your</v>

1154
01:00:11.031 --> 01:00:14.120
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not reasonable to think about</v>

1155
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:18.230
<v Speaker 4>the way that you operate as you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>things with your brain.</v>

1156
01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:19.820
<v Speaker 4>And then you do things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1157
01:00:19.821 --> 01:00:22.910
<v Speaker 4>if that's sort of true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's important ways that it's not</v>

1158
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:25.610
<v Speaker 4>true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's important to know the ways that</v>

1159
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 4>it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It helps you understand phenomena that</v>

1160
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't otherwise understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can give you an example.</v>

1161
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:35.300
<v Speaker 4>There are people who experience</v>
<v Speaker 4>blindness.</v>

1162
01:00:35.301 --> 01:00:36.830
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't because their eyes get</v>

1163
01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.630
<v Speaker 4>damaged just because they have brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>damage.</v>

1164
01:00:38.631 --> 01:00:40.940
<v Speaker 4>And so it damages the visual cortex.</v>

1165
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:44.000
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the higher order,</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher order part of the brain that's</v>

1166
01:00:44.001 --> 01:00:46.610
<v Speaker 4>responsible for conscious vision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1167
01:00:46.611 --> 01:00:48.070
<v Speaker 4>So maybe they get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

1168
01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.180
<v Speaker 4>they get a tumor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get hit in the head or they get</v>

1169
01:00:50.181 --> 01:00:52.370
<v Speaker 4>shocked or something and then Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're blind.</v>

1170
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.890
<v Speaker 4>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1171
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.440
<v Speaker 4>they tell you they can't see anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you say to them,</v>

1172
01:00:57.441 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's fine.</v>

1173
01:00:58.701 --> 01:01:00.890
<v Speaker 4>You can't see anything but let's play a</v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

1174
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.260
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to hold up my left hand or my</v>

1175
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:07.190
<v Speaker 4>right hand and you're going to guess</v>
<v Speaker 4>about which I'm holding up.</v>

1176
01:01:07.191 --> 01:01:11.000
<v Speaker 4>And so you do this and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right and you do this and they go left,</v>

1177
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.250
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

1178
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.050
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1179
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.960
<v Speaker 4>And they're right and you tell them</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

1180
01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:18.531
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1181
01:01:18.531 --> 01:01:21.620
<v Speaker 4>I can't because I don't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's one,</v>

1182
01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.970
<v Speaker 4>that's blind sight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1183
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.410
<v Speaker 4>So here's another kind of blind sight.</v>

1184
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 4>So you take the same person and you set</v>
<v Speaker 4>them in front of the screen and you say,</v>

1185
01:01:29.151 --> 01:01:30.080
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the screen.</v>

1186
01:01:30.081 --> 01:01:32.690
<v Speaker 4>And they tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told you already I can't see anything.</v>

1187
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:35.720
<v Speaker 4>And then you flash faces at them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1188
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you check for changes in the</v>

1189
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:41.630
<v Speaker 4>conductivity of their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when people react emotionally,</v>

1190
01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:44.660
<v Speaker 4>they sweat a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little less than that changes how</v>

1191
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.500
<v Speaker 4>electricity passes through their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you show them a smiling face and</v>

1192
01:01:48.501 --> 01:01:50.240
<v Speaker 4>there's not much of a change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1193
01:01:50.241 --> 01:01:53.900
<v Speaker 4>you show them a neutral face and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not much of a change.</v>

1194
01:01:53.901 --> 01:01:57.650
<v Speaker 4>And then you showed them like a really</v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive or really afraid face and</v>

1195
01:01:57.651 --> 01:02:00.980
<v Speaker 4>poof spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you do that at a number of times and</v>

1196
01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:03.170
<v Speaker 4>you show them well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as I show you a face of</v>

1197
01:02:03.171 --> 01:02:06.080
<v Speaker 4>someone who's afraid or face of someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's angry,</v>

1198
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.110
<v Speaker 4>you react to it.</v>

1199
01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:09.140
<v Speaker 4>Psychophysiological you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1200
01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.120
<v Speaker 4>how the hell can that happen if they</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't see an answer that is,</v>

1201
01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.710
<v Speaker 4>you don't just see with your vision you</v>
<v Speaker 4>see with your body.</v>

1202
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.000
<v Speaker 4>And so one of the things that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>find,</v>

1203
01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 4>for example if you go through Swanson's</v>
<v Speaker 4>paper,</v>

1204
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I'll read you a little bit about this</v>
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>

1205
01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:30.561
<v Speaker 4>is that most of your senses map onto</v>
<v Speaker 4>multiple levels of your nervous system.</v>

1206
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:33.120
<v Speaker 4>So some of them knocked right onto your</v>
<v Speaker 4>spine.</v>

1207
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 4>And that's good because now and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

1208
01:02:35.851 --> 01:02:40.680
<v Speaker 4>I should tell your spine to do something</v>
<v Speaker 4>before you think cause is too slow.</v>

1209
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:41.911
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1210
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 4>you've got to understand like way back</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we were frogs,</v>

1211
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.340
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had eyes,</v>

1212
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.120
<v Speaker 4>we didn't have much of a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like what the hell were the eyes</v>

1213
01:02:51.121 --> 01:02:55.470
<v Speaker 4>doing that it's not like the frog</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly sees and you might think,</v>

1214
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:59.100
<v Speaker 4>well how could eyes inform you about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world if you don't?</v>

1215
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.700
<v Speaker 4>Exactly see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you got to kind of think of it</v>

1216
01:03:01.701 --> 01:03:03.360
<v Speaker 4>didn't appear as Yeti incense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>

1217
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:06.330
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's an example.</v>

1218
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.360
<v Speaker 4>It might take an animal like a sponge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty simple animal and it can open and</v>

1219
01:03:12.361 --> 01:03:17.220
<v Speaker 4>close pours on the outside of its</v>
<v Speaker 4>surface according to different changes</v>

1220
01:03:17.221 --> 01:03:22.221
<v Speaker 4>in the ocean that surrounds it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's perception is sort of like</v>

1221
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.580
<v Speaker 4>the ocean has three states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever those might be.</v>

1222
01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it has 10 I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for the sake of simplicity,</v>

1223
01:03:29.221 --> 01:03:32.430
<v Speaker 4>we'll say three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ocean manifest itself in three</v>

1224
01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:37.050
<v Speaker 4>pattern states in pattern state one I do</v>
<v Speaker 4>this in pattern state too.</v>

1225
01:03:37.051 --> 01:03:41.550
<v Speaker 4>I do this in pattern state three I do</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and so it's direct pattern onto</v>

1226
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:45.030
<v Speaker 4>action mapping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so animals can use their eyes just</v>

1227
01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:48.240
<v Speaker 4>to react with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to see the thing,</v>

1228
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause you think you see and then you</v>

1229
01:03:50.311 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 4>act.</v>

1230
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:53.520
<v Speaker 4>But why do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just react and you know this</v>

1231
01:03:53.521 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 4>already because in a simple way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you put your hand on a hot stove,</v>

1232
01:03:57.691 --> 01:04:00.630
<v Speaker 4>you'll go like this and then you'll feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pain.</v>

1233
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:05.310
<v Speaker 4>And what that means is that your body</v>
<v Speaker 4>has conserved the relationship between</v>

1234
01:04:05.311 --> 01:04:09.840
<v Speaker 4>your sensory neurons and your motor</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurons out of spinal level so that you</v>

1235
01:04:09.841 --> 01:04:13.560
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your perception of the heat is this.</v>

1236
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:19.490
<v Speaker 4>It's not of the heat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just mapping a bodily pattern onto</v>

1237
01:04:19.561 --> 01:04:24.561
<v Speaker 4>a sensory pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so a lot of really primitive sensory</v>

1238
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.530
<v Speaker 4>input is exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the sense detects a pattern.</v>

1239
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.710
<v Speaker 4>And with no intermediary of</v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation,</v>

1240
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.560
<v Speaker 4>that pattern is translated into a</v>
<v Speaker 4>behavioral output.</v>

1241
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:38.670
<v Speaker 4>And so there's actually generally the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>

1242
01:04:38.671 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 4>the simplest cells or sensory motor</v>
<v Speaker 4>cells.</v>

1243
01:04:40.711 --> 01:04:43.710
<v Speaker 4>So they do both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They map the pattern and they react and</v>

1244
01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:48.330
<v Speaker 4>then the sensory and the motor cells</v>
<v Speaker 4>differentiate and then neuro tissue</v>

1245
01:04:48.331 --> 01:04:49.290
<v Speaker 4>grows inside them.</v>

1246
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Speaker 4>And so then what happens is that instead</v>
<v Speaker 4>of an outside pattern being mapped</v>

1247
01:04:53.821 --> 01:04:57.780
<v Speaker 4>immediately onto a behavioral pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the neuro intermediary says,</v>

1248
01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:00.840
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this pattern could mean that any of</v>

1249
01:05:00.841 --> 01:05:05.160
<v Speaker 4>these three things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then that neural layer grows and</v>

1250
01:05:05.161 --> 01:05:07.260
<v Speaker 4>grows and grows until being creatures</v>
<v Speaker 4>like us,</v>

1251
01:05:07.261 --> 01:05:10.260
<v Speaker 4>it's like a whopping layer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we see a pattern and we go,</v>

1252
01:05:10.261 --> 01:05:11.190
<v Speaker 4>that could be this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1253
01:05:11.191 --> 01:05:11.731
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1254
01:05:11.731 --> 01:05:12.271
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1255
01:05:12.271 --> 01:05:13.104
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1256
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:16.320
<v Speaker 4>And then all of those things could be</v>
<v Speaker 4>mapped on to this or this or this or</v>

1257
01:05:16.321 --> 01:05:17.154
<v Speaker 4>this or this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1258
01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:18.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes us more slower,</v>

1259
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:21.850
<v Speaker 4>but more flexible and slow can be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

1260
01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 4>So like when you're walking down a</v>
<v Speaker 4>pathway and a snake appears,</v>

1261
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:27.520
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to be thinking snake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rubber hose,</v>

1262
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 4>stick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1263
01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:30.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because then you're dead because the</v>

1264
01:05:30.701 --> 01:05:33.190
<v Speaker 4>snake bites you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you want to do is catch the snake</v>

1265
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:36.640
<v Speaker 4>out of the corner of your eye and jump</v>
<v Speaker 4>up into the air before you even know</v>

1266
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:37.720
<v Speaker 4>that you saw a snake.</v>

1267
01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:41.800
<v Speaker 4>And you can do that because your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 4>can map right onto your spine and they</v>

1268
01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:44.950
<v Speaker 4>don't just map right onto your spine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They map onto your nervous system and</v>

1269
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:46.690
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>

1270
01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:51.340
<v Speaker 4>with the blind sight person who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at the face,</v>

1271
01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:54.820
<v Speaker 4>so it's an angry face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eyes are still mapping information</v>

1272
01:05:54.821 --> 01:05:57.520
<v Speaker 4>onto the Amygdala.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the Amygdala changes the</v>

1273
01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:59.170
<v Speaker 4>psychophysiology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1274
01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:03.670
<v Speaker 4>it says prepare for threat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the person might feel uneasy,</v>

1275
01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:05.230
<v Speaker 4>but that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird,</v>

1276
01:06:05.231 --> 01:06:09.460
<v Speaker 4>but that's a form of site to feel uneasy</v>
<v Speaker 4>can be a form of site.</v>

1277
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:14.620
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>

1278
01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 4>that's to say even more clearly that</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain just isn't in your head.</v>

1279
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:20.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's all the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all the way from,</v>

1280
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:22.750
<v Speaker 4>and this is a nice psg Eddie of</v>
<v Speaker 4>viewpoint because you know,</v>

1281
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:26.230
<v Speaker 4>in some sense what Piaget says about</v>
<v Speaker 4>children is they sort of organize</v>

1282
01:06:26.231 --> 01:06:28.810
<v Speaker 4>themselves from the spinal level</v>
<v Speaker 4>upwards.</v>

1283
01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.940
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they learn these little sub routines.</v>

1284
01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.850
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a few sub routines.</v>

1285
01:06:32.851 --> 01:06:36.670
<v Speaker 4>So is it like built right into the spine</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they start playing with those</v>

1286
01:06:36.671 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 4>and chaining them together in flexible</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways and they keep doing that,</v>

1287
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in more and more complex ways until</v>

1288
01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:45.730
<v Speaker 4>they're capable of the abstract</v>
<v Speaker 4>representation of thought.</v>

1289
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.820
<v Speaker 4>And you can see how this will work as we</v>
<v Speaker 4>go through the,</v>

1290
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:52.870
<v Speaker 4>the nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your brains in your body,</v>

1291
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.830
<v Speaker 4>in fact there's some evidence and there</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's more than one kind of nervous</v>

1292
01:06:56.831 --> 01:06:57.521
<v Speaker 4>system too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1293
01:06:57.521 --> 01:07:01.870
<v Speaker 4>There's the central nervous system that</v>
<v Speaker 4>allows you to move voluntarily and that</v>

1294
01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:04.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>provides you with sensory feedback,</v>

1295
01:07:04.601 --> 01:07:07.480
<v Speaker 4>some of which you're conscious of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's also the autonomic nervous</v>

1296
01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:10.420
<v Speaker 4>system that runs your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the complex machinery that you're</v>

1297
01:07:10.421 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 4>too stupid to attend to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1298
01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:15.310
<v Speaker 4>cause your consciousness gets little</v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs.</v>

1299
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.800
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't get to run your liver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>

1300
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:20.620
<v Speaker 4>You imagine what your life would be like</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were in charge of your liver.</v>

1301
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like you'd have been dead years ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause what do you know about livers?</v>

1302
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:27.550
<v Speaker 4>So you have a whole system like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>autonomic nervous system,</v>

1303
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.450
<v Speaker 4>which has more neurons than the central</v>
<v Speaker 4>nervous system that just runs all that</v>

1304
01:07:31.451 --> 01:07:33.130
<v Speaker 4>stuff for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1305
01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:34.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good thing you do and then you don't</v>

1306
01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:36.650
<v Speaker 4>have to pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1307
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.470
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of distribution of neural</v>

1308
01:07:41.471 --> 01:07:44.440
<v Speaker 4>tissue throughout your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's even some evidence that you</v>

1309
01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:49.441
<v Speaker 4>have a like a second brain of sorts in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your solar plexus where you know,</v>

1310
01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.540
<v Speaker 4>that's perhaps part of the reason why</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really don't like to get hit there.</v>

1311
01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:55.510
<v Speaker 4>But there's a tremendous number of</v>
<v Speaker 4>serotonergic neurons,</v>

1312
01:07:55.511 --> 01:07:56.470
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your,</v>

1313
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:59.410
<v Speaker 4>in your midsection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's increasing evidence that</v>

1314
01:07:59.411 --> 01:08:02.140
<v Speaker 4>those are associated with things like</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion and mood.</v>

1315
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:06.310
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea that the brain is here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1316
01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 4>mm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1317
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.880
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really.</v>

1318
01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:11.320
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a continuum.</v>

1319
01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body is a psychophysiological</v>

1320
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:17.960
<v Speaker 4>entity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to separate it into body and mind is</v>

1321
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not right.</v>

1322
01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:25.400
<v Speaker 4>The other thing that seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>increasingly clear among the say the</v>

1323
01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.220
<v Speaker 4>robotics guys is you can't even be smart</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you have a body.</v>

1324
01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:33.670
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why the advanced advanced</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence guys are building robots</v>

1325
01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:36.980
<v Speaker 4>from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing it just like piaget would</v>

1326
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:38.060
<v Speaker 4>have suggested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1327
01:08:38.061 --> 01:08:41.570
<v Speaker 4>well build some things that can move and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then chain those things that can move</v>

1328
01:08:41.571 --> 01:08:44.780
<v Speaker 4>together so that they can move in more</v>
<v Speaker 4>complex ways and then chain them</v>

1329
01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 4>together so they can work in more</v>
<v Speaker 4>complex ways.</v>

1330
01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.580
<v Speaker 4>And once you've got this thing that can</v>
<v Speaker 4>do things,</v>

1331
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:53.510
<v Speaker 4>then stick a brain on it and that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it'll have things that can do with</v>

1332
01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:55.460
<v Speaker 4>its brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't do it that way,</v>

1333
01:08:55.461 --> 01:08:58.580
<v Speaker 4>you get something that can't function</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligently.</v>

1334
01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:01.170
<v Speaker 4>It's close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1335
01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:07.530
<v Speaker 4>so there is the brain and the major one</v>
<v Speaker 4>way of dividing it into its major</v>

1336
01:09:08.151 --> 01:09:10.010
<v Speaker 4>subcomponents is represented.</v>

1337
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 4>There's a variety of ways you can do</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1338
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:13.730
<v Speaker 4>You can divide it into hemispheres</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's sort of split down the</v>

1339
01:09:13.731 --> 01:09:16.190
<v Speaker 4>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The right hemisphere seems to be kind of</v>

1340
01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:20.120
<v Speaker 4>specialized for the processing of</v>
<v Speaker 4>unknown information.</v>

1341
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:25.040
<v Speaker 4>And the left seems to be more</v>
<v Speaker 4>comfortable working where you know</v>

1342
01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:29.300
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen and that the left</v>
<v Speaker 4>is most generally the linguistic part of</v>

1343
01:09:29.301 --> 01:09:30.500
<v Speaker 4>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although not always,</v>

1344
01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:31.580
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a rough,</v>

1345
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:33.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would you call it?</v>

1346
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:37.520
<v Speaker 4>It's a rough truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of exceptions.</v>

1347
01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:41.870
<v Speaker 4>The linguistic system tends to</v>
<v Speaker 4>specialize in the left and the left</v>

1348
01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.870
<v Speaker 4>sorta insists that it knows what's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1349
01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.590
<v Speaker 4>And the right is always looking out for</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that don't fit and sort of</v>

1350
01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.910
<v Speaker 4>convincing the left slowly and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>under the table to change its</v>

1351
01:09:52.911 --> 01:09:54.080
<v Speaker 4>viewpoints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that seemed,</v>

1352
01:09:54.081 --> 01:09:56.360
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that seems to happen when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're asleep and you're dreaming.</v>

1353
01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 4>So the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe what's happening when you're</v>

1354
01:09:58.941 --> 01:10:02.630
<v Speaker 4>dreaming is that during the day your</v>
<v Speaker 4>cognitive processes are pretty tight and</v>

1355
01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:07.100
<v Speaker 4>defined and they better be right because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to be dreaming your</v>

1356
01:10:07.101 --> 01:10:09.770
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia dreams in the daytime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad idea.</v>

1357
01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.690
<v Speaker 4>So you gotta stay kind of focused and</v>
<v Speaker 4>narrow in a way during the day.</v>

1358
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:19.040
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with that narrowed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>narrow focus is that you're not paying</v>

1359
01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:21.980
<v Speaker 4>attention to a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it kind of looks like your right</v>

1360
01:10:21.981 --> 01:10:25.370
<v Speaker 4>hemisphere keeps track of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially important things that you're</v>

1361
01:10:25.371 --> 01:10:29.540
<v Speaker 4>not keeping track of and sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then at night you're,</v>

1362
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:32.450
<v Speaker 4>you're category system sort of broadens</v>
<v Speaker 4>and loosens.</v>

1363
01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:34.490
<v Speaker 4>You can tell that in dreams because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so weird.</v>

1364
01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:38.360
<v Speaker 4>And that's maybe when the right</v>
<v Speaker 4>hemisphere is sort of tapping some new</v>

1365
01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:42.620
<v Speaker 4>information into the left and playing</v>
<v Speaker 4>without how it might be recategorized</v>

1366
01:10:42.621 --> 01:10:45.650
<v Speaker 4>without completely overwhelming the left</v>
<v Speaker 4>because</v>

1367
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.820
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just because you learn something new,</v>

1368
01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:51.710
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean you want to upset</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

1369
01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:52.461
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1370
01:10:52.461 --> 01:10:56.450
<v Speaker 4>So it's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a real complex dynamic between</v>

1371
01:10:56.451 --> 01:10:58.850
<v Speaker 4>stability and learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's conceivable.</v>

1372
01:10:58.851 --> 01:11:02.090
<v Speaker 4>That's why you have two hemispheres.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So who knows?</v>

1373
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.360
<v Speaker 4>It's good theory though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] the guy who came up with it</v>

1374
01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.130
<v Speaker 4>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his name is Goldberg,</v>

1375
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:09.610
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alconan Goldberg,</v>

1376
01:11:09.611 --> 01:11:13.070
<v Speaker 4>and he was a student of Alexander Luria</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was a great neuropsychologist.</v>

1377
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.921
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1378
01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:15.300
<v Speaker 4>it's a credible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's credible idea.</v>

1379
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:20.390
<v Speaker 4>So here's some rough divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got your cerebellum,</v>

1380
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.330
<v Speaker 4>that Cerebellum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't know what the hell that thing</v>

1381
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have one,</v>

1382
01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:28.770
<v Speaker 4>you get all wobbly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's more neurons in the</v>

1383
01:11:28.771 --> 01:11:31.110
<v Speaker 4>cerebellum and then there are in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of the brain.</v>

1384
01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:34.230
<v Speaker 4>So like is it just making you not</v>
<v Speaker 4>wobbly?</v>

1385
01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 4>It seems like a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 4>devotion of resources to something</v>

1386
01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.370
<v Speaker 4>that's relatively simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1387
01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:42.811
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>

1388
01:11:42.811 --> 01:11:45.270
<v Speaker 4>when you're a new drinker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol's really hard than the</v>

1389
01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:46.590
<v Speaker 4>Cerebellum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why you're,</v>

1390
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally useless in a motorway and you</v>

1391
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:51.240
<v Speaker 4>fall down and all those things happened.</v>

1392
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.890
<v Speaker 4>But so that's the cerebellum and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know what it does even though it's</v>

1393
01:11:55.891 --> 01:11:58.350
<v Speaker 4>very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lee Branch did kind of looks like a</v>

1394
01:11:58.351 --> 01:12:00.510
<v Speaker 4>cauliflower and it's just packed full of</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurons.</v>

1395
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:04.770
<v Speaker 4>And then there's the occipital lobe and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of use that to see with more</v>

1396
01:12:04.771 --> 01:12:07.170
<v Speaker 4>or less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the prior lobe kind of keeps,</v>

1397
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:11.640
<v Speaker 4>helps keep track of who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who you are from a bodily perspective</v>

1398
01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:15.870
<v Speaker 4>and sort of where your body's located in</v>
<v Speaker 4>space and sort of who you are as an</v>

1399
01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 4>embodied person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1400
01:12:17.491 --> 01:12:19.620
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you lose the right parietal lobe</v>

1401
01:12:19.621 --> 01:12:22.140
<v Speaker 4>because you have a stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you lose the left side of your</v>

1402
01:12:22.141 --> 01:12:25.650
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even more weirdly you lose the left</v>

1403
01:12:25.651 --> 01:12:28.530
<v Speaker 4>side of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So all of a sudden you can't see the</v>

1404
01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:31.950
<v Speaker 4>left side of it anything and no one can</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out what that's like.</v>

1405
01:12:31.951 --> 01:12:36.951
<v Speaker 4>Because say I'm looking at this room and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this pridal damage.</v>

1406
01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:40.110
<v Speaker 4>If I'm looking at the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I not see the left side of the room?</v>

1407
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:43.110
<v Speaker 4>And then if I look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden I don't see your left</v>

1408
01:12:43.111 --> 01:12:44.730
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we can't figure that out.</v>

1409
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:49.380
<v Speaker 4>Like the left is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then the left is relative to where</v>

1410
01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:51.960
<v Speaker 4>you happened to be looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think one of the ways of</v>

1411
01:12:51.961 --> 01:12:55.410
<v Speaker 4>understanding it is sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know how you clearly can't see</v>

1412
01:12:55.411 --> 01:12:59.820
<v Speaker 4>anything behind your head and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>black where you can't see,</v>

1413
01:12:59.821 --> 01:13:01.410
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's black if you close your eyes.</v>

1414
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.360
<v Speaker 4>But there's a difference between what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't see behind your head and the</v>

1415
01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:09.540
<v Speaker 4>black you see when you close your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause the block sort of seems like</v>

1416
01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:12.030
<v Speaker 4>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but compared to what's behind your head,</v>

1417
01:13:12.031 --> 01:13:13.800
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not nothing at all.</v>

1418
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:16.140
<v Speaker 4>So I think what happens with people who</v>
<v Speaker 4>have neglect,</v>

1419
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.070
<v Speaker 4>periodontal damages that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like back park just goes like this.</v>

1420
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:25.200
<v Speaker 4>And so instead of you seeing this much</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world and this being just not</v>

1421
01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:27.090
<v Speaker 4>there at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as vision is concerned,</v>

1422
01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.020
<v Speaker 4>it goes like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you've only got like a</v>

1423
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.240
<v Speaker 4>quarter of the world that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so people like that,</v>

1424
01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.520
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they'll throw their own legs</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of bed,</v>

1425
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:37.950
<v Speaker 4>they wake up and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1426
01:13:37.951 --> 01:13:40.320
<v Speaker 4>because they can kind of detect the left</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not very well.</v>

1427
01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.330
<v Speaker 4>And they're quite freaked out because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1428
01:13:42.331 --> 01:13:44.490
<v Speaker 4>like do you really want to wake up with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a laying in bed with,</v>

1429
01:13:44.491 --> 01:13:46.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they grab it and throw it out and</v>

1430
01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:48.720
<v Speaker 4>that's not so good because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>attached to it.</v>

1431
01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.800
<v Speaker 4>Or so they'll eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll eat and they only eat half the</v>

1432
01:13:52.801 --> 01:13:54.800
<v Speaker 4>food on their plate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you turn the plate didn't delete</v>

1433
01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.360
<v Speaker 4>half of the half that's left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

1434
01:13:57.390 --> 01:14:02.390
<v Speaker 4>that's the prior little temporal lobe</v>
<v Speaker 4>that enables you to here roughly</v>

1435
01:14:03.661 --> 01:14:06.390
<v Speaker 4>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of memory there too.</v>

1436
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:08.250
<v Speaker 4>And the frontal lobe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1437
01:14:08.251 --> 01:14:10.620
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the frontal lobe seems to allow you to</v>

1438
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:15.740
<v Speaker 4>make voluntary movements sort of at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the highest level of abstraction.</v>

1439
01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:20.110
<v Speaker 4>And then the prefrontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would be right at the front of the</v>

1440
01:14:20.111 --> 01:14:23.520
<v Speaker 4>yellow there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of like the back part of the,</v>

1441
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:26.740
<v Speaker 4>of the frontal lobe enables you to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>voluntary movements,</v>

1442
01:14:26.741 --> 01:14:31.630
<v Speaker 4>but the prefrontal cortex enables you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>represent the potential motor movements</v>

1443
01:14:31.631 --> 01:14:34.000
<v Speaker 4>that you might make before you implement</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1444
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.750
<v Speaker 4>And so any evolved out of the motor</v>
<v Speaker 4>strip during the course of evolution,</v>

1445
01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:39.460
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well first you learn how to act</v>

1446
01:14:39.461 --> 01:14:41.590
<v Speaker 4>voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then as that grew,</v>

1447
01:14:41.591 --> 01:14:43.690
<v Speaker 4>and it's particularly big in human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings,</v>

1448
01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.890
<v Speaker 4>that part was able to divorce actions</v>
<v Speaker 4>from your body,</v>

1449
01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 4>represent them in an abstract space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>run the MS simulations,</v>

1450
01:14:53.801 --> 01:14:56.950
<v Speaker 4>calculate the outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then implement them or not.</v>

1451
01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:57.611
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1452
01:14:57.611 --> 01:15:00.130
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a hit and miss business because</v>

1453
01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:05.460
<v Speaker 4>lots of you people undoubtedly simulate</v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic outcomes and then go do</v>

1454
01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:07.710
<v Speaker 4>whatever it gives you were going to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyways.</v>

1455
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:08.390
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1456
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:11.560
<v Speaker 4>that happens to people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say when they're trying to stop drinking</v>

1457
01:15:11.561 --> 01:15:14.350
<v Speaker 4>or to stop using cocaine or not to be in</v>
<v Speaker 4>jeet or,</v>

1458
01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:18.860
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your prefrontal Cortex can whip up these</v>

1459
01:15:18.861 --> 01:15:21.760
<v Speaker 4>simulations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but other parts of your body can</v>

1460
01:15:21.761 --> 01:15:23.800
<v Speaker 4>override them quite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quite badly.</v>

1461
01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.350
<v Speaker 4>So that's sort of roughly the brain at</v>
<v Speaker 4>least from,</v>

1462
01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:30.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at it from the side and then</v>

1463
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:35.730
<v Speaker 4>this is it split down the middle and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can see that it's not precisely two</v>

1464
01:15:36.791 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 4>hemispheres all the way down</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the middle.</v>

1465
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.790
<v Speaker 4>It's one thing and then it grows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These two things like little hat and uh,</v>

1466
01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 4>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the important parts of the brain are</v>

1467
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:53.050
<v Speaker 4>low down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>central,</v>

1468
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:54.610
<v Speaker 4>old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1469
01:15:54.611 --> 01:15:56.650
<v Speaker 4>because people like to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1470
01:15:56.651 --> 01:15:58.180
<v Speaker 4>if they're doing evolved a long time</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

1471
01:15:58.181 --> 01:15:59.014
<v Speaker 4>it's primitive.</v>

1472
01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:00.813
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1473
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.950
<v Speaker 4>if it evolved a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been around a long time.</v>

1474
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.310
<v Speaker 4>It's really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you don't run your liver.</v>

1475
01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:13.150
<v Speaker 4>The autonomic nervous system runs it</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's been around for an awful</v>

1476
01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:15.250
<v Speaker 4>long time and it knows exactly how to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1477
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.190
<v Speaker 4>And so it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sense the new parts of the</v>

1478
01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:21.880
<v Speaker 4>brains are the brain in many ways are</v>
<v Speaker 4>the parts that are primitive.</v>

1479
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.290
<v Speaker 4>So in the old parts are extremely</v>
<v Speaker 4>necessary and sophisticated.</v>

1480
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:29.620
<v Speaker 4>And so the areas we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on most,</v>

1481
01:16:29.621 --> 01:16:32.590
<v Speaker 4>particularly our or the Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've already talked about,</v>

1482
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:35.140
<v Speaker 4>the cortex is probably responsible.</v>

1483
01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:40.030
<v Speaker 4>People like to think of it as</v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible for consciousness and there</v>

1484
01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.680
<v Speaker 4>there's something about that that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1485
01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:46.710
<v Speaker 4>But it's quite clear that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 4>can remain conscious even if they have a</v>

1486
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:51.250
<v Speaker 4>substantial amount of damage to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cerebral cortex.</v>

1487
01:16:51.251 --> 01:16:55.720
<v Speaker 4>So consciousness is a really weird thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>where we're not very good at figuring</v>

1488
01:16:55.721 --> 01:16:59.890
<v Speaker 4>out where it's localized at all</v>
<v Speaker 4>cerebral cortex,</v>

1489
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:03.790
<v Speaker 4>Thalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Thalamus is the place where all your</v>

1490
01:17:03.791 --> 01:17:06.490
<v Speaker 4>sensory information comes together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

1491
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.980
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like a continuum.</v>

1492
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.650
<v Speaker 4>I've experienced despite the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have these five different sensory</v>

1493
01:17:12.651 --> 01:17:17.651
<v Speaker 4>inputs and the Thalamus seems to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>unite all that and then it sends the</v>

1494
01:17:17.931 --> 01:17:22.340
<v Speaker 4>messages that it amalgamates up to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cortex and the cortex sends to the back</v>

1495
01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:26.330
<v Speaker 4>and the Thalamus sends them back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's like this loop between the</v>

1496
01:17:26.331 --> 01:17:27.830
<v Speaker 4>fellows and the CORTEX.</v>

1497
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.680
<v Speaker 4>And maybe that's part of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness is,</v>

1498
01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:33.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than being localized in an area,</v>

1499
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 4>it could easily be a process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1500
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.690
<v Speaker 4>the fact that consciousness sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>turns on in the morning,</v>

1501
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:41.990
<v Speaker 4>which is a very weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seems to indicate to me that it,</v>

1502
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:44.330
<v Speaker 4>it's probably something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a loop.</v>

1503
01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:47.510
<v Speaker 4>It's the looping interaction between</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain areas and you know,</v>

1504
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 4>if something's looping like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets really weird properties.</v>

1505
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.240
<v Speaker 4>So that's a positive feedback system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1506
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:57.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've ever turned a</v>
<v Speaker 4>vid,</v>

1507
01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:01.100
<v Speaker 4>hooked a video camera to a TV and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn the video camera on the TV.</v>

1508
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.590
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts doing extremely weird things.</v>

1509
01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:08.510
<v Speaker 4>You can get all sorts of unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 4>complex designs and weird phenomena</v>

1510
01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.330
<v Speaker 4>because the TV is recycling its own</v>
<v Speaker 4>signal.</v>

1511
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.040
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's this circuit in there that's</v>

1512
01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:18.041
<v Speaker 4>looping and I suspect consciousness is</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that of the hippocampus.</v>

1513
01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.280
<v Speaker 4>The hippocampus is responsible for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>movement of short term information into</v>

1514
01:18:24.411 --> 01:18:26.750
<v Speaker 4>longterm storage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very important part of the brain.</v>

1515
01:18:26.751 --> 01:18:30.770
<v Speaker 4>We'll talk about that more next time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The amygdala is responsible for a lot of</v>

1516
01:18:30.771 --> 01:18:35.720
<v Speaker 4>emotional responses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the hypothalamus is responsible for</v>

1517
01:18:35.721 --> 01:18:38.360
<v Speaker 4>a lot of primordial motivational states.</v>

1518
01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:46.500
<v Speaker 4>And so we'll stop and we'll start with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hypothalamus on Tuesday.</v>

1519
01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:48.730
<v Speaker 4>See you soon.</v>
