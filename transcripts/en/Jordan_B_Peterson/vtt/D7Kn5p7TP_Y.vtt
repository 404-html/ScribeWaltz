1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.823
<v Speaker 2>well we're going to continue our </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion of the big five traits today </v>

3
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to talk to you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>openness and intelligence,</v>

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.833
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I want to do is put </v>

5
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:27.504
<v Speaker 2>them into context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to understand where </v>

6
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:34.761
<v Speaker 2>intelligence fits in the in the trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy structure and so we've,</v>

7
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.713
<v Speaker 2>we've looked at this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can break the big five into the </v>

8
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:40.764
<v Speaker 2>big to plasticity and stability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll start with stability here and </v>

9
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:46.524
<v Speaker 2>stable people are conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high and stress tolerance or emotional </v>

10
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 2>stability or low in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you look at it and high</v>

11
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.554
<v Speaker 2>in agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then conscientiousness breaks down into </v>

12
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.324
<v Speaker 2>industriousness and orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neuroticism breaks down into volatility </v>

13
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 2>and withdrawal and agreeableness breaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>down into politeness and compassion.</v>

14
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 2>And then for the second major trait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the big two trait.</v>

15
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 2>You have plasticity and plasticity is </v>
<v Speaker 2>made up of extraversion and openness and</v>

16
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 2>those look like the reason they clumped </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

17
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.583
<v Speaker 2>The reason the first three clump </v>
<v Speaker 2>together we think is because they're </v>

18
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 2>roughly associated with serotonergic </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

19
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.853
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason the latter two clump </v>

20
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 2>together is because they're roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with dopaminergic function.</v>

21
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.394
<v Speaker 2>And the dopamine system mediates </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploratory behavior in the face of the </v>

22
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 2>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also mediates positive emotion.</v>

23
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.143
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's because in order to move </v>

24
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:45.414
<v Speaker 2>forward into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't that you have to experience </v>

25
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:49.464
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that the emotion you experience </v>

26
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.254
<v Speaker 2>when you're motivated to move forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the unknown and explore is a </v>

27
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:55.374
<v Speaker 2>positive emotion and positive emotion is</v>
<v Speaker 2>very much also associated with </v>

28
00:01:58.771 --> 00:01:59.604
<v Speaker 2>interaction in the social environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's because a tremendous </v>

29
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:03.624
<v Speaker 2>amount of what you're doing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>social environment is essentially </v>

30
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 2>exploratory behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

31
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:08.364
<v Speaker 2>Because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're communicating with people </v>

32
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.580
<v Speaker 2>that's primarily exploratory behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

33
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 2>so it's not surprising that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuitry overlaps and in that manner,</v>

34
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.693
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openness is the one we're going to </v>

35
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on most particularly today.</v>

36
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.883
<v Speaker 2>And it is openness to experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically and it seems to break down </v>

37
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 2>into intellect and openness proper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

38
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 2>it's in its intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is interested in ideas,</v>

39
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 2>maybe facility with ideas and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>openness,</v>

40
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 2>which is more like creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

41
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:41.214
<v Speaker 2>that's now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't divide them into interest in </v>

42
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 2>ideas and creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So precisely because they,</v>

43
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 2>they overlapped to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a great degree.</v>

44
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.963
<v Speaker 2>But there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is reason for differentiating </v>

45
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 2>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

46
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.703
<v Speaker 2>women are about a third of a standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>deviation higher than men in openness </v>

47
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.454
<v Speaker 2>slash creativity and men are about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>third of a standard deviation higher </v>

48
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 2>than women in interest in ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellect.</v>

49
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually quite a substantial </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference within a trait.</v>

50
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 2>That's when the two traits are so highly</v>
<v Speaker 2>correlated.</v>

51
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's reason to do the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do the fractionation.</v>

52
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.403
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to concentrate on </v>

53
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:21.154
<v Speaker 2>openness today and the reason that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>presenting the trait description first </v>

54
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:26.434
<v Speaker 2>rather than moving immediately into say </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq and creativity is because it's </v>

55
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 2>reasonable to.</v>

56
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.893
<v Speaker 2>It's useful to know that you can take </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and put it in the big five </v>

57
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.723
<v Speaker 2>taxonomy and you can actually measure </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence a lot more accurately with </v>

58
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.374
<v Speaker 2>an Iq test and perhaps also with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity test than you can with the </v>

59
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.424
<v Speaker 2>self report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Personality tests that relies on </v>

60
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:47.651
<v Speaker 2>adjectives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 2>because I could ask you guys how smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>are you on a scale of one to seven?</v>

62
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And that would be roughly correlated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your Iq.</v>

63
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 2>But if I really wanted to know how smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

64
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.363
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be much better to give you an </v>

65
00:03:58.511 --> 00:03:59.344
<v Speaker 2>Iq test and if I was wanting to know how</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative you are rather than asking you </v>

66
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 2>how creative you are and getting you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>report,</v>

67
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 2>even though there would be some accuracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

68
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.253
<v Speaker 2>it would be better actually to give you </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the different tests of </v>

69
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>creativity that we'll talk about today.</v>

70
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.503
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weird thing about the big five are </v>

71
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the weird things about it is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have great tests for the traits</v>

72
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 2>independently of self report for almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the traits.</v>

73
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:24.364
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I've been trying </v>

74
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:27.934
<v Speaker 2>to do in my lab for the last five years </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to find some sort of laboratory task </v>

75
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 2>that conscientious people do better on </v>
<v Speaker 2>or unconscientious people do worse on.</v>

76
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 2>And you'd think that would be simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>because conscientiousness,</v>

77
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.894
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very good predictor of longterm </v>

78
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 2>life success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Success.</v>

79
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 2>It's also a very good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>university grades.</v>

80
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not as good as Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still a good predictor.</v>

81
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.763
<v Speaker 2>But we have had one insanely difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>time trying to find a non self report </v>

82
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 2>test that associate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

83
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 2>that actually predicts </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness.</v>

84
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 2>So much appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

85
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's neuroticism.</v>

86
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Neuroticism is associated with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>more self aware and it's actually,</v>

87
00:05:14.451 --> 00:05:15.284
<v Speaker 2>it loads on negative emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so being self conscious as associated </v>

88
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:18.424
<v Speaker 2>with being high in negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can assess neuroticism using </v>

89
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 2>tests that that asks you about anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>and emotional pain or depression,</v>

90
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 2>but that's also not much different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>than than self report.</v>

91
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.013
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna concentrate on openness </v>

92
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:33.844
<v Speaker 2>today and we're going to concentrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>both on creativity and intelligence and </v>

93
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.683
<v Speaker 2>there's actually almost nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology that's more contentious </v>

94
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the investigations into the,</v>

95
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.453
<v Speaker 2>the technical or the what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the set of skills and abilities that </v>

96
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>falls under trade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openness.</v>

97
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:51.154
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is especially the case with </v>

98
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.823
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that intelligence is actually quite </v>

99
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.823
<v Speaker 2>measurable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been able to measure it since </v>

100
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.070
<v Speaker 2>roughly the beginning of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

101
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 2>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been a originated the first,</v>

102
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.323
<v Speaker 2>I would say reliable and valid Iq tests </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've been used quite extensively </v>

103
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:16.170
<v Speaker 2>for a long period of time and ICU.</v>

104
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what Iq is as we go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this,</v>

105
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:19.934
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't anything that social </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists have been able to measure </v>

106
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:27.911
<v Speaker 2>more successfully than Iq and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing that social or very little one.</v>

107
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.653
<v Speaker 2>There's one exception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The relationship between income </v>

108
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:33.734
<v Speaker 2>inequality and male homicide is a power </v>
<v Speaker 2>more powerful relationship than the </v>

109
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.223
<v Speaker 2>relationship between Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in general life success or Icu and </v>

110
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.470
<v Speaker 2>general school success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

111
00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:44.304
<v Speaker 2>It's even a little stronger than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between Iq and the rate at </v>

112
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 2>which you learn something new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but other than that,</v>

113
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty slim pickings and so we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna walk through very carefully how Iq</v>

114
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 2>his Iq tests are created and formulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and exactly what it is that they measure</v>

115
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:01.604
<v Speaker 2>and why and will equate that to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree to creativity and also </v>

116
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:05.924
<v Speaker 2>differentiated from creativity as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making the assumption that the aspects </v>

117
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>of openness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellect,</v>

118
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:11.534
<v Speaker 2>and openness proper are the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects and that they're usefully </v>

119
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.273
<v Speaker 2>differentiated.</v>

120
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.833
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing that you might want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to consider is that the world is a very </v>

121
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:22.214
<v Speaker 2>complicated place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've talked about this before and </v>

122
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 2>the way that you handled this way too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much complexity for you to handle in its</v>

123
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 2>in its entirety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

124
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.143
<v Speaker 2>in a room like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an endless number of phenomena </v>

125
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:37.184
<v Speaker 2>that you could focus your attention on </v>
<v Speaker 2>right from the sort of macro phenomenon </v>

126
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:41.504
<v Speaker 2>which would be the overall say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>color or appearance of the room to the </v>

127
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:44.804
<v Speaker 2>micro phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be the details at the </v>

128
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:47.714
<v Speaker 2>highest level of detail that you're able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to perceive that litter the landscape </v>

129
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the problems that you have</v>

130
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 2>to solve when you're operating in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is how you perceive the world.</v>

131
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.433
<v Speaker 2>And we do that in part by making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that we perceive low </v>

132
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:01.784
<v Speaker 2>resolution representations of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we also confuse those with the </v>

133
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

134
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.803
<v Speaker 2>So when I'm looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really looking at a low represent </v>

135
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 2>what I perceived consciously as a low </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation,</v>

136
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 2>low resolution representations of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

137
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I only see the front of you to begin </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

138
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I only see your surface and in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>

139
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:20.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even perceive you in some sense as a </v>

140
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:25.390
<v Speaker 2>more or less uniform color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell exactly what color his</v>

141
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 2>skin is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of a light pink,</v>

142
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:29.190
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my,</v>

143
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.173
<v Speaker 2>my perception is fairly is fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know a better way of putting it </v>

144
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:34.394
<v Speaker 2>than low resolution and I seem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive you at the level of resolution </v>

145
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 2>that's sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the lowest resolution.</v>

146
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:43.993
<v Speaker 2>That's sufficient to facilitate our </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions because I don't want to </v>

147
00:08:47.331 --> 00:08:51.190
<v Speaker 2>clutter up my perceptions of you when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking with excess details,</v>

148
00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:53.210
<v Speaker 2>so there's lots of things about you I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't need to see.</v>

149
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.043
<v Speaker 2>I certainly can't see any of your micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>below the below the phenomenal level </v>

150
00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:59.304
<v Speaker 2>like I can't tell without tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>further investigation what you're made </v>

151
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 2>of biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

152
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:05.154
<v Speaker 2>and I certainly can't perceive the </v>
<v Speaker 2>networks of society that you're engaged </v>

153
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 2>in your family or the other sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>networks that you're embedded in.</v>

154
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.623
<v Speaker 2>I see you here now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the front of you at low resolution and </v>

155
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:17.394
<v Speaker 2>you can tell that to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've talked about this before </v>

156
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:20.334
<v Speaker 2>because if you see say animated movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that use very low resolution </v>

157
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 2>representations of people like South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Park's a really good example because the</v>

158
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:34.041
<v Speaker 2>imitate or the animation in South Park's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very iconic and and and simple.</v>

159
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 2>It actually makes almost no difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>to following the story and so that shows</v>

160
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you how iconic your perception really </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

161
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 2>can be replaced by very simple icons and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you instantly adapt to that,</v>

162
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:46.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we can go and see the lego movie </v>

163
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Batman Lego movie for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that it's Batman,</v>

164
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:52.074
<v Speaker 2>which is an abstraction to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's made out of Legos is </v>

165
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 2>almost irrelevant to following the plot.</v>

166
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.393
<v Speaker 2>So some people have compared our </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptions to the user interface on a </v>

167
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:00.834
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you're interacting with </v>

168
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 2>your computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really interact,</v>

169
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.913
<v Speaker 2>so to speak with the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are iconic representations on the </v>

170
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 2>screen of the computer that you interact</v>
<v Speaker 2>with and those represent,</v>

171
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.850
<v Speaker 2>obviously they share some functional </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with what's going on in the</v>

172
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:15.684
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mostly they're there so that you </v>

173
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.863
<v Speaker 2>using your perceptual structures can </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with the computer in a manner </v>

174
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:23.850
<v Speaker 2>that's easy for extremely intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>apes,</v>

175
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.283
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the problems that you have to </v>

176
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:28.254
<v Speaker 2>solve in the world because it's so full </v>
<v Speaker 2>of detail and so complex is how do you </v>

177
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 2>actually see the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you actually perceive it,</v>

178
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.843
<v Speaker 2>and it isn't really self evident that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem because you think when </v>

179
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you look at the world that it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>presents itself to you,</v>

180
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's a tremendously complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and that's partly why developing</v>

181
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.873
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence systems that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually see the world and act in it in </v>

182
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:52.494
<v Speaker 2>any real way has proved to be a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more difficult problem than people had </v>

183
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:56.290
<v Speaker 2>originally suppose.</v>

184
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.143
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were told maybe from the early </v>

185
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:04.461
<v Speaker 2>sixties onwards that such things as </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech to text or object recognition,</v>

186
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.800
<v Speaker 2>recognition or robots that could operate</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

187
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 2>We're only two or three years away and </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

188
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a situation now where there are</v>

189
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:13.794
<v Speaker 2>some fairly complicated robots built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're still really in their </v>

190
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:17.034
<v Speaker 2>nascent form and it's because perceiving</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and then figuring out how to </v>

191
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:20.244
<v Speaker 2>act and it turns out to be a much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated problem than we originally </v>

192
00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:24.174
<v Speaker 2>thought because the borders between </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are not self evident and what </v>

193
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:28.764
<v Speaker 2>level of resolution you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceiving things at for say maximal </v>

194
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:34.350
<v Speaker 2>functional utility is also not self </v>
<v Speaker 2>evident.</v>

195
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.420
<v Speaker 2>It's also tied up very strangely and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways we don't understand with the nature</v>

196
00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:40.710
<v Speaker 2>of your embodiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

197
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:41.544
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to see things that are handy </v>

198
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:45.803
<v Speaker 2>because we can pick them up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate them and we can make use of </v>

199
00:11:48.361 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

200
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.343
<v Speaker 2>And so to some degree our brains are </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved to make the world manifest </v>

201
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 2>itself to us in a set of discrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usable tools.</v>

202
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.473
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a reasonable way of thinking </v>

203
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:00.154
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are discrete and usable </v>

204
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 2>because we have a certain kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological platform,</v>

205
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:05.164
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have hands and mouths and </v>

206
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 2>because we walk in a bipedal manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's logical for us to break up the</v>

207
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>world in a manner that makes operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this body maximally useful.</v>

208
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.993
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>straightforward one to one relationship </v>

209
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 2>between our perceptions of things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things themselves.</v>

210
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly,</v>

211
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 2>of course we know that because with any </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptible object,</v>

212
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 2>like I could conceptualize you as one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for all sorts of purposes.</v>

213
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm trying to solve a complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem in relationship to you,</v>

214
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine how to conceptualize you.</v>

215
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.343
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you come to me because you're </v>

216
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 2>suffering from a psychological problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>of some sort,</v>

217
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 2>then I have to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

218
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 2>is it organic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

219
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:50.314
<v Speaker 2>is there's actually something </v>
<v Speaker 2>physiological wrong with you and I need </v>

220
00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 2>to know what level of analysis I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably conceptualize you out.</v>

221
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.010
<v Speaker 2>Is it psychological?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it.</v>

222
00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 2>And if it's psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it functional?</v>

223
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:00.874
<v Speaker 2>Like do you lack the skills or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack the ability to apply the skills or </v>

224
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 2>is there something really going wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your family,</v>

225
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it's even a reflection of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>overarching sociological problem.</v>

226
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 2>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

227
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:13.780
<v Speaker 2>that when the unemployment rate goes up </v>
<v Speaker 2>one percent,</v>

228
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:16.330
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric hospitalizations go up five </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>

229
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 2>and so then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

230
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're.</v>

231
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 2>If there's a huge rise in depression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety across the population and at the</v>

232
00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 2>same time there's a huge increase in </v>
<v Speaker 2>unemployment.</v>

233
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:32.130
<v Speaker 2>You have to ask yourself what level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception would best be suited to solve</v>

234
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:33.004
<v Speaker 2>that problem because it isn't self </v>
<v Speaker 2>evident that it's psychological at the </v>

235
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 2>level of the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

236
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:43.410
<v Speaker 2>My point is is that perception is a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult problem and so now here's.</v>

237
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Here's something interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think about this for a minute.</v>

238
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.540
<v Speaker 2>I went and saw an autistic woman speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>at one point.</v>

239
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Her name was temple grandin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's really worth looking up.</v>

240
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Temple Grandin is a very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

241
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.820
<v Speaker 2>She's very seriously autistic when she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a child,</v>

242
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 2>but her mother and her worked her out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it so that she could be,</v>

243
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.720
<v Speaker 2>she's very functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She works as a professor,</v>

244
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember where it's in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>midwest somewhere now.</v>

245
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:09.603
<v Speaker 2>She's famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only be for being a highly </v>

246
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:12.634
<v Speaker 2>functional autistic person who talks a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair bit about what it's like to be </v>

247
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:16.174
<v Speaker 2>autistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also for designing slaughterhouses </v>

248
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 2>across the United States.</v>

249
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.183
<v Speaker 2>And the reason she can do that as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's concerned is because she thinks </v>

250
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:27.640
<v Speaker 2>she thinks like an animal thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she doesn't.</v>

251
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.560
<v Speaker 2>And she's identified maybe at least part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what the core problem is with autism.</v>

252
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:33.723
<v Speaker 2>So she talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard her at was in Arizona and it </v>

253
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:37.640
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

254
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.940
<v Speaker 2>was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

255
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.093
<v Speaker 2>entrancing talk she sewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she showed some really interesting </v>

256
00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:43.294
<v Speaker 2>pictures of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what she's done is she's redesigned </v>

257
00:14:45.191 --> 00:14:47.940
<v Speaker 2>slaughter houses so that when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals enter the slaughterhouse,</v>

258
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 2>they go into like a spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>

259
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.450
<v Speaker 2>They can't see what's around the corner </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the walls are high,</v>

260
00:14:53.451 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 2>so they're not distracted by anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

261
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:57.560
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things she showed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

262
00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:58.394
<v Speaker 2>was a bunch of cows going through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard sequence of of gates </v>

263
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:03.344
<v Speaker 2>essentially and off to the side there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a windmill spinning and the cows </v>

264
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:09.290
<v Speaker 2>would stop because the windmill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't understand what the windmill</v>

265
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:10.124
<v Speaker 2>was and they'd stop or showed other </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures where cows were going down a </v>

266
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.700
<v Speaker 2>pathway to and there was a coke can </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in the middle of the pathway and</v>

267
00:15:16.701 --> 00:15:17.534
<v Speaker 2>the cows would all stop because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what to do with it or she </v>

268
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:21.194
<v Speaker 2>had another picture of cows out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the field all surrounding a </v>

269
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.064
<v Speaker 2>briefcase and they are all looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the briefcase and the cows didn't like </v>

270
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:30.530
<v Speaker 2>anything that shouldn't be there and had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hard time mapping it.</v>

271
00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Now she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

272
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.760
<v Speaker 2>here's a little exercise she did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

273
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 2>think of a church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

274
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:41.150
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you think you imagine a child's</v>
<v Speaker 2>drawing of a church.</v>

275
00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like your standard house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a pen tag Pentagon,</v>

276
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is basically how children draw the</v>

277
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:47.834
<v Speaker 2>front of a house with a steeple on top </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe a cross on top of it or </v>

278
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:52.610
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually isn't at church.</v>

279
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.533
<v Speaker 2>It's an icon of a church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think about how children draw </v>

280
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 2>houses too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pentagon,</v>

281
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.970
<v Speaker 2>rectangle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is a trapezoid chimney?</v>

282
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.400
<v Speaker 2>Almost always with smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite interesting.</v>

283
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:05.234
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where kids get that </v>

284
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:07.004
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they almost always draw a chimney </v>

285
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 2>with smoke even though chimneys with </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke aren't that common anymore.</v>

286
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.750
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you can see what a child's picture of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>house looks like in your imagination.</v>

288
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.983
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that you might want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about is that is not a picture of </v>

289
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 2>a house at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

290
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 2>It's an iconic representation that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda like a hero cliff because no house</v>

291
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:26.144
<v Speaker 2>looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you think about how a child </v>

292
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:29.450
<v Speaker 2>will draw a person circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick,</v>

293
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.021
<v Speaker 2>stick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick,</v>

294
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:30.854
<v Speaker 2>stick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick.</v>

295
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 2>And you show it to somebody to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a person.</v>

296
00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:34.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

297
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.720
<v Speaker 2>It looks nothing like a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

298
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.083
<v Speaker 2>I mean you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You immediately recognize it as a </v>

299
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it looks nothing like a person.</v>

300
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.153
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what grand and said was that when she </v>

301
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:47.000
<v Speaker 2>thinks of a church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has to think of a church.</v>

302
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.893
<v Speaker 2>She's seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She can't take the set of all churches </v>

303
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:56.420
<v Speaker 2>in abstract out an iconic representation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and use that to represent the set of all</v>

304
00:16:56.421 --> 00:16:57.310
<v Speaker 2>churches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has.</v>

305
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.273
<v Speaker 2>She gets fixated on a specific exemplar </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she thinks that one of the problems </v>

306
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:03.794
<v Speaker 2>with autistic people and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult time developing language </v>

307
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:08.204
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they can't abstract out a </v>

308
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.310
<v Speaker 2>generalized representation across a set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of entities.</v>

309
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.143
<v Speaker 2>They can't abstract and then they end </v>
<v Speaker 2>well and of course if you can abstract </v>

310
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:18.614
<v Speaker 2>and it's also very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate the abstractions and you see </v>

311
00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:23.420
<v Speaker 2>very strange behavior with autistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>children for example.</v>

312
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:24.254
<v Speaker 2>So they don't like people and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people don't stay in their </v>

313
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 2>perceptual boxes like a human being is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult thing to perceive because</v>

314
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:35.030
<v Speaker 2>we're always shifting around and moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing different things.</v>

315
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't stay in our categorical </v>
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>

316
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Autistic people have real trouble with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>

317
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 2>but they also have trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>

318
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:46.250
<v Speaker 2>if you're autistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>child gets accustomed to your kitchen,</v>

319
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.620
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you move a chair,</v>

320
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 2>then it especially if they're severely </v>
<v Speaker 2>autistic,</v>

321
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:52.404
<v Speaker 2>they'll have an absolute fit about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you think kitchen with chair </v>

322
00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:57.114
<v Speaker 2>moved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think completely different place </v>

323
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.003
<v Speaker 2>because they can't abstract the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constancy is across the different </v>

324
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:07.560
<v Speaker 2>situations and represent them </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstractly.</v>

325
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 2>So I made this little diagram.</v>

326
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 2>I made this little diagram here to kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of give you a sense of what you might be</v>

327
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:16.944
<v Speaker 2>doing when you're abstracting </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptually and so you could say think </v>

328
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 2>about something that's that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of my model of how complex the</v>

329
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 2>world is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the world is a lot more complex than</v>

330
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:27.264
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the world is made out of everything </v>

331
00:18:29.551 --> 00:18:30.384
<v Speaker 2>is made out of littler things and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>littler things are made out of littler </v>

332
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 2>things and so forth and those things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>nested inside.</v>

333
00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:36.474
<v Speaker 2>Bigger things and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And where you perceive on that level of </v>

334
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 2>abstraction is somewhat arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be bounded by your,</v>

335
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.303
<v Speaker 2>by your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing is that your </v>

336
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 2>perceptual structures are determined by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the goals that you have at hand.</v>

337
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.833
<v Speaker 2>I mean some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not completely true because your </v>

338
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 2>perceptual systems also have </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitations,</v>

339
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:55.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

340
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 2>There's things you can't see or hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you need to.</v>

341
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.740
<v Speaker 2>So there are limitations built in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but within that set of limitations,</v>

342
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:02.574
<v Speaker 2>you're still trying to tune your </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptions to your motivated goals and </v>

343
00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:06.864
<v Speaker 2>that's also very useful to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to understand </v>

344
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:12.600
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence because for </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>

345
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 2>without goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no perception because there's no</v>

346
00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:16.344
<v Speaker 2>filtering mechanism that you can use to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine the level of resolution at </v>

347
00:19:19.321 --> 00:19:20.960
<v Speaker 2>which you perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

348
00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:21.794
<v Speaker 2>So there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing made of smaller things </v>

349
00:19:24.481 --> 00:19:26.580
<v Speaker 2>which are made out of smaller things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so.</v>

350
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.600
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of my iconic representation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the complexity of the world and then you</v>

351
00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:31.440
<v Speaker 2>could think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

352
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you see this object?</v>

353
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.340
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you just look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can detect.</v>

354
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.293
<v Speaker 2>So like a necker cube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those cubes that are line </v>

355
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:43.910
<v Speaker 2>drawings that you can see the front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

356
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Then it'll flip to the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen those?</v>

357
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.093
<v Speaker 2>So this is kind of necker cube like or </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least it is for me in that when I </v>

358
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:53.580
<v Speaker 2>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my perceptions play around with it.</v>

359
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:54.414
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I focus on the kind of cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>like shape in the metal and sometimes I </v>

360
00:19:58.651 --> 00:19:59.484
<v Speaker 2>can see these other lines and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I'll focus on that square and </v>

361
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.293
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I can see the little dots </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are maybe one daughter and my </v>

362
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:07.104
<v Speaker 2>perceptions are going like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to fit a pattern to it and you </v>

363
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 2>can kind of detect that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching it.</v>

364
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:13.763
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you have the options of perceiving </v>

365
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:21.150
<v Speaker 2>this in its full complexity or you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>simplify it essentially.</v>

366
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.130
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of ways you can simplify </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

367
00:20:23.131 --> 00:20:26.820
<v Speaker 2>but some of them are laid out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you take the complex complex thing,</v>

368
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.550
<v Speaker 2>you make a low resolution representation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

369
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.350
<v Speaker 2>so that's rough.</v>

370
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the rough area that all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>dots occupy,</v>

371
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.940
<v Speaker 2>that's the rough area broken down to its</v>
<v Speaker 2>most fundamental quadrants.</v>

372
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.790
<v Speaker 2>That might be how you would look at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

373
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.250
<v Speaker 2>if this was a map of an orchard and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were trying to walk from south to north,</v>

374
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 2>that would be a useful representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

375
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.550
<v Speaker 2>this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>

376
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the highest level of resolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can perceive this object at.</v>

377
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 2>That's lower resolution than the object </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

378
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 2>So the first issue is how should you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at things?</v>

379
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:02.613
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem that intelligence has </v>

380
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:04.864
<v Speaker 2>to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the problems that </v>

381
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 2>intelligence goes after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think what happens is we have</v>

382
00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:09.634
<v Speaker 2>the thing in itself and then we simplify</v>
<v Speaker 2>it with a perception and that's an </v>

383
00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:15.574
<v Speaker 2>iconic representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we nail the iconic </v>

384
00:21:17.951 --> 00:21:18.784
<v Speaker 2>representation with a word and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>how we compress the world's complexity </v>

385
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:23.590
<v Speaker 2>into something that we can manage.</v>

386
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.663
<v Speaker 2>We take the complex thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it into an icon and represent the </v>

387
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:31.270
<v Speaker 2>icon with a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I throw you the word,</v>

388
00:21:31.271 --> 00:21:32.104
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decompose it into the icon and then </v>

389
00:21:34.121 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 2>decompose it even further into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

390
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.113
<v Speaker 2>If you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know the icon and you know the </v>

391
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:41.560
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then we can use shorthand,</v>

392
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.423
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have representational </v>

393
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:45.100
<v Speaker 2>structures of Soda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

394
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.880
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just tossing you markers about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your representational structures and you</v>

395
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:49.714
<v Speaker 2>can unfold them and that's what you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're reading a novel because the </v>

396
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:57.790
<v Speaker 2>novel comes alive in your imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your own idiosyncratic way,</v>

397
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.750
<v Speaker 2>and it wouldn't if you didn't understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>the references of the novel,</v>

398
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.763
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The novelist has to assume that your </v>

399
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:05.344
<v Speaker 2>basic perceptual structures and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitions and your instincts are </v>

400
00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:09.094
<v Speaker 2>basically the same as his or hers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise they have to assume </v>

401
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:12.784
<v Speaker 2>that because otherwise they would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost in an infinite regress of </v>

402
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 2>explanation.</v>

403
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 2>So it's problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Often.</v>

404
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you start reading Victoria novels,</v>

405
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.740
<v Speaker 2>you may find that it takes awhile to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into them because the presuppositions,</v>

406
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.530
<v Speaker 2>the expectations are slightly different </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so is the language.</v>

407
00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:33.380
<v Speaker 2>You have to update the representations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

408
00:22:33.381 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 2>so that's roughly as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

409
00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Speaker 2>that's roughly a representation of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is doing in the world.</v>

410
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:39.523
<v Speaker 2>It's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how in the world do you look at </v>

411
00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:46.510
<v Speaker 2>things so that you can use them for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposes that you need to use them for,</v>

412
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.110
<v Speaker 2>and then the next problem that </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence has to solve,</v>

413
00:22:50.111 --> 00:22:50.944
<v Speaker 2>which is related,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is once you've got the perceptual </v>

414
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:53.704
<v Speaker 2>landscape sorted out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you abstractly represent the </v>

415
00:22:57.671 --> 00:23:01.000
<v Speaker 2>action patterns that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement in the world?</v>

416
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's how do you perceive where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are now,</v>

417
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.753
<v Speaker 2>how do you perceive where you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how do you construct op and then </v>

418
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:11.434
<v Speaker 2>implement strategies that enable you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move from where you are to where you're </v>

419
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

420
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's a continual process of mapping </v>
<v Speaker 2>and movement.</v>

421
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.310
<v Speaker 2>And so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

422
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.390
<v Speaker 2>it's navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're doing in the world all</v>

423
00:23:22.391 --> 00:23:25.150
<v Speaker 2>the time is navigating through it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're mobile creatures.</v>

424
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.253
<v Speaker 2>We're navigating through it attempting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the world manifest itself in </v>

425
00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:31.114
<v Speaker 2>accordance with our wishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the fundamental problem that </v>

426
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:38.311
<v Speaker 2>intelligence has to solve and animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>have their perceptions to rely on.</v>

427
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.323
<v Speaker 2>But we have our perceptions and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to abstract from those </v>

428
00:23:43.721 --> 00:23:48.721
<v Speaker 2>perceptions multiple and then to </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract finally until into language.</v>

429
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.083
<v Speaker 2>So we live in a very abstracted world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also means that we can learn the </v>

430
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 2>lesson in one place and generalize it </v>
<v Speaker 2>across many other places,</v>

431
00:23:57.651 --> 00:23:58.484
<v Speaker 2>which is also something that animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a hard time doing because they </v>

432
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to do that perceptual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>initial,</v>

433
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 2>perceptual generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

434
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.830
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then the question might be,</v>

435
00:24:13.831 --> 00:24:16.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if intelligence has to solve the problem</v>

436
00:24:16.081 --> 00:24:21.081
<v Speaker 2>of how to perceive in and perceive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigate within the world towards ends,</v>

437
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:27.240
<v Speaker 2>towards in order to fulfill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to,</v>

438
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the world manifest what it needs</v>

439
00:24:30.211 --> 00:24:33.060
<v Speaker 2>to manifest so that you can maintain </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and stay alive.</v>

440
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.670
<v Speaker 2>What ends is it orienting itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards.</v>

441
00:24:35.671 --> 00:24:38.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a good way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the traits,</v>

442
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.233
<v Speaker 2>the traits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the traits motivate the perceptual </v>

443
00:24:41.161 --> 00:24:42.750
<v Speaker 2>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might think that,</v>

444
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.823
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extroverted people are after social </v>

445
00:24:45.931 --> 00:24:46.764
<v Speaker 2>success and you can understand why that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be because social success brings </v>

446
00:24:50.191 --> 00:24:51.024
<v Speaker 2>with it all sorts of rewards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social failure brings costs and you </v>

447
00:24:54.541 --> 00:24:57.860
<v Speaker 2>could also understand why that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>frighten you away from it.</v>

448
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:58.703
<v Speaker 2>And social success also requires the </v>
<v Speaker 2>expenditure of effort and introverted </v>

449
00:25:02.221 --> 00:25:05.460
<v Speaker 2>people seem to be much more conservative</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sense,</v>

450
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:06.983
<v Speaker 2>in terms of expanding social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expending energy socially and I suppose </v>

451
00:25:10.591 --> 00:25:13.590
<v Speaker 2>they're protecting themselves to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree against the possibility of social</v>

452
00:25:13.591 --> 00:25:14.250
<v Speaker 2>failure.</v>

453
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.083
<v Speaker 2>We don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know more about how extroverts in </v>

454
00:25:17.821 --> 00:25:20.910
<v Speaker 2>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how and why extroverts orient themselves</v>

455
00:25:20.911 --> 00:25:24.600
<v Speaker 2>the way they do in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not so sure about introverts.</v>

456
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.903
<v Speaker 2>What it is that what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the proper landscape is for </v>

457
00:25:29.821 --> 00:25:31.860
<v Speaker 2>introverts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can show you a word cloud.</v>

458
00:25:31.861 --> 00:25:32.694
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that at some point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>introverts that were generated from </v>

459
00:25:35.161 --> 00:25:40.161
<v Speaker 2>introverts on facebook and they seem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be into fantasy and gaming a lot and and</v>

460
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.873
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why that is exactly because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fantasy element should be more </v>

461
00:25:45.421 --> 00:25:49.950
<v Speaker 2>locally localized in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the introverted types,</v>

462
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:50.873
<v Speaker 2>I mean I suppose they're the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are on the Big Bang theory roughly </v>

463
00:25:53.791 --> 00:25:54.624
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

464
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:55.743
<v Speaker 2>they seem to be the introverted types </v>
<v Speaker 2>and but we don't understand that much </v>

465
00:25:59.401 --> 00:26:00.234
<v Speaker 2>about them and exactly how it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're orienting themselves in the </v>

466
00:26:02.101 --> 00:26:04.110
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are high in neuroticism,</v>

467
00:26:04.111 --> 00:26:06.180
<v Speaker 2>are oriented towards security and </v>
<v Speaker 2>safety,</v>

468
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.570
<v Speaker 2>agreeable people versus disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are oriented,</v>

469
00:26:09.571 --> 00:26:12.000
<v Speaker 2>say towards cooperation versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

470
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Conscientious people are oriented </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards order,</v>

471
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.450
<v Speaker 2>duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obligation and implementation and open.</v>

472
00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:22.340
<v Speaker 2>People are oriented towards abstraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>in both idiation,</v>

473
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:27.000
<v Speaker 2>landy and representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so those are also to some degree,</v>

474
00:26:27.001 --> 00:26:29.460
<v Speaker 2>you might also think about those as </v>
<v Speaker 2>value systems,</v>

475
00:26:29.461 --> 00:26:33.240
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because what you value is definitely not</v>

476
00:26:33.241 --> 00:26:35.850
<v Speaker 2>only what you pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too narrow a view.</v>

477
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.043
<v Speaker 2>Value is also what you perceive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue and so thinking about these </v>

478
00:26:40.681 --> 00:26:44.880
<v Speaker 2>things as this entire frame of I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a much better way of doing it.</v>

479
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:45.743
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of structure earlier as a </v>

480
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:48.714
<v Speaker 2>micro personality and I mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 2>determination of micro personalities by </v>

481
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.163
<v Speaker 2>fundamental underlying biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems like defensive aggression and </v>

482
00:26:57.931 --> 00:26:58.764
<v Speaker 2>sexual sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>desire and hunger and thirst and so </v>

483
00:27:04.441 --> 00:27:07.260
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are all systems that can grab your</v>

484
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:08.094
<v Speaker 2>perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make you look at the world in a certain </v>

485
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:11.184
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make you pursue something else in a </v>

486
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:13.374
<v Speaker 2>certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and prime action responses that are in </v>

487
00:27:16.021 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 2>keeping with all of that.</v>

488
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:18.403
<v Speaker 2>The traits seem to be something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher order agglomerations of those </v>

489
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:23.124
<v Speaker 2>more fundamental biological motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although we don't quite understand the </v>

490
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:29.730
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology and the traits,</v>

491
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.560
<v Speaker 2>we're starting to sort it out so we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

492
00:27:31.561 --> 00:27:32.394
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the function of the </v>

493
00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:34.464
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hypothalamus regulates the basic </v>

494
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:40.350
<v Speaker 2>biological motivations that I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>outlined,</v>

495
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:41.483
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the place where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploratory systems find their ultimate </v>

496
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.893
<v Speaker 2>physiological grounding and openness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>extroversion seemed to be variant </v>

497
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:50.634
<v Speaker 2>manifestations of the exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulse and that's grounded in the </v>

498
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:54.983
<v Speaker 2>Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're starting to be able to put the </v>

499
00:27:56.581 --> 00:28:00.190
<v Speaker 2>traits to sort of nail the traits down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to their underlying biology.</v>

500
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 2>With regards to neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

501
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.613
<v Speaker 2>if you're high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more sensitive to anxiety and </v>

502
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:11.970
<v Speaker 2>that's regulated at least in part by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippocampus and generated in part by the</v>

503
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Amygdala.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another part of the brain called</v>

504
00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:14.934
<v Speaker 2>the periodic with aqua ductal gray that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be associated with the </v>

505
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:22.080
<v Speaker 2>experience of pain and pain is quite a </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex phenomena.</v>

506
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Depression is pain like grief is pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like social isolation is pain.</v>

507
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:28.074
<v Speaker 2>Like disappointment is pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's anxiety components to that </v>

508
00:28:31.381 --> 00:28:33.810
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so neuroticism seems to be something</v>

509
00:28:33.811 --> 00:28:37.980
<v Speaker 2>like threshold for activation in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotions systems.</v>

510
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:43.110
<v Speaker 2>So if you're higher in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one unit of uncertainty might produce,</v>

511
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 2>let's say three units of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychophysiological response.</v>

512
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:47.334
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're lower in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one unit of uncertainty might produce </v>

513
00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:52.320
<v Speaker 2>one unit of psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

514
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 2>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's a simplified Schemata,</v>

515
00:28:55.711 --> 00:28:56.544
<v Speaker 2>but there's variability because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>something unexpected or threatening </v>

516
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:01.074
<v Speaker 2>happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't obvious how upset you should </v>

517
00:29:03.271 --> 00:29:06.270
<v Speaker 2>get one answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what might be a brush it off,</v>

518
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.170
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

519
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:08.004
<v Speaker 2>Their answer might be it's a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe and often when something </v>

520
00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:12.084
<v Speaker 2>uncertain or threatening occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have enough information at </v>

521
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:19.270
<v Speaker 2>your disposal to make a full </v>
<v Speaker 2>determination of the potential import of</v>

522
00:29:19.271 --> 00:29:22.020
<v Speaker 2>this circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's uncertain.</v>

523
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:27.090
<v Speaker 2>And so then you have to guess at how </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset you should be and where you are on</v>

524
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:29.850
<v Speaker 2>the normal distribution with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 2>trait neuroticism.</v>

525
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Say that sort of determines what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>guests on average is going to be.</v>

526
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.480
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other with conscientiousness say,</v>

527
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.040
<v Speaker 2>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how hard should you work?</v>

528
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really difficult question.</v>

529
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:44.674
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to die tomorrow and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably shouldn't work very hard </v>

530
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:48.664
<v Speaker 2>today at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one thing you might say is that the </v>

531
00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:52.594
<v Speaker 2>degree to which you should work hard is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent on your assumptions about the </v>

532
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:59.170
<v Speaker 2>stability of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually know this to be true because</v>

533
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.910
<v Speaker 2>if you put people in wildly uncertain </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>

534
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 2>they discount the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what you should do,</v>

535
00:30:07.091 --> 00:30:07.924
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only makes sense to store up goods </v>

536
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.193
<v Speaker 2>for future consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the future is likely to be very </v>

537
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:15.730
<v Speaker 2>similar to the past and the present.</v>

538
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 2>You need a stable society for that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness only works in a stable</v>

539
00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:24.250
<v Speaker 2>society because all you do otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're piling up goods,</v>

540
00:30:24.251 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of what conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do,</v>

541
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.093
<v Speaker 2>is leaving them there for the criminals </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take or waiting for the next chaotic </v>

542
00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:32.680
<v Speaker 2>upheaval to wipe out everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've stored.</v>

543
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.740
<v Speaker 2>And so even conscientiousness is a kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of guests,</v>

544
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.420
<v Speaker 2>hardworking people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

545
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice the present for the future.</v>

546
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.853
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as the future is going to be </v>

547
00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:43.624
<v Speaker 2>there and you can predict it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's not going to be there and </v>

548
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:48.640
<v Speaker 2>it's unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the right response is take what you</v>

549
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:50.100
<v Speaker 2>can take right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

550
00:30:50.101 --> 00:30:50.934
<v Speaker 2>the getting's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously there are troubles with </v>

551
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:54.191
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

552
00:30:54.191 --> 00:30:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

553
00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.093
<v Speaker 2>I'm offering rough rules of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to provide you with some </v>

554
00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:01.894
<v Speaker 2>indication of how and why these </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference in value structures exist </v>

555
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:08.170
<v Speaker 2>because there are applicable in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different environments.</v>

556
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.103
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes in a dangerous social </v>

557
00:31:10.811 --> 00:31:11.644
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious that being an </v>

558
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:16.090
<v Speaker 2>extroverted person is a good idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>because extroverted people,</v>

559
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:16.924
<v Speaker 2>they stand out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're extroverted and </v>

560
00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:19.810
<v Speaker 2>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

561
00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Because not only are they noisy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant and assertive,</v>

562
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:27.670
<v Speaker 2>they're also colorful and flamboyant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>provocative.</v>

563
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great if you're in a society that</v>

564
00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 2>rewards that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have,</v>

565
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're ruled by an authoritarian king</v>

566
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:36.484
<v Speaker 2>who wants absolutely no threat </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever to his stability ever than </v>

567
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:45.780
<v Speaker 2>dressing in gray and shutting the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>up is a really good survival tactic.</v>

568
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:47.643
<v Speaker 2>So the utility of the trait depends on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the structure of the environment that </v>

569
00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:52.234
<v Speaker 2>surrounds it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why there's variability in </v>

570
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:54.514
<v Speaker 2>traits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have to be careful when </v>

571
00:31:56.951 --> 00:31:57.784
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about it from a strict </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific perspective to make the </v>

572
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:01.294
<v Speaker 2>assumption that positioning at any place</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the normal distribution is </v>

573
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:08.230
<v Speaker 2>preferable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>preferable to positioning anywhere else.</v>

574
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.150
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one exception to that maybe might be icu</v>

575
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:14.763
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>see an icu with Iq is that people with </v>

576
00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:18.604
<v Speaker 2>higher Iq seemed to do better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's also only true in complex </v>

577
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:22.534
<v Speaker 2>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's another problem that </v>

578
00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 2>seems to emerge with Iq and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what to make of this,</v>

579
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:30.190
<v Speaker 2>but we know that as women's Iq </v>
<v Speaker 2>increases,</v>

580
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.503
<v Speaker 2>the probability that they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>to remain without a mate also increases </v>

581
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.560
<v Speaker 2>because women tend to mate across or up </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies.</v>

582
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

583
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.933
<v Speaker 3>if you're a woman with an Iq of 130,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you've already eliminated about 95 </v>

584
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:47.810
<v Speaker 3>percent of the men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's only using one criteria.</v>

585
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:48.644
<v Speaker 3>That's just straight intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there also might be limitations </v>

586
00:32:51.321 --> 00:32:52.154
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the utility of intelligence with </v>

587
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 3>regards to reproduction that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really understand very well yet.</v>

588
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.200
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

589
00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 3>so you get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's these underlying,</v>

590
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.890
<v Speaker 3>I kind of put down to value structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're capitalize on social groups.</v>

591
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:08.940
<v Speaker 3>That would be an extroverted value </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure,</v>

592
00:33:08.941 --> 00:33:09.774
<v Speaker 3>say maintain order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a a conscientious </v>

593
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:13.934
<v Speaker 3>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conscientious people are going to want </v>

594
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.950
<v Speaker 3>to maintain order because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want things to shift across time because</v>

595
00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:22.610
<v Speaker 3>if they shift too much across time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the things that have been stored up</v>

596
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:25.520
<v Speaker 3>for the future start to become </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly irrelevant.</v>

597
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.310
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of other reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain order as well,</v>

598
00:33:28.311 --> 00:33:29.150
<v Speaker 3>but that's one of them.</v>

599
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:30.763
<v Speaker 3>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that your cognitive ability allows </v>

600
00:33:34.521 --> 00:33:37.970
<v Speaker 3>you to do modeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is where human beings have have</v>

601
00:33:37.971 --> 00:33:42.971
<v Speaker 3>leapt ahead of their competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So an animal animals can think,</v>

602
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.020
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't exactly obvious how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

603
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:49.363
<v Speaker 3>They think strategically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they think the same way that </v>

604
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:54.170
<v Speaker 3>children think in some sense when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're playing with Legos,</v>

605
00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 3>when they're not thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Legos.</v>

606
00:33:55.881 --> 00:33:57.800
<v Speaker 3>You know when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're just moving them around.</v>

607
00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:58.933
<v Speaker 3>We know of like if you watch a smart </v>
<v Speaker 3>Predator group like lions go after a </v>

608
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.080
<v Speaker 3>target or watched chimpanzees hunt down </v>
<v Speaker 3>a monkey,</v>

609
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 3>you can see intelligence at work because</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting behavior is very,</v>

610
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:11.330
<v Speaker 3>very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously,</v>

611
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:12.164
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're chasing something </v>

612
00:34:12.891 --> 00:34:13.724
<v Speaker 3>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there isn't that level of abstract </v>

613
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:18.770
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whereas,</v>

614
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.640
<v Speaker 3>so let's look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's,</v>

615
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:24.850
<v Speaker 3>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a picture of the,</v>

616
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.450
<v Speaker 3>of the human brain with someone facing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this way,</v>

617
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

618
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.070
<v Speaker 3>So here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the primary motor Cortex,</v>

619
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.770
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're using that to voluntarily move</v>

620
00:34:36.771 --> 00:34:38.180
<v Speaker 3>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

621
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:39.740
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I might say to you,</v>

622
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:42.050
<v Speaker 3>close your eyes and imagine doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

623
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:42.913
<v Speaker 3>So just close your eyes and imagine </v>
<v Speaker 3>picking up the cup that's in front of </v>

624
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:46.760
<v Speaker 3>you and just visualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

625
00:34:46.761 --> 00:34:47.690
<v Speaker 3>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

626
00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:49.970
<v Speaker 3>what part of your brain are you using </v>
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>

627
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.280
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is used part of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>

628
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.143
<v Speaker 3>this part because it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where you have your body </v>

629
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:57.320
<v Speaker 3>represented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but use this part here,</v>

630
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.370
<v Speaker 3>the premotor cortex to envision </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential auctions.</v>

631
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:02.683
<v Speaker 3>Now what's happened is that this part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain evolved out of this part and </v>

632
00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:10.760
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense because the first part </v>
<v Speaker 3>is just how you would move,</v>

633
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:11.594
<v Speaker 3>but the second part is how you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about how you would move and then </v>

634
00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:17.150
<v Speaker 3>the next part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is this part huge in human beings,</v>

635
00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.253
<v Speaker 3>is how you would think about how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would think about how you would move so </v>

636
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.023
<v Speaker 3>because that enables you to start to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary extraordinarily abstract </v>

637
00:35:25.971 --> 00:35:26.390
<v Speaker 3>planning.</v>

638
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.650
<v Speaker 3>So I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

639
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.693
<v Speaker 3>envision how you would pick up the cup </v>
<v Speaker 3>and obviously that's something that </v>

640
00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:33.164
<v Speaker 3>you've separated out as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a potential simulation from the </v>

641
00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:36.884
<v Speaker 3>actual action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can talk about extraordinarily </v>

642
00:35:39.661 --> 00:35:44.661
<v Speaker 3>high level abstractions that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects across multiple specific domains</v>

643
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:49.671
<v Speaker 3>way into the future and the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract that your manipulations become,</v>

644
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:50.514
<v Speaker 3>the more they seem to be moved away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say from the primary motor cortex out </v>

645
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:56.970
<v Speaker 3>into the prefrontal cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hierarchies of abstraction.</v>

646
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that as this was Karl</v>
<v Speaker 3>Popper,</v>

647
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 3>this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really were thinking about why.</v>

648
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:05.094
<v Speaker 3>Think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you're an animal and you act </v>

649
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:08.963
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't go very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you die while you've learned that </v>

650
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.280
<v Speaker 3>the acting that way didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now your dad,</v>

651
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.430
<v Speaker 3>so that's not that helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you might think,</v>

652
00:36:17.431 --> 00:36:18.264
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you should represent how you're </v>

653
00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:24.201
<v Speaker 3>going to act so you know here's a box </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the snake in it and your Coffee Cup</v>

654
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.640
<v Speaker 3>is inside the box with the snake in it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say to you,</v>

655
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:30.150
<v Speaker 3>imagine picking up the Coffee Cup and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you imagine it and you think,</v>

656
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.013
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll pick up that coffee cup and then </v>

657
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:34.220
<v Speaker 3>the snake will bite me and old die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so then you do.</v>

658
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:38.040
<v Speaker 3>You decide that implementing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy of picking up the Coffee Cup is</v>

659
00:36:38.041 --> 00:36:43.041
<v Speaker 3>probably not a very good idea and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stupid idea has to die and not you.</v>

660
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.133
<v Speaker 3>And so popper's idea was that the reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we developed the capacity to </v>

661
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:52.230
<v Speaker 3>abstract was so that our stupid ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>could die instead of us.</v>

662
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.483
<v Speaker 3>And that's really it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost impossible to overstate how </v>

663
00:36:57.151 --> 00:37:00.000
<v Speaker 3>brilliant and observation that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what me,</v>

664
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.090
<v Speaker 3>what it means is that as a standard </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>

665
00:37:03.091 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 3>you would have to produce variance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>

666
00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:06.423
<v Speaker 3>reproductively to go out into the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and try their hand at survival and </v>

667
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:11.274
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty costly because you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>produce all the biological replications </v>

668
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:15.834
<v Speaker 3>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you could only probably manage that </v>

669
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.143
<v Speaker 3>maybe 13 times if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really worked at it and then then the </v>

670
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:26.520
<v Speaker 3>cost of their failure is extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>high because they die while you can just</v>

671
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:27.354
<v Speaker 3>sit there and produced like 20 different</v>
<v Speaker 3>versions of you stay extending out over </v>

672
00:37:31.651 --> 00:37:32.484
<v Speaker 3>the next week or the next month and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can run them through a simulation and </v>

673
00:37:35.881 --> 00:37:36.714
<v Speaker 3>kill off all the ones that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>regard as suitable and then only </v>

674
00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:41.610
<v Speaker 3>implement the successful ones.</v>

675
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:42.623
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could debate about how accurate you </v>

676
00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:48.420
<v Speaker 3>might be at doing that because it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>depend on your knowledge,</v>

677
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:49.463
<v Speaker 3>but we do know that intelligent people </v>
<v Speaker 3>tend to do better across the course of </v>

678
00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:54.654
<v Speaker 3>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it does seem that there is some </v>

679
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:03.090
<v Speaker 3>utility with regards to survival or at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least with regards to positioning in the</v>

680
00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:03.924
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is somewhat of a proxy for </v>

681
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:06.744
<v Speaker 3>survival and for reproductive success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some association between that </v>

682
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:10.943
<v Speaker 3>and the ability to abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we could say that part of the reason </v>

683
00:38:14.791 --> 00:38:15.624
<v Speaker 3>that people got smarter was because </v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter people were more likely to stay </v>

684
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

685
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:20.670
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more complicated than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

686
00:38:20.671 --> 00:38:25.170
<v Speaker 3>because I believe that human males and </v>
<v Speaker 3>females are in an evolutionary cognitive</v>

687
00:38:25.171 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 3>arms race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking.</v>

688
00:38:27.361 --> 00:38:32.361
<v Speaker 3>And so as men get trickier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women get trickier to understand them.</v>

689
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:34.500
<v Speaker 3>And then as women get trickier to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

690
00:38:34.501 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 3>men get trickier to understand them.</v>

691
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.933
<v Speaker 3>And so we'd been chasing each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>around this cortical expansion loop </v>

692
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 3>pretty much since we parted ways with </v>
<v Speaker 3>our common,</v>

693
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.800
<v Speaker 3>with the ancestor that we had in common </v>
<v Speaker 3>with chimpanzees.</v>

694
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 3>And so that's roughly about 7 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

695
00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.550
<v Speaker 3>We've undergone a tremendous cortical </v>
<v Speaker 3>expansion since then and there's lots of</v>

696
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:57.760
<v Speaker 3>reasons that have been propelling that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

697
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 3>So what do you have to do with when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking while you have to figure</v>

698
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:03.034
<v Speaker 3>out where you are and how to see that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to figure out where you're </v>

699
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:09.220
<v Speaker 3>going and what that should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to era.</v>

700
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.223
<v Speaker 3>You have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>generate and represent appropriate </v>

701
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 3>auction strategies and simulate those in</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and space.</v>

702
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:22.240
<v Speaker 3>And then one of the things that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>noting is that what you do when you read</v>

703
00:39:22.241 --> 00:39:23.074
<v Speaker 3>a story or when you tell a story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so part of the reason that you like </v>

704
00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:26.944
<v Speaker 3>to read stories is because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what story stories are telling </v>

705
00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:29.650
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

706
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:34.510
<v Speaker 3>How someone is going about doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then you can see how if you think</v>

707
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:39.070
<v Speaker 3>about preference for fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is actually part of openness,</v>

708
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.293
<v Speaker 3>preference for fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that utility in fiction is that allows </v>

709
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:44.044
<v Speaker 3>you to experience a plethora of </v>
<v Speaker 3>simulated worlds and to embody the </v>

710
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:49.414
<v Speaker 3>consequences in abstraction without </v>
<v Speaker 3>having to go through the trouble of </v>

711
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:53.104
<v Speaker 3>doing that for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we do know there's good empirical </v>

712
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:56.644
<v Speaker 3>literature now showing some of it done </v>
<v Speaker 3>by x students from my lab showing that </v>

713
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.580
<v Speaker 3>reading fiction does improve your </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpersonal intelligence,</v>

714
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:04.414
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ability to understand the position </v>

715
00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:07.234
<v Speaker 3>of other people logically enough because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you're doing when you're </v>

716
00:40:09.881 --> 00:40:12.430
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>

717
00:40:12.431 --> 00:40:13.264
<v Speaker 3>so I'm trying to give you some </v>
<v Speaker 3>background so that you can understand </v>

718
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.023
<v Speaker 3>what it means to abstract and also why </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's useful because we need that in </v>

719
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:24.700
<v Speaker 3>order to move forward with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

720
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.830
<v Speaker 3>So here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

721
00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:27.664
<v Speaker 3>So that's how you act voluntarily and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's how you represent how you </v>

722
00:40:31.331 --> 00:40:32.164
<v Speaker 3>act voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that's how you think about how </v>

723
00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:34.744
<v Speaker 3>you represent acting voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I'm telling you this is </v>

724
00:40:37.631 --> 00:40:38.464
<v Speaker 3>because it's useful to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence as abstract action because </v>

725
00:40:43.031 --> 00:40:46.810
<v Speaker 3>we tend to think about intelligence as </v>
<v Speaker 3>abstract representation,</v>

726
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.673
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Intelligence is the manipulation of </v>

727
00:40:48.971 --> 00:40:53.080
<v Speaker 3>facts or the understanding of facts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at it neurologically,</v>

728
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.153
<v Speaker 3>I would say that's a miss apprehension </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the part of the brain that </v>

729
00:40:56.261 --> 00:40:57.094
<v Speaker 3>does the highest level of abstract </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking is actually something that's </v>

730
00:40:59.981 --> 00:41:02.370
<v Speaker 3>emerged from the motor cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you can.</v>

731
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.160
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean you don't use your </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence to represent you do,</v>

732
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:07.563
<v Speaker 3>but the purpose of intelligence is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent potential action patterns and </v>

733
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.480
<v Speaker 3>we're embodied creatures and we need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>move in the world,</v>

734
00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:15.670
<v Speaker 3>and so that's the proper as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned.</v>

735
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.800
<v Speaker 3>That's the proper way to conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

736
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's a.</v>

737
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:21.784
<v Speaker 3>here's a study I'll read you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This study imagery and the premotor </v>

738
00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:26.200
<v Speaker 3>cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

739
00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:27.034
<v Speaker 3>studies on healthy subjects have shown a</v>
<v Speaker 3>partial overlap between the motor </v>

740
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:34.280
<v Speaker 3>execution and motor imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neural circuits.</v>

741
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:35.683
<v Speaker 3>Few have investigated brain activity </v>
<v Speaker 3>during motor imagery in stroke patients </v>

742
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:39.584
<v Speaker 3>with Hemiparesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a partial overlap between the motor </v>

743
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 3>execution and motor imagery neural </v>
<v Speaker 3>circuits.</v>

744
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.863
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an interesting side consequences </v>

745
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:46.844
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say I'm thirsty and I look at </v>

746
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:52.304
<v Speaker 3>that glass of water and part of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens when I look at the glass of </v>

747
00:41:56.331 --> 00:41:59.840
<v Speaker 3>water is that my eyes activate this </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly.</v>

748
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:03.530
<v Speaker 3>So you know I've already talked to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to some degree about how your eyes work,</v>

749
00:42:03.531 --> 00:42:04.341
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's patterns,</v>

750
00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:08.800
<v Speaker 3>they're out there in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the patterns are mapped onto the retina,</v>

751
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.590
<v Speaker 3>so it's a pattern display</v>
<v Speaker 3>matrix,</v>

752
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.963
<v Speaker 3>and then that pattern is propagated </v>
<v Speaker 3>along the optic nerve and then that </v>

753
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:17.414
<v Speaker 3>pattern manifests itself in the visual </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortex and then that pattern manifests </v>

754
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:21.283
<v Speaker 3>itself in the motor cortex and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifests itself in bodily movement or </v>

755
00:42:25.011 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 3>preparation for bodily movement.</v>

756
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Technically you don't need conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagery for that to happen.</v>

757
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Now that's something really useful to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know is that your eyes can activate your</v>

758
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:35.624
<v Speaker 3>body without you being aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>image because you think there's the </v>

759
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:39.831
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it.</v>

760
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:42.350
<v Speaker 3>Then I determine how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like yes,</v>

761
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.830
<v Speaker 3>but also no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the world and seeing it prepares</v>

762
00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:47.690
<v Speaker 3>me to act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about the damn imagery.</v>

763
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:48.943
<v Speaker 3>So when I look at that Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the part of the act of looking </v>

764
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:54.674
<v Speaker 3>at it is preparing that gesture and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's especially the case if I also </v>

765
00:42:58.431 --> 00:42:59.264
<v Speaker 3>happened to be thirsty because if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>thirsty the cups signifies something </v>

766
00:43:03.021 --> 00:43:03.854
<v Speaker 3>that I can use to quench my thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes it a very different thing </v>

767
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:08.323
<v Speaker 3>than what it is when it's empty or when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thirsty so I'm not even gonna </v>

768
00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.143
<v Speaker 3>use the same part of my brain to </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceive it because it's not the same </v>

769
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:15.950
<v Speaker 3>thing in relationship to me.</v>

770
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:21.110
<v Speaker 3>So I look at it and then just just even </v>
<v Speaker 3>just understanding the size of it,</v>

771
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:22.243
<v Speaker 3>there's not much difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding the size of it and doing </v>

772
00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:26.540
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's see how I got that.</v>

773
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.033
<v Speaker 3>So that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's my underneath when you will </v>

774
00:43:31.101 --> 00:43:31.934
<v Speaker 3>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what does it mean to understand </v>

775
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:34.124
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what it means in so far as </v>

776
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:41.060
<v Speaker 3>this is a cup because it could be tinder</v>
<v Speaker 3>for lighting a fire for example,</v>

777
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.253
<v Speaker 3>or something to stomp on to make a noise</v>
<v Speaker 3>in so far as it's a cup than </v>

778
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.000
<v Speaker 3>understanding it means pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mapping it onto exactly this</v>

779
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:56.270
<v Speaker 3>and if I do that successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I get a little reward,</v>

780
00:43:56.271 --> 00:43:57.104
<v Speaker 3>a little hint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little kick of dopamine and that </v>

781
00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:01.370
<v Speaker 3>dopamine makes me feel a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

782
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.760
<v Speaker 3>but it also bathes the neural tissue </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I use to make that perceptual,</v>

783
00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:09.143
<v Speaker 3>that to to to structure that perception </v>
<v Speaker 3>and also to undertake that act and it </v>

784
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:15.674
<v Speaker 3>makes just a little bit more likely that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll see it that way and act that way </v>

785
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:21.290
<v Speaker 3>and its presence again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's how you learn,</v>

786
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

787
00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:24.290
<v Speaker 3>You lay out a perceptual scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got a goal.</v>

788
00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.780
<v Speaker 3>If the perceptual scheme and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated action patterns make the goal</v>

789
00:44:28.781 --> 00:44:29.614
<v Speaker 3>of manifest itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you get a little burst of positive </v>

790
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.543
<v Speaker 3>click.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that makes it those little neural </v>

791
00:44:35.581 --> 00:44:36.414
<v Speaker 3>circuits that instantiated that thrive a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit and get a little bit more </v>

792
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:42.930
<v Speaker 3>predominant and that's also why you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch yourself.</v>

793
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:46.200
<v Speaker 3>If you're taking psychomotor stimulants </v>
<v Speaker 3>like cocaine or alcohol,</v>

794
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:47.034
<v Speaker 3>even for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they produce hyper learning and </v>

795
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:50.364
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll glance at that and maybe it'll </v>

796
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:54.780
<v Speaker 3>trigger off a bit of thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if that was,</v>

797
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:58.350
<v Speaker 3>if I was a cocaine addict and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine paraphernalia and I glanced at,</v>

798
00:44:58.351 --> 00:44:59.340
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

799
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:00.743
<v Speaker 3>that thing that I've built in my head </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of repeated know massive hits of </v>

800
00:45:04.651 --> 00:45:08.640
<v Speaker 3>dopamine is going to grab my perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures and my auctions and bring me.</v>

801
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:09.563
<v Speaker 3>That'll be that craving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an impulse to move forward </v>

802
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:12.894
<v Speaker 3>towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll feel that instantiated in your </v>

803
00:45:14.551 --> 00:45:16.140
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the craving.</v>

804
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.393
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to get rid of that even </v>

805
00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:19.943
<v Speaker 3>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a cocaine abuser and you've </v>

806
00:45:23.011 --> 00:45:26.730
<v Speaker 3>gone to a treatment center for several </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks and got over the worst of the,</v>

807
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.350
<v Speaker 3>at least initial parts of the elearning </v>
<v Speaker 3>not to abuse the second you go back into</v>

808
00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:34.200
<v Speaker 3>your natural environment and take a look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the cues.</v>

809
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:36.630
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing will be right back there.</v>

810
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:37.464
<v Speaker 3>Directing your action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what happens is when one of those </v>

811
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:42.390
<v Speaker 3>perceptual systems comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see this when you're hungry.</v>

812
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It suppresses all the other potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>perceptual systems.</v>

813
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.580
<v Speaker 3>You can see this when you're angry too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

814
00:45:47.581 --> 00:45:48.414
<v Speaker 3>You get angry and you're angry with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>partner and all you can think of is all </v>

815
00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:53.280
<v Speaker 3>the stupid things they've done for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last 10 years.</v>

816
00:45:53.281 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 3>You don't even remember that you like </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

817
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 3>It's like you could remind them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're mad,</v>

818
00:45:57.181 --> 00:45:58.940
<v Speaker 3>but remember you liked me now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

819
00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.810
<v Speaker 3>not right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

820
00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:01.644
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just shows you how those micro </v>

821
00:46:04.111 --> 00:46:06.750
<v Speaker 3>personalities can dominate and suppress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

822
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.613
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens because if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't suppress the other micro </v>

823
00:46:09.721 --> 00:46:10.554
<v Speaker 3>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't be able to run themselves </v>

824
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:14.400
<v Speaker 3>to conclusion.</v>

825
00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.010
<v Speaker 3>And then you'd never get what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

826
00:46:19.011 --> 00:46:19.844
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies have shown a partial overlap </v>

827
00:46:24.221 --> 00:46:29.120
<v Speaker 3>between the motor execution and motor </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagery neural circuits.</v>

828
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:30.103
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is you see something and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it primes you for the appropriate </v>

829
00:46:32.571 --> 00:46:33.404
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Few have investigated brain activity </v>

830
00:46:36.921 --> 00:46:40.100
<v Speaker 3>during motor imagery in stroke patients </v>
<v Speaker 3>with hemiparesis.</v>

831
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Hemiparesis is motor impairment from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

832
00:46:44.361 --> 00:46:45.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the stroke.</v>

833
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.963
<v Speaker 3>This work is aimed at examining </v>
<v Speaker 3>similarities between motor imagery and </v>

834
00:46:50.031 --> 00:46:50.864
<v Speaker 3>execution in a group of stroke patients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>11 patients were asked to perform a </v>

835
00:46:53.961 --> 00:46:54.794
<v Speaker 3>visual motor tracking task by either </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically or mentally tracking a sine </v>

836
00:46:58.491 --> 00:47:01.250
<v Speaker 3>wave forest target using their thumb and</v>
<v Speaker 3>index finger.</v>

837
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:06.400
<v Speaker 3>So they're doing this</v>
<v Speaker 3>during FMRI scanning results.</v>

838
00:47:06.941 --> 00:47:07.774
<v Speaker 3>Whole brain analysis confirmed shared </v>
<v Speaker 3>neural substrates between motor imagery </v>

839
00:47:11.981 --> 00:47:14.590
<v Speaker 3>and motor execution in bilateral </v>
<v Speaker 3>premotor cortex.</v>

840
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.900
<v Speaker 3>So that's the part that I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

841
00:47:16.901 --> 00:47:19.680
<v Speaker 3>I won't tell you about the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain in pride.</v>

842
00:47:19.681 --> 00:47:20.514
<v Speaker 3>A lobule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is partly associated with body </v>

843
00:47:22.151 --> 00:47:27.151
<v Speaker 3>recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

844
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 3>So basically I showed</v>

845
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:30.963
<v Speaker 1>you that study because it it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the studies that lend </v>

846
00:47:33.281 --> 00:47:34.114
<v Speaker 1>credence to what I was just describing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that imagery is the precursor to </v>

847
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:37.504
<v Speaker 1>action and that it's associated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the imagery going here and the </v>

848
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:42.970
<v Speaker 1>action there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about,</v>

849
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:47.200
<v Speaker 1>think about thanking think act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's roughly how it works.</v>

850
00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:51.443
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

851
00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.330
<v Speaker 3>now down to cognitive ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

852
00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:57.480
<v Speaker 3>how can you conceptualize intelligence?</v>

853
00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:01.663
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a major problem because your </v>

854
00:48:02.511 --> 00:48:06.680
<v Speaker 3>initial conceptualization determines in </v>
<v Speaker 3>part the strategies that you're going to</v>

855
00:48:06.681 --> 00:48:11.150
<v Speaker 3>use to investigate intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you say,</v>

856
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.970
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you pair a sentence down to what is</v>

857
00:48:13.971 --> 00:48:17.330
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sentence is problematic because part</v>

858
00:48:17.331 --> 00:48:18.164
<v Speaker 3>of it is a question about</v>
<v Speaker 3>if and how such a thing might manifest </v>

859
00:48:23.181 --> 00:48:27.980
<v Speaker 3>itself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a fact out there that are set</v>

860
00:48:27.981 --> 00:48:29.690
<v Speaker 3>of facts that corresponds to </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

861
00:48:29.691 --> 00:48:30.680
<v Speaker 3>But the other problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

862
00:48:30.681 --> 00:48:33.320
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean when you say </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence?</v>

863
00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:34.693
<v Speaker 3>And you kind of have to nail that down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to have a conversation </v>

864
00:48:38.151 --> 00:48:40.610
<v Speaker 3>about intelligence that doesn't go </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely astray.</v>

865
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.863
<v Speaker 3>And so you've got to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a definitional problem as </v>

866
00:48:43.401 --> 00:48:45.800
<v Speaker 3>well as an empirical problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

867
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.343
<v Speaker 3>there have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was especially true in the 19 </v>

868
00:48:49.911 --> 00:48:50.744
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>

869
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:56.790
<v Speaker 3>people have been studying intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq intelligence since the 19 twenties.</v>

870
00:48:56.791 --> 00:48:59.580
<v Speaker 3>And it is a very well established branch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of psychology.</v>

871
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:00.623
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I have to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Iq research is that if you don't </v>

872
00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.453
<v Speaker 3>buy Iq research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might as well throw away all the </v>

873
00:49:08.311 --> 00:49:09.144
<v Speaker 3>rest of psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is that the </v>

874
00:49:12.481 --> 00:49:14.040
<v Speaker 3>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

875
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:14.874
<v Speaker 3>who developed intelligence testing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were among the early psychologists who </v>

876
00:49:17.851 --> 00:49:22.851
<v Speaker 3>instantiated the statistical techniques </v>
<v Speaker 3>that all psychologists use to verify and</v>

877
00:49:22.981 --> 00:49:23.814
<v Speaker 3>test all of their hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you ended up throwing the baby out </v>

878
00:49:26.431 --> 00:49:27.264
<v Speaker 3>with the bathwater and the ICU people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have defined intelligence in a more </v>

879
00:49:32.251 --> 00:49:33.084
<v Speaker 3>stringent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stringent and accurate way than we've </v>

880
00:49:35.881 --> 00:49:39.690
<v Speaker 3>been able to define almost any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological construct.</v>

881
00:49:39.691 --> 00:49:42.780
<v Speaker 3>And so if you toss out the one that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>most well defined,</v>

882
00:49:42.781 --> 00:49:45.120
<v Speaker 3>then you're kind of stuck with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem of what are you going to do with</v>

883
00:49:45.121 --> 00:49:45.954
<v Speaker 3>all the ones that you have leftover that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are nowhere near as well defined or as </v>

884
00:49:49.081 --> 00:49:49.914
<v Speaker 3>well measured or as or as a or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or who's predictive validity as much </v>

885
00:49:55.201 --> 00:50:00.120
<v Speaker 3>less than it has been demonstrated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>much less vigor and clarity anyways.</v>

886
00:50:00.121 --> 00:50:00.954
<v Speaker 3>Despite all that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have posited a number of </v>

887
00:50:03.361 --> 00:50:06.950
<v Speaker 3>different intelligences and reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 3>so because there's a.</v>

888
00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:07.853
<v Speaker 3>If you think of intelligence as that </v>
<v Speaker 3>which might move you forward </v>

889
00:50:11.821 --> 00:50:12.654
<v Speaker 3>successfully in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously there's a fair number of </v>

890
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:16.403
<v Speaker 3>phenomena that are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals that might fit into that </v>

891
00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:19.770
<v Speaker 3>category.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have</v>

892
00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.240
<v Speaker 3>people have made these distinctions.</v>

893
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Bob Sternberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

894
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:30.704
<v Speaker 2>is distinguished between practical </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus analytical intelligence and he </v>

895
00:50:34.101 --> 00:50:34.934
<v Speaker 2>kind of thinks of practical as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>street smarts and has attempted to </v>

896
00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:39.014
<v Speaker 2>dissociate that from the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analytical intelligence that that </v>

897
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 2>characterize this more straight Iq </v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

898
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:46.034
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's done it successfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well at all and since the 19 </v>

899
00:50:48.981 --> 00:50:49.814
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in his practical intelligence </v>

900
00:50:52.251 --> 00:50:57.251
<v Speaker 2>has declined precipitously because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is matched head to head with standard</v>

901
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:58.363
<v Speaker 2>Iq intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Iq intelligence seats up all the </v>

902
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:01.724
<v Speaker 2>variability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really happened as far as I can </v>

903
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:08.120
<v Speaker 2>tell so far is that when we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>predict people's course through life,</v>

904
00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Iq does a very good job and then one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the traits does a very good job as well,</v>

905
00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:17.930
<v Speaker 2>which is conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't do as good a job as Iq.</v>

906
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.033
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that partly might be because we can't </v>

907
00:51:19.821 --> 00:51:21.440
<v Speaker 2>measure conscientiousness very well.</v>

908
00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:27.580
<v Speaker 2>We're stuck with self reports or maybe I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could gather peer reports about you or I</v>

909
00:51:27.581 --> 00:51:28.414
<v Speaker 2>could gather your parents reports about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your teachers reports and each of those </v>

910
00:51:31.661 --> 00:51:36.610
<v Speaker 2>seems to pick up a little bit more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pattern because you know yourself,</v>

911
00:51:36.611 --> 00:51:37.444
<v Speaker 2>but other people know you differently </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you know yourself and there are </v>

912
00:51:39.951 --> 00:51:40.784
<v Speaker 2>still some accuracy in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get multiple rater reports of </v>

913
00:51:43.631 --> 00:51:45.760
<v Speaker 2>something like conscientiousness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll up.</v>

914
00:51:45.761 --> 00:51:48.580
<v Speaker 2>It's predictive validity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the final analysis,</v>

915
00:51:48.581 --> 00:51:49.414
<v Speaker 2>the best you seem to be able to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with conscientiousness is about a point </v>

916
00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:54.070
<v Speaker 2>four correlation with longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

917
00:51:54.071 --> 00:51:54.904
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with Iq in complex jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can probably get point five and </v>

918
00:51:58.001 --> 00:51:58.834
<v Speaker 2>maybe point six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Point five is 25 percent of the </v>

919
00:52:01.571 --> 00:52:03.010
<v Speaker 2>variance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to square it.</v>

920
00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Point six is 30 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>36 percent of the variance,</v>

921
00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.040
<v Speaker 2>and point four is 16 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>variance.</v>

922
00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.030
<v Speaker 2>So even at the low end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say high end for conscientiousness</v>

923
00:52:13.031 --> 00:52:13.864
<v Speaker 2>is point four or 16 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Low End for Iq is point five or 25 </v>

924
00:52:18.341 --> 00:52:19.174
<v Speaker 2>percent low and estimates of Iq make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>one and a half times more powerful than </v>

925
00:52:22.751 --> 00:52:23.584
<v Speaker 2>the high end estimates of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and I think that's </v>

926
00:52:25.931 --> 00:52:27.100
<v Speaker 2>about right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd think,</v>

927
00:52:27.101 --> 00:52:27.934
<v Speaker 2>why do we even have to debate this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so bloody obvious to me </v>

928
00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:33.250
<v Speaker 2>that intelligence is a major predictor </v>
<v Speaker 2>of life success.</v>

929
00:52:33.251 --> 00:52:34.084
<v Speaker 2>I mean you people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've measured the Iq of University of </v>

930
00:52:36.281 --> 00:52:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Toronto people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

931
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.440
<v Speaker 2>people in this room who have an Iq of </v>
<v Speaker 2>less than 120 are rare.</v>

932
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

933
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:43.833
<v Speaker 2>Well smart people go to university now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that actually a contentious </v>

934
00:52:47.201 --> 00:52:48.034
<v Speaker 2>statement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What shouldn't be a contentious </v>

935
00:52:49.571 --> 00:52:50.830
<v Speaker 2>statement?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's self evident.</v>

936
00:52:50.831 --> 00:52:51.664
<v Speaker 2>Universities were actually set up so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that smart people could expand their </v>

937
00:52:54.521 --> 00:52:56.080
<v Speaker 2>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they were there.</v>

938
00:52:56.081 --> 00:52:56.914
<v Speaker 2>And you're selected on the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>assessments that are essentially there </v>

939
00:52:59.591 --> 00:53:04.591
<v Speaker 2>to assess something like intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

940
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:12.020
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will,</v>

941
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.930
<v Speaker 2>that will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is part of the controversy.</v>

942
00:53:13.931 --> 00:53:14.764
<v Speaker 2>Is it reasonable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a measurement issue and </v>

943
00:53:17.261 --> 00:53:18.094
<v Speaker 2>that's why we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I've been instructing you to </v>

944
00:53:19.511 --> 00:53:22.720
<v Speaker 2>some degree in psychometrics because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually know how to do this.</v>

945
00:53:22.721 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>We know how to answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's a look at how</v>

946
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:30.000
<v Speaker 3>at how intelligence has been assessed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and why,</v>

947
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 3>and then you can make up your own mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyways.</v>

948
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:33.024
<v Speaker 3>Here's some of the examples of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>forms of intelligence and so then the </v>

949
00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:38.400
<v Speaker 3>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

950
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:41.550
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean to have a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of intelligence?</v>

951
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:42.384
<v Speaker 3>Would would form a and form b be </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely uncorrelated like </v>

952
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:47.214
<v Speaker 3>extroversion and neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or would they be slightly correlated or </v>

953
00:53:49.381 --> 00:53:51.600
<v Speaker 3>would they be highly correlated and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might ask,</v>

954
00:53:51.601 --> 00:53:52.434
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how highly correlated did they have to </v>

955
00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:54.534
<v Speaker 3>be before they're the same thing or how </v>
<v Speaker 3>uncorrelated did they have to be before </v>

956
00:53:58.801 --> 00:53:59.634
<v Speaker 3>they're different things and actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer to that comes down to </v>

957
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:04.530
<v Speaker 3>something like practical utility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

958
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:05.873
<v Speaker 3>imagine I'm trying to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 3>well you'll do in university and I </v>

959
00:54:08.491 --> 00:54:12.510
<v Speaker 3>measure one thing and it's correlated at</v>
<v Speaker 3>point seven with another thing I measure</v>

960
00:54:12.511 --> 00:54:13.920
<v Speaker 3>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I might say,</v>

961
00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:14.754
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are those two things the same or </v>

962
00:54:15.391 --> 00:54:15.750
<v Speaker 3>different?</v>

963
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:18.030
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty highly correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your high and what it means you're going</v>

964
00:54:18.031 --> 00:54:19.740
<v Speaker 3>to be higher than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

965
00:54:19.741 --> 00:54:20.574
<v Speaker 3>so what is there any utility in </v>
<v Speaker 3>measuring both things and the way you </v>

966
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:26.640
<v Speaker 3>figured that out actually is you do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistically,</v>

967
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:27.474
<v Speaker 3>so we take the target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which might be your performance across </v>

968
00:54:30.481 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we say,</v>

969
00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:33.024
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we predict your performance across </v>

970
00:54:34.831 --> 00:54:38.370
<v Speaker 3>university better by using one variable </v>
<v Speaker 3>or two variables?</v>

971
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:41.460
<v Speaker 3>So we would enter them both into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>regression equation.</v>

972
00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:44.190
<v Speaker 3>All a regression equation does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite simple,</v>

973
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:45.383
<v Speaker 3>so you're trying to predict the target </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the regression age regression </v>

974
00:54:48.811 --> 00:54:51.960
<v Speaker 3>equation tells you how well you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>predict that target.</v>

975
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.003
<v Speaker 3>If you know another fact now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it gets a little complicated </v>

976
00:54:57.451 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 3>because that's a correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How well you can predict be with a well.</v>

977
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.770
<v Speaker 3>A regression will say how much you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>predict.</v>

978
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:09.830
<v Speaker 3>See if you know a and B or a and B and c</v>
<v Speaker 3>and d and e because you can use multiple</v>

979
00:55:10.591 --> 00:55:12.810
<v Speaker 3>predictors and you can weight them.</v>

980
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.290
<v Speaker 3>So it might be two times a plus one </v>
<v Speaker 3>times b equals c,</v>

981
00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:17.483
<v Speaker 3>and that's all a regression equation </v>
<v Speaker 3>does is just multiplication and </v>

982
00:55:19.591 --> 00:55:20.311
<v Speaker 3>addition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

983
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:21.144
<v Speaker 3>very straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so two variables are sufficiently </v>

984
00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:24.984
<v Speaker 3>different functionally if you can use </v>
<v Speaker 3>both of them simultaneously to predict </v>

985
00:55:28.561 --> 00:55:30.360
<v Speaker 3>something of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

986
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:33.310
<v Speaker 3>it's a tool like approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how the psychometricians do.</v>

987
00:55:33.311 --> 00:55:35.610
<v Speaker 3>It is something real well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>

988
00:55:35.611 --> 00:55:36.980
<v Speaker 3>If you can measure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>measure it,</v>

989
00:55:36.981 --> 00:55:37.814
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it helps you predict that that's how </v>

990
00:55:39.061 --> 00:55:40.680
<v Speaker 3>it's defined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then you might say,</v>

991
00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:41.514
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are are there these multiple </v>

992
00:55:44.431 --> 00:55:45.960
<v Speaker 3>intelligences?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

993
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.550
<v Speaker 3>the first question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

994
00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:51.000
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by are there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that would be,</v>

995
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.863
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's specify the question since we're </v>

996
00:55:53.251 --> 00:55:54.084
<v Speaker 3>going to be scientific about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's predict how well people do in </v>

997
00:55:56.491 --> 00:55:57.324
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll start with the assumption that </v>

998
00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.753
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if intelligence isn't associated with </v>

999
00:56:03.811 --> 00:56:04.644
<v Speaker 3>university success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're probably not talking about </v>

1000
00:56:07.111 --> 00:56:09.390
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you could argue that,</v>

1001
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:10.680
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you could say,</v>

1002
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:11.514
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence has nothing to do with </v>

1003
00:56:12.241 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 3>university success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a definitional matter.</v>

1004
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:15.803
<v Speaker 3>We'd have to agree to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it reasonable to start with the </v>

1005
00:56:19.471 --> 00:56:20.304
<v Speaker 3>presupposition that intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>university success share something in </v>

1006
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:24.730
<v Speaker 3>common?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1007
00:56:24.731 --> 00:56:28.930
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to be daft to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deny that initial proposition.</v>

1008
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Although you could,</v>

1009
00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:36.230
<v Speaker 3>because you could say it was privileged </v>
<v Speaker 3>or socioeconomic status or or or,</v>

1010
00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.250
<v Speaker 3>or any number of sociological phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of those are obviously relevant</v>

1011
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.040
<v Speaker 3>social class for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

1012
00:56:43.041 --> 00:56:47.780
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a higher social class and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all things being equal,</v>

1013
00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.810
<v Speaker 3>intelligence included,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a higher social class,</v>

1014
00:56:50.811 --> 00:56:53.330
<v Speaker 3>you're more likely to go to university </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you are if you're in a lower social</v>

1015
00:56:53.331 --> 00:56:54.530
<v Speaker 3>class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's other,</v>

1016
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.633
<v Speaker 3>there's other factors that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence whether or not you do well in </v>

1017
00:56:58.251 --> 00:56:59.084
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to assume that one of </v>

1018
00:57:00.051 --> 00:57:04.020
<v Speaker 3>them might be intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then you would ask,</v>

1019
00:57:04.021 --> 00:57:07.350
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you measured social intelligence,</v>

1020
00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 3>so that's what do they call that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Social Intelligence.</v>

1021
00:57:11.621 --> 00:57:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional intelligence,</v>

1022
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:16.480
<v Speaker 3>which does not exist by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emotional intelligence,</v>

1023
00:57:16.481 --> 00:57:18.460
<v Speaker 3>moral intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>linguistic musical,</v>

1024
00:57:18.461 --> 00:57:19.570
<v Speaker 3>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematical,</v>

1025
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:21.100
<v Speaker 3>spacial body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinesthetic,</v>

1026
00:57:21.101 --> 00:57:24.400
<v Speaker 3>interpersonal and intrapersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All different forms of intelligence.</v>

1027
00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:25.443
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to answer the question of whether </v>

1028
00:57:27.251 --> 00:57:28.084
<v Speaker 3>they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do first is pick a target </v>

1029
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:31.503
<v Speaker 3>prediction of university performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you make a measure for each of </v>

1030
00:57:34.031 --> 00:57:34.864
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you test to see if the measure </v>

1031
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:40.390
<v Speaker 3>measured the same thing across multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>instances within the same person.</v>

1032
00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:43.330
<v Speaker 3>That's a reliability tests because what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hell good is your ruler.</v>

1033
00:57:43.331 --> 00:57:44.164
<v Speaker 3>If it stretches when you use it has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure the same thing multiple times </v>

1034
00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:48.490
<v Speaker 3>and then you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1035
00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:49.443
<v Speaker 3>we'll take all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence is measured the way we've </v>

1036
00:57:52.871 --> 00:57:53.704
<v Speaker 3>decided to measure them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing we'll do is see how </v>

1037
00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:57.670
<v Speaker 3>highly correlated they are because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're complete,</v>

1038
00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:59.200
<v Speaker 3>two of them are completely correlated.</v>

1039
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.033
<v Speaker 3>Then you have one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to because that's </v>

1040
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.630
<v Speaker 3>virtually the definition of one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of two.</v>

1041
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.673
<v Speaker 3>You can factor analyze them and see if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pull out what's common across </v>

1042
00:58:08.741 --> 00:58:09.574
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing because then you </v>

1043
00:58:10.991 --> 00:58:11.561
<v Speaker 3>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1044
00:58:11.561 --> 00:58:15.250
<v Speaker 3>intelligence is what's common across all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the measures of these intelligences.</v>

1045
00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a fact.</v>

1046
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:19.990
<v Speaker 3>You have to decide if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with it,</v>

1047
00:58:19.991 --> 00:58:20.824
<v Speaker 3>but that if you were going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd use a factor analysis and you'd </v>

1048
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:24.124
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1049
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 3>if someone was more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>musical,</v>

1050
00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:27.723
<v Speaker 3>if they were also high in linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability and more likely to be logical </v>

1051
00:58:30.701 --> 00:58:33.370
<v Speaker 3>and mathematically inclined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they had a high spatial ability,</v>

1052
00:58:33.371 --> 00:58:34.204
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you'd be hypothesizing that there </v>

1053
00:58:35.801 --> 00:58:36.634
<v Speaker 3>was one factor behind all of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifestations that somehow similar and </v>

1054
00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:41.944
<v Speaker 3>maybe there wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you take all your measures and </v>

1055
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:44.764
<v Speaker 3>you put them in something like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple regression analysis and you'd </v>

1056
00:58:46.871 --> 00:58:50.890
<v Speaker 3>predict your target university </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance and then maybe you'd say,</v>

1057
00:58:50.891 --> 00:58:51.491
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

1058
00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 3>Let's not just use university </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>

1059
00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Let's use junior high performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high school performance,</v>

1060
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:59.103
<v Speaker 3>university performance and job success,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then let's say that the only things </v>

1061
00:59:03.611 --> 00:59:07.600
<v Speaker 3>that predict success across all of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>categories and that are the same,</v>

1062
00:59:07.601 --> 00:59:09.610
<v Speaker 3>we're going to define as intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1063
00:59:09.611 --> 00:59:11.440
<v Speaker 3>that's basically how you end up with Iq.</v>

1064
00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:15.723
<v Speaker 3>You could say that Iq is what's common </v>
<v Speaker 3>across all possible sets of of </v>

1065
00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:22.030
<v Speaker 3>intelligence tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now people are</v>

1066
00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:27.030
<v Speaker 3>going to debate that because you still </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to define what constitutes a test,</v>

1067
00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:28.683
<v Speaker 3>but the way the psychometricians have </v>
<v Speaker 3>managed it and have taken care of this </v>

1068
00:59:31.451 --> 00:59:32.950
<v Speaker 3>at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to say,</v>

1069
00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:35.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to.</v>

1070
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:38.320
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to define everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we measure as intelligence,</v>

1071
00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:41.050
<v Speaker 3>so extroverted people are more socially </v>
<v Speaker 3>fluent.</v>

1072
00:59:41.051 --> 00:59:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Are we going to call that intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1073
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:44.223
<v Speaker 3>We're going to call that personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to call that extroversion </v>

1074
00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:47.800
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to call stress </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerance.</v>

1075
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:49.083
<v Speaker 3>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1076
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:51.940
<v Speaker 3>if you can tolerate more stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're more intelligent.</v>

1077
00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:52.511
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1078
00:59:52.511 --> 00:59:53.980
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that isn't how we've defined it.</v>

1079
00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:56.590
<v Speaker 3>We're going to define that as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower in neuroticism.</v>

1080
00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:59.140
<v Speaker 3>If you're cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're more intelligent.</v>

1081
00:59:59.141 --> 01:00:01.120
<v Speaker 3>That's emotional intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1082
01:00:01.121 --> 01:00:03.430
<v Speaker 3>what you're less intelligent if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive.</v>

1083
01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1084
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:07.900
<v Speaker 3>So we parsed that off to agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then the question might be,</v>

1085
01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.320
<v Speaker 3>is there anything left of these so </v>
<v Speaker 3>called intelligences?</v>

1086
01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Once you control for personality and Iq </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the answer is no.</v>

1087
01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:17.793
<v Speaker 3>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing left of them and the people who </v>

1088
01:00:20.441 --> 01:00:21.274
<v Speaker 3>keep pushing these ideas keep trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>push them because they don't like the </v>

1089
01:00:23.861 --> 01:00:24.694
<v Speaker 3>idea of real individual differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me that's just a matter of </v>

1090
01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:28.024
<v Speaker 3>sticking your damn head in the sand </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's obvious here you're going </v>

1091
01:00:31.571 --> 01:00:32.404
<v Speaker 3>to have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want the child to have an Iq of 65 </v>

1092
01:00:34.871 --> 01:00:37.840
<v Speaker 3>or 145 decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1093
01:00:37.841 --> 01:00:39.310
<v Speaker 3>so you're all going to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1094
01:00:39.311 --> 01:00:42.610
<v Speaker 3>You think any one of you is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>vote to have a child with an Iq of 65,</v>

1095
01:00:42.611 --> 01:00:46.510
<v Speaker 3>that child's going to have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing even linguistic ability.</v>

1096
01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:49.120
<v Speaker 3>They're never going to learn to read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1097
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:51.700
<v Speaker 3>They're never going to leave home in all</v>
<v Speaker 3>likelihood.</v>

1098
01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.100
<v Speaker 3>So which child are you going to pick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1099
01:00:54.101 --> 01:00:55.660
<v Speaker 3>so do you believe in intelligence or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not?</v>

1100
01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.790
<v Speaker 3>Well obviously if you have any sense</v>

1101
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:04.210
<v Speaker 1>for every time something statistically </v>
<v Speaker 1>came up in the morning.</v>

1102
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1103
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>So all these things just have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical validity and just names.</v>

1104
01:01:12.751 --> 01:01:14.890
<v Speaker 1>So then if we're going to assign me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctor,</v>

1105
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.010
<v Speaker 1>are we assigning the names based on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we consider to be reasonable?</v>

1106
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

1107
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.970
<v Speaker 3>So look here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's one thing.</v>

1108
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:22.103
<v Speaker 3>So let's say this is actually what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened when people develop the big </v>

1109
01:01:24.391 --> 01:01:26.940
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to give a very large number</v>

1110
01:01:26.941 --> 01:01:31.260
<v Speaker 3>of people every question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every a huge set of questions that cover</v>

1111
01:01:31.261 --> 01:01:33.840
<v Speaker 3>every element of their personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can think of.</v>

1112
01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.670
<v Speaker 3>It's agnostic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1113
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.533
<v Speaker 3>What I'm really trying to do is come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the biggest possible set of </v>

1114
01:01:38.851 --> 01:01:42.590
<v Speaker 3>descriptors that someone could actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>fill out that's eliminated.</v>

1115
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:43.483
<v Speaker 3>I can't give you 10,000 questions as so </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I take a set of 10,000 questions </v>

1116
01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.970
<v Speaker 3>and randomly select a few sets of 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1117
01:01:50.971 --> 01:01:53.430
<v Speaker 3>Because then I would have represented </v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire set.</v>

1118
01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Then I give them to a thousand people </v>
<v Speaker 3>agnostically.</v>

1119
01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Then I do the factor analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang five factors come out,</v>

1120
01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:00.623
<v Speaker 3>and then the factor analysis tells me </v>
<v Speaker 3>which questions load on each factor in </v>

1121
01:02:04.171 --> 01:02:05.640
<v Speaker 3>what the factor analysis is saying.</v>

1122
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:09.210
<v Speaker 3>Here's 20 questions and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about them that's the same.</v>

1123
01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:11.370
<v Speaker 3>So then I read the questions and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1124
01:02:11.371 --> 01:02:12.204
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those questions are referring to </v>

1125
01:02:13.231 --> 01:02:15.330
<v Speaker 3>something the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

1126
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Well then maybe I talked to three </v>
<v Speaker 3>colleagues and we think,</v>

1127
01:02:17.761 --> 01:02:22.761
<v Speaker 3>well that's something like band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a name and then we could go see.</v>

1128
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Now that we have a measure of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sociability,</v>

1129
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:28.440
<v Speaker 3>we could go associated with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>measures of sociability.</v>

1130
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:29.430
<v Speaker 3>Like we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1131
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:32.400
<v Speaker 3>are people who score high on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure,</v>

1132
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:36.210
<v Speaker 3>associate it more likely to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>parties and the answer would be yes,</v>

1133
01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:41.160
<v Speaker 3>because what happens if you take 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions about personality and randomly</v>

1134
01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:41.994
<v Speaker 3>select sets of 100 and give each of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a thousand people and do a factor </v>

1135
01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:45.894
<v Speaker 3>analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first factor is extroversion and </v>

1136
01:02:48.511 --> 01:02:49.344
<v Speaker 3>it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the factor in human personality </v>

1137
01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:54.960
<v Speaker 3>that seems to pick up the biggest amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of variance and so so then we say from a</v>

1138
01:02:54.961 --> 01:02:57.600
<v Speaker 3>statistical perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extroversion is real,</v>

1139
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:58.890
<v Speaker 3>but we define real.</v>

1140
01:02:59.160 --> 01:02:59.993
<v Speaker 3>Real means that if you use linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation randomly applied across </v>

1141
01:03:05.191 --> 01:03:07.650
<v Speaker 3>large sets of people and you factor </v>
<v Speaker 3>analyze it,</v>

1142
01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:08.484
<v Speaker 3>these come out as clumped together </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to define what </v>

1143
01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:12.650
<v Speaker 3>constitutes real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to play that,</v>

1144
01:03:12.651 --> 01:03:13.484
<v Speaker 3>this is real game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically what you're doing in </v>

1145
01:03:14.911 --> 01:03:16.980
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's what happened with the big</v>

1146
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 3>five and then people started to look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1147
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:19.913
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a biological substrate for </v>

1148
01:03:20.971 --> 01:03:21.970
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

1149
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:25.620
<v Speaker 3>it turns out there is incentive reward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the positive reward system.</v>

1150
01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:26.993
<v Speaker 3>So and then while neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's often but not always the second </v>

1151
01:03:29.911 --> 01:03:30.721
<v Speaker 3>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1152
01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:33.120
<v Speaker 3>is there a biological basis for it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1153
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Threat sensitivity and pain sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seem to lock together.</v>

1154
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.003
<v Speaker 3>Agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the care system that Jaak </v>

1155
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Panksepp has identified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's basically.</v>

1156
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.940
<v Speaker 3>That's basically matter analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

1157
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:45.930
<v Speaker 3>You had another question</v>

1158
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.810
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence.</v>

1159
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because we found out how to measure</v>

1160
01:04:01.351 --> 01:04:03.840
<v Speaker 3>intelligence so and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll get into that right now.</v>

1161
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:05.040
<v Speaker 3>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1162
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.080
<v Speaker 3>how do you measure intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1163
01:04:07.081 --> 01:04:07.914
<v Speaker 3>well it's similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's similar to this linguistic </v>

1164
01:04:11.371 --> 01:04:13.350
<v Speaker 3>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's how it differs.</v>

1165
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.233
<v Speaker 3>Generate 10,000 questions that require </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and you get get 50 people to </v>

1166
01:04:19.111 --> 01:04:19.944
<v Speaker 3>do it and have them and have them be of </v>
<v Speaker 3>diverse opinions about what constitutes </v>

1167
01:04:24.031 --> 01:04:26.130
<v Speaker 3>knowledge so much the better then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover that.</v>

1168
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.640
<v Speaker 3>You want to oversample the territory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you want to have some quick questions</v>

1169
01:04:29.641 --> 01:04:30.474
<v Speaker 3>in there that only one person out of 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>would think that measures intelligence </v>

1170
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.960
<v Speaker 3>because you can over sample statistics </v>
<v Speaker 3>will take care of that.</v>

1171
01:04:36.961 --> 01:04:41.520
<v Speaker 3>So you want to ask more questions than </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think are reasonable and that's part</v>

1172
01:04:41.521 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 3>of the way that you get rid of bias in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sampling.</v>

1173
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:47.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like you think goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out 10 questions that someone could</v>

1174
01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:48.090
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

1175
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:50.070
<v Speaker 3>If you think they're intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what they are.</v>

1176
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.470
<v Speaker 3>And then 50 of you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bring me the questions.</v>

1177
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.513
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say we get a nice set of 10,000 </v>

1178
01:04:55.051 --> 01:04:55.884
<v Speaker 3>questions and we can take random sets of</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 and give them to a thousand people </v>

1179
01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.313
<v Speaker 3>and then we can score their answers to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the questions and then we can rank </v>

1180
01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:07.980
<v Speaker 3>order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could say correlate their performance</v>

1181
01:05:07.981 --> 01:05:11.850
<v Speaker 3>across different sets of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I give you one set of 100 questions.</v>

1182
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.730
<v Speaker 3>You scored 90.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you another set of questions.</v>

1183
01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:18.030
<v Speaker 3>You score 90 out of 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you score out of 100.</v>

1184
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Well then we would think if a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people did that,</v>

1185
01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.213
<v Speaker 3>those aren't measuring the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you're high on one and you </v>

1186
01:05:23.561 --> 01:05:27.490
<v Speaker 3>should be high on all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well with Iq it's like if you do that,</v>

1187
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.320
<v Speaker 3>the reliability is like point nine.</v>

1188
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.280
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take one set of 100 questions,</v>

1189
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:37.450
<v Speaker 3>you rank order people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take another set of 100 questions.</v>

1190
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:40.420
<v Speaker 3>You rank order people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you correlate the rank orders.</v>

1191
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:44.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like this is point nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people who did well in one do on all</v>

1192
01:05:44.801 --> 01:05:45.634
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people who did bad on one do bad on </v>

1193
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.860
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ICU or more technically,</v>

1194
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:51.963
<v Speaker 3>this is what Iq is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a thousand people and give them 20 </v>

1195
01:05:56.111 --> 01:06:00.790
<v Speaker 3>tests of 100 items and then factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>analyze the 20 tests and extract out the</v>

1196
01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:03.220
<v Speaker 3>central factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's g,</v>

1197
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.880
<v Speaker 3>that's fluid intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then what do you do with that?</v>

1198
01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Well then you can try to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can see,</v>

1199
01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:11.170
<v Speaker 3>well is there a biological basis for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

1200
01:06:11.171 --> 01:06:12.004
<v Speaker 3>Is there something about if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher in the ability to operate across </v>

1201
01:06:15.251 --> 01:06:16.084
<v Speaker 3>these sets of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there things about you that are </v>

1202
01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:18.520
<v Speaker 3>physiologically different?</v>

1203
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.390
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your reaction time is faster,</v>

1204
01:06:22.391 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 3>just simple reaction time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so light turns on you push a button,</v>

1205
01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.450
<v Speaker 3>light turns on you push a button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1206
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:31.180
<v Speaker 3>There's a lag between the light going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you pushing the button.</v>

1207
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.370
<v Speaker 3>The shorter the lag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the smarter you are.</v>

1208
01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:34.853
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it that's really interesting </v>

1209
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:39.430
<v Speaker 3>because you know if you're perceiving </v>
<v Speaker 3>something complex,</v>

1210
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.990
<v Speaker 3>it takes a lot of neural connections to </v>
<v Speaker 3>generate the perception,</v>

1211
01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.410
<v Speaker 3>but simple reaction time is like two </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurons whack.</v>

1212
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.633
<v Speaker 3>There's no complexity in that at all and</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet how fast you are at that is still </v>

1213
01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:54.130
<v Speaker 3>correlated only at about point two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

1214
01:06:54.131 --> 01:06:57.580
<v Speaker 3>but that's not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing research in psychology,</v>

1215
01:06:57.581 --> 01:06:58.414
<v Speaker 3>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you come out with a point two five </v>

1216
01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.310
<v Speaker 3>correlation between whatever you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>measuring and whatever you're interested</v>

1217
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:05.200
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having a pretty good day.</v>

1218
01:07:05.201 --> 01:07:06.034
<v Speaker 3>Point two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five is not bad at all and so it's not </v>

1219
01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.424
<v Speaker 3>accounting for all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's accounting for a fair bit of </v>

1220
01:07:10.991 --> 01:07:12.670
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how big your head is.</v>

1221
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:13.833
<v Speaker 3>That's also correlated how how big your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain is physically and then even more </v>

1222
01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:20.140
<v Speaker 3>accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how big your brain is in relationship to</v>

1223
01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:21.460
<v Speaker 3>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now again,</v>

1224
01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:23.440
<v Speaker 3>these are small correlations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>

1225
01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:26.740
<v Speaker 3>They're not nonsignificant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

1226
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.530
<v Speaker 3>Nerve peripheral nerve conduction </v>
<v Speaker 3>velocity.</v>

1227
01:07:29.531 --> 01:07:30.364
<v Speaker 3>That's this study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two studies with sample sizes of 90 and </v>

1228
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:34.054
<v Speaker 3>90 roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are reported that investigated </v>

1229
01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:37.510
<v Speaker 3>relationships among measures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

1230
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:38.344
<v Speaker 3>speed of information processing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and peripheral nerve conduction </v>

1231
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:42.370
<v Speaker 3>velocity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In both studies,</v>

1232
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:46.240
<v Speaker 3>neural conduction velocity was </v>
<v Speaker 3>significantly correlated with Iq scores.</v>

1233
01:07:46.241 --> 01:07:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Point four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two point four,</v>

1234
01:07:47.471 --> 01:07:48.490
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1235
01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.250
<v Speaker 3>that's a whopping correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do I know that?</v>

1236
01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Because a guy named Hemphill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is he right there.</v>

1237
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.471
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1238
01:07:56.471 --> 01:07:59.890
<v Speaker 3>how big is the correlation Coefficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you call it big?</v>

1239
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:03.100
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is generally lets</v>
<v Speaker 3>guests.</v>

1240
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.053
<v Speaker 3>So if you talk to psychologists and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked to you about how big the effect </v>

1241
01:08:07.091 --> 01:08:07.924
<v Speaker 3>sizes are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use guesses that were generated by </v>

1242
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:11.463
<v Speaker 3>statisticians in the fifties and so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>radically underestimate the actual of </v>

1243
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:19.100
<v Speaker 3>correlation coefficients because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>never studied it empirically.</v>

1244
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy handheld because here,</v>

1245
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:24.170
<v Speaker 3>how big is the correlation Coefficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be big?</v>

1246
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 3>How do you answer that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a thousand psychology studies rank,</v>

1247
01:08:28.611 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 3>order the effect sizes and break them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into percentiles,</v>

1248
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:33.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an empirical way of doing it.</v>

1249
01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:36.440
<v Speaker 3>How big is the effect that the typical </v>
<v Speaker 3>study generates?</v>

1250
01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:37.543
<v Speaker 3>Then you can use that as a way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>assessing how impressive the effect is </v>

1251
01:08:40.941 --> 01:08:42.020
<v Speaker 3>that you generated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1252
01:08:42.021 --> 01:08:43.190
<v Speaker 3>so this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here,</v>

1253
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Hemphill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2003.</v>

1254
01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Interpreting the magnitude of </v>
<v Speaker 3>correlation coefficient.</v>

1255
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.573
<v Speaker 3>Now you could say that's a dopey way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it because why defined size in </v>

1256
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:56.540
<v Speaker 3>accordance with the size that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have discovered and handheld would say,</v>

1257
01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.710
<v Speaker 3>well that's because I'm doing it this </v>
<v Speaker 3>way with this paper.</v>

1258
01:09:00.711 --> 01:09:02.780
<v Speaker 3>If you want to do it a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go right ahead,</v>

1259
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.740
<v Speaker 3>but there's utility in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You come up with an RF point two,</v>

1260
01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.633
<v Speaker 3>how likely is it that your next paper is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have an effect size of that </v>

1261
01:09:10.941 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 3>magnitude?</v>

1262
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.370
<v Speaker 3>How happy should you be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1263
01:09:13.371 --> 01:09:15.230
<v Speaker 3>the answer is a lot happier than you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

1264
01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:20.860
<v Speaker 3>So to get it our of point five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's 25 percent of the variance.</v>

1265
01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:21.884
<v Speaker 3>So you still have 75 percent of whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining your phenomena left to be </v>

1266
01:09:24.921 --> 01:09:27.800
<v Speaker 3>explained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our point five,</v>

1267
01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:30.500
<v Speaker 3>92 90,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 97th percentile,</v>

1268
01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:35.090
<v Speaker 3>so 19 out of 20 psychology studies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are published and that's a hell of a lot</v>

1269
01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:37.790
<v Speaker 3>more fewer psychology studies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>

1270
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:38.624
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this tiny fraction of them get </v>

1271
01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:43.490
<v Speaker 3>published,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95 percent of them show up a correlation</v>

1272
01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:47.330
<v Speaker 3>coefficient of less than point five for </v>
<v Speaker 3>her third point three,</v>

1273
01:09:47.331 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two point five,</v>

1274
01:09:48.231 --> 01:09:49.064
<v Speaker 3>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that's greater than 75 percent of </v>

1275
01:09:50.991 --> 01:09:52.040
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Point one,</v>

1276
01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:52.430
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>

1277
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:53.263
<v Speaker 3>Point three five is pretty typical and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the typical correlation between a </v>

1278
01:09:56.361 --> 01:09:57.194
<v Speaker 3>personality trait and the target of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest is usually something in the </v>

1279
01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:02.330
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood of point two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two point two five.</v>

1280
01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:04.460
<v Speaker 3>With Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get up two point five.</v>

1281
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.593
<v Speaker 3>The relationship between income </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality and male homicide is like </v>

1282
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:10.370
<v Speaker 3>point seven five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just covers all of it,</v>

1283
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.480
<v Speaker 3>which is to say that everywhere that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's poor,</v>

1284
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.510
<v Speaker 3>there's no male homicide and everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>that everyone's rich,</v>

1285
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:21.170
<v Speaker 3>there's no male homicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but places where there's poor people and</v>

1286
01:10:21.171 --> 01:10:23.540
<v Speaker 3>rich people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the male homicide rate goes way the hell</v>

1287
01:10:23.541 --> 01:10:24.374
<v Speaker 3>up right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's a steep distribution </v>

1288
01:10:27.381 --> 01:10:28.214
<v Speaker 3>because the men at the bottom think </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody has a lot more than me and </v>

1289
01:10:30.681 --> 01:10:33.380
<v Speaker 3>that's not very fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do something about that and</v>

1290
01:10:33.381 --> 01:10:36.210
<v Speaker 3>that usually means killing other men and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a.</v>

1291
01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:40.010
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievably powerful relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a useful thing to keep squirreled</v>

1292
01:10:40.011 --> 01:10:43.610
<v Speaker 3>away in your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poverty does not cause crime.</v>

1293
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Relative poverty causes crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a completely different thing,</v>

1294
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:54.920
<v Speaker 3>so and its dominance hierarchy issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally it's men.</v>

1295
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:55.813
<v Speaker 3>Men are generally the criminals and as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dominance hierarchy gets harder to </v>

1296
01:10:58.281 --> 01:10:59.210
<v Speaker 3>climb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the young man,</v>

1297
01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 3>especially the aggressive ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get more likely to turn to violence.</v>

1298
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:05.180
<v Speaker 3>You really need to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So credibly important fact.</v>

1299
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to interview the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured that out.</v>

1300
01:11:07.701 --> 01:11:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Martin Daly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to interview him for one of my</v>

1301
01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.364
<v Speaker 3>podcasts in the next month or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you might be interested in tuning in </v>

1302
01:11:12.561 --> 01:11:13.920
<v Speaker 3>on that if you're interested in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of thing.</v>

1303
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.710
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so back to these correlations.</v>

1304
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:17.544
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>peripheral nerve conduction velocity is </v>

1305
01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 3>correlated with Iq at like point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say point four five.</v>

1306
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a whopping effect man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's.</v>

1307
01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:26.844
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty straightforward thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Speed of electrical propagation along </v>

1308
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 3>your neural tissue determines how </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent you are.</v>

1309
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:35.490
<v Speaker 3>While is that really so surprising you'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>expect,</v>

1310
01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.340
<v Speaker 3>if that's associated with neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>integrity,</v>

1311
01:11:38.341 --> 01:11:40.770
<v Speaker 3>at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the sort of thing you would</v>

1312
01:11:40.771 --> 01:11:41.604
<v Speaker 3>expect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it shows you how biologically based </v>

1313
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:45.210
<v Speaker 3>it is too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Faster.</v>

1314
01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:46.044
<v Speaker 3>Neural conductance philosophy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with higher Iq scores and </v>

1315
01:11:48.391 --> 01:11:50.730
<v Speaker 3>faster speed of processing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1316
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a hypothesis.</v>

1317
01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.670
<v Speaker 3>What if you're trying to remember a </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone number?</v>

1318
01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:00.504
<v Speaker 3>Just the seven digit one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you do when you're remembering </v>

1319
01:12:02.071 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 3>the phone number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say it over and over again,</v>

1320
01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:05.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you or you.</v>

1321
01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:07.890
<v Speaker 3>If you don't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it over and over again,</v>

1322
01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:10.620
<v Speaker 3>and if someone distracts you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you lose it.</v>

1323
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:15.450
<v Speaker 3>That's working memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking and your working memory</v>

1324
01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.613
<v Speaker 3>capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so imagine you could do four digits and </v>

1325
01:12:19.141 --> 01:12:21.120
<v Speaker 3>remember them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do six,</v>

1326
01:12:21.121 --> 01:12:22.800
<v Speaker 3>you could do eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do 12,</v>

1327
01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:23.933
<v Speaker 3>likely not 12 is really pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great estimator of Iq working </v>

1328
01:12:27.631 --> 01:12:28.464
<v Speaker 3>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1329
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:29.783
<v Speaker 3>there's almost no neuropsychologists </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to think that working memory is </v>

1330
01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:34.104
<v Speaker 3>something in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's because they don't know a </v>

1331
01:12:35.461 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 3>damn thing about psychometrics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Generally speaking,</v>

1332
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:38.603
<v Speaker 3>there's almost no difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>fluid intelligence and working memory </v>

1333
01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:42.053
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is that all </v>
<v Speaker 3>measures of intellectual function </v>

1334
01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:50.370
<v Speaker 3>collapse into Ge and so we can take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at what that means.</v>

1335
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.600
<v Speaker 3>This is from this character here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carol joynt.</v>

1336
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:55.463
<v Speaker 3>Carol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to know everything there is </v>

1337
01:12:56.851 --> 01:12:57.684
<v Speaker 3>to know about Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a book that everyone who's a </v>

1338
01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:01.830
<v Speaker 3>psychologist should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should.</v>

1339
01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:02.843
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be able to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologist unless you've read this </v>

1340
01:13:04.201 --> 01:13:05.220
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my estimation.</v>

1341
01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:07.560
<v Speaker 3>There's a couple of key texts and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is one of them.</v>

1342
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.461
<v Speaker 3>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carol,</v>

1343
01:13:08.461 --> 01:13:09.294
<v Speaker 3>wrote this thick book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to read the whole thing </v>

1344
01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:11.724
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of it's just in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrations and proof of what he </v>

1345
01:13:14.761 --> 01:13:17.550
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what he did for Iq is the same thing</v>

1346
01:13:17.551 --> 01:13:20.070
<v Speaker 3>that psychometricians did for the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

1347
01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 3>You've got the big two at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not very highly correlated.</v>

1348
01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it's about point two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1349
01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:29.790
<v Speaker 3>So they're pretty independent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they fragment into the big five and</v>

1350
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:30.624
<v Speaker 3>then you can differentiate them further </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the big tent and there really are </v>

1351
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 3>five different traits because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>only correlated with each other at about</v>

1352
01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:39.720
<v Speaker 3>point two to point three.</v>

1353
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.500
<v Speaker 3>So really quite distinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1354
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:46.590
<v Speaker 3>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you fractionate Iq,</v>

1355
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:50.010
<v Speaker 3>how correlated are the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>fractionated into.</v>

1356
01:13:50.011 --> 01:13:52.290
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is point eight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>point nine.</v>

1357
01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:57.290
<v Speaker 3>There's one factor in Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking you,</v>

1358
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take</v>

1359
01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:04.710
<v Speaker 3>imagine that you took an Iq test and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>took,</v>

1360
01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:07.083
<v Speaker 3>it was 100 items long and you took the </v>
<v Speaker 3>50 items that were the most correlated </v>

1361
01:14:10.051 --> 01:14:10.884
<v Speaker 3>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the 50 items that were the </v>

1362
01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:13.924
<v Speaker 3>least correlated with those 50 items.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you broke it into two as much as you </v>

1363
01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:19.630
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you maximally differentiated,</v>

1364
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:21.123
<v Speaker 3>you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how correlated with the scores </v>

1365
01:14:22.571 --> 01:14:26.020
<v Speaker 3>beyond those two different subsets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the answer would be like point nine</v>

1366
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:29.740
<v Speaker 3>because there isn't two things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're measuring.</v>

1367
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Even if you break it up that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>post hoc and say,</v>

1368
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:35.230
<v Speaker 3>well it's unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to say because these are</v>

1369
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.320
<v Speaker 3>the 50 most highly correlated and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the leftovers,</v>

1370
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 3>like we're really capitalizing on chance</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1371
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:41.643
<v Speaker 3>You're still going to get an almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>identical readout from both sections of </v>

1372
01:14:44.561 --> 01:14:47.860
<v Speaker 3>the Iq test and it's just not the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>with personality.</v>

1373
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.903
<v Speaker 3>So and so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is carol's model basically stratum </v>

1374
01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the highest level of abstraction.</v>

1375
01:14:55.181 --> 01:14:56.014
<v Speaker 3>That's fluid intelligence and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can break it down into these sub </v>

1376
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 3>categories of cognitive ability and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might say,</v>

1377
01:15:02.141 --> 01:15:04.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how different are those subcategories?</v>

1378
01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:06.970
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is not very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're high in one,</v>

1379
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.740
<v Speaker 3>you're very likely to be high in all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1380
01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:13.890
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a bit of a Coda to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that the lower your Iq,</v>

1381
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:20.050
<v Speaker 3>the higher the correlation between these</v>
<v Speaker 3>sub aspects of intelligence,</v>

1382
01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.273
<v Speaker 3>the lower your Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the higher the correlation between the </v>

1383
01:15:23.441 --> 01:15:24.274
<v Speaker 3>sub aspects of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you get up into the higher strata of </v>

1384
01:15:27.161 --> 01:15:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your eye,</v>

1385
01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.593
<v Speaker 3>your intelligence differentiates more </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the potential range of </v>

1386
01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:32.944
<v Speaker 3>differentiation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say there's one way of not </v>

1387
01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:36.034
<v Speaker 3>being very bright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's multiple ways of being </v>

1388
01:15:39.011 --> 01:15:39.844
<v Speaker 3>bright.</v>

1389
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.880
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even even so,</v>

1390
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.903
<v Speaker 3>if you're high on one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still quite likely to be high on </v>

1391
01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:45.124
<v Speaker 3>the rest of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then the question is what's the </v>

1392
01:15:46.811 --> 01:15:47.644
<v Speaker 3>correlation between Ge and each of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>sub elements of Ge and then what's the </v>

1393
01:15:51.251 --> 01:15:53.680
<v Speaker 3>correlation between the sub elements of </v>
<v Speaker 3>GE themselves?</v>

1394
01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:58.300
<v Speaker 3>So if this was plasticity and we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at openness and extroversion,</v>

1395
01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.850
<v Speaker 3>the correlation here would be about </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1396
01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I think it's about point five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

1397
01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.880
<v Speaker 3>and the correlation between openness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>extroversion would be about point three.</v>

1398
01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Quite a bit of difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with this,</v>

1399
01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:13.480
<v Speaker 3>there's GE,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the sub elements,</v>

1400
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.690
<v Speaker 3>there's the correlation coefficients </v>
<v Speaker 3>point nine,</v>

1401
01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:19.540
<v Speaker 3>almost point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five point.</v>

1402
01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:21.220
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six or eight?</v>

1403
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Eight point eight point six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point eight,</v>

1404
01:16:23.891 --> 01:16:25.030
<v Speaker 3>point eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point nine.</v>

1405
01:16:25.031 --> 01:16:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Point nine.</v>

1406
01:16:26.051 --> 01:16:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1407
01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.860
<v Speaker 3>you can fractionate it the best you </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly can.</v>

1408
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:32.110
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing.</v>

1409
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:33.663
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing and it looks like it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to abstractly represent and </v>

1410
01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:40.570
<v Speaker 3>then to manipulate the abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said with working memory,</v>

1411
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:41.733
<v Speaker 3>you know you can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's simply how many digits can you </v>

1412
01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:48.280
<v Speaker 3>keep in your head simultaneously without</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropping one.</v>

1413
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.320
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

1414
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:52.810
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty straightforward.</v>

1415
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.020
<v Speaker 3>And then it's this viciously powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>predictor of longterm life success.</v>

1416
01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Probably prediction of around point </v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

1417
01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Now psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologists hate this.</v>

1418
01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.513
<v Speaker 3>They won't admit that it exists and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it's because there's something </v>

1419
01:17:08.021 --> 01:17:11.660
<v Speaker 3>about intelligence that against our </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsic egalitarianism,</v>

1420
01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:13.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two things that do it.</v>

1421
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:15.530
<v Speaker 3>First,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're successful.</v>

1422
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:17.840
<v Speaker 3>You like to think I'm successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1423
01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:19.790
<v Speaker 3>and you like to attribute it to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own,</v>

1424
01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Fair enough.</v>

1425
01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.373
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that there isn't an </v>
<v Speaker 3>element of it that's your own doing </v>

1426
01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:25.334
<v Speaker 3>whatever that means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if your nerve conductive velocity </v>

1427
01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.353
<v Speaker 3>happens to be high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot more probability that </v>

1428
01:17:31.941 --> 01:17:32.774
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be successful and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of hard to blame that on you or to </v>

1429
01:17:35.301 --> 01:17:36.680
<v Speaker 3>attribute it to you for that matter.</v>

1430
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:41.890
<v Speaker 3>So it indicates a kind of statistical </v>
<v Speaker 3>arbitrary ness about the distribution of</v>

1431
01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.470
<v Speaker 3>success and failure in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1432
01:17:44.471 --> 01:17:46.580
<v Speaker 3>so that's one thing people don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that idea.</v>

1433
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:47.623
<v Speaker 3>The second thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it turns out to be very </v>

1434
01:17:50.841 --> 01:17:51.674
<v Speaker 3>difficult to raise Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's tricky because it looks like </v>

1435
01:17:55.731 --> 01:17:56.564
<v Speaker 3>you can raise Iq across whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations because these fluid </v>

1436
01:18:00.141 --> 01:18:00.974
<v Speaker 3>intelligence looks like it's been rising</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite substantially over the last </v>

1437
01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:07.430
<v Speaker 3>hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe as people are better nourished and</v>

1438
01:18:07.431 --> 01:18:08.264
<v Speaker 3>better educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also more prone to continually </v>

1439
01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:13.820
<v Speaker 3>manipulate abstractions in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I mean kids start with computers</v>

1440
01:18:13.821 --> 01:18:15.390
<v Speaker 3>when they're like two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1441
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.333
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you take a group of people and </v>

1442
01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:22.790
<v Speaker 3>you try to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take a group of low Iq people and</v>

1443
01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:24.500
<v Speaker 3>you try to raise their Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

1444
01:18:24.501 --> 01:18:27.290
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to manage it without a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of investment.</v>

1445
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.620
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't necessarily mean the </v>
<v Speaker 3>investment isn't worthwhile,</v>

1446
01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:32.210
<v Speaker 3>but it does mean that it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult.</v>

1447
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:36.463
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best thing to do as far as we can </v>

1448
01:18:38.151 --> 01:18:40.100
<v Speaker 3>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best thing to do is get nourishment.</v>

1449
01:18:40.101 --> 01:18:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems to be the most effective.</v>

1450
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:43.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1451
01:18:43.941 --> 01:18:45.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm part of the reason.</v>

1452
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:46.663
<v Speaker 3>Part of the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the theory is part of the reason that </v>

1453
01:18:48.351 --> 01:18:49.184
<v Speaker 3>population iqs have been increasing over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last hundred years is because </v>

1454
01:18:52.011 --> 01:18:52.844
<v Speaker 3>there's just no one left who's seriously</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough malnourished so that it's going </v>

1455
01:18:56.661 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 3>to profoundly impact their intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities.</v>

1456
01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:02.840
<v Speaker 3>So breastfeeding seems to raise Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's two,</v>

1457
01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.713
<v Speaker 3>two points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three points with every year of </v>

1458
01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:06.320
<v Speaker 3>breastfeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>

1459
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:07.070
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1460
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:08.600
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually quite a lot.</v>

1461
01:19:08.601 --> 01:19:10.910
<v Speaker 3>Two or three points actually makes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference as it turns out.</v>

1462
01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.550
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1463
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's Iq real depends what you mean by</v>

1464
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:18.704
<v Speaker 3>real Iq is average performance across </v>
<v Speaker 3>average sets of questions that require </v>

1465
01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:30.581
<v Speaker 3>abstraction to conceive of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and answer is it real well,</v>

1466
01:19:31.101 --> 01:19:31.934
<v Speaker 3>it's real statistically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can use it to predict important </v>

1467
01:19:34.791 --> 01:19:39.791
<v Speaker 3>outcomes that other things can't predict</v>
<v Speaker 3>and from a scientific perspective,</v>

1468
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:45.200
<v Speaker 3>and it's also correlated with various </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiological and biological phenomena.</v>

1469
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:46.363
<v Speaker 3>While that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you define real </v>

1470
01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:48.920
<v Speaker 3>scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>

1471
01:19:48.921 --> 01:19:49.754
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are there other factors that determine </v>

1472
01:19:52.071 --> 01:19:52.904
<v Speaker 3>people's success and worth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq Isn't a measure of people's worth in </v>

1473
01:19:56.451 --> 01:19:58.070
<v Speaker 3>any intrinsic sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1474
01:19:58.190 --> 01:20:01.920
<v Speaker 3>it's an estimate of their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>succeed in abs,</v>

1475
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.863
<v Speaker 3>in hierarchies that are dependent on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to manipulate complex sets of </v>

1476
01:20:06.561 --> 01:20:07.394
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of other things about </v>

1477
01:20:08.941 --> 01:20:12.960
<v Speaker 3>people that differentiate them in terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of quality and quantity and all of those</v>

1478
01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:13.794
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the most evidence of those are the </v>

1479
01:20:15.451 --> 01:20:16.980
<v Speaker 3>big five traits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1480
01:20:16.981 --> 01:20:17.814
<v Speaker 3>if you're a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is another thing every </v>

1481
01:20:19.291 --> 01:20:20.124
<v Speaker 3>psychologist should be taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to discover something about </v>

1482
01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:27.870
<v Speaker 3>human beings that hasn't already been </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered,</v>

1483
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:32.640
<v Speaker 3>the first thing you should do is make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure it isn't Iq and it isn't any of the</v>

1484
01:20:32.641 --> 01:20:33.474
<v Speaker 3>big five traits and psychologists almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>never do that because what happens is </v>

1485
01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 3>that if they control for ICU,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in regression you'd say,</v>

1486
01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:41.094
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing I'm interested in </v>

1487
01:20:41.731 --> 01:20:42.510
<v Speaker 3>predicting.</v>

1488
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:44.760
<v Speaker 3>The first thing we're going to do is add</v>
<v Speaker 3>ICU and not.</v>

1489
01:20:44.761 --> 01:20:45.594
<v Speaker 3>I've measured that you took in five </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes either like a real Iq test </v>

1490
01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:49.403
<v Speaker 3>because you want to use a good measure </v>
<v Speaker 3>to test your hypothesis against and not </v>

1491
01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:56.340
<v Speaker 3>a 10 item measure of the big five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either like 100 item measure.</v>

1492
01:20:56.341 --> 01:20:59.370
<v Speaker 3>So you get a reliable measure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You throw in Icu,</v>

1493
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:00.293
<v Speaker 3>you throw in the big five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you throw in your dopey </v>

1494
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:04.680
<v Speaker 3>construct and then you see if it can </v>
<v Speaker 3>predict anything.</v>

1495
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:08.880
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so psychologists don't do it because</v>

1496
01:21:08.881 --> 01:21:09.714
<v Speaker 3>whenever they do it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it destroys their construct and that </v>

1497
01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:15.840
<v Speaker 3>makes them irritated because their claim</v>
<v Speaker 3>to their position.</v>

1498
01:21:15.841 --> 01:21:20.130
<v Speaker 3>Of Authority in the educational </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchy is predicated on the</v>

1499
01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:22.260
<v Speaker 3>validity of their construct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1500
01:21:22.261 --> 01:21:23.094
<v Speaker 3>if you're a real scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you try to do is destroy your </v>

1501
01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:26.550
<v Speaker 3>construct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

1502
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:29.070
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like this is real.</v>

1503
01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:30.053
<v Speaker 3>Then you think it's probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to spend the next 10 </v>

1504
01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:33.954
<v Speaker 3>years chasing a ghost and a Mira,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to try to destroy the damn </v>

1505
01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:39.000
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you say,</v>

1506
01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll match it up against a good measure</v>

1507
01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:44.280
<v Speaker 3>of Iq and a comprehensive big five and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it still survives.</v>

1508
01:21:44.281 --> 01:21:45.114
<v Speaker 3>We'll do a couple of replications to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that we can't kill it any </v>

1509
01:21:47.551 --> 01:21:48.384
<v Speaker 3>other way and maybe we'll do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistics three or four different ways </v>

1510
01:21:51.001 --> 01:21:51.834
<v Speaker 3>to make sure that the thing just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>disappear when you use a different </v>

1511
01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:57.570
<v Speaker 3>statistical procedure and people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that,</v>

1512
01:21:57.571 --> 01:21:58.404
<v Speaker 3>and that's why the replication rate even</v>
<v Speaker 3>among well established psychological </v>

1513
01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.240
<v Speaker 3>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

1514
01:22:03.241 --> 01:22:06.930
<v Speaker 3>once that have been highly cited is </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily low and no,</v>

1515
01:22:06.931 --> 01:22:07.764
<v Speaker 3>if you talk to psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll wave their hands and they'll </v>

1516
01:22:09.511 --> 01:22:09.811
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1517
01:22:09.811 --> 01:22:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't really believe in Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1518
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:12.713
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1519
01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:15.270
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about what do you call</v>
<v Speaker 3>those?</v>

1520
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.823
<v Speaker 3>What did the ghostbusters hunt down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about paranormal </v>

1521
01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:23.100
<v Speaker 3>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not things you get to believe in</v>

1522
01:22:23.101 --> 01:22:23.940
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1523
01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:27.090
<v Speaker 3>There are rules for defining what </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitutes something that's real from a</v>

1524
01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:29.910
<v Speaker 3>scientific perspective and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychometric perspective,</v>

1525
01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:31.420
<v Speaker 3>so you don't get to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1526
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.770
<v Speaker 3>apply one definition of reality because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like Icu,</v>

1527
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:38.550
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll use the same definition to</v>
<v Speaker 3>justify my own constructs.</v>

1528
01:22:38.551 --> 01:22:39.384
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1529
01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.610
<v Speaker 3>that isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not You can do that.</v>

1530
01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:43.470
<v Speaker 3>If you're a postmodernist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do that,</v>

1531
01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:46.050
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a person who actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks scientifically,</v>

1532
01:22:46.051 --> 01:22:49.970
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to play that game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now you know,</v>

1533
01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:52.500
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason that we need to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>about these sorts of things.</v>

1534
01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:57.150
<v Speaker 3>See how are we doing for time here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1535
01:22:57.151 --> 01:22:57.984
<v Speaker 3>we're doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to know these things </v>

1536
01:23:00.391 --> 01:23:02.580
<v Speaker 3>partly because they have policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>implications.</v>

1537
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:03.413
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to know them for your own life </v>

1538
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:08.110
<v Speaker 3>because you got to know that there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences in intelligence.</v>

1539
01:23:08.111 --> 01:23:08.944
<v Speaker 3>It's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go into a job and you're not </v>

1540
01:23:11.441 --> 01:23:12.274
<v Speaker 3>smart enough for that job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have one bloody </v>

1541
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:14.824
<v Speaker 3>miserable time and you're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>life wretched for the people around you </v>

1542
01:23:17.651 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 3>because you won't be able to handle the </v>
<v Speaker 3>position and as you climb hierarchies of</v>

1543
01:23:21.671 --> 01:23:22.504
<v Speaker 3>competence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the demand on fluid intelligence </v>

1544
01:23:24.161 --> 01:23:27.190
<v Speaker 3>increases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so unless you want to fail,</v>

1545
01:23:27.191 --> 01:23:30.340
<v Speaker 3>you don't put yourself in over your head</v>
<v Speaker 3>while what's over your head.</v>

1546
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a tricky thing to figure out.</v>

1547
01:23:32.410 --> 01:23:34.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have to figure that out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

1548
01:23:34.811 --> 01:23:36.580
<v Speaker 3>You have to figure it out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness.</v>

1549
01:23:36.581 --> 01:23:38.050
<v Speaker 3>You have to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With creativity,</v>

1550
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.890
<v Speaker 3>you have to figure out with stress </v>
<v Speaker 3>tolerance with agreeableness because you</v>

1551
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:44.590
<v Speaker 3>want to go into a cooperative </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and not a competitive one.</v>

1552
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:47.050
<v Speaker 3>If you're agreeable and with </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism,</v>

1553
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:51.880
<v Speaker 3>you probably want to keep the stress </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of your job relatively low because</v>

1554
01:23:51.881 --> 01:23:52.714
<v Speaker 3>those are all places that you can break </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and most people have at least one </v>

1555
01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.630
<v Speaker 3>significant weakness in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

1556
01:23:58.631 --> 01:23:59.464
<v Speaker 3>personality makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you got to be careful not to place </v>

1557
01:24:01.091 --> 01:24:03.790
<v Speaker 3>yourself in a position where that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be a fatal flaw.</v>

1558
01:24:04.090 --> 01:24:06.610
<v Speaker 3>But what you really want to do as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell,</v>

1559
01:24:06.611 --> 01:24:07.444
<v Speaker 3>if you want to maximize your chances for</v>
<v Speaker 3>both success and let's say wellbeing is </v>

1560
01:24:11.981 --> 01:24:12.814
<v Speaker 3>you want to find a strata of occupation </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which you would have an intelligence </v>

1561
01:24:16.601 --> 01:24:18.190
<v Speaker 3>that would put you in the upper core </v>
<v Speaker 3>tile.</v>

1562
01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:19.803
<v Speaker 3>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're a big fish in a small pond </v>

1563
01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.013
<v Speaker 3>and you don't want to be this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be the stupidest guy </v>

1564
01:24:25.361 --> 01:24:28.000
<v Speaker 3>in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bloody rough place to be.</v>

1565
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:29.343
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you probably don't want to be the </v>

1566
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:30.994
<v Speaker 3>smartest guy in the room either because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what that probably means is you should </v>

1567
01:24:33.251 --> 01:24:34.960
<v Speaker 3>be in a different room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1568
01:24:34.961 --> 01:24:37.630
<v Speaker 3>You should look at a place where if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right at the top,</v>

1569
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:41.020
<v Speaker 3>it's you've mastered it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time to go somewhere where you're a</v>

1570
01:24:41.021 --> 01:24:43.270
<v Speaker 3>little lower so that you've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to climb up for.</v>

1571
01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.600
<v Speaker 3>So I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not hyper conscientious,</v>

1572
01:24:46.601 --> 01:24:47.434
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably not going to want a job </v>

1573
01:24:48.491 --> 01:24:49.324
<v Speaker 3>that you have to work 70 hours a week at</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're just not wired up that </v>

1574
01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:52.504
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd rather have some leisure and like </v>

1575
01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 3>more power to you if that's how you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>wired up.</v>

1576
01:24:56.081 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with having some </v>
<v Speaker 3>leisure,</v>

1577
01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:02.500
<v Speaker 3>but if you're someone who can't stand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting around doing nothing ever,</v>

1578
01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:03.633
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you can go into a job that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to require you to work 75 hours a </v>

1579
01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:07.234
<v Speaker 3>week and almost all jobs that are at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>top of complex dominance hierarchies </v>

1580
01:25:10.241 --> 01:25:11.074
<v Speaker 3>require very high intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane levels of conscientiousness as </v>

1581
01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:14.950
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1582
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:15.783
<v Speaker 3>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as pretty damn high levels of stress </v>

1583
01:25:17.441 --> 01:25:18.530
<v Speaker 3>tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1584
01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.413
<v Speaker 3>because that can knock you out too </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's going to be sharp </v>

1585
01:25:21.821 --> 01:25:25.360
<v Speaker 3>fluctuations in your career generally </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking,</v>

1586
01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:26.560
<v Speaker 3>at the higher levels of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1587
01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:27.810
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

1588
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:28.863
<v Speaker 3>of a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have to make very complicated </v>

1589
01:25:30.461 --> 01:25:33.010
<v Speaker 3>decisions often with very short time </v>
<v Speaker 3>horizons.</v>

1590
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:34.960
<v Speaker 3>So you have to decide if that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1591
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's some ICU items.</v>

1592
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:41.950
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is from a task roughly.</v>

1593
01:25:41.951 --> 01:25:42.784
<v Speaker 3>It isn't from the direct test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an analog of the Raven's </v>

1594
01:25:45.131 --> 01:25:46.510
<v Speaker 3>progressive matrices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1595
01:25:46.511 --> 01:25:49.900
<v Speaker 3>here's how the Ravens was derived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So imagine that you have,</v>

1596
01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.393
<v Speaker 3>you got your hundred questions and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can take out the some of those and call </v>

1597
01:25:55.631 --> 01:25:56.710
<v Speaker 3>that Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1598
01:25:56.711 --> 01:25:57.544
<v Speaker 3>so now you'll have a score.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can do a correlation between </v>

1599
01:26:00.491 --> 01:26:01.324
<v Speaker 3>all of the items and that and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out which single item is the best </v>

1600
01:26:06.981 --> 01:26:07.814
<v Speaker 3>predictor of the total score because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>might see that question 39 has no </v>

1601
01:26:11.241 --> 01:26:13.610
<v Speaker 3>correlation with with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the meat,</v>

1602
01:26:13.611 --> 01:26:15.050
<v Speaker 3>with the average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

1603
01:26:15.051 --> 01:26:17.960
<v Speaker 3>well that isn't a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would actually throw that out of the</v>

1604
01:26:17.961 --> 01:26:19.460
<v Speaker 3>next test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you'd say,</v>

1605
01:26:19.461 --> 01:26:24.461
<v Speaker 3>well item number 15 is correlated at </v>
<v Speaker 3>point seven five with a total score.</v>

1606
01:26:24.730 --> 01:26:25.563
<v Speaker 3>So that's a good single item.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then imagine that you went across </v>

1607
01:26:27.951 --> 01:26:28.784
<v Speaker 3>sets of Iq tests and you took out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best single item predictors of full </v>

1608
01:26:32.481 --> 01:26:36.020
<v Speaker 3>scale Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you'd end up with is something like</v>

1609
01:26:36.021 --> 01:26:36.854
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1610
01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:42.840
<v Speaker 3>So the Raven's progressive matrices is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good test of fluid intelligence and</v>

1611
01:26:42.841 --> 01:26:46.440
<v Speaker 3>it's relatively non-linguistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also an advantage,</v>

1612
01:26:46.441 --> 01:26:48.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because imagine you wanted to assess the</v>

1613
01:26:48.511 --> 01:26:49.344
<v Speaker 3>intelligence of a very diverse range of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and they all came from different </v>

1614
01:26:52.381 --> 01:26:53.214
<v Speaker 3>linguistic backgrounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well as long as they can understand the </v>

1615
01:26:55.741 --> 01:26:58.230
<v Speaker 3>instructions which are almost self </v>
<v Speaker 3>evident,</v>

1616
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:59.490
<v Speaker 3>then they're going to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1617
01:26:59.491 --> 01:27:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is,</v>

1618
01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:01.853
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to guess case you didn't </v>

1619
01:27:04.711 --> 01:27:05.544
<v Speaker 3>already figured this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you would have had you been using </v>

1620
01:27:07.771 --> 01:27:08.604
<v Speaker 3>your intelligence and applying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to replace the question </v>

1621
01:27:10.921 --> 01:27:14.490
<v Speaker 3>mark with one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so here's how you do it.</v>

1622
01:27:14.491 --> 01:27:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>

1623
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.353
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a working memory task </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to hold a variety of </v>

1624
01:27:19.561 --> 01:27:21.300
<v Speaker 3>variables in imagination at the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1625
01:27:21.301 --> 01:27:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing you think,</v>

1626
01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:25.410
<v Speaker 3>see us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every role has a star,</v>

1627
01:27:25.411 --> 01:27:26.850
<v Speaker 3>a triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a square.</v>

1628
01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:31.110
<v Speaker 3>And each role has a dot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two dots and three dots.</v>

1629
01:27:31.410 --> 01:27:33.510
<v Speaker 3>And so every role has to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>triangle,</v>

1630
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.320
<v Speaker 3>square and star and one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two or three dots.</v>

1631
01:27:37.321 --> 01:27:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this one,</v>

1632
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:39.143
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's it missing in terms of shape </v>

1633
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:42.870
<v Speaker 3>triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent.</v>

1634
01:27:42.871 --> 01:27:45.360
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why you're at the UFT and then.</v>

1635
01:27:45.810 --> 01:27:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what's it missing for dots?</v>

1636
01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:49.380
<v Speaker 3>Two dots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent.</v>

1637
01:27:49.381 --> 01:27:51.510
<v Speaker 3>So we do a little scan here and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh look,</v>

1638
01:27:51.511 --> 01:27:53.940
<v Speaker 3>well it could be that one or it could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

1639
01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:55.643
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1640
01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.280
<v Speaker 3>It's that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so is that right?</v>

1641
01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:00.810
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aren't we smart?</v>

1642
01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was easy.</v>

1643
01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:03.083
<v Speaker 3>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not very smart if you figured </v>

1644
01:28:03.861 --> 01:28:06.120
<v Speaker 3>that one out because pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody can figure that one out.</v>

1645
01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:11.450
<v Speaker 3>I think this next one is more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1646
01:28:18.731 --> 01:28:22.090
<v Speaker 3>So in the first row you see that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>two objects.</v>

1647
01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Each are different color and they move </v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

1648
01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They joined that one.</v>

1649
01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:29.940
<v Speaker 3>There are separate there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They joined,</v>

1650
01:28:29.941 --> 01:28:31.060
<v Speaker 3>they're together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're separate.</v>

1651
01:28:31.061 --> 01:28:32.410
<v Speaker 3>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they joined there.</v>

1652
01:28:32.411 --> 01:28:35.890
<v Speaker 3>So this one should be halfway in between</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two.</v>

1653
01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:41.100
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see up this item actually might be</v>

1654
01:28:42.291 --> 01:28:45.290
<v Speaker 3>incorrectly represented because the blue</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be on the other side.</v>

1655
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:46.303
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>

1656
01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.390
<v Speaker 1>What's that</v>
<v Speaker 1>three?</v>

1657
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they flip?</v>

1658
01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:00.031
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well anyways,</v>

1659
01:29:00.031 --> 01:29:00.864
<v Speaker 3>you see that it's three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See not very bright because I've </v>

1660
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.070
<v Speaker 3>lectured for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1661
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.790
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was a more difficult item.</v>

1662
01:29:05.970 --> 01:29:08.940
<v Speaker 3>And then this one is more difficult if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember correctly.</v>

1663
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:13.560
<v Speaker 3>So let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're all three different colors so</v>

1664
01:29:13.570 --> 01:29:14.403
<v Speaker 3>it has to be color than what's the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and the relationship between the </v>

1665
01:29:17.971 --> 01:29:20.640
<v Speaker 3>colors change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the answer?</v>

1666
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're all,</v>

1667
01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 3>you're all scared to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't you?</v>

1668
01:29:25.831 --> 01:29:26.664
<v Speaker 3>Because you might be wrong and the more </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxious people are even less likely to </v>

1669
01:29:30.661 --> 01:29:33.570
<v Speaker 3>answer number three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1670
01:29:33.571 --> 01:29:34.404
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to test someone's Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you put together a nice batch of </v>

1671
01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:38.544
<v Speaker 3>these at different levels of difficulty </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you sum them and then you rank </v>

1672
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:45.990
<v Speaker 3>order and then you correct for age and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have Iq and that's that.</v>

1673
01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:46.824
<v Speaker 3>And then you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then you can sort people into the </v>

1674
01:29:48.391 --> 01:29:51.570
<v Speaker 3>complexity of their occupations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And isn't that dismal and wretched,</v>

1675
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:54.630
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here you go.</v>

1676
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:56.783
<v Speaker 3>This is from the wonderlic people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are commercial company that makes </v>

1677
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.593
<v Speaker 3>general cognitive ability tests and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>often used by corporations even though </v>

1678
01:30:04.261 --> 01:30:07.920
<v Speaker 3>it's actually illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually illegal to use Iq test,</v>

1679
01:30:07.921 --> 01:30:08.850
<v Speaker 3>but the wonderlic doesn't</v>

1680
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:12.103
<v Speaker 3>promote themselves as testing Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they think it's general </v>

1681
01:30:14.211 --> 01:30:15.980
<v Speaker 3>cognitive ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the same thing,</v>

1682
01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:19.160
<v Speaker 3>but whatever the sats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Gres,</v>

1683
01:30:19.161 --> 01:30:21.140
<v Speaker 3>the Olsat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of those are Iq tests,</v>

1684
01:30:22.130 --> 01:30:25.760
<v Speaker 3>so now they're more crystallized than </v>
<v Speaker 3>fluid and we'll get to that in a minute,</v>

1685
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:28.370
<v Speaker 3>but crystallized knowledge is what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>accrue across type,</v>

1686
01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:32.060
<v Speaker 3>so you could say that fluid intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what programs your brain,</v>

1687
01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:35.690
<v Speaker 3>it fills it with facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say it fills it with knowledge and</v>

1688
01:30:35.691 --> 01:30:36.524
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can get an estimate of your </v>

1689
01:30:37.401 --> 01:30:40.760
<v Speaker 3>intelligence by sampling your domain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>factual knowledge,</v>

1690
01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:41.953
<v Speaker 3>and the reason for that is that while </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously the better the program or the </v>

1691
01:30:44.961 --> 01:30:45.794
<v Speaker 3>better the content,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so what that also means is that you </v>

1692
01:30:47.781 --> 01:30:49.030
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could,</v>

1693
01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:52.550
<v Speaker 3>if your prefrontal cortex was damaged </v>
<v Speaker 3>later in life,</v>

1694
01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.430
<v Speaker 3>your fluid Iq could plummet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're crystallized.</v>

1695
01:30:55.431 --> 01:30:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Iq remain more or less intact.</v>

1696
01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:01.970
<v Speaker 3>So even though they're not different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one produces the other,</v>

1697
01:31:01.971 --> 01:31:02.804
<v Speaker 3>and then once the producer has produced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the producer can disappear and you </v>

1698
01:31:06.201 --> 01:31:11.030
<v Speaker 3>still got the encoded knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at least that's how it looks to me.</v>

1699
01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.133
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how smart do you have to be to be </v>

1700
01:31:14.421 --> 01:31:16.100
<v Speaker 3>different things in life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1701
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:21.790
<v Speaker 3>if you were to have an Iq of 116 to 130,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is 85th percentile and above,</v>

1702
01:31:23.841 --> 01:31:27.680
<v Speaker 3>so it's one person in eight up to one </v>
<v Speaker 3>person in 1:30,</v>

1703
01:31:27.681 --> 01:31:29.750
<v Speaker 3>I believe is 85,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 95.</v>

1704
01:31:29.751 --> 01:31:31.730
<v Speaker 3>Is it 95?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ninety five,</v>

1705
01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.250
<v Speaker 3>one person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight to one person in 20.</v>

1706
01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.353
<v Speaker 3>Then you can be a attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a research analyst and editor and </v>

1707
01:31:37.911 --> 01:31:39.440
<v Speaker 3>advertising manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a chemist,</v>

1708
01:31:39.441 --> 01:31:41.870
<v Speaker 3>an engineer and executive manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>

1709
01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.310
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

1710
01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.790
<v Speaker 3>that's not the high end for ICU by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1711
01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:49.280
<v Speaker 3>It can go up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1712
01:31:49.281 --> 01:31:50.114
<v Speaker 3>it can go up indefinitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although there's fewer and fewer people </v>

1713
01:31:52.071 --> 01:31:52.904
<v Speaker 3>as it goes up.</v>

1714
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:56.000
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to be the best at what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing,</v>

1715
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:57.403
<v Speaker 3>bar none,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then having an Iq of above 145 is a </v>

1716
01:32:00.251 --> 01:32:01.084
<v Speaker 3>necessity and maybe you're pushing one </v>
<v Speaker 3>60 in some situations and maybe that's </v>

1717
01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:04.894
<v Speaker 3>make me make a new one person in 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>or even one person in 100,000 and then </v>

1718
01:32:08.441 --> 01:32:09.274
<v Speaker 3>also to really be good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably have to be reasonably </v>

1719
01:32:12.011 --> 01:32:14.170
<v Speaker 3>stress tolerant and also somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientious,</v>

1720
01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:15.243
<v Speaker 3>so people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why is it that smart people are at </v>

1721
01:32:19.481 --> 01:32:20.314
<v Speaker 3>the top of dominance hierarchies and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>answer to that in part is because they </v>

1722
01:32:22.481 --> 01:32:24.130
<v Speaker 3>get their first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1723
01:32:24.131 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean everything's a race roughly </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking,</v>

1724
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:27.723
<v Speaker 3>and the faster you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more likely you are to be at the </v>

1725
01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:32.980
<v Speaker 3>forefront of the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And intelligence in large part is speed.</v>

1726
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:33.873
<v Speaker 3>That's not all of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're moving towards something </v>

1727
01:32:36.641 --> 01:32:39.340
<v Speaker 3>difficult rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the faster people are going to get there</v>

1728
01:32:39.341 --> 01:32:42.850
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Iq of 1:15,</v>

1729
01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.650
<v Speaker 3>1:10 to 1:15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's 80,</v>

1730
01:32:44.651 --> 01:32:45.700
<v Speaker 3>fifth to 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>

1731
01:32:45.730 --> 01:32:48.040
<v Speaker 3>85th percentile.</v>

1737
01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.880
<v Speaker 3>the smartest people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're above this.</v>

1738
01:33:00.881 --> 01:33:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Who are the smartest people at </v>
<v Speaker 3>University?</v>

1739
01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:03.603
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1742
01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you who's on the other end,</v>

1743
01:33:10.361 --> 01:33:14.950
<v Speaker 3>but I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>to slightly above average rate,</v>

1754
01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.273
<v Speaker 3>People have some technical skill and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some ability to deal with complex </v>

1755
01:33:38.981 --> 01:33:39.820

<v Speaker 3>die setter mechanic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>

1767
01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.370
<v Speaker 3>good Iq range for relatively qualified </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradespeople.</v>

1768
01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:13.890
<v Speaker 3>80 seven to 93 messenger,</v>

<v Speaker 3>material handler,</v>

1772
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:20.100
<v Speaker 3>packer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what you're seeing,</v>

1773
01:34:20.130 --> 01:34:22.710
<v Speaker 3>what you're starting to see is that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you move down the hierarchy,</v>

1774
01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:24.083
<v Speaker 3>the jobs get simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're more likely to be assigned by </v>

1775
01:34:25.891 --> 01:34:26.724
<v Speaker 3>other people or the repetitive because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what Iq predicts to some degree is how </v>

1776
01:34:31.681 --> 01:34:34.150
<v Speaker 3>rapidly you can learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you've learned it,</v>

1777
01:34:34.151 --> 01:34:36.840
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't predict how necessarily how </v>
<v Speaker 3>well you do at it,</v>

1778
01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:41.940
<v Speaker 3>and so the more repetitive jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 people with lower iqs are more suited</v>

1779
01:34:41.941 --> 01:34:45.690
<v Speaker 3>to more repetitive jobs under 87.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there something?</v>

1780
01:34:46.050 --> 01:34:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1781
01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:50.123
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big problem and it's something </v>

1782
01:34:52.291 --> 01:34:57.291
<v Speaker 3>our society has not addressed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jobs for people with our of less than 85</v>

1783
01:34:58.101 --> 01:34:59.810
<v Speaker 3>are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rare.</v>

1784
01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:02.420
<v Speaker 3>So what the hell are those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do?</v>

1785
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:05.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 15 percent of the population.</v>

1786
01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:08.810
<v Speaker 3>What are they supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1787
01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:09.793
<v Speaker 3>we better figure it out because one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that's happening too is that </v>

1788
01:35:12.141 --> 01:35:12.974
<v Speaker 3>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the High Iq tech geeks get a hold of </v>

1789
01:35:15.891 --> 01:35:16.724
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the demand for cognitive power is </v>

1790
01:35:18.591 --> 01:35:19.940
<v Speaker 3>increasing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not decreasing,</v>

1791
01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:21.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to be a teller.</v>

1792
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know those checkout machines,</v>

1793
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:26.510
<v Speaker 3>they're not so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to work at Mcdonald's.</v>

1794
01:35:26.511 --> 01:35:27.344
<v Speaker 3>You think that's a simple job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't see robots working at </v>

1795
01:35:28.911 --> 01:35:29.744
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald's and the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that what Mcdonald's workers do is too </v>

1796
01:35:32.691 --> 01:35:36.560
<v Speaker 3>complex for for robots to do so</v>

1797
01:35:40.110 --> 01:35:40.943
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a discussion that no one </v>

1798
01:35:41.971 --> 01:35:43.380
<v Speaker 3>wants to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's okay.</v>

1799
01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:46.530
<v Speaker 3>It's still a problem and it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealt with.</v>

1800
01:35:46.770 --> 01:35:47.603
<v Speaker 3>So the US government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I told you this at one point </v>

1801
01:35:49.381 --> 01:35:50.214
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal to induct anyone into the </v>

1802
01:35:51.961 --> 01:35:54.300
<v Speaker 3>US army if they have an Iq of less than </v>
<v Speaker 3>83,</v>

1803
01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.793
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about 10 percent of the population </v>

1804
01:35:58.530 --> 01:35:59.363
<v Speaker 3>because the US army and they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing Iq testing since Iq testing began </v>

1805
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:03.263
<v Speaker 3>because they want everybody they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly get into the army because in </v>

1806
01:36:06.631 --> 01:36:07.464
<v Speaker 3>peace time they use it as a way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving people up the socioeconomic </v>

1807
01:36:10.201 --> 01:36:13.830
<v Speaker 3>ladder and in war time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well obviously you need as many soldiers</v>

1808
01:36:13.831 --> 01:36:14.664
<v Speaker 3>as you can get your hands on and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be any pickier than </v>

1809
01:36:18.001 --> 01:36:20.210
<v Speaker 3>you have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the U,</v>

1810
01:36:20.211 --> 01:36:23.580
<v Speaker 3>s army says it's illegal to induct </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody into the armed forces.</v>

1811
01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:24.413
<v Speaker 3>If they have an Iq of less than 83,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know that they've done it for </v>

1812
01:36:26.911 --> 01:36:29.280
<v Speaker 3>absolute necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1813
01:36:29.281 --> 01:36:30.114
<v Speaker 3>And when people have made a finding that</v>
<v Speaker 3>contradicts what they want to hear and </v>

1814
01:36:33.691 --> 01:36:35.520
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it out of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessity,</v>

1815
01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:36.473
<v Speaker 3>you can be reasonably true that it's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those facts that just won't bloody </v>

1816
01:36:38.791 --> 01:36:40.680
<v Speaker 3>well go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you might think,</v>

1817
01:36:40.681 --> 01:36:41.514
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's nothing for someone with an </v>

1818
01:36:42.691 --> 01:36:43.524
<v Speaker 3>Iq of less than 83 to do in the army,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes you think that there's </v>

1819
01:36:46.021 --> 01:36:48.090
<v Speaker 3>something that they can do in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>general population?</v>

1820
01:36:48.690 --> 01:36:51.450
<v Speaker 3>And then the issue is because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Conservatives will say,</v>

1821
01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.460
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should just work harder.</v>

1822
01:36:53.461 --> 01:36:54.091
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1823
01:36:54.091 --> 01:36:56.040
<v Speaker 3>that ain't gonna fly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the liberals will say,</v>

1824
01:36:56.041 --> 01:36:56.874
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no difference between people </v>

1825
01:36:57.810 --> 01:36:58.643
<v Speaker 3>anyhow and you can just train people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do everything that's wrong so they're </v>

1826
01:37:01.861 --> 01:37:04.020
<v Speaker 3>both wrong and they're seriously wrong.</v>

1827
01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:07.380
<v Speaker 3>And the fact that neither side of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political perspective,</v>

1828
01:37:07.381 --> 01:37:08.214
<v Speaker 3>we'll take a good cold hard look at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem means that we're going to </v>

1829
01:37:11.071 --> 01:37:11.904
<v Speaker 3>increasingly have a structural problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>in our societies because we're </v>

1830
01:37:14.311 --> 01:37:15.144
<v Speaker 3>complexifying everything so rapidly that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't find employment unless </v>

1831
01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.180
<v Speaker 3>increasingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're intelligent,</v>

1832
01:37:21.181 --> 01:37:22.860
<v Speaker 3>you guys are really going to face this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1833
01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:23.843
<v Speaker 3>lawyers are disappearing like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is you can look </v>

1834
01:37:27.871 --> 01:37:29.430
<v Speaker 3>it up online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Increasingly.</v>

1835
01:37:29.431 --> 01:37:31.500
<v Speaker 3>You can do things yourself if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>

1836
01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:32.813
<v Speaker 3>And so like the working class people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been wiped out pretty nicely over </v>

1837
01:37:35.461 --> 01:37:38.910
<v Speaker 3>the last 30 years by by automation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>various other things.</v>

1838
01:37:39.150 --> 01:37:42.390
<v Speaker 3>It's the low end of the white collar </v>
<v Speaker 3>class that's coming up next.</v>

1839
01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.910
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not saying that lawyers are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the low end,</v>

1840
01:37:44.911 --> 01:37:48.750
<v Speaker 3>but low end lawyers are in the low end </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the white collar class.</v>

1841
01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:50.003
<v Speaker 3>So there's still going to be plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions for people who are creative </v>

1842
01:37:52.321 --> 01:37:55.050
<v Speaker 3>and fast on their feet and super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1843
01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:56.063
<v Speaker 3>people are going to have all the money </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's already happening to a great </v>

1844
01:37:58.711 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 3>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1845
01:37:59.950 --> 01:38:02.190
<v Speaker 3>because if you're smart and you can use </v>
<v Speaker 3>a computer,</v>

1846
01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:04.650
<v Speaker 3>you're so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just absolutely unbelievable.</v>

1847
01:38:04.651 --> 01:38:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you can't use a computer and lots</v>

1848
01:38:07.441 --> 01:38:10.260
<v Speaker 3>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't mean you can open word,</v>

1849
01:38:10.261 --> 01:38:12.210
<v Speaker 3>that isn't what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe,</v>

1850
01:38:12.211 --> 01:38:13.044
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can program and if you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>program while you're right at the next </v>

1851
01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:19.440
<v Speaker 3>and so if you haven't got that with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1852
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:21.360
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be left behind.</v>

1853
01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them will take demerol.</v>

1854
01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.510
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening in the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

1855
01:38:30.690 --> 01:38:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an opiate.</v>

1856
01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:33.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a massive drug problem </v>

1857
01:38:34.651 --> 01:38:35.484
<v Speaker 3>emerging and.</v>

1858
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:39.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1859
01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:39.921
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

1860
01:38:39.921 --> 01:38:41.090
<v Speaker 3>that is what's happening there.</v>

1861
01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:45.740
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drugs.</v>

1862
01:38:46.730 --> 01:38:48.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drugs of abuse.</v>

1863
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:53.083
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that what,</v>

1864
01:38:53.150 --> 01:38:56.570
<v Speaker 3>what is happening to a large degree is </v>
<v Speaker 3>people drop out of the employment race.</v>

1865
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:59.150
<v Speaker 3>They get very depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They develop chronic pain problems,</v>

1866
01:38:59.151 --> 01:38:59.984
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because chronic pain and depression are </v>

1867
01:39:02.361 --> 01:39:03.194
<v Speaker 3>very much the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they subsist on opiates which </v>

1868
01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:08.900
<v Speaker 3>are subsidized by Medicaid in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding about this.</v>

1869
01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:10.460
<v Speaker 3>This is exactly what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1870
01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.280
<v Speaker 3>what else is going to happen to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>for whom there is nothing to do.</v>

1871
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:16.310
<v Speaker 3>They have a terrible time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they're conscientious.</v>

1872
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:23.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the Ai guys are pushing hard on</v>

1873
01:39:23.031 --> 01:39:23.720
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1874
01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:27.590
<v Speaker 3>what's the biggest employment category</v>

1875
01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.880
<v Speaker 4>driver?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about it.</v>

1876
01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:33.453
<v Speaker 3>What's Tesla doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are all the ai guys working on as </v>

1877
01:39:35.921 --> 01:39:38.860
<v Speaker 3>fast as they possibly can?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Driverless cars,</v>

1878
01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:39.993
<v Speaker 3>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except that's the biggest employment </v>

1879
01:39:41.231 --> 01:39:43.630
<v Speaker 3>category for men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what are those guys going to do?</v>

1880
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to sit home and be </v>

1881
01:39:46.811 --> 01:39:47.644
<v Speaker 3>miserable with their wives and take </v>
<v Speaker 3>opiates because they have chronic pain </v>

1882
01:39:49.511 --> 01:39:50.800
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1883
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you might think,</v>

1884
01:39:52.451 --> 01:39:53.284
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could they think of something else to </v>

1885
01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:55.480
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1886
01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:56.763
<v Speaker 3>if you have an Iq of 83 or less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be doing a lot of </v>

1887
01:39:58.811 --> 01:40:01.060
<v Speaker 3>thinking about something else to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1888
01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:03.470
<v Speaker 3>That isn't how it works because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>more of a.</v>

1889
01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:07.090
<v Speaker 3>you're an act person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a thinking person,</v>

1890
01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:08.790
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1891
01:40:08.791 --> 01:40:11.680
<v Speaker 3>and so if you have a task at hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're conscientious,</v>

1892
01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:14.250
<v Speaker 3>you can diligently go about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1893
01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.093
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to train people with Iqs of </v>
<v Speaker 3>80 and less to do what I would consider </v>

1894
01:40:20.410 --> 01:40:21.243
<v Speaker 3>tasks that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one of you could learn to do in 10 </v>

1895
01:40:23.561 --> 01:40:24.394
<v Speaker 3>minutes and never make a mistake again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like tens of hours with bare </v>

1896
01:40:28.601 --> 01:40:33.580
<v Speaker 3>minimum mastery of the tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's ugly situation,</v>

1897
01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:36.750
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1898
01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:40.740
<v Speaker 3>Openness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So creativity.</v>

1899
01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.113
<v Speaker 4>Oh</v>

1900
01:40:44.370 --> 01:40:45.880
<v Speaker 3>well I can talk more about this on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1901
01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:46.883
<v Speaker 3>on Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we'll just stop and I'll go into </v>

1902
01:40:48.541 --> 01:40:51.540
<v Speaker 3>creativity on Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've got about five minutes.</v>

1903
01:40:51.541 --> 01:40:52.374
<v Speaker 3>So if anyone has a question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be more than happy to entertain a </v>

1904
01:40:54.161 --> 01:40:56.470
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it did it.</v>

1905
01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:57.333
<v Speaker 3>What I tell you what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in a technical area to some </v>

1906
01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:00.761
<v Speaker 3>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1907
01:41:00.761 --> 01:41:01.594
<v Speaker 3>So you need to understand how these </v>
<v Speaker 3>tests come about because you can't </v>

1908
01:41:03.581 --> 01:41:05.770
<v Speaker 3>understand the concepts without </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding it.</v>

1909
01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:07.023
<v Speaker 3>So I'm hoping that the way I told you </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Iq tests were derived made </v>

1910
01:41:09.821 --> 01:41:11.140
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1911
01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:11.993
<v Speaker 3>it's a fairly straightforward thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what you want to concentrate </v>

1912
01:41:13.751 --> 01:41:14.584
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had a question?</v>

1913
01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:20.110
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1914
01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.650
<v Speaker 3>You can't change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't train simple reaction time.</v>

1915
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:31.090
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You talk about very rapidly and it here.</v>

1916
01:41:31.170 --> 01:41:33.430
<v Speaker 3>But let's take your question a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>further.</v>

1917
01:41:34.150 --> 01:41:35.020
<v Speaker 3>So let's say,</v>

1918
01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:36.513
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1919
01:41:38.430 --> 01:41:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Iq predicts how fast you'll master of </v>
<v Speaker 3>video game.</v>

1920
01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:43.080
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it does.</v>

1921
01:41:43.110 --> 01:41:45.690
<v Speaker 3>So then let's say we're going to train </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hell out of you on a video game.</v>

1922
01:41:45.691 --> 01:41:48.540
<v Speaker 3>So you get super good at it and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get like tetris.</v>

1923
01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:49.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>

1924
01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Does everyone know what Tetris is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1925
01:41:51.631 --> 01:41:52.464
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is really an I an Iq test for all </v>

1926
01:41:55.111 --> 01:41:57.240
<v Speaker 3>intents and purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's spacial rotation test.</v>

1927
01:41:57.570 --> 01:41:59.580
<v Speaker 3>So you can get really good at Tetris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1928
01:41:59.581 --> 01:42:00.001
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1929
01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:01.740
<v Speaker 3>my Iq is increasing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1930
01:42:01.741 --> 01:42:02.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>

1931
01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Let's say I produce a variant of Tetris </v>
<v Speaker 3>that requires that the idea is basically</v>

1932
01:42:09.481 --> 01:42:11.220
<v Speaker 3>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it requires different operations.</v>

1933
01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Being good at Tetris won't help you be </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at that test.</v>

1934
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:15.143
<v Speaker 3>You don't get crossover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people have been trying this for a </v>

1935
01:42:17.401 --> 01:42:18.181
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1936
01:42:18.181 --> 01:42:19.014
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you could practice a bunch of Iq </v>

1937
01:42:19.861 --> 01:42:21.210
<v Speaker 3>tests and you'd get better.</v>

1938
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.691
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1939
01:42:21.691 --> 01:42:23.460
<v Speaker 3>you get better on the Iq test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you practice,</v>

1940
01:42:23.461 --> 01:42:28.461
<v Speaker 3>but you don't get better on Iq tests and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see even fluid,</v>

1941
01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:29.513
<v Speaker 3>you can't move it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are people who come up with </v>

1942
01:42:31.261 --> 01:42:33.750
<v Speaker 3>claims all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the lumosity people.</v>

1943
01:42:34.050 --> 01:42:34.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1944
01:42:34.670 --> 01:42:36.720
<v Speaker 3>here's a bunch of complex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then they thought,</v>

1945
01:42:36.721 --> 01:42:39.720
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>practice one test.</v>

1946
01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:40.673
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't work to make you smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then practice a whole bunch of tests </v>

1947
01:42:44.431 --> 01:42:47.430
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe what you learned across </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the tests will make you smarter.</v>

1948
01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:48.653
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work and it really sucks </v>

1949
01:42:50.791 --> 01:42:51.624
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things you'd hope is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that once you had extracted out a </v>

1950
01:42:54.421 --> 01:42:55.254
<v Speaker 3>central factor for intelligence that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could get people to practice the micro </v>

1951
01:42:58.531 --> 01:43:01.530
<v Speaker 3>skills that were associated with it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it would boost icu.</v>

1952
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:06.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like it doesn't work and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about every five years someone comes out</v>

1953
01:43:06.421 --> 01:43:07.470
<v Speaker 3>with a claim that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1954
01:43:07.471 --> 01:43:09.930
<v Speaker 3>we've developed a new test and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just do this test,</v>

1955
01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:10.913
<v Speaker 3>you'll get smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then someone tested out and they </v>

1956
01:43:13.201 --> 01:43:17.070
<v Speaker 3>usually use the Raven's progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>matrices as the marker and they show no,</v>

1957
01:43:17.071 --> 01:43:17.904
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Domain specific knowledge doesn't </v>

1958
01:43:19.201 --> 01:43:23.010
<v Speaker 3>generalize to other areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a hell of a thing if you,</v>

1959
01:43:23.011 --> 01:43:25.200
<v Speaker 3>if you can figure out how to raise </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's fluid Iq,</v>

1960
01:43:25.201 --> 01:43:26.034
<v Speaker 3>you will be a billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you won't be able to do it because </v>

1961
01:43:28.351 --> 01:43:30.130
<v Speaker 3>it looks like it's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you never know,</v>

1962
01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:30.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1963
01:43:30.691 --> 01:43:32.220
<v Speaker 3>maybe someone will crack it at some </v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

1964
01:43:32.221 --> 01:43:34.320
<v Speaker 3>but we certainly haven't yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1965
01:43:36.650 --> 01:43:38.440
<v Speaker 4>no transfer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1966
01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:41.923
<v Speaker 3>There's no generally no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No generalizability of a specific skill </v>

1967
01:43:44.601 --> 01:43:46.880
<v Speaker 3>to ICU.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1968
01:43:46.881 --> 01:43:49.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you practice one thing and it,</v>

1969
01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:50.353
<v Speaker 3>there's something that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's close that there's going to be </v>

1970
01:43:51.951 --> 01:43:52.784
<v Speaker 3>some generalizability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda hard to define what close </v>

1971
01:43:54.981 --> 01:43:59.981
<v Speaker 3>means though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pro Pro.</v>

1972
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on.</v>

1973
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:04.900
<v Speaker 3>It would depend on how big the factor </v>
<v Speaker 3>you changed was.</v>

1974
01:44:04.901 --> 01:44:06.910
<v Speaker 3>But the general rule of thumb is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>transfer.</v>

1975
01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.193
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1976
01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:20.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The higher the Higher Iq.</v>

1977
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Higher Iq person will lose and learn</v>

1978
01:44:22.561 --> 01:44:25.170
<v Speaker 3>the new thing faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much no matter what it is.</v>

1979
01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:26.730
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1980
01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:29.490
<v Speaker 3>But even so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1981
01:44:29.491 --> 01:44:32.160
<v Speaker 3>what if you practice learning a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>new things fast,</v>

1982
01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:34.530
<v Speaker 3>would that make you faster at learning </v>
<v Speaker 3>new things?</v>

1983
01:44:34.650 --> 01:44:37.470
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are doing that all the time.</v>

1984
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:41.190
<v Speaker 3>So you're probably maxed out on that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some degree and be no,</v>

1985
01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:43.260
<v Speaker 3>it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1986
01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.210
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>

1987
01:44:45.211 --> 01:44:46.044
<v Speaker 3>people have tried this for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and for good reason and we haven't </v>

1988
01:44:50.101 --> 01:44:51.000
<v Speaker 3>got anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1989
01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:53.193
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1990
01:44:58.870 --> 01:45:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The language one is tougher because like</v>

1991
01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:06.540
<v Speaker 3>if you say say you learn two languages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you pick up the third faster and.</v>

1992
01:45:06.630 --> 01:45:07.463
<v Speaker 3>Well the answer is how it depends on how</v>
<v Speaker 3>linguistically close the new languages </v>

1993
01:45:12.061 --> 01:45:15.210
<v Speaker 3>to the two that you've already learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if you learn 30,</v>

1994
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:20.370
<v Speaker 3>you can probably learn a new one in like</v>
<v Speaker 3>two days because once you've learned 30,</v>

1995
01:45:20.371 --> 01:45:21.204
<v Speaker 3>you've covered the domain of languages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the language issue is a little bit </v>

1996
01:45:23.791 --> 01:45:24.624
<v Speaker 3>more complex because languages have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fair bit of commonality in their </v>

1997
01:45:27.391 --> 01:45:29.220
<v Speaker 3>underlying structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1998
01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.113
<v Speaker 3>but you don't learn one language faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>after you've learned three because </v>

1999
01:45:32.701 --> 01:45:33.534
<v Speaker 3>you've got smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn one language faster after </v>

2000
01:45:35.881 --> 01:45:38.250
<v Speaker 3>you've learned three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know more about languages.</v>

2001
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:39.730
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2002
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:43.650
<v Speaker 3>we should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll see you Thursday.</v>
