<v Speaker 2>Bjorn Lomborg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a Danish author and president of </v>

3
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 2>the Copenhagen Consensus Center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a project base us think tank.</v>

4
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.123
<v Speaker 2>We're prominent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Economists are seeking to establish </v>

5
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:25.854
<v Speaker 2>priorities for advancing global welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the former director of the Danish </v>

6
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 2>government Environmental Assessment </v>
<v Speaker 2>Institute in Copenhagen.</v>

7
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Bjorn became known internationally for </v>
<v Speaker 2>his book,</v>

8
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:41.451
<v Speaker 2>The skeptical environmentalist in 2001 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how to spend $75 billion to make the</v>

9
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.134
<v Speaker 2>world a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool it in 2007 which is also a movie </v>

10
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 2>and lately published in 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 2>prioritizing development,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a cost benefit analysis of the UN </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable development goals among many</v>

12
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:57.834
<v Speaker 2>other works in books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm hoping we'll have a very </v>

13
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 2>productive conversation today and </v>
<v Speaker 2>welcome to this discussion.</v>

14
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Thanks a lot of term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

15
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:08.094
<v Speaker 2>so why don't you just start by letting </v>
<v Speaker 2>people know what you've been up to over </v>

16
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 2>the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say two decades.</v>

17
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a very broad question and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and why.</v>

18
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:17.394
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been interested in talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you because I read a number of your </v>

19
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:21.384
<v Speaker 2>books a few years ago and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in their economic analysis </v>

20
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 2>and and as a way of determining which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which crises,</v>

21
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:30.414
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or which potential crises are real and </v>

22
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 2>also how they might be managed most </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligently.</v>

23
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Thank thanks a lot drew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

24
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally what I tried to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say [inaudible],</v>

25
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 3>this really is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very obvious.</v>

26
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 3>We only have a limited amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>

27
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.423
<v Speaker 3>so let's make sure we focus those </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources on the places where we can </v>

28
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.160
<v Speaker 3>help the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we can do the most good.</v>

29
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.323
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it that we mostly focused on in </v>

30
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.713
<v Speaker 3>the world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very often the things that get the </v>

31
00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:59.840
<v Speaker 3>headlines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that people talk about,</v>

32
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.763
<v Speaker 3>it talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And very often that ends up being the </v>

33
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:03.104
<v Speaker 3>things that have the cutest animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the most crying babies of the groups </v>

34
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:07.454
<v Speaker 3>with the best pr and surely that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right way to prioritize the right </v>

35
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:12.494
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be to look at if I spend a </v>

36
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:18.971
<v Speaker 3>dollar or a peso or rupee here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will I do more good than if I spent that</v>

37
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 3>same dollar a rupee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece out over here.</v>

38
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 3>So basically asking across all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>different areas you can spend resources,</v>

39
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 3>where do I help the most?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now obviously that's a huge conversation</v>

40
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:33.380
<v Speaker 3>in and of itself because it's not easy </v>
<v Speaker 3>to just determine that.</v>

41
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.453
<v Speaker 3>But the basic idea is simply to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>let's focus on the places where you can </v>

42
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:38.954
<v Speaker 3>do the most good rather than the places </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it makes us feel the best about </v>

43
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:43.964
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's really what I've been trying </v>

44
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:46.154
<v Speaker 3>to do for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

45
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for two decades.</v>

46
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prioritizing the world and trying to say</v>

47
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 3>where should you spend money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course makes the,</v>

48
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Speaker 3>the projects that we say these are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

49
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:57.014
<v Speaker 3>really great interventions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all love us and think we're the </v>

50
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 3>best thing since sliced bread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course the,</v>

51
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 3>the projects and the policies that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>not so effective,</v>

52
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 3>we think we're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

53
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creates a lot of antagonism and makes</v>

54
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.520
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people annoyed and interest in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

55
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's crucial to ask these </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

56
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one question would be,</v>

57
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 3>what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

58
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 3>like when I was looking at the UN </v>
<v Speaker 3>development goals,</v>

59
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

60
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 3>there was something approximating 200 of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

61
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 3>And this was a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked on a UN panel and I thought,</v>

62
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:27.844
<v Speaker 3>well the problem with 200 goals is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have 200 they're not goals if </v>

63
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:33.154
<v Speaker 3>there's 200 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you absolutely have to </v>

64
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 3>prioritize in order to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assuming some limitation on resources,</v>

65
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you,</v>

66
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 3>what you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then,</v>

67
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 3>then the question would become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

68
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 3>how do you calculate benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a really difficult problem,</v>

69
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 3>which is I think why it wasn't addressed</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the mishmash of 200 goals,</v>

70
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.093
<v Speaker 3>apart from the fact that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>offend people by rank ordering their </v>

71
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:57.094
<v Speaker 3>priorities.</v>

72
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 3>So why don't you tell people a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit about the,</v>

73
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.723
<v Speaker 3>about the methods that you used?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think they're extremely </v>

74
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're absolutely right.</v>

75
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.004
<v Speaker 3>The sustainable development goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually work with the UN back in </v>

76
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 3>2015 when they were doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

77
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

78
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

79
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 3>it was about a 60 to 90.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very unclear,</v>

80
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>UN ambassadors.</v>

81
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 3>I actually met with a quarter of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

82
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 3>in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can talk to each one of them said,</v>

83
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't we try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

84
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 3>focus on the targets that would do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>very most good.</v>

85
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each one of them said yes individually,</v>

86
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

87
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.093
<v Speaker 3>the combined effort of all the UN </v>
<v Speaker 3>ambassadors was of course not to </v>

88
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:34.684
<v Speaker 3>actually do the best goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was to get everybody's goals in </v>

89
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.171
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

90
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:39.004
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Norwegians had three ideas and the </v>

91
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Brazilians at four and everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

92
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or four that they want in there.</v>

93
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 3>That's why we ended up with 169 targets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

94
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.753
<v Speaker 3>which of course simply means you </v>
<v Speaker 3>promised everything to everyone </v>

95
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means a lot of people are going</v>

96
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.394
<v Speaker 3>to be very disappointed when 2030 rolls </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and we haven't actually dealt </v>

97
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.380
<v Speaker 3>with all the things that we promised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

98
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 3>So what happens there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens there is that you,</v>

99
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 3>the people who are doing that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>including everyone on the list,</v>

100
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.873
<v Speaker 3>maximize short term emotional wellbeing </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the people who had been doing the </v>

101
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 3>consultation at the cost of medium to </v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm progress,</v>

102
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.843
<v Speaker 3>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to be around in 2030 </v>

103
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 3>and all possibility to suffer the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of that.</v>

104
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least they're not.</v>

105
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.643
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's going to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We failed to do as much good as we </v>

106
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 3>possibly could because we will have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of good everywhere,</v>

107
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.070
<v Speaker 3>but doing a little good everywhere.</v>

108
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.933
<v Speaker 3>It's not nearly as good as doing an </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous amount of good in the places </v>

109
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 3>where you can view the very most good </v>
<v Speaker 3>with extra resources.</v>

110
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember we're estimating the total cost</v>

111
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:46.261
<v Speaker 3>of the sdgs as somewhere in there in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>range of two and a half trillion dollars</v>

112
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 3>and the actual amounts available,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's about $140 billion.</v>

113
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 3>So we literally have 5% of what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>promising.</v>

114
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 3>So we're promising the world and then we</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

115
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a small amount of money and let's</v>

116
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 3>spread it similarly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everybody gets a little bit of it.</v>

117
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

118
00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:04.434
<v Speaker 3>so that's partly where you derive your </v>
<v Speaker 3>premise that we're dealing with limited </v>

119
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:08.084
<v Speaker 3>resources is that you're actually using </v>
<v Speaker 3>a real number and the number of you're </v>

120
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.044
<v Speaker 3>using is what's actually available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you wrote how to spend 75 </v>

121
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.093
<v Speaker 3>billion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you basically go calf of what it was </v>

122
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 3>available that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was about much,</v>

123
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 3>much earlier on.</v>

124
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.243
<v Speaker 3>And that was mostly sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fun idea to say how would you </v>

125
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 3>spend a specific amount?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

126
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 3>And that was half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

127
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we weren't saying we should spend all</v>

128
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.394
<v Speaker 3>of it in the exact way that we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about how would totally agree </v>

129
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to agree with you,</v>

130
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:36.344
<v Speaker 3>people have to agree that everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't be done for everyone all at once </v>

131
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 3>at infinite expense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that it's useful practically.</v>

132
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.133
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also even in a Utopian sense in </v>

133
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.850
<v Speaker 3>desirable sends to rank order so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the obvious money that's available,</v>

134
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.510
<v Speaker 3>the money that's genuinely available can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be targeted best.</v>

135
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.543
<v Speaker 3>And so then the next question would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you go about that in the least </v>

136
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.420
<v Speaker 3>controversial and most empirically sound</v>
<v Speaker 3>manner to,</v>

137
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 3>to do the rank ordering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we use cost benefit analysis,</v>

138
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 3>which is a very well established </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic tool that tries to say,</v>

139
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.513
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for each of the proposals that you come </v>

140
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 3>up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much will that proposal cost?</v>

141
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Now remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not just economics.</v>

142
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Most of the costs will be money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for instance,</v>

143
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 3>if you want to immunize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

144
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small children,</v>

145
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.373
<v Speaker 3>you also have to ask the mothers to </v>
<v Speaker 3>spend packs a day to go to the place </v>

146
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 3>where their kids will be immunized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'll both cost them labor.</v>

147
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 3>They can't do Labor that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they'll have transportation costs,</v>

148
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:37.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll have food costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be extra the cost.</v>

149
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 3>So we try to add all of those costs up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

150
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 3>so what's the total cost of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>project?</v>

151
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Then we look at all the benefits and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the benefits of both economic,</v>

152
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:47.001
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

153
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:48.770
<v Speaker 3>but there are also social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

154
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 3>kids not dying or kids not being sick </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they are often also environmental.</v>

155
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.103
<v Speaker 3>So we tried to take all of those costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of those benefits of both the </v>

156
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 3>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environmental and social benefits at</v>

157
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:01.004
<v Speaker 3>them all up into one number that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>denominated in dollars or rupees or </v>

158
00:08:05.221 --> 00:08:06.410
<v Speaker 3>whatever your currency is.</v>

159
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.573
<v Speaker 3>And then you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well for this many dollars you can do </v>

160
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:10.754
<v Speaker 3>this much good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means you can also say for </v>

161
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 3>every dollar spent you can do this much </v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

162
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.393
<v Speaker 3>Now obviously I'm simplifying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a sense what it means is if you </v>

163
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.104
<v Speaker 3>do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of economists has spent a lot of </v>

164
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:23.624
<v Speaker 3>time trying to make those right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have all the same parameters </v>

165
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:26.804
<v Speaker 3>across all these different areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually means you can start </v>

166
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 3>comparing different interventions across</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the different areas and say,</v>

167
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 3>where do you get the biggest bang for </v>
<v Speaker 3>your buck?</v>

168
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.830
<v Speaker 3>And of course that is what matters if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually going to do good.</v>

169
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:41.420
<v Speaker 3>So we did a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is not,</v>

170
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.520
<v Speaker 3>please don't buy this book because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

171
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.533
<v Speaker 3>this is a very long at an academic book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we did this long and academic book </v>

172
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:48.644
<v Speaker 3>with with more than 50 of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 3>top economists looking across all these </v>

173
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:52.904
<v Speaker 3>different areas.</v>

174
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.833
<v Speaker 3>But the beauty is you can actually put </v>
<v Speaker 3>it in just one chart and I'm going to </v>

175
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:58.044
<v Speaker 3>show you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll also put it up on your </v>

176
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:02.090
<v Speaker 3>website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the ones,</v>

177
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 3>one page chart that has all the targets </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

178
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.133
<v Speaker 3>And for each of the targets there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis that says how much will this </v>

179
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 3>cost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much good will it do?</v>

180
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 3>And then it shows for every dollar </v>
<v Speaker 3>spent,</v>

181
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 3>how much good will it do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's a long line,</v>

182
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 3>it'll do a lot of dollars of good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's a short line,</v>

183
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:20.723
<v Speaker 3>not too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it really becomes this very simple </v>

184
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 3>menu for the world to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where can you spend your resources?</v>

185
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.990
<v Speaker 3>And of course this doesn't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

186
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 3>just like when you go into a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a menu.</v>

187
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean you buy the cheapest thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the most nutritious thing.</v>

188
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're in the mood for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

189
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an unhealthy cake.</v>

190
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 3>But it's incredibly important to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the cost and what's the benefit.</v>

191
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.263
<v Speaker 3>And knowing this makes it a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 3>likely that the world is going to focus </v>

192
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:49.314
<v Speaker 3>itself on some of the really long bars </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it can do a lot of good for every </v>

193
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:54.840
<v Speaker 3>dollar or group you're a peso spent.</v>

194
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now if I was thinking about </v>

195
00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.244
<v Speaker 2>critiquing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say from a social science and an </v>

196
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 2>aura or a political perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing that I would object is,</v>

197
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

198
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.953
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it that you know that your </v>

199
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 2>calculation of the costs and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits are accurate?</v>

200
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.873
<v Speaker 2>So you and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how do you know that they're </v>

201
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 2>essentially as free as possible of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>undue political bias?</v>

202
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.213
<v Speaker 2>So because the critics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt we'll object as perhaps they </v>

203
00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there will be,</v>

204
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 2>let's call them implicit biases even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though I'm not a fan of that idea.</v>

205
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.513
<v Speaker 2>In some sense there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying presuppositions that weight </v>

206
00:10:38.161 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 2>the manner in which the economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculations are made.</v>

207
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.543
<v Speaker 2>And then of course you also have to buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the cost benefit analysis </v>

208
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:45.234
<v Speaker 2>approach is actually valid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So can you tell me what you guys did to </v>

209
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 2>forestall such to take such criticisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>into account?</v>

210
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:53.563
<v Speaker 3>And so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't just ask one team of </v>

211
00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:57.294
<v Speaker 3>economists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We also have other teams critiquing </v>

212
00:10:58.921 --> 00:10:59.754
<v Speaker 3>those economists and we exactly tried to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that there's sort of critique </v>

213
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:03.884
<v Speaker 3>some both sides if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know that this is not just an </v>

214
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:07.284
<v Speaker 3>ideologically driven number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually an empirically pretty </v>

215
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:12.750
<v Speaker 3>clear number that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

216
00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:16.440
<v Speaker 3>if you focus on on vaccinations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually going to do.</v>

217
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:17.274
<v Speaker 3>And what we find is you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>$60 to social good for every dollar you </v>

218
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:23.160
<v Speaker 3>spend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you could argue,</v>

219
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.190
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

220
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.050
<v Speaker 3>What would be sort of the ideal </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological spin you could put in that?</v>

221
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing is to say,</v>

222
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you measure all humans as equal?</v>

223
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.660
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually did.</v>

224
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.793
<v Speaker 3>And of course you could argue from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic point the same point that they </v>

225
00:11:37.571 --> 00:11:40.350
<v Speaker 3>are not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think very few people would want to do</v>

226
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:43.230
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we do is across all this,</v>

227
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.243
<v Speaker 3>all these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all people are ranked as equally </v>

228
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:47.190
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

229
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.270
<v Speaker 3>That is equally valuable and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously political consideration.</v>

230
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:52.104
<v Speaker 3>But I think one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're looking across a world that is </v>

231
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 3>the right one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anything,</v>

232
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:57.543
<v Speaker 3>that probably means that most rich </v>
<v Speaker 3>country people are valued at way too </v>

233
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:03.640
<v Speaker 3>little compared to what they're actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to do themselves.</v>

234
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 3>But this means that we actually get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting right intensive sense of saying,</v>

235
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:09.004
<v Speaker 3>where are you going to spend extra money</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your goal is to help the most in the </v>

236
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 3>world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

237
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:14.344
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you used an approach that was </v>

238
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.383
<v Speaker 3>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say a solid measurement </v>

239
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:19.710
<v Speaker 3>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

240
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the theoretical perspective because</v>

241
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:22.714
<v Speaker 3>the idea would be to have multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>measures of the same phenomenon or set </v>

242
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 3>of phenomena and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to see where they are dovetail.</v>

243
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 3>So that would be an issue of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reliability.</v>

244
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:34.354
<v Speaker 3>So if you have multiple teams of </v>
<v Speaker 3>economists and they all converge on </v>

245
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:38.614
<v Speaker 3>something that approximates an agreement</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you look at a diverse range of </v>

246
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:42.274
<v Speaker 3>opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can be reasonably certain that </v>

247
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:45.880
<v Speaker 3>you've conversed on something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

248
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.340
<v Speaker 3>And then you also have an element of </v>
<v Speaker 3>peer review in there.</v>

249
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another way of go,</v>

250
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.303
<v Speaker 3>go ahead and exactly what both of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>are obviously important to make sure as </v>

251
00:12:56.381 --> 00:12:58.710
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get the reliability of the,</v>

252
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 3>you actually get something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>resembles somewhat of a truth.</v>

253
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 3>But the real point here is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some way,</v>

254
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.280
<v Speaker 3>if we just take a step back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not a question about getting the</v>

255
00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:11.530
<v Speaker 3>absolute numbers exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

256
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 3>that would be wonderful if we could do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

257
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I just told you that,</v>

258
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaccination,</v>

259
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:16.774
<v Speaker 3>every dollar you spend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll give you $60 back and it'd be </v>

260
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:20.344
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unlikely that that's the right </v>

261
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 3>number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's much,</v>

262
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:26.160
<v Speaker 3>much more about getting the order of </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnitude right.</v>

263
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.640
<v Speaker 3>Is it 60 or is it six or is it $600 you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get back?</v>

264
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.593
<v Speaker 3>Because really the point here is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>compare across all these other things </v>

265
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:36.550
<v Speaker 3>that you could also have spent that </v>
<v Speaker 3>money on.</v>

266
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.970
<v Speaker 3>And there we have a much greater uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of reliability because we're pretty</v>

267
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:45.940
<v Speaker 3>sure that even if you change the </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumption very much,</v>

268
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 3>you will still get much of the same kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of picture.</v>

269
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.343
<v Speaker 3>You won't get exactly the same picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you'll very much get the same sort </v>

270
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:54.004
<v Speaker 3>of picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which indicates that there's a few </v>

271
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:57.730
<v Speaker 3>targets that we'll do an amazing amount </v>
<v Speaker 3>of good.</v>

272
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of targets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just do a little good.</v>

273
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.113
<v Speaker 3>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tried to say is do the amazing </v>

274
00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:04.150
<v Speaker 3>targets first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

275
00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:04.984
<v Speaker 3>So the critical thing for you guys to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get right as the rank ordering and not </v>

276
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:08.434
<v Speaker 3>the absolute magnet as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as long as your method is stable </v>

277
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:12.484
<v Speaker 3>across all the different domains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the rank ordering should be </v>

278
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:15.574
<v Speaker 3>relatively stable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now did you get a prieto distribution </v>

279
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:21.730
<v Speaker 3>with regards to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive impact of investment?</v>

280
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:22.563
<v Speaker 3>Like is there a handful of interventions</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are clearly head and shoulders </v>

281
00:14:27.821 --> 00:14:31.030
<v Speaker 3>above the rest in terms of generating </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive economic outcome and,</v>

282
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.133
<v Speaker 3>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what proportion of the total number </v>

283
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:36.610
<v Speaker 3>of say 170 goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you did,</v>

284
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.533
<v Speaker 3>if you accomplish 10% of the 170 goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of the Economic Bang for your </v>

285
00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 3>buck would you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you accrue?</v>

286
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 3>I should actually just say I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant that question.</v>

287
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 3>That's wonderful because that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we tried to do.</v>

288
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 3>So if you do across all these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every dollar spent,</v>

289
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 3>we'll do about $7 of good if you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it across all of them equally,</v>

290
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 3>which is probably unreasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 3>assume,</v>

291
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:00.891
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

292
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:01.724
<v Speaker 3>unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the sort of first order </v>

293
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 3>approximation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you spend it on the best 19 targets,</v>

294
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 3>you would do $32 of good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So more than four times more.</v>

295
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:12.764
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can simply spend you're the same </v>

296
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:15.824
<v Speaker 3>dollar and do more than four times more </v>
<v Speaker 3>good than you would do if you just </v>

297
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:20.960
<v Speaker 3>scattershot it across all areas.</v>

298
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.243
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you also have to remember is a lot </v>

299
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 3>of the things that we're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are really,</v>

300
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:29.900
<v Speaker 3>really effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also things that are much easier to do.</v>

301
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.640
<v Speaker 3>So two of the best things that we point </v>
<v Speaker 3>out is actually contraception.</v>

302
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.520
<v Speaker 3>So family planning for women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

303
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Because if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that there's,</v>

304
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.510
<v Speaker 3>there's about 13% of women that still </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have access to contraception.</v>

305
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if they got that access,</v>

306
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 3>they would be able to better space it </v>
<v Speaker 3>kits.</v>

307
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:50.624
<v Speaker 3>And we know that that means that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually have your pubes when you're </v>

308
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:53.504
<v Speaker 3>ready to have them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means you put more effort and </v>

309
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Speaker 3>investment into your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they'll grow up better,</v>

310
00:15:58.581 --> 00:15:59.414
<v Speaker 3>they'll be fed better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll have a greater chance of </v>

311
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:02.054
<v Speaker 3>surviving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they'll also become more productive </v>

312
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:04.424
<v Speaker 3>in the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also means fewer of those kids are </v>

313
00:16:06.351 --> 00:16:08.480
<v Speaker 3>going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>few of moms are going to die.</v>

314
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.480
<v Speaker 3>So we actually estimate you'd see about </v>
<v Speaker 3>600,000 fewer kids die and you would get</v>

315
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.480
<v Speaker 3>a demographic dividend that is basically</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have slightly,</v>

316
00:16:18.481 --> 00:16:20.630
<v Speaker 3>if your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can invest more in them,</v>

317
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.583
<v Speaker 3>you get better return on every kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have slightly higher growth rates </v>

318
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:25.903
<v Speaker 3>and so we estimate for every dollar you </v>
<v Speaker 3>spend that family planning you will do </v>

319
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:29.744
<v Speaker 3>$120 of social good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other great thing is invest in free </v>

320
00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:35.684
<v Speaker 3>trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Free Trade is something that we've sort </v>

321
00:16:37.641 --> 00:16:39.240
<v Speaker 3>of forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

322
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.810
<v Speaker 3>we actually had the last big free trade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a discussion from Doha,</v>

323
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in 1999.</v>

324
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:46.810
<v Speaker 3>It's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

325
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.773
<v Speaker 3>stop being a concern obviously with </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump but also with many other people </v>

326
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:53.390
<v Speaker 3>who have sort of given up on free trade </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>

327
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:54.224
<v Speaker 3>We have to remember that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>basic things that have made us wealthy </v>

328
00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.630
<v Speaker 3>is the fact that we trade with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

329
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.090
<v Speaker 3>You do what you're good at and I do what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at.</v>

330
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.090
<v Speaker 3>And that means when we change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually all get better off.</v>

331
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.950
<v Speaker 3>There are some issues here</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some,</v>

332
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.360
<v Speaker 3>in some detail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

333
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.200
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that would mean practically.</v>

334
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:13.034
<v Speaker 3>Like what are the sorts of barriers that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys determined were particularly </v>

335
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 3>troublesome that need to be addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we actually estimate it,</v>

336
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 3>what would it take to get a reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful dough around,</v>

337
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.210
<v Speaker 3>which would not be free trade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be free yard trade.</v>

338
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.250
<v Speaker 3>So it would simply be reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris,</v>

339
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.400
<v Speaker 3>make it easier for everyone to trade </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the world,</v>

340
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.280
<v Speaker 3>especially from the developing world to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the developed world.</v>

341
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.520
<v Speaker 3>And one of the outcomes we found was not</v>
<v Speaker 3>only that,</v>

342
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:41.354
<v Speaker 3>on average,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every person in the world would be </v>

343
00:17:42.741 --> 00:17:43.521
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

344
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:44.354
<v Speaker 3>in the developing world would be about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand dollars richer per person per </v>

345
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 3>year in 2030 so by the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainable development goals,</v>

346
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.200
<v Speaker 3>we would lift 145 million people out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>poverty.</v>

347
00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:00.620
<v Speaker 3>But we would simply make everyone better</v>
<v Speaker 3>off because if you're in a poor country,</v>

348
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:03.630
<v Speaker 3>you would be able to sell the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you do best.</v>

349
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.820
<v Speaker 3>How little easier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little cheaper,</v>

350
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:06.654
<v Speaker 3>and hence be able to market more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'd be able to buy back more from </v>

351
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:13.620
<v Speaker 3>other developed countries and that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>make everyone better off.</v>

352
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>

353
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 3>this is not rocket science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look at China,</v>

354
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:18.490
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

355
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.540
<v Speaker 3>China over the last 30 years lifted what</v>
<v Speaker 3>had 680 million people out of poverty,</v>

356
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.043
<v Speaker 3>very largely driven by the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they could trade with the rest of the </v>

357
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:30.330
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if we could make that happen for</v>

358
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 3>sub Saharan Africa if we could make that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen more for Latin America.</v>

359
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.823
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more about realizing that for very </v>

360
00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:38.034
<v Speaker 3>little money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these things can do an amazing </v>

361
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:41.064
<v Speaker 3>amount of good and we tend to forget </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's no focus on these </v>

362
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:45.594
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't think about a family planning </v>

363
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:51.720
<v Speaker 3>or or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a free trade or indeed vaccinations.</v>

364
00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:52.554
<v Speaker 3>We think about all kinds of other things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like plastic waste or global warming or </v>

365
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.860
<v Speaker 3>many other things that have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

366
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention from,</v>

367
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.880
<v Speaker 3>from celebrities and getting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>newspaper.</v>

368
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's because there are no </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

369
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.360
<v Speaker 3>But it's about getting a sense of what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the magnitude of how much good we can do</v>

370
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.440
<v Speaker 3>with little money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let's talk about global warming</v>

371
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.620
<v Speaker 2>because by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

372
00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:16.060
<v Speaker 2>so my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

373
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to lots of people about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>work and you know,</v>

374
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.860
<v Speaker 2>you obviously have a lot of admirers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of detractors.</v>

375
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.833
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be listening to the detractors </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I believed after I had reviewed </v>

376
00:19:28.031 --> 00:19:28.864
<v Speaker 2>the UN development goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had come to the same conclusion that </v>

377
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.280
<v Speaker 2>you had come to before I knew what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had done,</v>

378
00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:34.114
<v Speaker 2>which was these things need to be rank </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordered because otherwise it's not a </v>

379
00:19:36.701 --> 00:19:38.260
<v Speaker 2>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a strategy.</v>

380
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.470
<v Speaker 2>And so then there has to be some </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism for rank ordering them.</v>

381
00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:43.270
<v Speaker 2>And I ran across your work and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

382
00:19:43.271 --> 00:19:48.040
<v Speaker 2>well that seems to be exactly right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me from an agnostic perspective,</v>

383
00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:48.874
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's an interesting idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what you have to start with is </v>

384
00:19:51.701 --> 00:19:52.534
<v Speaker 2>the willingness to be agnostic about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the worst problems are and while </v>

385
00:19:56.471 --> 00:19:59.530
<v Speaker 2>the worst and most solvable problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say at the same time,</v>

386
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.830
<v Speaker 2>you have to be agnostic about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think that that's part of</v>

387
00:20:02.831 --> 00:20:03.664
<v Speaker 2>the reason why what you do bothers so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many people because they have an a </v>

388
00:20:05.891 --> 00:20:09.640
<v Speaker 2>priori commitment to what constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most salient catastrophe.</v>

389
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.160
<v Speaker 2>And that's clearly at the moment is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the eye,</v>

390
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:14.780
<v Speaker 2>the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

391
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.330
<v Speaker 2>climate change or global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you want to phrase it,</v>

392
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes such an immediate and </v>

393
00:20:22.031 --> 00:20:22.864
<v Speaker 2>pressing threat of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of overwhelming economic magnitude that </v>

394
00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.680
<v Speaker 2>a sacrifice of any amount is worth some </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability of forestalling that.</v>

395
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.030
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

396
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.023
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that striking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>your list and maybe what I should do is </v>

397
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:39.684
<v Speaker 2>have you tell us what the top seven or </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight are just so that we have some </v>

398
00:20:42.631 --> 00:20:43.464
<v Speaker 2>sense of what the priorities are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things I noticed was </v>

399
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>that they don't tend</v>

400
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.430
<v Speaker 3>to include measures that are designed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>forestall global warming.</v>

401
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:53.701
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

402
00:20:53.701 --> 00:20:54.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually,</v>

403
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

404
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.840
<v Speaker 3>we had two Nobel laureates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

405
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.873
<v Speaker 3>look over all of these evident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this evidence and set priorities </v>

406
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 3>and then come out with 19 targets that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they focused on.</v>

407
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:05.950
<v Speaker 3>Actually one of them was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

408
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.813
<v Speaker 3>stop fossil fuel subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously a stupid idea in so </v>

409
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.280
<v Speaker 3>many different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

410
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.220
<v Speaker 3>remember this is most of them developing</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries where it's very often done,</v>

411
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.233
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to basically pacified population a </v>

412
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:19.354
<v Speaker 3>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you make a subsidies for bread or </v>

413
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:22.810
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

414
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.660
<v Speaker 3>but of course the idea of subsidizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>fossil fuels like that.</v>

415
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:28.140
<v Speaker 3>So it was done in Indonesia has done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

416
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.203
<v Speaker 3>is basically a way of subsidizing fairly</v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy people to drive their car that </v>

417
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:33.994
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a car in order to enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 3>this a and drive it more and actually </v>

418
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:38.403
<v Speaker 3>create more congestion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more inclusion and with very few </v>

419
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:41.974
<v Speaker 3>benefits.</v>

420
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:42.873
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so clearly what you should be doing is </v>

421
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.070
<v Speaker 3>scrap those subsidies for fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only because they lead to more,</v>

422
00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>air pollution and co two emissions,</v>

423
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.753
<v Speaker 3>but also because they're just terribly </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad use of public resources that could </v>

424
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:55.654
<v Speaker 3>have been spent on education or health </v>
<v Speaker 3>or other places they could have done a </v>

425
00:21:58.841 --> 00:21:59.674
<v Speaker 3>lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

426
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.723
<v Speaker 3>But just to give you a sense of some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other ones that we were talking </v>

427
00:22:02.891 --> 00:22:03.820
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

428
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.220
<v Speaker 3>expanded immunization as we talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

429
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.263
<v Speaker 3>That's an incredibly good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that we're right now cut child </v>

430
00:22:11.321 --> 00:22:12.154
<v Speaker 3>mortality that is under five mortality </v>
<v Speaker 3>from about 12 million kids dying every </v>

431
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.920
<v Speaker 3>year in 1992 about 6 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fantastic achievement.</v>

432
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:21.993
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>6 million is still a mind boggling </v>

433
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 3>number that's way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way too large.</v>

434
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.450
<v Speaker 3>And we actually know that by investing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a billion dollars,</v>

435
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.220
<v Speaker 3>we could save a million kids every year </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've got to almost say that again</v>

436
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.510
<v Speaker 3>for $1 billion.</v>

437
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.180
<v Speaker 3>You could save a million kids' lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>every year.</v>

438
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:40.210
<v Speaker 3>Why the hell is that not one of our top </v>
<v Speaker 3>priorities?</v>

439
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's also why we show for every </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar spent,</v>

440
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.900
<v Speaker 3>you actually do $60 worth of goods and </v>
<v Speaker 3>other incredible,</v>

441
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>investment is in nutrition.</v>

442
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.501
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

443
00:22:50.501 --> 00:22:52.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody kind of knows that it's,</v>

444
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:53.883
<v Speaker 3>it's not right that people are starving </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we know that we could actually feed </v>

445
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.693
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main reason why people are still </v>

446
00:22:58.631 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 3>starving is because they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough money.</v>

447
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:01.474
<v Speaker 3>It's not because we can't produce it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's because they're poor and they </v>

448
00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:04.504
<v Speaker 3>don't actually have the demand capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the real tragedy of malnutrition is </v>

449
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.460
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get it when you're really small,</v>

450
00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 3>so from zero to two years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain develops less.</v>

451
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.583
<v Speaker 3>And that means when you get into school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually less able to learn and </v>

452
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:23.530
<v Speaker 3>that stays with you for your entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

453
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:28.330
<v Speaker 3>You stay less long than school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you learn less than you come out and you</v>

454
00:23:28.331 --> 00:23:31.510
<v Speaker 3>actually are not very productive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know this now we,</v>

455
00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 3>we've had this as a theoretical argument</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long time.</v>

456
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.043
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but researchers in some of the </v>

457
00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:36.574
<v Speaker 3>researchers that we work with have not </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually proven this because they went </v>

458
00:23:39.641 --> 00:23:43.420
<v Speaker 3>back to an old study done in Guatemala </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the late 1960s,</v>

459
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.453
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where researchers went to two small </v>

460
00:23:46.071 --> 00:23:46.904
<v Speaker 3>villages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ruled water model and gave the kids </v>

461
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:50.024
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the really small zero to two year </v>

462
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 3>olds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good food,</v>

463
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.383
<v Speaker 3>and then they took to other rural </v>
<v Speaker 3>villages nearby and gave the kids </v>

464
00:23:56.331 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 3>essentially sugar water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you couldn't do this today.</v>

465
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.613
<v Speaker 3>But the brilliant thing about it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as our researchers then refound these </v>

466
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:04.094
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they now in their late thirties early </v>

467
00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:08.150
<v Speaker 3>forties and you could see what had </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

468
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 3>and it was exactly what the theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicted.</v>

469
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:14.390
<v Speaker 3>If you had gotten good food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stayed longer in school,</v>

470
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.260
<v Speaker 3>you'll learn more every year in school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you came out,</v>

471
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.153
<v Speaker 3>you were much more productive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways we measure that is </v>

472
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.520
<v Speaker 3>you had higher incomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're avoiding being stunned,</v>

473
00:24:24.521 --> 00:24:29.000
<v Speaker 3>it you had 60% higher income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just a phenomenal outcome.</v>

474
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:30.260
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spend money,</v>

475
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:31.094
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a malnutrition by getting good food and </v>

476
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:36.350
<v Speaker 3>also research and development into </v>
<v Speaker 3>better yielding varieties.</v>

477
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.850
<v Speaker 3>And you can do an incredible amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>good for every dollar we estimate $35 or</v>

478
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:41.684
<v Speaker 3>thereabouts,</v>

479
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you're doing is for stalling</v>

480
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 2>cognitive deterioration in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first two years.</v>

481
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 2>And because cognitive ability is a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictor of longterm success,</v>

482
00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:51.014
<v Speaker 2>then you're producing people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more likely to be economically </v>

483
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.840
<v Speaker 2>productive for themselves and for other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

484
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.861
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

485
00:24:57.861 --> 00:24:58.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

486
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 2>It's also for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

487
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:01.880
<v Speaker 2>If you're yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>

488
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.980
<v Speaker 2>You're likely to make other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>better too.</v>

489
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

490
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an absolutely crucial issue.</v>

491
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

492
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's quite striking.</v>

493
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.373
<v Speaker 2>It was quite striking to me when I came </v>
<v Speaker 2>across your work to find out to what </v>

494
00:25:14.901 --> 00:25:15.734
<v Speaker 2>degree it was focused on targeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>children's health in some fundamental </v>

495
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:22.370
<v Speaker 2>sense in the developing world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be,</v>

496
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.490
<v Speaker 2>if you had to put it in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong.</v>

497
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.010
<v Speaker 2>That seemed to be where are you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>focused or where,</v>

498
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 2>where your focus took you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else can I just say?</v>

499
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Because there's also some other very low</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging fruit.</v>

500
00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:37.280
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

501
00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:39.410
<v Speaker 2>what you're seeing increasingly across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is</v>

502
00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.770
<v Speaker 3>that more and more people died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not of infectious diseases because we've</v>

503
00:25:43.771 --> 00:25:47.760
<v Speaker 3>actually tackled many of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they died from old age diseases like</v>

504
00:25:47.761 --> 00:25:49.300
<v Speaker 3>cancer and heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

505
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.810
<v Speaker 3>it by far the biggest issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>

506
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.210
<v Speaker 3>it turns out to be fairly costly to deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

507
00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.223
<v Speaker 3>But heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've actually now figure it out pretty </v>

508
00:25:58.031 --> 00:25:58.864
<v Speaker 3>much how to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to the extent that we will live </v>

509
00:26:00.821 --> 00:26:01.654
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that we can make people live much </v>

510
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:04.054
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's basically by giving very </v>

511
00:26:05.471 --> 00:26:08.980
<v Speaker 3>cheap and off Patton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a heart med medication.</v>

512
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.023
<v Speaker 3>So we give this a lot of middle aged </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and the developed world and it's </v>

513
00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:14.284
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very cheap to also do in the developing </v>

514
00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:18.370
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can save about three years of life</v>

515
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.490
<v Speaker 3>for these elderly people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both men and women.</v>

516
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.700
<v Speaker 3>And it costs peanuts and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically make all lives longer.</v>

517
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.280
<v Speaker 3>And so that's one of the places where we</v>
<v Speaker 3>also show there's a huge benefit.</v>

518
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.653
<v Speaker 3>We also emphasize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is again one of the depressing </v>

519
00:26:34.361 --> 00:26:37.930
<v Speaker 3>things that we should be focusing a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>more on tuberculosis,</v>

520
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:38.973
<v Speaker 3>tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the world's leading infectious </v>

521
00:26:40.931 --> 00:26:43.260
<v Speaker 3>disease killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no longer HIV aids.</v>

522
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's still a good idea to invest in,</v>

523
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually needing better idea to</v>
<v Speaker 3>invest in tuberculosis.</v>

524
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.340
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's an old diseases,</v>

525
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.223
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been with us for hundreds of years </v>

526
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 3>and we kind of learned to how to fix it </v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred years ago.</v>

527
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.860
<v Speaker 3>It's not an issue in the developed </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

528
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.750
<v Speaker 3>so most people don't want to hear about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

529
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 3>don't care about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a crucial killer that kills 1.4</v>

530
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:07.410
<v Speaker 3>million people every year in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing world.</v>

531
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.520
<v Speaker 3>And we have the means to eradicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much all of those that's very,</v>

532
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:12.600
<v Speaker 3>very cheaply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

533
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:13.583
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the places where we say </v>
<v Speaker 3>spend money here because you can do an </v>

534
00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 3>amazing amount of good.</v>

535
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:21.450
<v Speaker 3>So I think we were just simply looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>for where are the really good deals?</v>

536
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.840
<v Speaker 3>If you want to do something about global</v>
<v Speaker 3>warming is an issue,</v>

537
00:27:24.841 --> 00:27:28.140
<v Speaker 3>then you should ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

538
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's two things to global warming.</v>

539
00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 3>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you mentioned,</v>

540
00:27:32.491 --> 00:27:33.324
<v Speaker 3>there's a sense in which people believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the overwhelming danger that's </v>

541
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.063
<v Speaker 3>going to undermine the entirety of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization and just like pretty much </v>

542
00:27:42.781 --> 00:27:44.460
<v Speaker 3>all other problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just not true.</v>

543
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.890
<v Speaker 3>This is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the end of the world.</v>

544
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the economic system done,</v>

545
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.383
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nobel prize was just a water and </v>

546
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 3>climate economics to Willy North House,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

547
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:55.620
<v Speaker 3>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

548
00:27:55.621 --> 00:27:58.920
<v Speaker 3>and he's been a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy working almost three decades on,</v>

549
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:59.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

550
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.400
<v Speaker 3>on what are the costs and the benefits </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

551
00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:05.400
<v Speaker 3>of climate action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he finds the cost of climate.</v>

552
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.033
<v Speaker 3>So climate change is about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's backed up on a lot of other </v>

553
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:11.304
<v Speaker 3>economists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is somewhere between two and 4% of GDP </v>

554
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.390
<v Speaker 3>by the end of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So remember by then we'll be,</v>

555
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say four or five times richer.</v>

556
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 3>So we'll be 400,</v>
<v Speaker 3>5% as rich as we are now,</v>

557
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.640
<v Speaker 3>but we will see a drop in our incomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>worth about two to 4% less than we would</v>

558
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 3>otherwise have had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

559
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.740
<v Speaker 3>But it's by no means the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

560
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.560
<v Speaker 3>And that's the first thing you sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to recognize.</v>

561
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.050
<v Speaker 3>This is a problem is not the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

562
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Because if you think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the end of the world,</v>

563
00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:42.774
<v Speaker 3>as you rightly pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're willing to throw everything </v>

564
00:28:44.611 --> 00:28:47.220
<v Speaker 3>and the kitchen sink at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it's a problem,</v>

565
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.970
<v Speaker 3>you will act exactly like what I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>we should do with all problems.</v>

566
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:51.803
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

567
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.850
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's ask,</v>

568
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.690
<v Speaker 3>where can we spend a dollar and fix most</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that problem.</v>

569
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.150
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately that's not climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

570
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.170
<v Speaker 3>It's actually really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard to just change it.</v>

571
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 3>A tiny bit of climate change with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of money.</v>

572
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.433
<v Speaker 3>And that's why we find that most of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>interventions that you do for climate </v>

573
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:12.060
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns out to be fairly poor.</v>

574
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.500
<v Speaker 3>They're not necessarily bad investments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them are.</v>

575
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even,</v>

576
00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:16.291
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

577
00:29:16.291 --> 00:29:19.860
<v Speaker 3>adaptation or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or get more energy for,</v>

578
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for poor countries give you sort of,</v>

579
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

580
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:26.100
<v Speaker 3>$5 back on the dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is nice.</v>

581
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.470
<v Speaker 3>But in the big scheme of things here are</v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

582
00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:30.900
<v Speaker 3>much better place as you can spend your </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources on.</v>

583
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.590
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

584
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.250
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh so,</v>

585
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.840
<v Speaker 3>so let's look at God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

586
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I'm really curious about this,</v>

587
00:29:35.961 --> 00:29:36.794
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I can't see any a priori </v>

588
00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 3>problems with your method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me to make a</v>

589
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.843
<v Speaker 2>lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if your goal is to do the most </v>

590
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 2>amount of good in the shortest period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time with the least amount of resources,</v>

591
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.193
<v Speaker 2>which seems like a pretty damn good goal</v>
<v Speaker 2>then and to be realistic about what's </v>

592
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:54.364
<v Speaker 2>attainable then I can't see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone's done a better job from a </v>

593
00:29:57.911 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 2>methodological perspective than you guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

594
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.451
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now,</v>

595
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:04.960
<v Speaker 2>but you still face a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of opposition and most of that does come</v>

596
00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 2>from the climate side of things as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I can tell.</v>

597
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.823
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to think through why </v>

598
00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:11.854
<v Speaker 2>that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I reviewed the climate </v>

599
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.780
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a few years ago,</v>

600
00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:17.893
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had some real concerns about </v>

601
00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:20.434
<v Speaker 2>measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accuracy and so forth because it's a </v>

602
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:27.151
<v Speaker 2>very complicated issue and it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constants that should be associated with</v>

603
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 2>increase in carbon dioxide aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>

604
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:31.930
<v Speaker 2>And there's quite wide error bars around</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

605
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.763
<v Speaker 2>And then carbon dioxide has all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdly complicated effects like </v>

606
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:39.310
<v Speaker 2>increasing green global greening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite an interesting one.</v>

607
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.770
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also struck me that the,</v>

608
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:44.883
<v Speaker 2>if you project out the climate change </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimates across about a 50 to 100 year </v>

609
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:49.324
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the error bars grow very large as you </v>

610
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:53.680
<v Speaker 2>move outward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously because the errors multiply.</v>

611
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:54.933
<v Speaker 2>And then it struck me that we're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where the error bars out 50 </v>

612
00:30:59.711 --> 00:31:03.580
<v Speaker 2>years or so wide that even if we did </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people recommended now,</v>

613
00:31:03.581 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 2>we could never be sure that it actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked because you can't,</v>

614
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.993
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the propagation of error across all </v>

615
00:31:10.571 --> 00:31:13.870
<v Speaker 2>those decades makes the picture so </v>
<v Speaker 2>blurry two or three,</v>

616
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:14.704
<v Speaker 2>four decades down the road that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no way of garnering evidence about the </v>

617
00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:21.160
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness of your intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's a high cost intervention,</v>

618
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:22.900
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be a really bad idea.</v>

619
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.251
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

620
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:25.084
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to step one more step </v>

621
00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:26.830
<v Speaker 2>backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

622
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:28.443
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also found it difficult to trust the </v>

623
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:33.304
<v Speaker 2>climate science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that was that it </v>

624
00:31:35.321 --> 00:31:38.470
<v Speaker 2>struck me as motivated by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

625
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:39.723
<v Speaker 2>issues in la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in some part that were outside </v>

626
00:31:42.821 --> 00:31:43.654
<v Speaker 2>of the science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that a tremendous amount </v>

627
00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:52.050
<v Speaker 2>of what motivates people's psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment to the idea of climate change</v>

628
00:31:52.051 --> 00:31:52.884
<v Speaker 2>is an underlying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like an underlying anti </v>

629
00:31:54.591 --> 00:31:55.424
<v Speaker 2>western or anticapitalist ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the idea is that we should </v>

630
00:32:00.221 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 2>restrict growth and we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>restructure the economic system and that</v>

631
00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:06.370
<v Speaker 2>would address climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that would be a positive thing.</v>

632
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:07.204
<v Speaker 2>And it's forced all the apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the real goal seems to be more to </v>

633
00:32:10.511 --> 00:32:11.344
<v Speaker 2>find an ethical justification for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political position that requires the </v>

634
00:32:14.111 --> 00:32:17.260
<v Speaker 2>retooling of these economic systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

635
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.780
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

636
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I guess the first thing I'd like to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what you,</v>

637
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 2>does that strike you as a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument?</v>

638
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.123
<v Speaker 2>Cause I can't see otherwise why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be objecting to what it is that </v>

639
00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:32.530
<v Speaker 2>you're doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

640
00:32:32.531 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of questions and then let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't unpack some of those.</v>

641
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

642
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

643
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.000
<v Speaker 3>if you look out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

644
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

645
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.050
<v Speaker 3>going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

646
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.580
<v Speaker 3>some of that actually cancels out when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were saying,</v>

647
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.593
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're uncertain about how much the </v>

648
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:49.034
<v Speaker 3>temperature rise will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do know that it's a causal </v>

649
00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 3>mechanism is CEO to lead to higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>warming.</v>

650
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 3>If you take some of the Sio two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will get less of it.</v>

651
00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Now we don't exactly know how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you get less,</v>

652
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:02.084
<v Speaker 3>whether it was a lot down here a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit or whether it was here in down a </v>

653
00:33:05.281 --> 00:33:06.114
<v Speaker 3>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but did you actually get a little bit </v>

654
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.243
<v Speaker 3>the same thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can take some of the error bars </v>

655
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 3>up because you're only looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference,</v>

656
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:13.933
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're not actually looking at the </v>

657
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.740
<v Speaker 3>actual input.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

658
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 3>the other thing I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in no doubt that there's a lot of,</v>

659
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.353
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other reasons why people latch on to </v>

660
00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 3>social phenomena.</v>

661
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:25.131
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

662
00:33:25.131 --> 00:33:25.964
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when some climate scientists say we </v>

663
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:31.100
<v Speaker 3>should cut carbon emissions because this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is leading to a really dangerous issue,</v>

664
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:32.870
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of other people who will </v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

665
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.150
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually fits with my ideological,</v>

666
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.070
<v Speaker 3>a priest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the substation.</v>

667
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:38.840
<v Speaker 3>So I'll actually join in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

668
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this conversation.</v>

669
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 3>I think that happens in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different areas.</v>

670
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:43.983
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to do is to sort of step back and </v>

671
00:33:46.521 --> 00:33:46.821
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

672
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:50.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get into all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm simply taking as the starting point.</v>

673
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.470
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're economist.</v>

674
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a political scientist,</v>

675
00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:55.070
<v Speaker 3>but all the people I work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our economists,</v>

676
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:59.870
<v Speaker 3>we just take as given what the climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists are telling us.</v>

677
00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

678
00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.440
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

679
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.540
<v Speaker 3>did they actually get it somewhat wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

680
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 3>and I think certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

681
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.360
<v Speaker 3>somebody should be looking into it.</v>

682
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.450
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

683
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 3>I've met a lot of these climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists.</v>

684
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:14.270
<v Speaker 3>My sense is that they're good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardworking,</v>

685
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:15.283
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists are actually trying to find </v>

686
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:17.564
<v Speaker 3>out what's the up and down in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we said we'd take our starting point </v>

687
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.943
<v Speaker 3>with you and climate panel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we do is we ask how much will it </v>

688
00:34:26.091 --> 00:34:31.091
<v Speaker 3>cost to cut carbon emissions so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we will see a significant change in</v>

689
00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:35.240
<v Speaker 3>temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course remember we emit co2,</v>

690
00:34:35.241 --> 00:34:38.150
<v Speaker 3>not because we want to bother Al Gore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone one else.</v>

691
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.103
<v Speaker 3>It's a byproduct of having a life that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is incredibly much nicer than one we </v>

692
00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:47.420
<v Speaker 3>would have if we didn't have access to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of energy.</v>

693
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean we can sit and talk here across </v>
<v Speaker 3>the continent,</v>

694
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.583
<v Speaker 3>but also you have heating and cooling </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a fertilizer that subsidize I </v>

695
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.083
<v Speaker 3>official fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It basically feeds half the world's </v>

696
00:34:59.091 --> 00:34:59.924
<v Speaker 3>population and a lot of other benefits </v>
<v Speaker 3>that come from mostly using fossil </v>

697
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:03.980
<v Speaker 3>fuels.</v>

698
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.240
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to get rid of some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those fossil fuels and pot,</v>

699
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.113
<v Speaker 3>possibly all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will have to replace it with more </v>

700
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:12.120
<v Speaker 3>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

701
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.800
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it costs to cut corporate</v>

702
00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 3>emissions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that may be worth the cost,</v>

703
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:18.974
<v Speaker 3>but that's exactly the question that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to ask and that's what William </v>

704
00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:22.683
<v Speaker 3>Nordhaus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nobel laureate and the climate </v>

705
00:35:23.631 --> 00:35:27.440
<v Speaker 3>economics and many of us fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's really important.</v>

706
00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:30.620
<v Speaker 3>It's really important to note that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not questioning the science as it</v>

707
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:31.454
<v Speaker 3>stands now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so that this is purely a </v>

708
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:35.090
<v Speaker 3>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic calculation.</v>

709
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.070
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is only a bad thing.</v>

710
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:37.973
<v Speaker 3>Good co2 impacts warming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it does so in the way that the UN </v>

711
00:35:42.091 --> 00:35:43.620
<v Speaker 3>climate panel tells us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

712
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.483
<v Speaker 3>that's not entirely true because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things that they tell us and </v>

713
00:35:47.641 --> 00:35:50.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole variability and we tried</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take that into account,</v>

714
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.190
<v Speaker 3>but honestly it turns out that if you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it on the central estimates,</v>

715
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.620
<v Speaker 3>you get pretty much what I'm about to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you.</v>

716
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.220
<v Speaker 3>So what you find is if you cut carbon </v>
<v Speaker 3>emissions,</v>

717
00:35:59.221 --> 00:36:02.940
<v Speaker 3>now you can have a little bit of impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a hundred years,</v>

718
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.770
<v Speaker 3>but it will have a significant cost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's not going to put us to the poor</v>

719
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:08.604
<v Speaker 3>house that nobody's talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like we're not talking about the </v>

720
00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:12.024
<v Speaker 3>end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we don't do something about climate </v>

721
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:14.094
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about the end of the </v>

722
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:16.104
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we do something about climate change </v>

723
00:36:17.191 --> 00:36:19.650
<v Speaker 3>drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want to sort of dial it back on the</v>

724
00:36:19.651 --> 00:36:21.360
<v Speaker 3>rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both from the alarmists that say,</v>

725
00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:22.860
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is coming to an end.</v>

726
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Or the people who are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

727
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 3>we can't afford this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we all going to the poor house.</v>

728
00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:28.810
<v Speaker 3>If you want to have solar panels and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wind turbines.</v>

729
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:33.020
<v Speaker 3>These are both manageable costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thesis sort of in the order,</v>

730
00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:33.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two to 4% but the problem is that if we </v>

731
00:36:37.021 --> 00:36:37.854
<v Speaker 3>do sort of things that cost one to 2% of</v>
<v Speaker 3>GDP right now and for the rest of the </v>

732
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.600
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we basically solve almost no,</v>

733
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.870
<v Speaker 3>no part of the global warming problem.</v>

734
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:49.703
<v Speaker 3>We'd probably saw about 1% of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically by incurring a cost of one </v>

735
00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:57.780
<v Speaker 3>to 2% of GDP now and every year </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout the rest of the century,</v>

736
00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:58.763
<v Speaker 3>you will have solved almost none of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem come 2100 so you still have to </v>

737
00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:07.740
<v Speaker 3>pay all the same problems that global </v>
<v Speaker 3>warming is as encouraging,</v>

738
00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.420
<v Speaker 3>minus a slight amount and then you paid </v>
<v Speaker 3>one to 2% every year.</v>

739
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:17.780
<v Speaker 3>That's the basic idea of why most cost </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit analysis show that unless you do</v>

740
00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 3>it very carefully and only do a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of cutting and do it really smartly,</v>

741
00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:27.300
<v Speaker 3>you're actually incurring higher costs </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the problem you're trying to solve.</v>

742
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.320
<v Speaker 3>So we can thread the needle and do </v>
<v Speaker 3>really carefully,</v>

743
00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.230
<v Speaker 3>but that requires a lot of smartness </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a lot of politicians.</v>

744
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.513
<v Speaker 3>But if we do it really bluntly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to incur lots of costs </v>

745
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:40.050
<v Speaker 3>to actually not get very many benefits.</v>

746
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:40.913
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the people who are not happy </v>

747
00:37:42.841 --> 00:37:43.674
<v Speaker 3>with you for not prioritizing climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>change to the degree that it should be </v>

748
00:37:46.471 --> 00:37:47.304
<v Speaker 3>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how do they criticize your </v>

749
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:51.984
<v Speaker 3>statements?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like on what basis do they decide that </v>

750
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:57.120
<v Speaker 3>your conclusions are inappropriate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

751
00:37:57.121 --> 00:37:57.954
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you read most of the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a lot of things they'll just </v>

752
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:01.201
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

753
00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:02.880
<v Speaker 3>you're a denier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say that.</v>

754
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.430
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>excommunicate you.</v>

755
00:38:05.431 --> 00:38:07.170
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not right.</v>

756
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.781
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

757
00:38:07.781 --> 00:38:10.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really going to talk about those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people because that's just,</v>

758
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:11.323
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's political posturing that rather </v>

759
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:15.300
<v Speaker 3>than anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a reasonable argument to</v>

760
00:38:15.301 --> 00:38:19.560
<v Speaker 3>be made to say that's not the only way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can approach this.</v>

761
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:22.800
<v Speaker 3>So there's two ways you can think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>cost benefit analysis,</v>

762
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:26.580
<v Speaker 3>actually showing that climate impacts </v>
<v Speaker 3>are worth doing.</v>

763
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.280
<v Speaker 3>One is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

764
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.900
<v Speaker 3>but there might be a tiny risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even just a tiny risk to the whole world</v>

765
00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:36.580
<v Speaker 3>is going to spin out of control and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all going to die kind of thing.</v>

766
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.250
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not implausible.</v>

767
00:38:39.251 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you say sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to put a percentage on it,</v>

768
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.220
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's greater than zero.</v>

769
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.433
<v Speaker 3>So there's a non zero chance that global</v>
<v Speaker 3>warming will spin out of control and </v>

770
00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 3>we'll basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be,</v>

771
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:52.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rally get a few,</v>

772
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:52.984
<v Speaker 3>couple a hundred couples of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of humans living on an ice free Arctic </v>

773
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.353
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a positive feedback loop </v>

774
00:38:58.901 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

775
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:00.634
<v Speaker 3>That we might trigger mechanisms like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the melting of the greenland ice sheet </v>

776
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:05.890
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would flood the world or cause some</v>

777
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 3>irreparable catastrophe of unparalleled </v>
<v Speaker 3>magnitude.</v>

778
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:10.240
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

779
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.990
<v Speaker 3>so I have a question about that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a tricky one to address,</v>

780
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:14.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

781
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of an apocalyptic argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the argument would be,</v>

782
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:18.543
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a 1% chance of an infinite </v>

783
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:20.644
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth any donation of resources to </v>

784
00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:23.464
<v Speaker 3>stave it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one way of thinking about that is </v>

785
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:32.401
<v Speaker 3>actually to multiply the catastrophes </v>
<v Speaker 3>because my suspicions are that that same</v>

786
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:33.964
<v Speaker 3>argument could be used in relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a lot of the other problems that you </v>

787
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:39.034
<v Speaker 3>are trying to address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know what the probability </v>

788
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:42.934
<v Speaker 3>is that if we keep a substantial number </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people in abject poverty over the </v>

789
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:48.730
<v Speaker 3>next 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say more than we'd have to,</v>

790
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:53.430
<v Speaker 3>that we would increase the probability </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the generation of um,</v>

791
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>epidemic and infectious diseases because</v>

792
00:39:57.551 --> 00:40:01.690
<v Speaker 3>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor people are risk to everyone in this</v>

793
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 3>court is a horrible way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

794
00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 3>But poverty is a risk to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a better way of thinking about it</v>

795
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:07.804
<v Speaker 3>because decreased global human health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also a breeding ground for all </v>

796
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:13.330
<v Speaker 3>sorts of catastrophes that might emerge.</v>

797
00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.163
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 3>political instability and a nuclear war </v>

798
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:21.130
<v Speaker 3>and all of those things that are also </v>
<v Speaker 3>equally apocalyptic.</v>

799
00:40:21.131 --> 00:40:21.964
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me to be reasonable to some </v>

800
00:40:24.131 --> 00:40:25.090
<v Speaker 3>degree to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

801
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:26.763
<v Speaker 3>there's the possibility across a wide </v>
<v Speaker 3>range of potential crises of unforeseen </v>

802
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:32.980
<v Speaker 3>positive feedback loops spiraling out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

803
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.260
<v Speaker 3>But we can't introduce them into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument less.</v>

804
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:38.010
<v Speaker 3>We can parameterize them because all it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

805
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.863
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an unfair game move in some sense </v>

806
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 3>because you can't be not wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

807
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.050
<v Speaker 3>You can exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

808
00:40:45.051 --> 00:40:45.884
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're,</v>

809
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.230
<v Speaker 3>you're basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you allow it in,</v>

810
00:40:48.231 --> 00:40:50.500
<v Speaker 3>in this area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because you like that,</v>

811
00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:51.334
<v Speaker 3>cause they go there a area and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to focus more money on my </v>

812
00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:55.450
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is climate change.</v>

813
00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.570
<v Speaker 3>You could equally well do it in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of other areas.</v>

814
00:40:58.571 --> 00:41:00.910
<v Speaker 3>And I actually think you can make your </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument even stronger.</v>

815
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.760
<v Speaker 3>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just the poverty sort of breeds</v>

816
00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:04.594
<v Speaker 3>a lot of risks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also that they breed terrorism </v>

817
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.090
<v Speaker 3>and willingness to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

818
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a lot of bad things and you know,</v>

819
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:11.643
<v Speaker 3>focused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just something that happens </v>

820
00:41:13.091 --> 00:41:13.920
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

821
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.753
<v Speaker 3>threatened by terrorists and our ability</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep all the plutonium in the world </v>

822
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 3>under,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under law and,</v>

823
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:20.883
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get catastrophe from anything </v>

824
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.860
<v Speaker 3>nor Canto App.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So abject poverty for example.</v>

825
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.260
<v Speaker 3>You could imagine that there might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>two socioeconomic contributions to that.</v>

826
00:41:29.261 --> 00:41:30.094
<v Speaker 3>There would be the absolute number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in abject poverty who are </v>

827
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:33.763
<v Speaker 3>therefore desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there would also be maybe </v>

828
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:36.524
<v Speaker 3>another contribution of excess </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality and a sense that the world </v>

829
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 3>isn't laying itself out fairly and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would justify political,</v>

830
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.883
<v Speaker 3>political and revolutionary and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stability and also a state failure and </v>

831
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:53.380
<v Speaker 3>many other things that we know make it a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot easier for everyone to,</v>

832
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.080
<v Speaker 3>to make really bad things like we saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of Afghanistan,</v>

833
00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with nine 11 and a lot of other things.</v>

834
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you,</v>

835
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 3>once you get failed states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a lot of bad things happen.</v>

836
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.233
<v Speaker 3>We try to make people better off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We tried to make people federoff </v>

837
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.780
<v Speaker 3>globally so that we decrease the </v>
<v Speaker 3>probability of,</v>

838
00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 3>of large scale political instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political and economic instability.</v>

839
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.710
<v Speaker 3>And that's another way of staving off an</v>
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse.</v>

840
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.821
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

841
00:42:16.821 --> 00:42:19.540
<v Speaker 3>And then on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I just say,</v>

842
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.610
<v Speaker 3>so northouse actually looked at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know about Lauren,</v>

843
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.553
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because some people aren't exactly what </v>

844
00:42:24.621 --> 00:42:25.454
<v Speaker 3>you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a tiny risk that things go </v>

845
00:42:26.991 --> 00:42:27.741
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad.</v>

846
00:42:27.741 --> 00:42:30.290
<v Speaker 3>So we should spend all of our money on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this issue.</v>

847
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.590
<v Speaker 3>But of course that's a failed argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>because likewise,</v>

848
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:36.560
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of small risks everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

849
00:42:36.561 --> 00:42:41.561
<v Speaker 3>We know one risk which is being hit by </v>
<v Speaker 3>an asteroid that could wipe out the uh,</v>

850
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.860
<v Speaker 3>the earth yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Nordhaus did that.</v>

851
00:42:44.861 --> 00:42:46.370
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very elegant.</v>

852
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:47.563
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that we can track all of those </v>

853
00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:51.104
<v Speaker 3>asteroids out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>99.99% but we chose to only track 90% </v>

854
00:42:57.081 --> 00:42:59.300
<v Speaker 3>because tracking the rest was too </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive.</v>

855
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:00.583
<v Speaker 3>So you can actually see that we put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>price on how much are we willing to do </v>

856
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:04.851
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

857
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:05.684
<v Speaker 3>that's just one place where we have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very clear example that we say we cast </v>

858
00:43:09.551 --> 00:43:12.980
<v Speaker 3>somewhat for the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't care about it entirely.</v>

859
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.190
<v Speaker 3>We have lots of other issues that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to focus on right now.</v>

860
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:20.510
<v Speaker 3>So that's every other area you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>rq,</v>

861
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 3>what is the risks and what are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to do this?</v>

862
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.573
<v Speaker 3>And absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given that there are some risks and </v>

863
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:30.530
<v Speaker 3>they're probably more downside risk than</v>
<v Speaker 3>upside risk for global warming,</v>

864
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.620
<v Speaker 3>we should probably do a little more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we would otherwise do.</v>

865
00:43:33.621 --> 00:43:35.330
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what the model show </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

866
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.343
<v Speaker 3>And those are the models that we use in </v>
<v Speaker 3>making the estimate of how much should </v>

867
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:41.810
<v Speaker 3>you be paying for global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>

868
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.720
<v Speaker 3>we should take that into account,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not a good argument.</v>

869
00:43:44.721 --> 00:43:46.130
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was one argument.</v>

870
00:43:46.131 --> 00:43:46.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

871
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I'll try to be a little with the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

872
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:49.813
<v Speaker 3>The other argument is that people will </v>
<v Speaker 3>say one of the reasons why it doesn't </v>

873
00:43:53.151 --> 00:43:56.270
<v Speaker 3>pay to do global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is because you have to pay now,</v>

874
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.240
<v Speaker 3>but the benefits come far up into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

875
00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:00.074
<v Speaker 3>So basically you do something now that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly costly and then you get a tiny </v>

876
00:44:03.111 --> 00:44:03.944
<v Speaker 3>benefit in a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to really say the future's </v>

877
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 3>incredibly important economic speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is that the discount is really low.</v>

878
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:13.244
<v Speaker 3>They really care a lot about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now a lot of people would argue we </v>

879
00:44:17.001 --> 00:44:17.520
<v Speaker 3>should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

880
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.353
<v Speaker 3>we're rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be able to care enormously </v>

881
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:21.770
<v Speaker 3>about the future.</v>

882
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.843
<v Speaker 3>And if you change that parameter enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say we care enormously about </v>

883
00:44:25.971 --> 00:44:26.804
<v Speaker 3>future generations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually turns out that global </v>

884
00:44:29.151 --> 00:44:30.740
<v Speaker 3>warming becomes a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

885
00:44:30.741 --> 00:44:33.000
<v Speaker 3>doing something about global warming </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually becomes,</v>

886
00:44:33.001 --> 00:44:33.834
<v Speaker 3>goes from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

887
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.560
<v Speaker 3>saying you spend a dollar and you do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of cents of climate damage to,</v>

888
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.453
<v Speaker 3>sorry to avoid climate damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually spend a dollar and you </v>

889
00:44:40.651 --> 00:44:45.360
<v Speaker 3>might do $2 of climate benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it actually turns it into good idea.</v>

890
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.560
<v Speaker 3>But here's the kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you care that much about the future,</v>

891
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.540
<v Speaker 3>you change every other one of all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these priorities and make them Whoa,</v>

892
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:55.463
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we're obviously happens is </v>

893
00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.490
<v Speaker 3>you've just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I care so much about the future that the</v>

894
00:44:59.491 --> 00:45:03.960
<v Speaker 3>guy that I will save from not having </v>
<v Speaker 3>tuberculosis and dying from it tomorrow,</v>

895
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 3>we'll now go on to have a successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

896
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 3>His kids will live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll do better,</v>

897
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.330
<v Speaker 3>he will have a better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his nation will do better.</v>

898
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 3>That means there'll be much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much better off in 2100 and so on.</v>

899
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:16.583
<v Speaker 3>And that means that this is no longer a </v>
<v Speaker 3>question of saying you spend it all in </v>

900
00:45:19.631 --> 00:45:22.710
<v Speaker 3>you to $43 worth of goods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you spend it all,</v>

901
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.553
<v Speaker 3>you $1,000 worth of goods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you've achieved as basically </v>

902
00:45:27.631 --> 00:45:28.464
<v Speaker 3>just make everything a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also intellectually what making </v>

903
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.350
<v Speaker 3>the discount rate very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very small.</v>

904
00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.200
<v Speaker 3>What it means is you should basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>starve.</v>

905
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.213
<v Speaker 3>You should just eat porch every day and </v>
<v Speaker 3>spend all of the rest of your money on </v>

906
00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:44.940
<v Speaker 3>the future because you care so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it right now.</v>

907
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

908
00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:49.140
<v Speaker 3>I applaud your are sort of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your consistency,</v>

909
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.273
<v Speaker 3>but most people just don't do this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we certainly don't do this in the way </v>

910
00:45:52.801 --> 00:45:53.270
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

911
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:55.890
<v Speaker 3>we don't seem to care all that much </v>
<v Speaker 3>about our pension systems,</v>

912
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.700
<v Speaker 3>which are in many rich countries got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fail in the next 20 to 40 years.</v>

913
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:02.950
<v Speaker 3>All these other issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as long as you were saying no,</v>

914
00:46:02.951 --> 00:46:03.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

915
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.030
<v Speaker 3>what you're really saying then is on </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate.</v>

916
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:06.923
<v Speaker 3>We want to care a lot about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't want to do it in all other </v>

917
00:46:09.241 --> 00:46:09.960
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

918
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.793
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to do it across all areas and </v>

919
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:14.980
<v Speaker 3>then you need to be very hungry and only</v>
<v Speaker 3>parch.</v>

920
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:15.601
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

921
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:16.434
<v Speaker 3>So your claim basically from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>methodological perspective is that your </v>

922
00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:21.900
<v Speaker 3>rank ordering remains constant across </v>
<v Speaker 3>variable discount rates.</v>

923
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:23.251
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

924
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:24.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a really important,</v>

925
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:25.763
<v Speaker 3>that's a really fundamentally important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not until I got to say it does </v>

926
00:46:29.311 --> 00:46:32.310
<v Speaker 3>change some of these because obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.273
<v Speaker 3>education for instance is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you pay now and you'll only get </v>

928
00:46:35.761 --> 00:46:36.594
<v Speaker 3>benefits 10 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 years out when the kids grow up in </v>

929
00:46:39.081 --> 00:46:40.500
<v Speaker 3>the actual become much more productive.</v>

930
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.513
<v Speaker 3>So there is a change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mostly the rank order ordering </v>

931
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.233
<v Speaker 3>remains the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm simply just insisting that </v>

932
00:46:46.681 --> 00:46:49.050
<v Speaker 3>people need to be consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just say,</v>

933
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.113
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the future is important when you talk </v>

934
00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:52.074
<v Speaker 3>about climate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to want to say the future is </v>

935
00:46:53.101 --> 00:46:55.140
<v Speaker 3>important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's important across all areas and then</v>

936
00:46:55.141 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 3>you really have to do everything and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

937
00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.510
<v Speaker 3>forego a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a good life for yourself.</v>

938
00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.300
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

939
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:00.781
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

940
00:47:00.781 --> 00:47:01.614
<v Speaker 3>so the other thing that's worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 3>pointing out about the discount rate is </v>

941
00:47:04.051 --> 00:47:04.940
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

942
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:08.250
<v Speaker 3>you can make a case that the future is </v>
<v Speaker 3>more important than the present.</v>

943
00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Especially cause it's extends out so </v>
<v Speaker 3>far.</v>

944
00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:11.394
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other reason that people </v>

945
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:13.344
<v Speaker 3>discount the future is because you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>make the case that you can predict the </v>

946
00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:17.964
<v Speaker 3>outcome of your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means that the error in </v>

947
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:24.220
<v Speaker 3>prediction magnifies itself as you move </v>
<v Speaker 3>out farther in timeframe.</v>

948
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.103
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is you get to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where there isn't a lot of point </v>

949
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.580
<v Speaker 3>in adjusting your behavior in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>

950
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.980
<v Speaker 3>If you look like a hundred years out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

951
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:33.814
<v Speaker 3>or a thousand years out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you actually can't calculate </v>

952
00:47:35.801 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 3>with any accuracy the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your actions or inactions.</v>

953
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.173
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cumulative error makes discounting </v>

954
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:43.894
<v Speaker 3>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the appropriate thing to do because you </v>

955
00:47:45.701 --> 00:47:47.860
<v Speaker 3>can predict what's going to happen if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you act now,</v>

956
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:51.220
<v Speaker 3>now and maybe tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you get much less accurate as,</v>

957
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.233
<v Speaker 3>as you move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even in the best case scenario where </v>

958
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:55.444
<v Speaker 3>we had the best wishes for the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean we could justify </v>

959
00:47:58.811 --> 00:47:59.644
<v Speaker 3>incredibly radical sacrifices now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we can't calculate their </v>

960
00:48:01.781 --> 00:48:03.360
<v Speaker 3>cumulative impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

961
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

962
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.383
<v Speaker 3>there's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a good way of thinking about </v>

963
00:48:06.701 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

964
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.690
<v Speaker 3>if you look at what previous generations</v>
<v Speaker 3>has done for us,</v>

965
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:11.853
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that they really managed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do is to give us a lot more </v>

966
00:48:14.561 --> 00:48:15.394
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>

967
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.293
<v Speaker 3>So investment in knowledge is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great way to help future generations </v>

968
00:48:19.421 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 3>because it helped them in all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways and we can't really predict how,</v>

969
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:25.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's probably a good idea to leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>them with a lot of books.</v>

970
00:48:25.931 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm using that as a metaphor,</v>

971
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.253
<v Speaker 3>but trying to help them in a specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>way in matching back a hundred years </v>

972
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:36.070
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our forefathers back in the 1920s,</v>

973
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:41.550
<v Speaker 3>no 1910s would have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have done reasonably to help us.</v>

974
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chances are they would have wasted a lot</v>

975
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:47.050
<v Speaker 3>of money on things that never turn into </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

976
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.060
<v Speaker 3>There's a wonderful book called today </v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

977
00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

978
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm forgetting now.</v>

979
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

980
00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 3>it has a great and clever title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've clearly screwed up now,</v>

981
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:06.310
<v Speaker 3>but it was back in 1893.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

982
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:06.881
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

983
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:08.920
<v Speaker 3>the world's fair in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

984
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:09.963
<v Speaker 3>ask 50 of the world's smartest people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>predict what would the world look like </v>

985
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:14.470
<v Speaker 3>in a hundred years.</v>

986
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.200
<v Speaker 3>And so all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first star said,</v>

987
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:19.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that I'm not going to be</v>

988
00:49:19.091 --> 00:49:21.940
<v Speaker 3>around when this prediction comes true </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>

989
00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they made all their predictions</v>

990
00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:26.990
<v Speaker 3>and they were almost entirely off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

991
00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:27.853
<v Speaker 3>There's some pretty close or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one that it predicted sort of </v>

992
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:34.840
<v Speaker 3>email in the sense that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those [inaudible] and then up,</v>

993
00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 3>I can't pronounce that pneumatics </v>
<v Speaker 3>pneumatic tubes.</v>

994
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which has sent away and it would sort of</v>

995
00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.060
<v Speaker 3>suck it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you could send a letter somewhere</v>

996
00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.590
<v Speaker 3>they imagined that that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>worldwide thing.</v>

997
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 3>And so you could actually send a letter </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

998
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:51.700
<v Speaker 3>You just sort of put it in the very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very long tube,</v>

999
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.360
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can sort of say,</v>

1000
00:49:55.361 --> 00:49:55.991
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1001
00:49:55.991 --> 00:49:57.520
<v Speaker 3>that's not entirely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1002
00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 3>got the whole technology wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the right idea.</v>

1003
00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:01.443
<v Speaker 3>But the fundamental point is we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably wrong about so many things as </v>

1004
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:05.584
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I am to help the world in the </v>

1005
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:09.520
<v Speaker 3>future by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

1006
00:50:09.521 --> 00:50:14.290
<v Speaker 3>cutting temperature might be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>least effective ways of helping also.</v>

1007
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:17.080
<v Speaker 3>So there's another thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about that.</v>

1008
00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:22.000
<v Speaker 3>I think that speaks to the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence of your approach.</v>

1009
00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:27.001
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things that has struck me </v>
<v Speaker 3>as highly likely is that given complex</v>

1010
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 2>things are and how rapidly they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing that the best thing we could do</v>

1011
00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 2>to prepare ourselves for the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be to make better people,</v>

1012
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.720
<v Speaker 2>smarter people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiser people,</v>

1013
00:50:38.721 --> 00:50:40.310
<v Speaker 2>more responsible people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

1014
00:50:40.311 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 2>So there's a psychological element to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1015
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.483
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say some of my work has </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrated on that and the public </v>

1016
00:50:46.821 --> 00:50:47.654
<v Speaker 2>lectures that I've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting about your </v>

1017
00:50:49.551 --> 00:50:50.384
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economic approaches that you're </v>

1018
00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:52.634
<v Speaker 2>diverting a lot of resources to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation of better people for tomorrow </v>

1019
00:50:56.691 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 2>by investing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in in childhood nutrition.</v>

1020
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:00.733
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I suppose this is kind of how we </v>

1021
00:51:02.971 --> 00:51:03.804
<v Speaker 2>economists look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe biologists could look at it </v>

1022
00:51:05.481 --> 00:51:06.314
<v Speaker 2>this way too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think of people as general </v>

1023
00:51:08.241 --> 00:51:11.380
<v Speaker 2>problem solving machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not a bad way of thinking about</v>

1024
00:51:11.381 --> 00:51:12.214
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it might be that given that you </v>

1025
00:51:14.061 --> 00:51:16.550
<v Speaker 2>don't know which problems are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be paramount,</v>

1026
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:19.790
<v Speaker 2>what you want to do is improve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines that will solve the problems,</v>

1027
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.470
<v Speaker 2>whatever those problems happen to be.</v>

1028
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:26.800
<v Speaker 2>And so that investment in early </v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood development seems particularly</v>

1029
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Apropos in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so having said that,</v>

1030
00:51:31.491 --> 00:51:32.324
<v Speaker 2>I want to return to the climate issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>one more time because here's something </v>

1031
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:37.970
<v Speaker 2>peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something I don't understand.</v>

1032
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.373
<v Speaker 2>It's a real mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that just for the sake of </v>

1033
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:43.124
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that most of the people who are </v>

1034
00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:44.864
<v Speaker 2>concerned about climate change and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to economic development or </v>

1035
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:51.050
<v Speaker 2>on the left side of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1036
00:51:51.051 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 2>but led,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's also say that those who are on</v>

1037
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:53.804
<v Speaker 2>the left side of the spectrum are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically also concerned with the </v>

1038
00:51:57.081 --> 00:51:57.914
<v Speaker 2>economic wellbeing of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispossessed and that those might be </v>

1039
00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:04.580
<v Speaker 2>equally important concerns and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity locked together.</v>

1040
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.713
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strange thing about so many of your </v>

1041
00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:08.294
<v Speaker 2>recommendations is that they're directly</v>
<v Speaker 2>aimed at addressing the immediate now </v>

1042
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 2>concerns of the fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispossessed.</v>

1043
00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:17.383
<v Speaker 2>And so you'd think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the reason that I can't </v>

1044
00:52:19.671 --> 00:52:20.504
<v Speaker 2>understand why there's so much objection</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your methods because it's not like </v>

1045
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:26.323
<v Speaker 2>what you came up with looks like support</v>
<v Speaker 2>for something that's like a right wing </v>

1046
00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:32.180
<v Speaker 2>agenda by any stretch of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

1047
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:33.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1048
00:52:33.321 --> 00:52:36.770
<v Speaker 2>it's predicated on the idea that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of development aid,</v>

1049
00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:39.680
<v Speaker 2>especially directed to children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said not exclusively.</v>

1050
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.640
<v Speaker 2>There would be of great use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it seems to me to be undeniable that</v>

1051
00:52:43.641 --> 00:52:44.474
<v Speaker 2>the most dispossessed people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world are impoverished infants of </v>

1052
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:50.480
<v Speaker 2>impoverished people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1053
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.733
<v Speaker 2>so what if some of the objections to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing are ideologically </v>

1054
00:52:56.421 --> 00:52:58.910
<v Speaker 2>motivated?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why doesn't that cancel it out?</v>

1055
00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.540
<v Speaker 2>As a good question and I don't quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>

1056
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.030
<v Speaker 2>My sense is that in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1057
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:05.680
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1058
00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.920
<v Speaker 2>I was in New York in September.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1059
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.550
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1060
00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:12.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first I heard a summit at the UN,</v>

1061
00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:14.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for tuberculosis and I was there because</v>

1062
00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:15.194
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that we've identified </v>
<v Speaker 2>as this is a great investment and of </v>

1063
00:53:17.991 --> 00:53:19.710
<v Speaker 2>course all the tugboats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tuberculosis,</v>

1064
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.810
<v Speaker 2>people love us because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1065
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:23.270
<v Speaker 2>we're finding out you should spend more </v>
<v Speaker 2>money on their problem.</v>

1066
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1067
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>and almost</v>

1068
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.270
<v Speaker 3>nobody went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1069
00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an orbit together with the South African</v>

1070
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 3>health minister and it was widely </v>
<v Speaker 3>published in the developing world,</v>

1071
00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.540
<v Speaker 3>but almost no one in the developed world</v>
<v Speaker 3>picked it up.</v>

1072
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:37.643
<v Speaker 3>It was only when I wrote and other offit</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I said there were two meetings </v>

1073
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 3>taking place in the New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One was this TV place where,</v>

1074
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:45.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest infectious disease killer in the</v>

1075
00:53:45.781 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're almost nobody turned up.</v>

1076
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.140
<v Speaker 3>And then those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other meeting,</v>

1077
00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.153
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which macron and the French president </v>

1078
00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.110
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bloomberg and others attended to,</v>

1079
00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:58.140
<v Speaker 3>which was the climate summit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which everybody attended to.</v>

1080
00:53:58.830 --> 00:53:59.663
<v Speaker 3>He sort of pointed out the disparity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it was picked up in all kinds of </v>

1081
00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:05.970
<v Speaker 3>developed country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick the papers.</v>

1082
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.190
<v Speaker 3>I think fundamentally it goes down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1083
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 3>while everybody says they care a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the world's poor,</v>

1084
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:16.970
<v Speaker 3>the reality is that you care somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>for but most rich,</v>

1085
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:21.960
<v Speaker 3>well meaning people probably care a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>more about the fact that they worry that</v>

1086
00:54:21.961 --> 00:54:22.794
<v Speaker 3>their kids might be in a position where </v>
<v Speaker 3>global warming is really going to </v>

1087
00:54:25.351 --> 00:54:27.460
<v Speaker 3>undermine even that.</v>

1088
00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.193
<v Speaker 3>Because look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we already established the fact that </v>

1089
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:32.243
<v Speaker 3>there's equal reason to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>apocalyptically concerned about uncheck </v>

1090
00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:40.671
<v Speaker 3>poverty and inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is why I suggested to begin with</v>

1091
00:54:40.681 --> 00:54:41.514
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one of the lovely things about the </v>

1092
00:54:43.021 --> 00:54:43.854
<v Speaker 3>idea of climate change is that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really justifies the idea of </v>

1093
00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:50.160
<v Speaker 3>overthrowing the current system or of </v>
<v Speaker 3>undermining the current system.</v>

1094
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:51.533
<v Speaker 3>And that if you're inclined to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than inclined to truly help the </v>

1095
00:54:54.841 --> 00:54:56.040
<v Speaker 3>dispossessed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1096
00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:57.293
<v Speaker 3>then you'd be more inclined to support a</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory that justifies that sort of </v>

1097
00:55:00.541 --> 00:55:03.150
<v Speaker 3>radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say interventionists policy.</v>

1098
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.313
<v Speaker 3>And I can't see a way out of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>logically given that the work that </v>

1099
00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:08.814
<v Speaker 3>you're doing on tuberculosis is a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>example is directly and Evett </v>

1100
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:14.003
<v Speaker 3>evidentially associated with a market </v>
<v Speaker 3>increase in the wellbeing of the </v>

1101
00:55:18.511 --> 00:55:19.344
<v Speaker 3>dispossessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you'd think that they would </v>

1102
00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:24.300
<v Speaker 3>attract the proper amount of ideological</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention,</v>

1103
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.410
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't.</v>

1104
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:27.750
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a great mystery.</v>

1105
00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.740
<v Speaker 3>There's something about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily good and it's as,</v>

1106
00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:31.623
<v Speaker 3>it's a good point and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think you have a consistent </v>

1107
00:55:34.321 --> 00:55:35.190
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1108
00:55:35.191 --> 00:55:36.024
<v Speaker 3>the thing that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've decided a long time ago that I </v>

1109
00:55:38.371 --> 00:55:41.730
<v Speaker 3>don't want to argue and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the difference between,</v>

1110
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.490
<v Speaker 3>of being more psychologically focused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to argue,</v>

1111
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.610
<v Speaker 3>I think might be people's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1112
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.473
<v Speaker 3>sort of inner motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to actually take them on face </v>

1113
00:55:50.911 --> 00:55:51.744
<v Speaker 3>value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1114
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.490
<v Speaker 3>many people I meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

1115
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.850
<v Speaker 3>I worry a lot about climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worry a lot about the world's poor.</v>

1116
00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:59.220
<v Speaker 3>And then I try to show them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1117
00:55:59.221 --> 00:56:00.054
<v Speaker 3>if you actually do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why the hell would you be focusing on </v>

1118
00:56:02.071 --> 00:56:02.904
<v Speaker 3>spending lots of money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll almost to no good instead of </v>

1119
00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:05.634
<v Speaker 3>spending possibly less money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And during the fall you about more and </v>

1120
00:56:09.421 --> 00:56:10.254
<v Speaker 3>it creates some cognitive dissonance and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it switches people a little bit </v>

1121
00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:16.440
<v Speaker 3>towards spending smarter.</v>

1122
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.730
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

1123
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.300
<v Speaker 3>But telecall ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1124
00:56:21.301 --> 00:56:26.080
<v Speaker 3>it's like what you're doing is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>new and it takes a long time.</v>

1125
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:27.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not new for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1126
00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 3>it's not new considering the span of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>single lifetime,</v>

1127
00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:31.984
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is very radical in </v>

1128
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:36.010
<v Speaker 3>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>

1129
00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:39.100
<v Speaker 3>and there isn't anybody else doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it might own,</v>

1130
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:39.963
<v Speaker 3>it might be that will take 20 years or </v>
<v Speaker 3>25 years or something like that for the </v>

1131
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:44.014
<v Speaker 3>approach that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>publicizing and have developed to for </v>

1132
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:50.950
<v Speaker 3>people to actually know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1133
00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 3>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did they say?</v>

1134
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:55.180
<v Speaker 3>You should assume ignorance instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolence when you can.</v>

1135
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 3>I do think that ignorance is a part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1136
00:56:58.121 --> 00:56:58.954
<v Speaker 3>It's not obvious to everyone that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is this method of rank ordering that </v>

1137
00:57:02.441 --> 00:57:03.274
<v Speaker 3>people have done it and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there are consequences to that </v>

1138
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:07.870
<v Speaker 3>that could be laid out in an intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 3>economic plan.</v>

1139
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.631
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1140
00:57:08.631 --> 00:57:09.464
<v Speaker 3>I know that it takes a finding in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific literature if it's going to </v>

1141
00:57:13.181 --> 00:57:16.780
<v Speaker 3>make its way into the public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something approximating 15 years.</v>

1142
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:21.070
<v Speaker 3>And that's only the ones that actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>do manage to make it.</v>

1143
00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:22.383
<v Speaker 3>And so it could be that just way more </v>
<v Speaker 3>people need to build what you're doing </v>

1144
00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:29.200
<v Speaker 3>and why and how it was done before it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets the steam going.</v>

1145
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:33.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues in part to try to help figure out</v>

1146
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.533
<v Speaker 3>what it would take to motivate people to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be more attentive to the sorts of </v>

1147
00:57:38.741 --> 00:57:39.574
<v Speaker 3>solutions that you and your people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been putting forward and hit and to </v>

1148
00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:43.720
<v Speaker 3>eliminate those barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1149
00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:44.590
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1150
00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:46.090
<v Speaker 3>but it could just be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

1151
00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:49.180
<v Speaker 3>it could just be ignorance and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of them,</v>

1152
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 3>one of the problems that we're facing </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly,</v>

1153
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 3>and I know why there's no one else doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>this than we,</v>

1154
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:59.740
<v Speaker 3>the weird thing because when you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>prioritization and you inevitably end up</v>

1155
00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:00.603
<v Speaker 3>antagonizing a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a climate change is the most </v>

1156
00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:04.330
<v Speaker 3>obvious one.</v>

1157
00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.130
<v Speaker 3>But for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sanitation,</v>

1158
00:58:06.131 --> 00:58:07.990
<v Speaker 3>water and sanitation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge problem.</v>

1159
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1160
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:09.663
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two and a half million people </v>

1161
00:58:10.811 --> 00:58:11.644
<v Speaker 3>affected by this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the points that we emphasizes </v>

1162
00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:16.900
<v Speaker 3>that Dune sanitation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while a good thing to do,</v>

1163
00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:20.530
<v Speaker 3>it probably only pays you back $3 back </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the dollar.</v>

1164
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:21.453
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's actually fairly costly to </v>

1165
00:58:23.141 --> 00:58:23.974
<v Speaker 3>do sanitation and also because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits not nearly as great as what </v>

1166
00:58:27.551 --> 00:58:28.384
<v Speaker 3>many have assumed and this is new global</v>
<v Speaker 3>burden of disease estimates that the </v>

1167
00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:32.344
<v Speaker 3>real problem is that what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>with sanitation is that you're not </v>

1168
00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:37.210
<v Speaker 3>removing fecal matter from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>

1169
00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.193
<v Speaker 3>You simply reducing the amount so you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not actually having all that much of an </v>

1170
00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.330
<v Speaker 3>impact on the sea shore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having a little bit,</v>

1171
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.060
<v Speaker 3>but not nearly as much as what we would </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to say.</v>

1172
00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.860
<v Speaker 3>That obviously pisses off all the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are doing sanitation and we ended up</v>

1173
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:52.180
<v Speaker 3>pissing off a lot of people.</v>

1174
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:57.210
<v Speaker 3>And the truth is I think it's necessary </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to do this when you rank</v>

1175
00:58:57.431 --> 00:58:58.560
<v Speaker 3>order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course the,</v>

1176
00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:00.700
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cost is to come out of top.</v>

1177
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the cost is don't,</v>

1178
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:03.603
<v Speaker 3>don't love it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also important to make that </v>

1179
00:59:05.891 --> 00:59:06.730
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1180
00:59:06.731 --> 00:59:08.400
<v Speaker 3>so at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>

1181
00:59:08.401 --> 00:59:13.401
<v Speaker 3>my sense is it's necessary to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it will always entail a great amount</v>

1182
00:59:14.681 --> 00:59:15.514
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sort of,</v>

1183
00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anies,</v>

1184
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.983
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't feel like we're </v>

1185
00:59:19.871 --> 00:59:20.590
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1186
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Kumbaya and we should do everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're actually saying,</v>

1187
00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.460
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should do these things.</v>

1188
00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:27.710
<v Speaker 3>But not all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although they seem nice,</v>

1189
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:30.710
<v Speaker 3>they're just not in the same league.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1190
00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:31.460
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1191
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.040
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

1192
00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.413
<v Speaker 3>it would be nice if we could do </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything good that we possibly could </v>

1193
00:59:38.031 --> 00:59:40.550
<v Speaker 3>all at once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>

1194
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:42.583
<v Speaker 3>it's not realistic because you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything at once and you don't have </v>

1195
00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.910
<v Speaker 3>infinite resources as we've already </v>
<v Speaker 3>pointed out.</v>

1196
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.260
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1197
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:52.700
<v Speaker 3>So what would you say would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to play devil's advocate</v>

1198
00:59:52.701 --> 00:59:53.534
<v Speaker 3>against your own position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I presume you've done a lot of </v>

1199
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:59.630
<v Speaker 3>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are their criticisms against your,</v>

1200
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.063
<v Speaker 3>let's say your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your aims and your methods that you </v>

1201
01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.620
<v Speaker 3>regard as unresolved?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1202
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:11.150
<v Speaker 3>what is it that you're doing that still </v>
<v Speaker 3>weak and wrong in your own estimation or</v>

1203
01:00:11.151 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the,</v>

1204
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:14.130
<v Speaker 3>where the limitations in your methods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1205
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.040
<v Speaker 3>there's no method does everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have two very obvious problems.</v>

1206
01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:19.874
<v Speaker 3>One is not all issues is about money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're looking at how do you </v>

1207
01:00:24.381 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 3>prioritize money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes money is not the issue.</v>

1208
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:30.110
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on free trade as we talked about before,</v>

1209
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.153
<v Speaker 3>we estimate the benefit is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we actually look at the cost as the </v>

1210
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:35.984
<v Speaker 3>cost of subsidizing western farmers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because those are the ones that </v>

1211
01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 3>basically make a killing from not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>freeing up,</v>

1212
01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin global markets.</v>

1213
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.570
<v Speaker 3>And those were the ones that usually </v>
<v Speaker 3>kept held it back.</v>

1214
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.290
<v Speaker 3>But what has happened is it has become </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more sort of an emotional thing.</v>

1215
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:55.370
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of an identity thing and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>not sure how you would cost that.</v>

1216
01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:59.870
<v Speaker 3>So to the extent that things have not </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with money,</v>

1217
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 3>but they just simply about political </v>
<v Speaker 3>willingness or interest or,</v>

1218
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:04.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1219
01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we are not making the argument,</v>

1220
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is going to convince you.</v>

1221
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:13.220
<v Speaker 3>So in some sense we are telling you </v>
<v Speaker 3>where can you spend money,</v>

1222
01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.740
<v Speaker 3>but we're not talking about the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't require money.</v>

1223
01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people would object that you're,</v>

1224
01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:18.853
<v Speaker 3>that the problem with your method is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're measuring everything that </v>

1225
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:24.770
<v Speaker 3>can be tangibly measured from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic perspective.</v>

1226
01:01:24.771 --> 01:01:29.540
<v Speaker 3>But that's actually a small fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe of properly attended to.</v>

1227
01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I would tend to say it's probably sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of 70 or 80%.</v>

1228
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not quite sure how you'd make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1229
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:36.783
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1230
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:37.993
<v Speaker 3>the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest policy decisions in most </v>

1231
01:01:40.011 --> 01:01:42.400
<v Speaker 3>countries is the national budget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1232
01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.890
<v Speaker 3>it's very clear that that is a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>substantial part of what we decide.</v>

1233
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.690
<v Speaker 3>How are we going to allocate money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1234
01:01:47.691 --> 01:01:49.300
<v Speaker 3>the problem lately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big issue.</v>

1235
01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.170
<v Speaker 3>We don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the only issue.</v>

1236
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.921
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1237
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:54.470
<v Speaker 3>the problem with the objection is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1238
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 3>the people who are objecting could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1239
01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.300
<v Speaker 3>That your methods are narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1240
01:01:59.301 --> 01:02:01.370
<v Speaker 3>you're making the case that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>in an arrow as a,</v>

1241
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:01.941
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a,</v>

1242
01:02:01.941 --> 01:02:02.774
<v Speaker 3>as a pessimist might assume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that puts the onus on them to come </v>

1243
01:02:05.781 --> 01:02:08.930
<v Speaker 3>up with an alternative way of ranking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1244
01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just say we're,</v>

1245
01:02:10.481 --> 01:02:14.240
<v Speaker 3>we're not talking about those last 30% </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are purely about,</v>

1246
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:15.283
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1247
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:17.810
<v Speaker 3>should we have transgender bathrooms or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>

1248
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's possibly a bad idea because </v>

1249
01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:24.030
<v Speaker 3>that actually has cost them and building</v>
<v Speaker 3>a third bathroom or something.</v>

1250
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:24.690
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1251
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:28.230
<v Speaker 3>there's some things that are mostly just</v>
<v Speaker 3>about w what do you think?</v>

1252
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:30.510
<v Speaker 3>What do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are your intuitions?</v>

1253
01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than actual costs.</v>

1254
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 3>But there's no way of adjudicating </v>
<v Speaker 3>between those claims.</v>

1255
01:02:36.061 --> 01:02:36.894
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem that all the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was pushing each other around </v>

1256
01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:40.130
<v Speaker 3>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they can't,</v>

1257
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.173
<v Speaker 3>with the rational there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still a substantial amount of </v>

1258
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:46.470
<v Speaker 3>issues where you do need to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>resource allocation.</v>

1259
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 3>And there we have a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second part,</v>

1260
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.570
<v Speaker 3>the second sort of criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1261
01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:55.290
<v Speaker 3>which is a very fair criticism is we </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't look at inequality.</v>

1262
01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.693
<v Speaker 3>So economists are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very bad at dealing with inequality </v>

1263
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:02.010
<v Speaker 3>because fundamentally that's a political</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

1264
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:06.420
<v Speaker 3>So when we look at you spend a dollar </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you do $60 worth of good,</v>

1265
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.480
<v Speaker 3>we don't look at who gets that $60.</v>

1266
01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.733
<v Speaker 3>Now to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the things that she was all you </v>

1267
01:03:13.351 --> 01:03:14.184
<v Speaker 3>also pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the things that we actually </v>

1268
01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:16.524
<v Speaker 3>indicate are really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really low hanging fruit of the world </v>

1269
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:21.900
<v Speaker 3>are things that will help the world's </v>
<v Speaker 3>pores mostly because the world's poorest</v>

1270
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:23.123
<v Speaker 3>have so many things that they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten that would be hugely beneficial </v>

1271
01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:26.874
<v Speaker 3>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it mostly actually help also </v>

1272
01:03:29.191 --> 01:03:31.440
<v Speaker 3>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't measure it.</v>

1273
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:32.783
<v Speaker 3>And so we don't actually look at would </v>
<v Speaker 3>this be a good expenditure in the t in </v>

1274
01:03:37.941 --> 01:03:40.410
<v Speaker 3>the sense of helping the world's </v>
<v Speaker 3>poorest,</v>

1275
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:43.320
<v Speaker 3>mostly wood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not part of our framework.</v>

1276
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.430
<v Speaker 3>And there's how me making that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1277
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.453
<v Speaker 3>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because cost benefit analysis is </v>

1278
01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:50.454
<v Speaker 3>basically assuming that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>equally worth talking about that </v>

1279
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.600
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way of,</v>

1280
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 3>of sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you can,</v>

1281
01:03:58.501 --> 01:03:59.334
<v Speaker 3>but it becomes incredibly unclear and </v>
<v Speaker 3>very unintuitive if you start making </v>

1282
01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:06.630
<v Speaker 3>weightings and on who is actually worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

1283
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:08.660
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we are,</v>

1284
01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:11.460
<v Speaker 3>we're getting saying it's a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the menu,</v>

1285
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:12.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get in the restaurant,</v>

1286
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:13.950
<v Speaker 3>we're telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1287
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:14.903
<v Speaker 3>the Spanish is cheap and it has lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>vitamins and the cake is expensive and </v>

1288
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:20.060
<v Speaker 3>it's bad for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1289
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.293
<v Speaker 3>you go ahead and make the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the fair way to have </v>

1290
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:25.134
<v Speaker 3>that conversation that we're telling you</v>
<v Speaker 3>some important facts about your </v>

1291
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:28.674
<v Speaker 3>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these are not the only things that </v>

1292
01:04:30.151 --> 01:04:33.450
<v Speaker 3>are going to guide your decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm absolutely happy to say that.</v>

1293
01:04:33.451 --> 01:04:34.284
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in some sense you asked me to be </v>

1294
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.300
<v Speaker 3>devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's important to clarify.</v>

1295
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.533
<v Speaker 3>We don't look at all issues because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>only look at issues that require </v>

1296
01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:45.480
<v Speaker 3>resources and we don't feel with </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality,</v>

1297
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.433
<v Speaker 3>which is also an important issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But apart from that we have to make </v>

1298
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:53.520
<v Speaker 3>priorities and we're simply making it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little clear.</v>

1299
01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.460
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can choose to totally disregard it.</v>

1300
01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:57.443
<v Speaker 3>But I would imagine that you would at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least like to know what does the </v>

1301
01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:02.640
<v Speaker 3>evidence tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you spend it all here,</v>

1302
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.880
<v Speaker 3>how many people will you save?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many lives will be improved,</v>

1303
01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:08.400
<v Speaker 3>how much environment will be improved </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>

1304
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:09.503
<v Speaker 3>Versus all the other things where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could have spent that dollar and done </v>

1305
01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:14.820
<v Speaker 3>different amounts of good in all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>different areas.</v>

1306
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.100
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we provide for the menu.</v>

1307
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.180
<v Speaker 2>So do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1308
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I appreciate that very much.</v>

1309
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have any sense,</v>

1310
01:05:23.171 --> 01:05:25.330
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the top of your head,</v>

1311
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.673
<v Speaker 2>what the total capital expenditure for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the minimization eradication of </v>

1312
01:05:30.221 --> 01:05:32.770
<v Speaker 2>tuberculosis actually would be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you talking about?</v>

1313
01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 2>An absolute dollar amounts.</v>

1314
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.480
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1315
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.150
<v Speaker 3>and it depends a lot on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1316
01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.140
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1317
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.150
<v Speaker 3>we estimate it you need about $2 </v>
<v Speaker 3>billion.</v>

1318
01:05:42.151 --> 01:05:42.541
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1319
01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:43.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1320
01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:44.043
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the global funds that we were also </v>

1321
01:05:45.271 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 3>campaigning with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1322
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.333
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's saying it's about five point $8 </v>

1323
01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:51.720
<v Speaker 3>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to be quite honest,</v>

1324
01:05:51.721 --> 01:05:55.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm not quite sure which of these two </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers is the right number.</v>

1325
01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:56.840
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1326
01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:58.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to,</v>

1327
01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:00.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to give you a sense of proportion,</v>

1328
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:01.603
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of subsidies that we give to </v>

1329
01:06:03.451 --> 01:06:04.920
<v Speaker 3>solar and wind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1330
01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:09.100
<v Speaker 3>is about $120 billion right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1331
01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:09.900
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1332
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.130
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about a very,</v>

1333
01:06:11.131 --> 01:06:12.720
<v Speaker 3>very small amount,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1334
01:06:12.721 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 3>and certainly it's a very small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1335
01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:15.750
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about what,</v>

1336
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:19.650
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>4% of global development,</v>

1337
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:20.301
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1338
01:06:20.301 --> 01:06:24.360
<v Speaker 3>spending the amount of spending that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we spend every year to try and help</v>

1339
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:27.240
<v Speaker 3>improve the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it will probably be one of the very,</v>

1340
01:06:27.241 --> 01:06:29.370
<v Speaker 3>very best things that we could do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

1341
01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.810
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very small leanings.</v>

1342
01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.890
<v Speaker 3>I need to know these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that if they did</v>

1343
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.823
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would start to care if they </v>

1344
01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:37.020
<v Speaker 2>actually knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1345
01:06:37.021 --> 01:06:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

1346
01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I got two final questions for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1347
01:06:40.741 --> 01:06:41.574
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll ask you if there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else you wanted to bring to </v>

1348
01:06:43.861 --> 01:06:44.694
<v Speaker 2>people's attention that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you thought was particularly </v>

1349
01:06:46.081 --> 01:06:46.831
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1350
01:06:46.831 --> 01:06:49.260
<v Speaker 2>So the first one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1351
01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.900
<v Speaker 2>to what degree do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1352
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.793
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask all three questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To what degree do you think you've been </v>

1353
01:06:56.241 --> 01:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>making headway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like obviously you're,</v>

1354
01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.133
<v Speaker 2>you've been successful in putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>together your institutes and your work </v>

1355
01:07:03.051 --> 01:07:06.590
<v Speaker 2>is garnered a substantial amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention published and otherwise,</v>

1356
01:07:06.591 --> 01:07:09.800
<v Speaker 2>and so it's not like you've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>silenced and,</v>

1357
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:10.703
<v Speaker 2>and imprisoned or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so are the reasons for optimism as </v>

1358
01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:19.190
<v Speaker 2>far as you're concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the next thing that I'd like to</v>

1359
01:07:19.191 --> 01:07:20.024
<v Speaker 2>ask you about is what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 2>France because one of the things that </v>

1360
01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:24.853
<v Speaker 2>the people who are pushing for radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>current interventions with regards to </v>

1361
01:07:29.091 --> 01:07:33.590
<v Speaker 2>longterm climate change haven't factored</v>
<v Speaker 2>in is the reverse apocalyptic issue,</v>

1362
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.520
<v Speaker 2>which is that there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantial resistance to the short term</v>

1363
01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:41.120
<v Speaker 2>costs that will cause spinoff disasters </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their own.</v>

1364
01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:45.080
<v Speaker 2>And so the French example seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting case in point.</v>

1365
01:07:45.081 --> 01:07:47.000
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first question was,</v>

1366
01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.720
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about the impact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having in the second is,</v>

1367
01:07:50.721 --> 01:07:52.820
<v Speaker 2>what do you have to say about what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in France?</v>

1368
01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1369
01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.420
<v Speaker 3>And can I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna answer it in reverse.</v>

1370
01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.540
<v Speaker 3>The France point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really a good,</v>

1371
01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good argument.</v>

1372
01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:03.180
<v Speaker 3>If you ask people around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1373
01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:05.600
<v Speaker 3>do you care about global warming?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost everyone will say,</v>

1374
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:06.463
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1375
01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.360
<v Speaker 3>do you want to do something for global </v>
<v Speaker 3>warming?</v>

1376
01:08:08.361 --> 01:08:10.370
<v Speaker 3>And they'll say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then when you ask them,</v>

1377
01:08:10.371 --> 01:08:13.790
<v Speaker 3>how much are you willing to pay the </v>
<v Speaker 3>typical answer,</v>

1378
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both in rich and cork countries,</v>

1379
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.450
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of hundred dollars per </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1380
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 3>So Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes from 100 to $200.</v>

1381
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.030
<v Speaker 3>So fundamentally what people are saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1382
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:24.950
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do worry about this issue.</v>

1383
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to spend a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

1384
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:27.374
<v Speaker 3>but not very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is the fundamental </v>

1385
01:08:29.571 --> 01:08:30.404
<v Speaker 3>thing that we just have not been able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to the attention of a lot of people </v>

1386
01:08:34.221 --> 01:08:36.890
<v Speaker 3>who are pushing for really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really radical solutions.</v>

1387
01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:41.840
<v Speaker 3>You're never going to succeed in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic situation.</v>

1388
01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:42.893
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1389
01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:44.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you keep ramping up,</v>

1390
01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:46.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the taxes on fossil fuels,</v>

1391
01:08:46.971 --> 01:08:49.790
<v Speaker 3>if you keep making energy more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive,</v>

1392
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.140
<v Speaker 3>it's going to harm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1393
01:08:51.141 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 3>the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most very,</v>

1394
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:55.400
<v Speaker 3>very regressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that obviously</v>

1395
01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:00.950
<v Speaker 3>means a lot of heartache for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor people.</v>

1396
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.963
<v Speaker 3>These are typically also the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are at least able to defend themselves </v>

1397
01:09:04.881 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 3>because they're just so busy just </v>
<v Speaker 3>surviving the day today.</v>

1398
01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:09.853
<v Speaker 3>So it typically has to hit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middleclass before you really get sort </v>

1399
01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:15.290
<v Speaker 3>of an eruption as what you've seen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>France and elsewhere.</v>

1400
01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.393
<v Speaker 3>Let's remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also a lot of other issues in </v>

1401
01:09:17.901 --> 01:09:20.540
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not just because they put three,</v>

1402
01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.390
<v Speaker 3>three sets on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1403
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:24.080
<v Speaker 3>on a liter of diesel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1404
01:09:24.081 --> 01:09:28.040
<v Speaker 3>but it is an issue of saying if you push</v>
<v Speaker 3>people too far,</v>

1405
01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.800
<v Speaker 3>you will actually not be able to do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution for climate.</v>

1406
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.960
<v Speaker 3>And so you're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very expensive.</v>

1407
01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Solutions are never going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm viable,</v>

1408
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:37.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you predict these ideas of saying,</v>

1409
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.650
<v Speaker 3>if we had Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1410
01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:42.830
<v Speaker 3>and if he would actually have managed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a carbon tax on,</v>

1411
01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:43.930
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on co2.</v>

1412
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Remember he actually had a democratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>congress,</v>

1413
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:47.283
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first two years of this presidency </v>

1414
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.730
<v Speaker 3>and they were still not able to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbon tax implemented.</v>

1415
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:55.370
<v Speaker 3>Of course when you have a Republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>congress,</v>

1416
01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:58.070
<v Speaker 3>it becomes really hard when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>republican president.</v>

1417
01:09:58.071 --> 01:09:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it falls apart.</v>

1418
01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:02.000
<v Speaker 3>You just can't do this for a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1419
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.700
<v Speaker 3>It's just not going to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why,</v>

1420
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:05.561
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1421
01:10:05.561 --> 01:10:06.394
<v Speaker 3>and we never got to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We actually did a climate consensus </v>

1422
01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:12.410
<v Speaker 3>where we brought together 27 of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world's top climate economist,</v>

1423
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:16.580
<v Speaker 3>three Nobel laureates to look at where </v>
<v Speaker 3>can you do good for climate?</v>

1424
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:17.743
<v Speaker 3>And what they found was the by far best </v>
<v Speaker 3>investment to tackle global warming is </v>

1425
01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:24.550
<v Speaker 3>to invest in Green Energy R.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

1426
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:26.030
<v Speaker 3>D.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fundamentally,</v>

1427
01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:30.050
<v Speaker 3>if we could invest in making better </v>
<v Speaker 3>green energy for the future,</v>

1428
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.333
<v Speaker 3>hopefully eventually get it to be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap that it w out compete fossil </v>

1429
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:36.680
<v Speaker 3>fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will solve global warming just simply</v>

1430
01:10:36.681 --> 01:10:37.514
<v Speaker 3>because the green energy became cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you'll allow me a slight detour </v>

1431
01:10:41.091 --> 01:10:41.720
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it,</v>

1432
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.450
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1433
01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:45.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the 1860 [inaudible],</v>

1434
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.573
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world was hunting whales to </v>

1435
01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:50.330
<v Speaker 3>extinction because whales have this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful,</v>

1436
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.830
<v Speaker 3>should I just say that again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1437
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:55.240
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1438
01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the 1860s,</v>

1439
01:10:57.370 --> 01:10:58.203
<v Speaker 3>we were hunting whales to extinction </v>
<v Speaker 3>because whales have this wonderful oil </v>

1440
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.890
<v Speaker 3>that just burns a lot cleaner and a low </v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1441
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.260
<v Speaker 3>And so it was wonderful for the houses </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in,</v>

1442
01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:09.590
<v Speaker 3>in North American and Europe to burn </v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1443
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.473
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whale oil and they're all excited </v>

1444
01:11:11.631 --> 01:11:16.631
<v Speaker 3>about it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bad side effect there was actually a</v>

1445
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:18.180
<v Speaker 3>pushing whales to extinction.</v>

1446
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Now the sort of global warming approach </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that problem would have been society.</v>

1447
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:23.843
<v Speaker 3>Could you please turn down the light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you please have it a little less </v>

1448
01:11:26.521 --> 01:11:27.354
<v Speaker 3>light in your room?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course you would have been </v>

1449
01:11:28.681 --> 01:11:29.514
<v Speaker 3>entirely failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did save the whales was we </v>

1450
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.770
<v Speaker 3>discovered oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fossil fuel oil,</v>

1451
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:35.813
<v Speaker 3>which were actually burning cleaner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was much cheaper and you didn't have </v>

1452
01:11:38.101 --> 01:11:38.934
<v Speaker 3>to go out and kill whales for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what happened about a decade was </v>

1453
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.510
<v Speaker 3>to stop killing whales because you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a better technological product.</v>

1454
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:46.643
<v Speaker 3>And we've seen this a lot of times that </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology can simply invalidate an old </v>

1455
01:11:50.251 --> 01:11:51.084
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem that you thought was almost </v>

1456
01:11:52.711 --> 01:11:54.990
<v Speaker 3>intractable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get cheaper,</v>

1457
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:56.880
<v Speaker 3>smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new technology,</v>

1458
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.590
<v Speaker 3>people switch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1459
01:11:58.591 --> 01:11:59.424
<v Speaker 3>That's opposing imposing limits on </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive limits on people is not an </v>

1460
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:07.620
<v Speaker 3>appropriate longterm solution because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>implementation resistance and cost.</v>

1461
01:12:07.621 --> 01:12:09.710
<v Speaker 3>And the best solution is to come up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1462
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 3>well let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put it in a cliched manner,</v>

1463
01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:16.020
<v Speaker 3>is to come up with a better solution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is cheaper energy.</v>

1464
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.140
<v Speaker 3>That's that it has all the advantages </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fewer disadvantages.</v>

1465
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:21.090
<v Speaker 3>And that's really how it would be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1466
01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Wind turbines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>solar panels,</v>

1467
01:12:22.951 --> 01:12:25.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just taking the two most popular</v>

1468
01:12:25.201 --> 01:12:28.500
<v Speaker 3>things and batteries together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they were cheaper than fossil fuels,</v>

1469
01:12:28.501 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 3>which they aren't right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they were,</v>

1470
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.400
<v Speaker 3>of course everyone would bond them </v>
<v Speaker 3>buying coal,</v>

1471
01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:34.243
<v Speaker 3>fire power plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really not rocket science in </v>

1472
01:12:35.911 --> 01:12:37.710
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not saying it's going to be easy</v>

1473
01:12:37.711 --> 01:12:39.600
<v Speaker 3>and it's certainly not going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

1474
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's the only viable long term </v>
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>

1475
01:12:42.031 --> 01:12:44.070
<v Speaker 3>It's much cheaper and much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>

1476
01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.053
<v Speaker 3>So we estimated that for every dollar </v>
<v Speaker 3>spent you'll actually do about $11 a </v>

1477
01:12:48.641 --> 01:12:50.330
<v Speaker 3>climate benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1478
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:52.740
<v Speaker 3>so that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So an alternative energy.</v>

1479
01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:56.400
<v Speaker 3>Our index,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fart,</v>

1480
01:12:56.490 --> 01:12:56.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1481
01:12:56.971 --> 01:12:58.590
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the best thing,</v>

1482
01:12:58.591 --> 01:13:00.450
<v Speaker 3>but it comes down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it actually,</v>

1483
01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pretty good investment.</v>

1484
01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:03.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the best in the world,</v>

1485
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:04.853
<v Speaker 3>but we should definitely be doing okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second question that you had was </v>

1486
01:13:08.191 --> 01:13:08.791
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1487
01:13:08.791 --> 01:13:10.800
<v Speaker 3>the optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fundamentally,</v>

1488
01:13:10.801 --> 01:13:13.680
<v Speaker 3>how much of an impact does this have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1489
01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:14.603
<v Speaker 3>it's half the impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very predictable impact that when we </v>

1490
01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:18.630
<v Speaker 3>come out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

1491
01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1492
01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:23.550
<v Speaker 3>more immunization gives you $60 back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dollar,</v>

1493
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:24.803
<v Speaker 3>the people who are doing immunization </v>
<v Speaker 3>tells you all the time you should fund </v>

1494
01:13:28.651 --> 01:13:31.590
<v Speaker 3>us because we do $60 in good humor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every dollar you spend.</v>

1495
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:34.590
<v Speaker 3>So very clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sat down with a guy from,</v>

1496
01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:35.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1497
01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:37.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a family foundation,</v>

1498
01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:38.850
<v Speaker 3>a big family foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

1499
01:13:38.851 --> 01:13:39.684
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we were at a malaria event and we </v>

1500
01:13:42.871 --> 01:13:45.470
<v Speaker 3>sat and politely conversing here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1501
01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.890
<v Speaker 3>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what do you do?</v>

1502
01:13:46.891 --> 01:13:47.261
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1503
01:13:47.261 --> 01:13:49.210
<v Speaker 3>I worked with the Copenhagen Consensus </v>
<v Speaker 3>Center,</v>

1504
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:50.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally blacks there.</v>

1505
01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:51.983
<v Speaker 3>And then I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do and what we work with </v>

1506
01:13:53.941 --> 01:13:54.500
<v Speaker 3>malaria.</v>

1507
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 3>We did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that actually it's,</v>

1508
01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:59.180
<v Speaker 3>you spend a dollar in malarial do $33 </v>
<v Speaker 3>worth of good.</v>

1509
01:13:59.181 --> 01:13:59.821
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1510
01:13:59.821 --> 01:14:01.570
<v Speaker 3>we did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1511
01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:02.211
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1512
01:14:02.211 --> 01:14:03.090
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1513
01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.010
<v Speaker 3>this is exactly the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not,</v>

1514
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.120
<v Speaker 3>we're not there to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1515
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:06.983
<v Speaker 3>get attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're there to make sure that we get </v>

1516
01:14:08.881 --> 01:14:09.714
<v Speaker 3>attention to some of these top ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we definitely helped a lot </v>

1517
01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:15.640
<v Speaker 3>of these top ideas get a little easier </v>
<v Speaker 3>right in the world.</v>

1518
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me ask you another cost benefit.</v>

1519
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1520
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.700
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what if I said,</v>

1521
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.433
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be interested interesting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a metta cost benefit analysis on </v>

1522
01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:29.254
<v Speaker 3>how much money you would need to raise </v>
<v Speaker 3>and spend to effectively market your </v>

1523
01:14:34.031 --> 01:14:34.864
<v Speaker 3>findings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to hire people who are </v>

1524
01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:37.624
<v Speaker 3>really good at doing such marketing so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you had the appropriate </v>

1525
01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:42.850
<v Speaker 3>advertisements and so that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you're,</v>

1526
01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.800
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not a criticism,</v>

1527
01:14:44.801 --> 01:14:45.634
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your approach is very academic and </v>

1528
01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:48.784
<v Speaker 3>very objective and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's all well and good and </v>

1529
01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:54.010
<v Speaker 3>reliable and valid and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1530
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:56.170
<v Speaker 3>But</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>

1531
01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:59.170
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you reconna [inaudible] compute to</v>

1532
01:14:59.171 --> 01:15:03.630
<v Speaker 3>utility in dollar value of establishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>an ex,</v>

1533
01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.793
<v Speaker 3>an extensive inappropriate marketing </v>
<v Speaker 3>scheme because you'd think that there </v>

1534
01:15:07.991 --> 01:15:08.824
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>

1535
01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:09.683
<v Speaker 3>cause I've been watching what's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening with the Democrats in the U S </v>

1536
01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:16.240
<v Speaker 3>and they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pack that I know about has been,</v>

1537
01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.533
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making new ads for the Democrats trying </v>

1538
01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:20.974
<v Speaker 3>to move them towards the center and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had a substantial amount of </v>

1539
01:15:23.741 --> 01:15:24.574
<v Speaker 3>impact because the advertisements have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been very professionally crafted and </v>

1540
01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:28.870
<v Speaker 3>constructive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1541
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.180
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1542
01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:33.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd been,</v>

1543
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:35.223
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason I'm interviewing you </v>
<v Speaker 3>today is because I want to put this up </v>

1544
01:15:37.451 --> 01:15:38.284
<v Speaker 3>on youtube and I want to get it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there in podcast so that more people </v>

1545
01:15:40.241 --> 01:15:42.130
<v Speaker 3>know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1546
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:43.663
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1547
01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:47.470
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the short answer of course is we have</v>

1548
01:15:47.471 --> 01:15:49.550
<v Speaker 3>tried to do that because we're economist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we think,</v>

1549
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be a good idea.</v>

1550
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:54.070
<v Speaker 3>So let me just tell you about something </v>
<v Speaker 3>else that we had done.</v>

1551
01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:54.671
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1552
01:15:54.671 --> 01:15:57.730
<v Speaker 3>so we've been working a lot and we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>just talking about the cool.</v>

1553
01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.053
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you do prioritization on the </v>

1554
01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:03.970
<v Speaker 3>planetary scale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's academically very interesting.</v>

1555
01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:07.150
<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately the impact is mostly </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people say,</v>

1556
01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably true somewhere else.</v>

1557
01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:10.043
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when we go and tell the immune </v>

1558
01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:11.620
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>

1559
01:16:11.621 --> 01:16:12.454
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably true for Mexico and </v>

1560
01:16:13.331 --> 01:16:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say it's probably true of Argentina.</v>

1561
01:16:15.431 --> 01:16:16.264
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everybody just push it off to </v>

1562
01:16:17.561 --> 01:16:21.100
<v Speaker 3>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bowl was never anyone's problem.</v>

1563
01:16:21.101 --> 01:16:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone else needs to fix us.</v>

1564
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:26.760
<v Speaker 3>And so what we've increasingly done it </v>
<v Speaker 3>as to do this in nations.</v>

1565
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.083
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we did this a couple of years ago in </v>

1566
01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a w and,</v>

1567
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.823
<v Speaker 3>and the nation of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an overlap between who actually </v>

1568
01:16:34.121 --> 01:16:38.260
<v Speaker 3>decides where to spend the money and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems that we analyzing.</v>

1569
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:41.260
<v Speaker 3>So we did the exact same thing for just </v>
<v Speaker 3>for Bangladesh.</v>

1570
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:46.440
<v Speaker 3>So we did a list of all the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we talked to everyone in Bangladesh.</v>

1571
01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:47.314
<v Speaker 3>We got them to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the best things that you want </v>

1572
01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:49.984
<v Speaker 3>to focus on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the smartest new solutions we </v>

1573
01:16:51.251 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 3>worked with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Primus think tank,</v>

1574
01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:53.973
<v Speaker 3>the finance minister,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else and talked about where </v>

1575
01:16:55.781 --> 01:16:57.790
<v Speaker 3>can you actually spend money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1576
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.863
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a menu that's not entirely </v>

1577
01:17:00.671 --> 01:17:03.580
<v Speaker 3>politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly the politicians don't like all</v>

1578
01:17:03.581 --> 01:17:04.750
<v Speaker 3>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what the,</v>

1579
01:17:04.751 --> 01:17:06.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the finance minister would go like,</v>

1580
01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:06.941
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1581
01:17:06.941 --> 01:17:07.660
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

1582
01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:08.650
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like this.</v>

1583
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:10.940
<v Speaker 3>See Him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they did some of the things.</v>

1584
01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:14.270
<v Speaker 3>So that solves the Tower of Babel </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem to some degree.</v>

1585
01:17:14.271 --> 01:17:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Is that too much distance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1586
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:18.590
<v Speaker 3>there's too much distance between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>local and the global.</v>

1587
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:21.320
<v Speaker 3>And so you're using the nation state as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1588
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.960
<v Speaker 3>as a psychological intermediary.</v>

1589
01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:28.520
<v Speaker 3>So there we actually estimate that every</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollar spent on what we were doing,</v>

1590
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:29.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

1591
01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:30.363
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least $10,000 worth of good simply </v>

1592
01:17:32.301 --> 01:17:37.301
<v Speaker 3>because we help shift spending in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bangladesh both on their national budget</v>

1593
01:17:37.911 --> 01:17:41.090
<v Speaker 3>but also the development budgets </v>
<v Speaker 3>spending in Bangladesh.</v>

1594
01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:42.740
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't change,</v>

1595
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:43.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bangladesh to suddenly become super </v>

1596
01:17:45.201 --> 01:17:46.160
<v Speaker 3>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>

1597
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm simply changed the bowl little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>we gave,</v>

1598
01:17:48.681 --> 01:17:49.514
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>headwind to the poor ideas and tailwind </v>

1599
01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:54.710
<v Speaker 3>to the good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we will not Haiti,</v>

1600
01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:55.544
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're now doing this in India together </v>

1601
01:17:56.781 --> 01:17:58.660
<v Speaker 3>with Tata Trust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just came back and said,</v>

1602
01:17:58.661 --> 01:18:01.340
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm a little jet lag or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bleary eyed.</v>

1603
01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:03.560
<v Speaker 3>I just came back from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Ghana,</v>

1604
01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:04.573
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are we going to do our next </v>

1605
01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:07.100
<v Speaker 3>project?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we want to bring this to Africa.</v>

1606
01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to do it globally and locally.</v>

1607
01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.473
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think when we'll have a lot more </v>

1608
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:13.394
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to actually get people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention when you talk specifically to </v>

1609
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.360
<v Speaker 3>the nation states where you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be making these decisions.</v>

1610
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:21.403
<v Speaker 3>But obviously if it's true Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably also true in the </v>

1611
01:18:23.871 --> 01:18:25.580
<v Speaker 3>neighboring state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get the overlap.</v>

1612
01:18:26.210 --> 01:18:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think I would love to,</v>

1613
01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:29.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1614
01:18:29.051 --> 01:18:29.930
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

1615
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:30.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

1616
01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:31.740
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1617
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:35.450
<v Speaker 3>of extra sort of pr ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think what we,</v>

1618
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.343
<v Speaker 3>what we really need is just simply to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to come up with all these great </v>

1619
01:18:40.011 --> 01:18:42.820
<v Speaker 3>ideas and I think we are reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful but,</v>

1620
01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:47.090
<v Speaker 3>but the problem in some ways is we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>advocates of all the boring stuff.</v>

1621
01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.073
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff that gets the attention </v>

1622
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:52.580
<v Speaker 3>are the ones that have the crying babies</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cute animals.</v>

1623
01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.590
<v Speaker 3>The thing is it's not true.</v>

1624
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:58.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not what you're doing isn't boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely exciting beyond belief.</v>

1625
01:18:58.491 --> 01:19:03.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't believe that it is dry </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't believe that it doesn't have</v>

1626
01:19:03.051 --> 01:19:03.884
<v Speaker 3>a powerful narrative message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that there are reasons that </v>

1627
01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:07.574
<v Speaker 3>the narrative messages I'm scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think putting your finger on the </v>

1628
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:13.790
<v Speaker 3>gap between the local and the global is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a good one.</v>

1629
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:17.870
<v Speaker 3>That's smart because you see the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem starting to emerge.</v>

1630
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:18.704
<v Speaker 3>For example with the EU where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>overarching bureaucracy is so distant </v>

1631
01:19:22.071 --> 01:19:26.750
<v Speaker 3>from the people on the ground that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a disconnect in identification.</v>

1632
01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:27.973
<v Speaker 3>And so to harness the latent power of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nation state and its patriotism and </v>

1633
01:19:31.971 --> 01:19:34.690
<v Speaker 3>it's at its economic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would,</v>

1634
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.943
<v Speaker 3>it's rather local economic structure </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to me to be a rita smarter </v>

1635
01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.130
<v Speaker 3>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

1636
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.113
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thrilled when I came across your </v>

1637
01:19:42.921 --> 01:19:46.250
<v Speaker 3>work and I mean on an emotional level </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I thought,</v>

1638
01:19:46.251 --> 01:19:48.290
<v Speaker 3>well wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we really want it to do good,</v>

1639
01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.153
<v Speaker 3>if that was the goal and we wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it intelligently and carefully and </v>

1640
01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:55.970
<v Speaker 3>agnostically to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1641
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:59.060
<v Speaker 3>and in a non he ideologically </v>
<v Speaker 3>self-serving manner,</v>

1642
01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:01.490
<v Speaker 3>which would be a lovely thing to manage </v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was possible,</v>

1643
01:20:01.491 --> 01:20:04.040
<v Speaker 3>then this seemed to be an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting approach.</v>

1644
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:04.874
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that there's every reason to </v>

1645
01:20:07.321 --> 01:20:08.154
<v Speaker 3>assume that</v>

1646
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.113
<v Speaker 2>with proper publicity that people could </v>
<v Speaker 2>really get behind the idea that we </v>

1647
01:20:12.931 --> 01:20:15.480
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have to have tuberculosis in 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1648
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.361
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1649
01:20:16.361 --> 01:20:18.000
<v Speaker 2>and that some of these things could </v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1650
01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to people in on my lecture </v>

1651
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.790
<v Speaker 2>tour about the things that we could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the world a better place.</v>

1652
01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:26.310
<v Speaker 2>And there's no shortage of enthusiasm </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

1653
01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:29.010
<v Speaker 2>It's just that there's a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cynicism,</v>

1654
01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.740
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot more ignorance is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will,</v>

1655
01:20:31.741 --> 01:20:36.741
<v Speaker 2>we just don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your prescription say well here's 10</v>

1656
01:20:36.961 --> 01:20:37.794
<v Speaker 2>things you could do one of them and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of them would work and so you've got a </v>

1657
01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:41.064
<v Speaker 2>bit of a choice there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't have to take our number one </v>

1658
01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 2>priority as your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could take number five and you'd</v>

1659
01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:49.530
<v Speaker 2>still do a lovely job and it might be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>accordance with your own motivations.</v>

1660
01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I can,</v>

1661
01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:52.913
<v Speaker 2>can you get me pdfs for example of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant whatever you think is relevant </v>

1662
01:20:58.860 --> 01:20:59.693
<v Speaker 2>that would inform people in short order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will post in the description of the </v>

1663
01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:04.944
<v Speaker 2>video so that they get access to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whatever material you'd like to have </v>

1664
01:21:09.181 --> 01:21:11.640
<v Speaker 2>disseminated as a consequence of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

1665
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:12.743
<v Speaker 2>just get that to me and I'll post it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>any blurb you want me to put it in the </v>

1666
01:21:15.811 --> 01:21:18.360
<v Speaker 2>description.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll also do that with whatever.</v>

1667
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:19.980
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when do you need it for?</v>

1668
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.950
<v Speaker 2>As soon as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you can get it,</v>

1669
01:21:21.951 --> 01:21:24.650
<v Speaker 2>cause I'll put this very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the next day.</v>

1670
01:21:24.670 --> 01:21:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1671
01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:28.683
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything else that you would </v>

1672
01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:32.940
<v Speaker 2>like to say that we haven't covered?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1673
01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:33.843
<v Speaker 2>For first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's wonderful the way that </v>

1674
01:21:35.551 --> 01:21:36.384
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about this as sort of an </v>

1675
01:21:37.981 --> 01:21:38.670
<v Speaker 2>outside of that.</v>

1676
01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:40.010
<v Speaker 2>It's actually exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1677
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:41.080
<v Speaker 2>because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1678
01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:41.953
<v Speaker 2>and we probably make this mistake that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we think of ourselves in a little bit </v>

1679
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.200
<v Speaker 2>and sort of technocrats and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1680
01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:48.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiddlers and the margin kind of thing.</v>

1681
01:21:48.691 --> 01:21:51.030
<v Speaker 2>And it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right and it is exciting.</v>

1682
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.530
<v Speaker 2>It is exciting actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could actually spend our resources</v>

1683
01:21:55.531 --> 01:21:57.990
<v Speaker 2>four times as well as what we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1684
01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:58.973
<v Speaker 2>So instead of saying all the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are politically cried and making us all </v>

1685
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.093
<v Speaker 2>feel warm and fuzzy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually doing the things that perhaps </v>

1686
01:22:04.651 --> 01:22:07.380
<v Speaker 2>are not top of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not top of the,</v>

1687
01:22:07.410 --> 01:22:08.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1688
01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the agenda,</v>

1689
01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:11.370
<v Speaker 2>but we just do an amazing amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1690
01:22:11.371 --> 01:22:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Why the hell are we not doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1691
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:14.103
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much for getting me back </v>

1692
01:22:16.081 --> 01:22:17.520
<v Speaker 2>into the group and excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

1693
01:22:17.521 --> 01:22:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And incredibly useful.</v>

1694
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1695
01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a mistake not to view what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing as a,</v>

1696
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.370
<v Speaker 2>as an exciting adventure.</v>

1697
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a form of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what,</v>

1698
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:31.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a form of non-helpful humility.</v>

1699
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1700
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:36.510
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think I,</v>

1701
01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Danish,</v>

1702
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>background and,</v>

1703
01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.810
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things we're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at as self-effacement.</v>

1704
01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so yes,</v>

1705
01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.400
<v Speaker 2>you're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you're following people,</v>

1706
01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.470
<v Speaker 2>you're calling people to a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure here saying,</v>

1707
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:50.304
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have enough resources so that we can </v>

1708
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.320
<v Speaker 2>deflect a small fraction of them and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>an unbelievable amount of good.</v>

1709
01:22:57.331 --> 01:22:59.580
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there were no downside to that.</v>

1710
01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.850
<v Speaker 2>There would be no downside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone,</v>

1711
01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:02.693
<v Speaker 2>there would be nothing but upside even </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some error and there's going to be </v>

1712
01:23:04.621 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 2>error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so of course,</v>

1713
01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.193
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we'll find that people will </v>

1714
01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:11.020
<v Speaker 2>respond to this video in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very positive way.</v>

1715
01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:12.373
<v Speaker 2>And because I do believe that there as </v>
<v Speaker 2>people become more aware that we are </v>

1716
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:18.724
<v Speaker 2>becoming richer and that we do have more</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources at our disposal and that </v>

1717
01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.690
<v Speaker 2>that's genuinely true.</v>

1718
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.600
<v Speaker 2>And that with a bit of intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration,</v>

1719
01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:29.890
<v Speaker 2>we could make things a lot more less </v>
<v Speaker 2>dismal for a lot of people.</v>

1720
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:33.760
<v Speaker 2>I think that they will start to view </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as something that's part of a great</v>

1721
01:23:33.761 --> 01:23:36.100
<v Speaker 2>global,</v>
<v Speaker 2>national and global adventure.</v>

1722
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:37.363
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and because you're agnostic and because </v>

1723
01:23:38.891 --> 01:23:42.680
<v Speaker 2>you've done the leg work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people can also,</v>

1724
01:23:42.681 --> 01:23:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I think get behind that without any real</v>
<v Speaker 2>cynicism,</v>

1725
01:23:45.081 --> 01:23:45.914
<v Speaker 2>they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1726
01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.710
<v Speaker 2>our money spent here is not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasted.</v>

1727
01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:52.190
<v Speaker 2>We can be reasonably assured that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're charitable in this direction,</v>

1728
01:23:52.191 --> 01:23:54.470
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do something positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1729
01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:55.790
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1730
01:23:55.791 --> 01:23:56.960
<v Speaker 2>I found it an incredibly</v>

1731
01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.880
<v Speaker 3>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just say,</v>

1732
01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:00.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1733
01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:03.450
<v Speaker 3>we said a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that I've done.</v>

1734
01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I need to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1735
01:24:05.101 --> 01:24:05.934
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just the sock puppet that talks </v>

1736
01:24:07.111 --> 01:24:08.490
<v Speaker 3>about all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1737
01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.340
<v Speaker 3>this is the work of an incredible amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of really,</v>

1738
01:24:11.341 --> 01:24:12.174
<v Speaker 3>really smart economists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the three end of the world's </v>

1739
01:24:13.741 --> 01:24:15.840
<v Speaker 3>top economists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven Nobel Lawrence,</v>

1740
01:24:16.170 --> 01:24:19.230
<v Speaker 3>those are the guys who have actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>done the work and who are giving you the</v>

1741
01:24:19.231 --> 01:24:21.180
<v Speaker 3>credibility to all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1742
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:25.080
<v Speaker 3>this research and that's why we can say </v>
<v Speaker 3>with great amount of certainty,</v>

1743
01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:27.180
<v Speaker 3>this is not just sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a whim,</v>

1744
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.060
<v Speaker 3>but something that is probably the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>we know now.</v>

1745
01:24:30.061 --> 01:24:32.550
<v Speaker 3>It's probably as you point out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not entirely true,</v>

1746
01:24:32.551 --> 01:24:35.100
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly better than anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else we have right now.</v>

1747
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.113
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1748
01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:41.390
<v Speaker 2>actually the right comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's not absolutely true.</v>

1749
01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no one's got a better idea.</v>

1750
01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:45.403
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we go with the best idea that we </v>

1751
01:24:46.341 --> 01:24:48.500
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1752
01:24:48.710 --> 01:24:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1753
01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:50.571
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

1754
01:24:50.571 --> 01:24:52.340
<v Speaker 2>it was a great pleasure talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1755
01:24:52.341 --> 01:24:53.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hoping that,</v>

1756
01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a million people will watch this and </v>

1757
01:24:55.551 --> 01:24:56.384
<v Speaker 2>that we'll get another million podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of it and that this'll help </v>

1758
01:24:59.991 --> 01:25:01.220
<v Speaker 2>disseminate what you're doing</v>

1759
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:03.050
<v Speaker 3>broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be,</v>

1760
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Bet.</v>

1761
01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1762
01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.870
<v Speaker 3>it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome meeting you.</v>

1763
01:25:08.871 --> 01:25:11.750
<v Speaker 3>And I hope our paths will cross again </v>
<v Speaker 3>soon and,</v>

1764
01:25:11.751 --> 01:25:12.351
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1765
01:25:12.351 --> 01:25:14.180
<v Speaker 3>we should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should make a habit of this.</v>

1766
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we definitely should.</v>

1767
01:25:15.441 --> 01:25:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Well when you start to develop some more</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the national indices,</v>

1768
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:22.620
<v Speaker 2>have you worked on any Western countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Canada or the United States or so?</v>

1769
01:25:22.621 --> 01:25:22.770
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1770
01:25:22.770 --> 01:25:23.401
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1771
01:25:23.401 --> 01:25:24.650
<v Speaker 3>I want it to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

1772
01:25:24.651 --> 01:25:27.710
<v Speaker 3>we haven't done it in the US just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's too dysfunctional,</v>

1773
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:28.623
<v Speaker 3>so many different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen a couple of other people </v>

1774
01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.700
<v Speaker 3>trying to do this without our </v>
<v Speaker 3>involvement.</v>

1775
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:35.100
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at is it,</v>

1776
01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:36.083
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get all these economists who do all </v>

1777
01:25:37.141 --> 01:25:39.930
<v Speaker 3>of this stuff and the first draft of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>paper is,</v>

1778
01:25:40.110 --> 01:25:42.030
<v Speaker 3>this is really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need 10 years,</v>

1779
01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:42.923
<v Speaker 3>a lot of research money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we'll probably get you </v>

1780
01:25:44.521 --> 01:25:46.620
<v Speaker 3>something and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we say hello and that's,</v>

1781
01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:49.710
<v Speaker 3>that's nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to give it your best shot.</v>

1782
01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.870
<v Speaker 3>Give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use the information that's out there now</v>

1783
01:25:51.871 --> 01:25:52.704
<v Speaker 3>and give us a knowledge because </v>
<v Speaker 3>politicians are going to make decisions </v>

1784
01:25:54.721 --> 01:25:55.990
<v Speaker 3>next year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1785
01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:56.883
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what has happened in those two </v>

1786
01:25:58.290 --> 01:26:00.240
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they did one in Holland,</v>

1787
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:03.350
<v Speaker 3>they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might actually be Canada,</v>

1788
01:26:03.351 --> 01:26:04.910
<v Speaker 3>but that was like 10 years ago.</v>

1789
01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:05.983
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in ends up very much like a very </v>

1790
01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:08.624
<v Speaker 3>interesting anthology of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of of points that I have no sort of </v>

1791
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.420
<v Speaker 3>consistency is what we're trying to save</v>
<v Speaker 3>cost.</v>

1792
01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.570
<v Speaker 3>What would it cost to have something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this done for Canada?</v>

1793
01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the shirt,</v>

1794
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:26.270
<v Speaker 3>the short version is it cost about two </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a half million dollars.</v>

1795
01:26:26.271 --> 01:26:27.150
<v Speaker 3>Simply it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1796
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.830
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really scale well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1797
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.170
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it for Ghana,</v>

1798
01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.900
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing as doing it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

1799
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:36.200
<v Speaker 3>How long would it take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 months.</v>

1800
01:26:36.710 --> 01:26:38.420
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's such a good idea.</v>

1801
01:26:38.421 --> 01:26:40.700
<v Speaker 3>So two and a half million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 months.</v>

1802
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1803
01:26:42.321 --> 01:26:43.154
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm going to wrap that around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well maybe we can figure out how to </v>

1804
01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.360
<v Speaker 3>raise the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should.</v>

1805
01:26:47.361 --> 01:26:49.070
<v Speaker 3>We should try and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That be would be good.</v>

1806
01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.533
<v Speaker 3>I think there'd be a lot of interest in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada and Canada would be great way to </v>

1807
01:26:53.271 --> 01:26:57.320
<v Speaker 3>also get sort of bridge point into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>US without doing it in the u s Yup.</v>

1808
01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1809
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:59.203
<v Speaker 3>that would be good cause we're flailing </v>
<v Speaker 3>about politically and it would be nice </v>

1810
01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.180
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1811
01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.033
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>

1812
01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:04.821
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1813
01:27:04.821 --> 01:27:07.460
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fodder for another conversation.</v>

1814
01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:09.050
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a couple of other conversations</v>

1815
01:27:09.051 --> 01:27:09.884
<v Speaker 3>that I'd like to have with you about </v>
<v Speaker 3>policy development and also about </v>

1816
01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:14.540
<v Speaker 3>marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we'll save those for another time.</v>

1817
01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>
