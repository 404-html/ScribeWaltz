1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.240
<v Speaker 1>We are the Democrats</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 18,</v>

2
00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:08.074
<v Speaker 1>28.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our great party has played a major role </v>

3
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:11.194
<v Speaker 1>in participating in the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>process that is produced what is </v>

4
00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>arguably the greatest republic the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>has ever seen.</v>

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.173
<v Speaker 1>We've produced generation after </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of leaders who despite their </v>

6
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:23.944
<v Speaker 1>faults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have helped establish and maintain a </v>

7
00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:26.554
<v Speaker 1>country that is served in the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a beacon of light and hope to the </v>

8
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:30.754
<v Speaker 1>desperate masses of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yearning in those immemorial words to </v>

9
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>breathe free</v>

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.213
<v Speaker 1>over those nearly 200 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have all worked together despite our </v>

11
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>differences to produce a society we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate.</v>

12
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:45.954
<v Speaker 1>Want is a rarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're hardworking men and women can </v>

13
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:49.194
<v Speaker 1>produce a better future for themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their children and where the </v>

14
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:52.434
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary disadvantages that have in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past held so many of us back and </v>

15
00:00:56.311 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>deprived others of our genuine talents </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in good faith,</v>

16
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:00.864
<v Speaker 1>being continually reduced and minimized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is perfect and neither is our </v>

17
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have built together a stable,</v>

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting,</v>

19
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.253
<v Speaker 1>dynamic community and can all in </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence look forward to an even </v>

20
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>better tomorrow.</v>

21
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 1>But we as Democrats have faltered in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>duty in recent years.</v>

22
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.753
<v Speaker 1>We have allowed the discourse within our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ranks to become increasingly dominated </v>

23
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.104
<v Speaker 1>by a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well organized and disruptive minority </v>

24
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.853
<v Speaker 1>who have insisted ever more stridently </v>
<v Speaker 1>that our culture is a tyrannical </v>

25
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 1>destructive patriarchy and that we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not sovereign,</v>

26
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.893
<v Speaker 1>responsible individual citizens capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of negotiating a shared and prosperous </v>

27
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:47.744
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but oppressive or oppressed minority </v>

28
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>group members defined above all by our </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

29
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity,</v>

30
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.233
<v Speaker 1>and sexual preference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have failed as well to oppose the </v>

31
00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:00.674
<v Speaker 1>profoundly anti American claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That free speech is merely the means by </v>

32
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:05.324
<v Speaker 1>which the powerful protect their </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests and we have abandoned are </v>

33
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:09.434
<v Speaker 1>invaluable commitment to and contract </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the American working class who </v>

34
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:13.874
<v Speaker 1>toiled mightily and often under </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of extreme deprivation to </v>

35
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.554
<v Speaker 1>perform the backbreaking labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so necessary to the creation of our </v>

36
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>stellar country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In doing so,</v>

37
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.723
<v Speaker 1>we betrayed and insulted our primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituency and we squandered the </v>

38
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:30.404
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to elect the first woman to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the position of the presidency of the </v>

39
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.533
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then instead of taking responsibility </v>

40
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:39.044
<v Speaker 1>for our well-deserved failure and loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we insisted upon vilifying those who </v>

41
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:47.720
<v Speaker 1>defeated us appropriately and honestly </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the honorable democratic process.</v>

42
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.260
<v Speaker 1>We're sorry,</v>

43
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>we promised to return to the priorities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made our party great.</v>

44
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.963
<v Speaker 1>We promise to build and revitalize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vital infrastructure who's construction </v>

45
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>employees are tradespeople and whose use</v>
<v Speaker 1>is available to all.</v>

46
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.493
<v Speaker 1>We promise to insist that our schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those who conduct the research upon </v>

47
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.850
<v Speaker 1>which their methods are founded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned they're divisive,</v>

48
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>videology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and teach our children the knowledge and</v>

49
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>skills necessary to make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectable,</v>

50
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>

51
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.593
<v Speaker 1>reliable citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We promise and have already taken </v>

52
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>productive steps to reduce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable corruption that tends to take</v>

53
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:32.371
<v Speaker 1>hold of even the greatest and most alert</v>
<v Speaker 1>of states where the Democrats,</v>

54
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.813
<v Speaker 1>we did not uphold our responsibility to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the American people and were justly and </v>

55
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>properly sorry for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We promised to clean our house.</v>

56
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.413
<v Speaker 1>We promise to draw divisions between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>key and time honored principles that </v>

57
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:47.674
<v Speaker 1>unite us all and the divisive identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics that is threatening to reduce </v>

58
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>this to an ignoble squabbling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerously polarized tribalism</v>

59
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>where the Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hope you'll forgive us and we promise</v>

60
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>by the sacred social compact defined by </v>
<v Speaker 1>our unalienable individual rights to act</v>

61
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>responsibly and carefully and do better </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

62
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Long may our great country prosper.</v>
