1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Talk about constructivism and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to primarily discuss John Piaget,</v>

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>although the readings extend to stumped</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree out past his thought.</v>

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>PSA is generally regarded as a</v>

4
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>developmental psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not what he thought of himself.</v>

5
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>He thought that he was at genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>epistemologist,</v>

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>which is a term that I think has ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>only been applied to him.</v>

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>An epistemologist is someone who studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which knowledge,</v>

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who studies knowledge itself.</v>

9
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Piaget thought that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And he wanted to understand how it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that knowledge unfolded across time.</v>

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>And more importantly than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to understand how the</v>

12
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>cognitive structures that made up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual developed across time.</v>

13
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>So that's generally why he's regarded as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a developmental psychologist because of</v>

14
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>course he also studied children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

15
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget rope to begin this.</v>

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote an awful lot of books and a lot</v>

17
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>of them haven't yet been translated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the ones that are translated are</v>

18
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>translated pretty badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is probably an example</v>

19
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>of a fairly bad translation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but regardless of that,</v>

20
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>the point that's being made is both</v>
<v Speaker 1>valid and interesting.</v>

21
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>So the Garmin postulate a various</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional epistemologies,</v>

22
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>which are theories of valid knowledge is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that knowledge is a fact say or a set of</v>

23
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>facts so that you would go to class and</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn a set of facts and that is what</v>

24
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>would give you knowledge instead of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

25
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And if our various forms of noman</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawings incomplete as we know they are,</v>

26
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>because they're replaced sequentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently in the domain of physics,</v>

28
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>physicists revealed to us that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>really didn't understand what some</v>

29
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>massive percentage of the universe was</v>
<v Speaker 1>made up.</v>

30
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember,</v>

31
00:01:56.011 --> 00:02:01.011
<v Speaker 1>it's 75% or 95% made up of dark matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has never been detective.</v>

32
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>And we know how to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good example of how our</v>

33
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>fundamental assumptions can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged at any moment.</v>

34
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>And how a fact can turn from a fact into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clear fallacy if our various forms of</v>

35
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always in complete.</v>

36
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:19.821
<v Speaker 1>And our various sciences still imperfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which is acquired is acquired and</v>

37
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>can therefore be studied statically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the proposition there is that you</v>

38
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>come and you learn the facts and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts themselves are solid bits of</v>

39
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>information and they don't change across</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

40
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.380
<v Speaker 1>And so that once you have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have them.</v>

41
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Now of course piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously delts that hence the absolute</v>

42
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>position of the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is knowledge or how were the</v>

43
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:44.541
<v Speaker 1>various types of knowledge possible as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an alternative under the converging</v>

44
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>influence of a series of factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're tending more and more today to</v>

45
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>regard knowledge as a process more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>a state,</v>

46
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>any being or object that science is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to hold fast dissolves.</v>

47
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Once again in the current of</v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

48
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>it is the last analysis of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>development and the vid alone that we</v>

49
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>have the right to state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a fact.</v>

50
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>What it means by that is the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings learn facts is in fact a</v>

51
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>So you are capable of learning things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thinks that's sort of the</v>

53
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>fundamental fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People assimilate information and they</v>

54
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>transformed as a consequence of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so studying that as he says what we</v>

55
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>can and should then seek is a law of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this process.</v>

56
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 1>We are well aware on the other hand that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fine book by Kuhn Scientific</v>

57
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Revolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason PSA throws them in at the</v>

58
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you know about Thomas Kuhn's</v>

59
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>book on scientific resolutions?</v>

60
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>No one just to three people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

61
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.900
<v Speaker 1>well that's probably not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Kuhn was one of the 20th century's</v>
<v Speaker 1>foremost philosophers of science and he</v>

63
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>made a distinction between two different</v>
<v Speaker 1>modes of scientific process.</v>

64
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called normal science and the other</v>

65
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>he called Revolutionary Science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And normal science was the kind of</v>

66
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:11.701
<v Speaker 1>science then you'll do as undergraduates</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're incredibly lucky or</v>

67
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:14.840
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>or probably unbelievably really an Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly lucky.</v>

69
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>And so normal science occurs when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate knowledge incrementally from</v>

70
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>within the confines of an already</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed scientific theory.</v>

71
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 1>So a normal science would be a say the</v>
<v Speaker 1>application of big five models of</v>

72
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.750
<v Speaker 1>personality to the prediction of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other variable like say relationship</v>

73
00:04:35.751 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to uncover something new,</v>

74
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to shake the</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations of knowledge itself.</v>

75
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coon observed that from time to time</v>

76
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>there were discoveries that were made</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shook the foundation of knowledge</v>

77
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

78
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>There's some well known revolutions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

79
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>so the Newtonian Revolution was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution in science.</v>

80
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein's were produced another</v>

81
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>revolution in science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwin's were Mendel's work.</v>

82
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the revolutionary</v>

83
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.290
<v Speaker 1>transformations of thought that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>often considered.</v>

84
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Did I say Darwin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly should have said Darwin</v>

85
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>because his was probably the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary of all.</v>

86
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the reason that I wanted to tell you</v>

87
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I kept it in here,</v>

88
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.120
<v Speaker 1>even though it seems like it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little additional statement pin to the</v>

89
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>end of Piaget's Caucasian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that cool,</v>

90
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.390
<v Speaker 1>observed at scientists science seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress in accordance with the same</v>

91
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that Piaget observed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the knowledge of children appeared</v>

92
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:39.070
<v Speaker 1>to progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

93
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you'll learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>about piaget,</v>

94
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>which is generally all you learned if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learned about piaget,</v>

95
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>is his idea that children go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequential stages of development and</v>

96
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>usually people have you memorize those</v>
<v Speaker 1>stages.</v>

97
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I should let you know that piaget really</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't care that much about those</v>

98
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>stages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they occurred and how they</v>

99
00:05:56.201 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 1>could be sped up at what they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was much more interested in deep</v>

100
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:05.380
<v Speaker 1>philosophical questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that element of his work generally</v>

101
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>goes unrecognized by the North American</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist who purport to understand</v>

102
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>what he had to say now because he wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens of books,</v>

103
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>some of which are not yet translated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising that people come</v>

104
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>away with a partial view of key Jay when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're that prolific.</v>

105
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.790
<v Speaker 1>He was so damn smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was offered the curatorship of a</v>

106
00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:31.791
<v Speaker 1>museum when he was 10 because he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>published a scientific paper on,</v>

107
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:37.241
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on snails and but his</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents requested that he turned it</v>

108
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

109
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>piaget was a major genius and if someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts their mind like that puts their</v>

110
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.600
<v Speaker 1>mind to work for an entire lifetime and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived to be an old match,</v>

111
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>they can produce an awful lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual material and it's not</v>

112
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it can't be summarized</v>

113
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>easily as a single,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 1>coherence theory that you could memorize</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one page.</v>

115
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty hard for people to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not surprising that his thought</v>

116
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:01.450
<v Speaker 1>gets reduced to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>a set of axioms is in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the devil is often in the detail</v>

118
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 1>with great thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that to really</v>

119
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>understand what they had to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually have to read them because a</v>

120
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>lot of the information is at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence level of analysis and not at</v>

121
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:17.540
<v Speaker 1>the summary Level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

122
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to summarize what you</v>

123
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 1>have to say because most of what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to say is in fact informative.</v>

124
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just throw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to compress it.</v>

125
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this initial paragraph opens up the</v>

126
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:35.150
<v Speaker 1>world of Constructivism to now the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructivists are interesting people</v>

127
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll often hear people ask is it</v>

128
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 1>genetic or environmental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

129
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.240
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good question because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>false dichotomy that the genes formulate</v>

130
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>structures in accordance with</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental demand right from the</v>

131
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the organisms emergence.</v>

132
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.420
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a constant interplay</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the environment and genetics.</v>

133
00:07:56.421 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>But the environment isn't also just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's out there that's like made</v>

134
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:04.000
<v Speaker 1>out of lions and Tigers of Moose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings and you know,</v>

135
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.960
<v Speaker 1>the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

136
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.080
<v Speaker 1>it's an information field and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructivist point outrightly that</v>

137
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 1>partly what you're doing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating in the world is interacting</v>

138
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>with this field of information and</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporating it structure into the</v>

139
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>structure of your mind and body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how you adapt.</v>

140
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>So you could say in some sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're built out of information and</v>

141
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it</v>

142
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>and the constructivists or very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting interested in how you go</v>

143
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>about acquiring information and how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>then transform that information into the</v>

144
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 1>sort of knows that you can apply to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

145
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.310
<v Speaker 1>So they're also very pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially piaget because Piaget regards</v>

146
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 1>knowledge as um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the prerequisite for adaptive</v>

147
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:47.804
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

148
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

149
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>he's less concerned about the facts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know about the structure of the</v>

150
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>world that he is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that you modify and adapt your</v>

151
00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>behavior so that you could survive in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

152
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the first pos,</v>

153
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 1>that's constructivism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next postulate is that</v>

154
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 1>there are revolutions in this internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that you construct that</v>

155
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>emerge as a consequence of you acquiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>new information.</v>

156
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that information can already</v>
<v Speaker 1>be fit into a knowledge structure that</v>

157
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you possess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes the information is so</v>

158
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:25.221
<v Speaker 1>anomalous or novel that it blows out</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental precept positions that</v>

159
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:30.261
<v Speaker 1>you've already established and forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to not only add some information to</v>

160
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 1>your repertoire of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to reconfigure the structure you use</v>

161
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>to represent the information you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that people don't like it when that</v>

162
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too dramatic and upsetting.</v>

163
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.000
<v Speaker 1>So which is often why revolutions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>science or in an APP,</v>

164
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 1>any other field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our first resistance,</v>

165
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's very complicated.</v>

166
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>The reasons people are opposed to new</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas are very complicated.</v>

167
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of theories about why that</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs.</v>

168
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll briefly outline and good</v>

169
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them,</v>

170
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 1>but a log line one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say there's already a</v>

171
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 1>scientific theory and it's instantiated</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

172
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.750
<v Speaker 1>So people accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's say that you are a proponent</v>

173
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>of that theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

174
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that theory therefore governs your</v>

175
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I threaten it,</v>

176
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.970
<v Speaker 1>then your world view is going to fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart and that's going to make you fall</v>

177
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a bad theory,</v>

178
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 1>but here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a variant of that which is</v>

179
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 1>similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which I think is better.</v>

180
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say I have a theory now what I'm</v>

181
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>doing with my theory is buying my right</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a professor.</v>

182
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 1>So I would come to the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto as a job candidate and I would</v>

183
00:10:40.171 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's my theory and here's why I think</v>

184
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>the facts support it.</v>

185
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Here's what it's good for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll say,</v>

186
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like you know enough about what</v>

187
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>you're doing so that you can occupy this</v>
<v Speaker 1>position in this dominance hierarchy.</v>

188
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm pretty happy about that because</v>

189
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:57.780
<v Speaker 1>that position in that dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is pretty permanent.</v>

190
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the advantages to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>academic job.</v>

191
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like once you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're relatively confident</v>

192
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 1>and relatively ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can,</v>

193
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you can maintain it across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

194
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.110
<v Speaker 1>so it's a big deal to be granted that</v>
<v Speaker 1>slot.</v>

195
00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>And then being in that dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is not only a matter of what</v>

196
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the fact that I'm in the</v>

197
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>donuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he means I get a certain salary and</v>

198
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:24.150
<v Speaker 1>that's not hypothetical that allows me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat.</v>

199
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>So I'm happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only psychological and I can</v>

200
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 1>pay my housing payments with it and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

201
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.420
<v Speaker 1>So it protects me from the cold and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>offers me something to eat and it gives</v>

202
00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:37.080
<v Speaker 1>me a certain public status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if some others,</v>

203
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.750
<v Speaker 1>joker comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they're young and they say,</v>

204
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a different theory and it makes</v>

205
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>your theory looks stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm not going to be very happy</v>

206
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:47.280
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because it upsets the way that I</v>

207
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:49.140
<v Speaker 1>could figure my understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

208
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's a drag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I might recover from that.</v>

209
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.540
<v Speaker 1>But it also undermines my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undermines the validity of my claim to</v>

210
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 1>that position in the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it sorta makes me an imposter,</v>

211
00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 1>say it and say the guy turns out to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

212
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:04.024
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

213
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm an imposter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I knew really no longer really have</v>

214
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 1>the right to occupy that position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone might even point that out,</v>

215
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 1>although it doesn't happen very often.</v>

216
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 1>In the case of professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happens fairly frequently</v>

217
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 1>in other sorts of occupations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

218
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden your position has made</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless because somebody figured out how</v>

219
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 1>to automate you and poof you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's hard on your world view but</v>

220
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot harder on your celery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the reasons that people</v>

221
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.330
<v Speaker 1>claim to the validity of their theories</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because it gives them a claim to a</v>

222
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

223
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.340
<v Speaker 1>what would you call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skillset and utility that then gives</v>

224
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:39.460
<v Speaker 1>them a claim to occupy a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>position in the dominance hierarchy and</v>

225
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 1>that protects them from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

226
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the horrors of reality.</v>

227
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Not Completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

228
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have health insurance for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

229
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really helpful.</v>

230
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.640
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want some joker coming along</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pointing out that my theory is,</v>

231
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 1>is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

232
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 1>so far that hasn't happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing as far as I'm</v>

233
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:00.814
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

234
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So psg concludes and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all knowledge is always in a state of</v>

235
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 1>development and consists in proceeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one state to a more complete and</v>

236
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 1>efficient one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidently it is a question of knowing</v>

237
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 1>this development and analyzing it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest possible accuracy.</v>

238
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget fingers,</v>

239
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.860
<v Speaker 1>you're a information foraging machine so</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak,</v>

240
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.970
<v Speaker 1>and the process that you engage in while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're forging from information for</v>

241
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 1>information and then figuring out what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with it is typical to human</v>

242
00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:34.360
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's some constancy of structure</v>

243
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.280
<v Speaker 1>across human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

244
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first idea.</v>

245
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that we all do it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different way,</v>

246
00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:42.010
<v Speaker 1>even though there's individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>variation,</v>

247
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:43.440
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

248
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.450
<v Speaker 1>the other sort of fundamental postulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>of constructivism,</v>

249
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.540
<v Speaker 1>especially the Phn Ian version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constructivism,</v>

250
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:52.030
<v Speaker 1>is that you sort of build yourself from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom up,</v>

251
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.800
<v Speaker 1>starting with your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Pia,</v>

252
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.570
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things about Piaget's</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that's unbelievably</v>

253
00:13:58.571 --> 00:13:59.560
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

254
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 1>So when people were first developing</v>
<v Speaker 1>models of artificial intelligence,</v>

255
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 1>they thought they'd be able to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>

256
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:08.770
<v Speaker 1>that sort of model of the world and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to act.</v>

257
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:12.670
<v Speaker 1>In the world sort of abstractly and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>would after they figured out how to act</v>

258
00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:14.740
<v Speaker 1>in the world would then act in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

259
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.800
<v Speaker 1>But that proved to be impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you can tell,</v>

260
00:14:17.801 --> 00:14:19.130
<v Speaker 1>because we don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

261
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>ambulatory robots that could like bus</v>
<v Speaker 1>tables at a restaurant,</v>

262
00:14:23.351 --> 00:14:25.690
<v Speaker 1>which turns out to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way a very complex job,</v>

263
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.390
<v Speaker 1>fast mathematical operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Computer can handle that easily or</v>

264
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 1>easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bussing a table.</v>

265
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like no computer is smart enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

266
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it turned out after like 40 years of</v>

267
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:44.131
<v Speaker 1>investigation that you couldn't build</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers that would operate as</v>

268
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>independent robots by teaching them</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow the world.</v>

269
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.830
<v Speaker 1>And then by having the model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential action that they were</v>

270
00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:53.330
<v Speaker 1>going to undertake and then implementing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

271
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 1>That did not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly because modeling the world is way</v>

272
00:14:57.351 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 1>more complicated than anybody ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspected.</v>

273
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:03.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like infinitely more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so some robotics engineers such as</v>

274
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Rodney Brooks who worked at Mit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started building robots from the bottom</v>

275
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made these little mindless robots</v>

276
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:14.270
<v Speaker 1>that really didn't even have a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>essential processor that we're action</v>

277
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the first things he built where</v>

278
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:18.350
<v Speaker 1>he's literally the sec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things that could skitter away from</v>

279
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all they could do.</v>

280
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 1>It turn a light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

281
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>they'd go find some dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's as if,</v>

282
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.900
<v Speaker 1>so imagine the world to that roadblock</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a binary place.</v>

283
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.960
<v Speaker 1>It was either a light place where a dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>place and then you might say,</v>

284
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.800
<v Speaker 1>well what did life or dark mean to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>little robot?</v>

285
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what does meaning mean?</v>

286
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good question.</v>

287
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 1>It's one that piaget answers meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>means to that the robot</v>

288
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 1>move to a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So light to that robot meant move to a</v>

289
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:54.140
<v Speaker 1>different place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the,</v>

290
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.580
<v Speaker 1>what the robot in a sense was doing was</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming one form of information,</v>

291
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.060
<v Speaker 1>light versus dark into another form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was skitter away.</v>

292
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And so I love that because it's not easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand what meaning means until</v>

293
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you relate it to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget's fundamental proposition</v>

294
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.800
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elements of your understanding are</v>

295
00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:17.810
<v Speaker 1>not perceptual abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

296
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:21.530
<v Speaker 1>there's even elements of understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>that underlie your perceptual</v>

297
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.480
<v Speaker 1>abstractions that are more fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what those are essentially our</v>

298
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.560
<v Speaker 1>sensory motor skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things you do with your body.</v>

299
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a lovely idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely profound and I think it's</v>

300
00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>absolutely correct.</v>

301
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does wreak havoc with the idea of</v>

302
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.780
<v Speaker 1>disembodied intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

303
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.730
<v Speaker 1>because for Piaget and also for Rodney</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooks who is responsible by the way,</v>

304
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.370
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you've seen big dog,</v>

305
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.570
<v Speaker 1>big dog look up Darpa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Da Rpa.</v>

306
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have seen big dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you are terrified by big</v>

307
00:16:57.081 --> 00:16:58.090
<v Speaker 1>dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

308
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Big Dog is this robot that's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed by the U s army that it's</v>

309
00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:07.080
<v Speaker 1>about this big and it's four legged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got ahead and it could run like</v>

310
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.000
<v Speaker 1>faster than you and it can run in snow</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it can run on ice and it can run up</v>

311
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:13.420
<v Speaker 1>hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you kick it,</v>

312
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.780
<v Speaker 1>if balances and stands back oxen</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically it's going to be used to</v>

313
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:22.110
<v Speaker 1>transport like the heavy things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers have to carry.</v>

314
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe that that's a stupid idea.</v>

315
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Once these things can emulate by</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they can already follow</v>

316
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:31.960
<v Speaker 1>each other because now they have visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

317
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arming that is going to be a very simple</v>

318
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

319
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.700
<v Speaker 1>And so the probability that we'll have</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably super fast robots that can</v>

320
00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:43.970
<v Speaker 1>shoot you in 10 years is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me as far as I can tell from the</v>

321
00:17:43.971 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 1>development is absolutely certain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's a computer</v>

322
00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 1>engineer and he's a really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

323
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you know how in science fiction movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when those robot shooting at</v>

324
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:53.874
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they miss.</v>

325
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 1>You said when the robots shoot it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you not only will they shoot at where</v>

326
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll shoot it.</v>

327
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:02.130
<v Speaker 1>The six places that they calculate your</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely to dark too and they will</v>

328
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:05.370
<v Speaker 1>never miss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lovely thing to think about.</v>

329
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.790
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully that will come to pass,</v>

330
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 1>but it probably will.</v>

331
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.830
<v Speaker 1>So here's the sort of thing that PSA was</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>

332
00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 1>These are very fundamental questions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a very deep intellect.</v>

333
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:26.070
<v Speaker 1>So he tried to go right to the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structures of knowledge to find out</v>

334
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>what was down there</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon what does an individual basis</v>

335
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:32.640
<v Speaker 1>judgments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

336
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.630
<v Speaker 1>How do you know where they do a or b or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the differences between right and</v>

337
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:38.970
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How has that instantiated in your,</v>

338
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.080
<v Speaker 1>in your being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your norms?</v>

339
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.840
<v Speaker 1>How is it that those norms are</v>
<v Speaker 1>validated?</v>

340
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.820
<v Speaker 1>What's the interest of such norms for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy of science in general,</v>

341
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.590
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a question like,</v>

342
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a consensual reality that we all</v>

343
00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 1>share to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why we can communicate,</v>

344
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a one to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between that consensual</v>

345
00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 1>reality and the categories of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget was interested in the</v>

346
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 1>similarities between our consensual</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint and the scientific viewpoint.</v>

347
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.100
<v Speaker 1>And the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

348
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 1>people use to hypothetically assume that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was flat.</v>

349
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could say,</v>

350
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason they assumed that was because</v>

351
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.670
<v Speaker 1>it looks flat when you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was an empirical observation,</v>

352
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.140
<v Speaker 1>but obviously there were other</v>
<v Speaker 1>observations that we managed to produce.</v>

353
00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:29.130
<v Speaker 1>It indicated that the world wasn't flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then our scientific conceptions and</v>

354
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:31.140
<v Speaker 1>our interpersonal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

355
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 1>consensual norms</v>
<v Speaker 1>became divorced from one another.</v>

356
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:37.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's becoming a really serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

357
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.440
<v Speaker 1>say with branches of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like quantum mechanics,</v>

358
00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:44.400
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are absolutely completely</v>

359
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.220
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible from a pragmatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

360
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 1>even to those who formulate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically I pay a piaget would say</v>

361
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:52.170
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

362
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.590
<v Speaker 1>when we interact with objects at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal,</v>

363
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal logical level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the level that we can most</v>

364
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 1>easily perceive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they act Newtonian,</v>

365
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can I take your pen?</v>

366
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.420
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of predict what this</v>

367
00:20:06.421 --> 00:20:09.990
<v Speaker 1>penalty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it acts like other objects of</v>

368
00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:14.640
<v Speaker 1>about its size and shape with mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your understanding of this is</v>

369
00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:19.530
<v Speaker 1>actually based upon your knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will happen if you manipulate this</v>

370
00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:22.080
<v Speaker 1>thing with your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's solid.</v>

371
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:25.020
<v Speaker 1>You'd be very surprised if you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>like put your fingers through this pen.</v>

372
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 1>You'd be surprised if it broke because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you expect a certain hardness.</v>

373
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 1>You do expect it to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although pins off to dote,</v>

374
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 1>you expect it to be pointy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you can take it apart into</v>

375
00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:38.880
<v Speaker 1>many objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though like you can ask how many</v>

376
00:20:38.881 --> 00:20:41.610
<v Speaker 1>objects is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

377
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.040
<v Speaker 1>it's one pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

378
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.410
<v Speaker 1>But you could take it apart.</v>

379
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Now it's two objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can see that there's other</v>

380
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 1>objects in here and sometimes you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it back together and it'll still</v>

381
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

382
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.700
<v Speaker 1>so Psj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his point is that what we regard as</v>

383
00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:11.320
<v Speaker 1>understanding to say that you understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>something is to indicate that you can</v>

384
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:16.030
<v Speaker 1>predict what is going to occur if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with that object with your</v>

385
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:17.290
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

386
00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives you your intuitive</v>

387
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:24.370
<v Speaker 1>understanding of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because this is material other,</v>

388
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you already know something about other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are material right and you</v>

389
00:21:28.361 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 1>can transfer it from place to place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's again an embodied knowledge</v>

390
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:36.130
<v Speaker 1>because material things are those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>through which you cannot put your hand</v>

391
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.620
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd get some weird things like smoker</v>

392
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.120
<v Speaker 1>clouds and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well are they,</v>

393
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.770
<v Speaker 1>what are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they objects?</v>

394
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Is a cloud and object?</v>

395
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

396
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Cause an object is one of these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could sort of manipulate as a</v>

397
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:50.890
<v Speaker 1>unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the categories of quantum mechanics,</v>

398
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which deal with these incredibly tiny</v>

399
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.600
<v Speaker 1>things that are really don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles and are really not waves,</v>

400
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.590
<v Speaker 1>they're in comprehensible to us because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never manipulate anything at that</v>

401
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:05.080
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because we can't play with it,</v>

402
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.470
<v Speaker 1>we have no real way of understanding it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because our understanding is based on</v>

403
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the mapping of objects onto our body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So any object that we can map onto her</v>

404
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:17.950
<v Speaker 1>body is therefore fundamentally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible.</v>

405
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It's very cool theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 1>and it very body centric theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does the fact that children think</v>

407
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:26.430
<v Speaker 1>differently than we do affect our</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumption?</v>

408
00:22:26.431 --> 00:22:28.990
<v Speaker 1>In fact itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting question too</v>

409
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:31.570
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got three year olds and of</v>

410
00:22:31.571 --> 00:22:33.340
<v Speaker 1>course they're pretty clueless about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world but,</v>

411
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know more,</v>

412
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:38.710
<v Speaker 1>but there's the three year old is alive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything and functioning.</v>

413
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.720
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

414
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.350
<v Speaker 1>if their conception of the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualitatively different than your</v>

415
00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:46.870
<v Speaker 1>conception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you can both survive in</v>

416
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 1>the same world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean about,</v>

417
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.450
<v Speaker 1>about what knowledge means and about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>limits of knowledge.</v>

418
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I could say the same thing above you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you might say about a three year</v>

420
00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:58.061
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

421
00:22:58.061 --> 00:23:01.030
<v Speaker 1>well if I took you from this place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped you in the jungle,</v>

422
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon you'd be dead,</v>

423
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 1>first few be visible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be dead.</v>

424
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that's sort of like the three</v>
<v Speaker 1>year olds state of being.</v>

425
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:10.601
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 1>if you were supposed to take care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you disappeared.</v>

427
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.260
<v Speaker 1>So obviously even your knowledge of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is limited by wall.</v>

428
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.010
<v Speaker 1>It's limited in its necessary generality</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the context.</v>

429
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.190
<v Speaker 1>But that also has something interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say about the validity of your</v>

430
00:23:24.191 --> 00:23:26.500
<v Speaker 1>knowledge itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very context dependent.</v>

431
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.881
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

432
00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>so that's the sort of thing that piaget</v>
<v Speaker 1>was interested in.</v>

433
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Here's some other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by number?</v>

434
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.420
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have,</v>

435
00:23:35.421 --> 00:23:37.660
<v Speaker 1>they say you can't compare apples and</v>
<v Speaker 1>oranges,</v>

436
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.330
<v Speaker 1>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I said,</v>

437
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.160
<v Speaker 1>well what's two oranges plus two apples</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fruits?</v>

438
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Who just said that you sound very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way you solve that was by</v>

439
00:23:48.621 --> 00:23:49.790
<v Speaker 1>generalizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a level,</v>

440
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I sat down,</v>

441
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's two desks plus two rocks,</v>

442
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.610
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes ma'am.</v>

443
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.020
<v Speaker 1>You're very good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty thing it was done.</v>

444
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.320
<v Speaker 1>That's an Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

445
00:24:02.321 --> 00:24:04.940
<v Speaker 1>those are their Iq questions by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you did get them now you could</v>

446
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:06.160
<v Speaker 1>feel disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>

447
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.890
<v Speaker 1>If you've got the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can pat yourself on the map.</v>

448
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:15.150
<v Speaker 1>So number is a funny thing because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I pointed out with the Pan,</v>

450
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:20.330
<v Speaker 1>well one can become many very rapidly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many can become one.</v>

451
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the whole idea of announcer is</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely difficult to understand.</v>

452
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.890
<v Speaker 1>You know like what is in common between</v>
<v Speaker 1>singular entities that allows you to</v>

453
00:24:31.611 --> 00:24:35.690
<v Speaker 1>represent all of them with one well</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals don't do that.</v>

454
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 1>They can in a sense they can sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuit three or four,</v>

455
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:43.950
<v Speaker 1>which is about all we can intuit to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once we get the nomenclature done</v>

456
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.910
<v Speaker 1>property man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can use numbers like crazy and then</v>

457
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.740
<v Speaker 1>they bill us to manipulate reality like</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>

458
00:24:49.741 --> 00:24:54.230
<v Speaker 1>So whatever it is we're extracting from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the commonality between objects seems to</v>

459
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:56.720
<v Speaker 1>be something that gives us incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

460
00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by space?</v>

461
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Since we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Einstein's work that you know,</v>

462
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.870
<v Speaker 1>space spaces is not an absolute in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

463
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.530
<v Speaker 1>It isn't the speeds we move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you mean by time and speed?</v>

464
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 1>What is an object permanent and when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>

465
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:18.740
<v Speaker 1>and when do you learn that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean that an object is the</v>

466
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:20.690
<v Speaker 1>same across time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

467
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:21.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there's a single</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecule in your body that was there</v>

469
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.890
<v Speaker 1>five months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months ago.</v>

470
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the turnover</v>

471
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.810
<v Speaker 1>duration is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fairly,</v>

472
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.710
<v Speaker 1>it's fairly quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's weird day because there you are</v>

473
00:25:36.711 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 1>and you were there two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of your constituent elements</v>

474
00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:42.590
<v Speaker 1>are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how is it that you can be the same</v>

475
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:47.750
<v Speaker 1>now that physicist Schrodinger</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schrodinger of the Schrodinger's cat</v>

476
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 1>fade solved that by claiming that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were at dissipative structure.</v>

477
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you thought life was</v>

478
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:54.950
<v Speaker 1>dissipative structures.</v>

479
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:55.371
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissipate.</v>

480
00:25:55.371 --> 00:25:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Dissipative structure is the same as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:25:58.191 --> 00:25:59.480
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you pull up the,</v>

482
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:00.583
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

483
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.740
<v Speaker 1>he pulled out at the bottom of the sink</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopper,</v>

484
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stopper,</v>

485
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're a saint is full of water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pull up the stopper,</v>

486
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a whirlpool,</v>

487
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:12.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the water's spins as it as it</v>

488
00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:17.500
<v Speaker 1>goes down the drain hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll notice that that whirlpool</v>

489
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 1>look sort of the same across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though obviously the water</v>

490
00:26:20.931 --> 00:26:24.770
<v Speaker 1>molecules that make it up are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He called that a dissipated structure.</v>

491
00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a pattern that maintained itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>in spite of the movement of matter</v>

492
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:30.890
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you are,</v>

493
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.350
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it requires energy to keep a</v>

494
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:37.370
<v Speaker 1>dissipative structure intact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

495
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take in energy.</v>

496
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.090
<v Speaker 1>So thanks to the sun.</v>

497
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by chance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

498
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have moral concerns and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it mean that you have moral</v>

499
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:52.290
<v Speaker 1>concerns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you have ideas about how people</v>

500
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:54.510
<v Speaker 1>should behave and how they shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>

501
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And you have a very deep understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

502
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's characteristic of all human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and many,</v>

503
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 1>many animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where does that come from?</v>

504
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Is it developed form of knowledge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are children doing when they're</v>

505
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:08.130
<v Speaker 1>playing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are people doing when they're</v>

506
00:27:08.131 --> 00:27:09.540
<v Speaker 1>dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

507
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:12.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the significance of the fact that</v>

508
00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you can imitate other people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll,</v>

509
00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with the last one briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

510
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that one of the things</v>

511
00:27:21.331 --> 00:27:24.660
<v Speaker 1>that really distinguishes us from other</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures animals is the fact that we</v>

512
00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:26.520
<v Speaker 1>have a thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big one.</v>

513
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 1>We've got very good functional thumbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hooray for that.</v>

514
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And we stand up on two feet.</v>

515
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.800
<v Speaker 1>So we get a chance to use our thumbs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to carry things round as a great</v>

516
00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:37.350
<v Speaker 1>things and to take them apart and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>swing sticks and so on.</v>

517
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:40.650
<v Speaker 1>But there are other animals who can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to a limited degree.</v>

518
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.800
<v Speaker 1>And then there's our ability to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a major one.</v>

519
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.320
<v Speaker 1>But one of the other things that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiates people from other animals</v>

520
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.290
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you hear monkey see monkey do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

522
00:27:51.151 --> 00:27:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Well that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey.</v>

523
00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:57.681
<v Speaker 1>See that's the end of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really can't imitate one another.</v>

524
00:27:58.441 --> 00:28:03.441
<v Speaker 1>And they certainly can't imitate any</v>
<v Speaker 1>even randomly generated normal behavior</v>

525
00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:08.400
<v Speaker 1>that another monkey producers think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it this way.</v>

526
00:28:08.401 --> 00:28:10.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hear these claims that chimpanzees</v>

527
00:28:10.261 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>have culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

528
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.383
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

529
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

530
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.710
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to figure out that they don't</v>

531
00:28:16.711 --> 00:28:17.670
<v Speaker 1>have culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

532
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 1>let's say chimps have been around</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking for 50 million years,</v>

533
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.220
<v Speaker 1>which is not a bad estimate because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverged from them about 7 million years</v>

534
00:28:26.221 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

535
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.450
<v Speaker 1>And the evidence is pretty clear that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that we diverged from looked a</v>

536
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 1>lot more like a chimp then it looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>like us.</v>

537
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:36.180
<v Speaker 1>So like we've been booting it ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>madly developing like mad and the chimps</v>

538
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:38.640
<v Speaker 1>would be laying back and eating leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

539
00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:42.690
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do they have a culture?</v>

540
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey that 50 million years,</v>

541
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't even built a hot yet.</v>

542
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.750
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're a culture generated</v>

543
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:56.751
<v Speaker 1>creature and you only magine match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll only manage saying one discovery</v>

544
00:28:57.451 --> 00:29:02.451
<v Speaker 1>of a hundred years between all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have 50 million years to get your</v>

545
00:29:02.611 --> 00:29:06.090
<v Speaker 1>act together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of hundred year segments.</v>

546
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.780
<v Speaker 1>And so even if the chimpanzee was</v>
<v Speaker 1>building culture at the rate of 0.0,</v>

547
00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero 1% a year,</v>

548
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:12.940
<v Speaker 1>if you calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm,</v>

549
00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.860
<v Speaker 1>that over 50 million years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the empire state building and</v>

550
00:29:16.861 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 1>there are the empire state buildings</v>
<v Speaker 1>that chimpanzees are living in.</v>

551
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.360
<v Speaker 1>And so therefore they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

552
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Now they might be able to recognize the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their peers in the dominance hierarchy.</v>

553
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.540
<v Speaker 1>They can do that and they can use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they can use simple tools,</v>

554
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:34.410
<v Speaker 1>but the tools they use seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on the environment that they</v>

555
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:35.700
<v Speaker 1>inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

556
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:38.100
<v Speaker 1>cause some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well some chips use one tool on some</v>

557
00:29:38.101 --> 00:29:39.450
<v Speaker 1>chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use another button.</v>

558
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to live in a rocky</v>

559
00:29:42.071 --> 00:29:43.480
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he might use rocks.</v>

560
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:45.280
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to live in a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has sticks,</v>

561
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:47.400
<v Speaker 1>you might use sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not because you're a</v>

562
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.820
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because the environment's</v>

563
00:29:48.821 --> 00:29:51.130
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

564
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candy,</v>

565
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.770
<v Speaker 1>imitate one another very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

566
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 1>but humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man were ridiculous.</v>

567
00:29:56.981 --> 00:29:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so imitative.</v>

568
00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

569
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's so cool because what it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that once you get a pattern of</v>

570
00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:05.680
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

571
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you whip up a new pattern of behavior,</v>

572
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I can watch you and I can just</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiate it in my own bloody,</v>

573
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a bit awkwardly to begin with.</v>

574
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Although maybe sometimes better than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

575
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.650
<v Speaker 1>And Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got that.</v>

576
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And so we're always looking around at</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

577
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 1>seeing what we're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as we see someone who's up</v>

578
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:25.330
<v Speaker 1>to something interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we can do the same thing.</v>

579
00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Children do that cause they imitate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

580
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 1>But there are even better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They generalize across instances of</v>

581
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:33.280
<v Speaker 1>imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

582
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you remember when you're a kid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're playing,</v>

583
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're playing house and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mom,</v>

584
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:38.950
<v Speaker 1>or maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

585
00:30:38.951 --> 00:30:42.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're the house cat because</v>
<v Speaker 1>children will certainly do that.</v>

586
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say the child is being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house cat.</v>

587
00:30:44.361 --> 00:30:46.240
<v Speaker 1>So he or she is down on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

588
00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:49.990
<v Speaker 1>all forest zoom room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cat maybe meowing and rubbing up</v>

589
00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:52.400
<v Speaker 1>against there mother's leg and looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a male milk.</v>

590
00:30:52.401 --> 00:30:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And the below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not exactly imitating their cat</v>

591
00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.130
<v Speaker 1>because if they were exactly imitating</v>
<v Speaker 1>their cat,</v>

592
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.980
<v Speaker 1>they would be moving exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way the cat move.</v>

593
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.500
<v Speaker 1>But now they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is they've observed</v>

594
00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:08.260
<v Speaker 1>the cat across a wide variety of in of</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>

595
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.560
<v Speaker 1>They abstracted what constitutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>generalized cat behavior from all of</v>

596
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 1>those instances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they can instantiate the spirit</v>

597
00:31:17.201 --> 00:31:19.960
<v Speaker 1>of the cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of the movements that make</v>

598
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:22.300
<v Speaker 1>up cactus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

599
00:31:22.301 --> 00:31:25.210
<v Speaker 1>because you're so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch them zooming around on the</v>

600
00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:28.990
<v Speaker 1>ground and despite the fact that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a tail or ears or refer,</v>

601
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.250
<v Speaker 1>you're going to figure it out pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

602
00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 1>That that is now a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And children do the same thing with</v>

603
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 1>their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they're playing house and the</v>

604
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:38.080
<v Speaker 1>imitate their father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

605
00:31:38.081 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 1>they may to some degree to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>imitate the sound of his voice and maybe</v>

606
00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 1>even use a couple of his favorite</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases.</v>

607
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:49.950
<v Speaker 1>But basically what they're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to act like a father rather than</v>

608
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.820
<v Speaker 1>imitating their father.</v>

609
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's like imminence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metta,</v>

610
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:54.600
<v Speaker 1>imitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

611
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.541
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch you,</v>

612
00:31:55.541 --> 00:31:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I watch you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch you,</v>

613
00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I watch you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's commonalities across all of</v>

614
00:31:58.861 --> 00:32:01.590
<v Speaker 1>those instances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I extract the commonalities,</v>

615
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I embody it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I played that's what I'm</v>

616
00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:06.730
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm figuring out how to embody the</v>

617
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 1>commonalities across multiple exposures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

618
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.470
<v Speaker 1>that's you're doing that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three,</v>

619
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you're so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then even if you're asleep you're</v>

620
00:32:14.231 --> 00:32:19.231
<v Speaker 1>doing it because you're doing it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dreams and so human beings do that.</v>

621
00:32:19.241 --> 00:32:21.970
<v Speaker 1>No other animals do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're thinking about the ways</v>

622
00:32:21.971 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 1>that we're weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to put invitation way up there</v>

623
00:32:25.241 --> 00:32:27.910
<v Speaker 1>on the list because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

624
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.820
<v Speaker 1>think about death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like congenitally deaf people</v>

625
00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.670
<v Speaker 1>don't have much access to language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know say they don't learn sign</v>

626
00:32:33.671 --> 00:32:35.890
<v Speaker 1>language because that used to happen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

627
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like they can still wander around</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and in well why?</v>

628
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Well because they're so good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>imitating,</v>

629
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 1>you know they get all the non verbal</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and that's a lot.</v>

630
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

631
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:54.311
<v Speaker 1>great to all that APP which actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>enables you to imitate across space and</v>

632
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:56.540
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's for.</v>

633
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.501
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

634
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:01.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe you whip up a new action and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you write it down in words and then you</v>

635
00:33:01.101 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 1>sent it to someone and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are instructions by the way,</v>

636
00:33:04.251 --> 00:33:07.970
<v Speaker 1>cause that's what instructions are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>send out to someone and then they read</v>

637
00:33:07.971 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 1>your code for behavior and then they act</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

638
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.600
<v Speaker 1>And so language enables you to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>invitation across space and time.</v>

639
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing and language because</v>

640
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a phd anyway because sometimes we</v>
<v Speaker 1>might think that language is there to</v>

641
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:24.170
<v Speaker 1>describe the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

642
00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:26.980
<v Speaker 1>in the scientific sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Kelly kind of thinks that,</v>

643
00:33:26.981 --> 00:33:29.690
<v Speaker 1>that thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings are sort of like</v>

644
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.010
<v Speaker 1>natural scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but natural scientists are much more</v>

645
00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 1>concerned with what is then with how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

646
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.860
<v Speaker 1>So Kelly's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What human beings are more like it's</v>

647
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:43.520
<v Speaker 1>natural engineers because we're always</v>
<v Speaker 1>zooming around and trying to figure out</v>

648
00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 1>how to fiddle with things much more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are.</v>

649
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.360
<v Speaker 1>And as I mentioned to you earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pragmatist would say,</v>

650
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:54.050
<v Speaker 1>well it's an artificial distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>because things are</v>

651
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.390
<v Speaker 1>what they are when you fiddle with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in fact what they are.</v>

652
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty smart.</v>

653
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:07.950
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also says this is part of the</v>

654
00:34:07.951 --> 00:34:11.730
<v Speaker 1>constructivist notion cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructivism is a philosophical</v>

655
00:34:11.731 --> 00:34:14.490
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says no does nothing to get in the</v>

656
00:34:14.491 --> 00:34:19.170
<v Speaker 1>eye and it does not begin in the object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It begins in the interactions.</v>

657
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a reciprocal and simultaneous</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of the subject on the one</v>

658
00:34:22.831 --> 00:34:27.300
<v Speaker 1>hand and the object on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no structure apart from</v>

659
00:34:27.301 --> 00:34:29.430
<v Speaker 1>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either abstract or genetic.</v>

660
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed you some of the symbolic</v>

661
00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:36.480
<v Speaker 1>categories and a couple of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous lectures and I mentioned for</v>

662
00:34:36.481 --> 00:34:39.360
<v Speaker 1>example that one of the symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories is the great father and a</v>

663
00:34:39.361 --> 00:34:41.850
<v Speaker 1>great father kind of stamps for cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

664
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the great mother stands for</v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty and and then and,</v>

665
00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.750
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes the terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

666
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:50.370
<v Speaker 1>back to the great father.</v>

667
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:57.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a precondition in constructivism</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there has to be three things that</v>

668
00:34:57.771 --> 00:34:59.780
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They map right onto that symbolic</v>

669
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:01.700
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is culture.</v>

670
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.900
<v Speaker 1>So when you look at something or really</v>
<v Speaker 1>with any creature looks at something,</v>

671
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.640
<v Speaker 1>there's an inbuilt structure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes the creatures,</v>

672
00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:11.910
<v Speaker 1>some of which would be biological built</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

673
00:35:11.911 --> 00:35:15.260
<v Speaker 1>there's some of which would be acquired</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they must have in order to</v>

674
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:17.840
<v Speaker 1>structure their perceptions of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at.</v>

675
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.410
<v Speaker 1>So you don't come to the situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>blank.</v>

676
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

677
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 1>you have two eyes so you can have stereo</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>

678
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you have five senses in</v>

679
00:35:26.981 --> 00:35:29.630
<v Speaker 1>there at the same census and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than that.</v>

680
00:35:29.631 --> 00:35:32.180
<v Speaker 1>You have snake detection circuits for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

681
00:35:32.181 --> 00:35:35.180
<v Speaker 1>So you're sort of primed to respond to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain class of predators.</v>

682
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.240
<v Speaker 1>You like sweet tastes and sour taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really like spinner</v>

683
00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 1>tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on and so forth.</v>

684
00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Like right from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've written how landscape of</v>

685
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:50.030
<v Speaker 1>interpreter structures in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame and simplify</v>

686
00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.840
<v Speaker 1>the world that you are exposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the world itself is this sort of</v>

687
00:35:58.841 --> 00:36:01.180
<v Speaker 1>amorphous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amorphous cause it's so</v>

688
00:36:01.181 --> 00:36:03.970
<v Speaker 1>multidimensional and complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much of it.</v>

689
00:36:03.971 --> 00:36:06.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fog that contains</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

690
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.180
<v Speaker 1>And so unless you can frame that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplify it and narrow it,</v>

691
00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and interact with it at all.</v>

692
00:36:14.651 --> 00:36:15.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

693
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't deal with everything at</v>

694
00:36:16.991 --> 00:36:19.210
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard enough to deal with one little</v>

695
00:36:19.211 --> 00:36:21.190
<v Speaker 1>thing at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

696
00:36:21.191 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>this internal structure is partly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>enables you to deal with one little</v>

697
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:28.300
<v Speaker 1>thing at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so there's you and there's the,</v>

698
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.780
<v Speaker 1>the source of all information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the structure of you and the</v>

699
00:36:31.781 --> 00:36:33.380
<v Speaker 1>source of all information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

700
00:36:33.381 --> 00:36:37.060
<v Speaker 1>then there's the process that's you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process that's you,</v>

701
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:42.390
<v Speaker 1>is you using your appendages</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and your census to</v>

702
00:36:42.611 --> 00:36:46.480
<v Speaker 1>interact with things and to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest new properties.</v>

703
00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are properties that they</v>

704
00:36:48.671 --> 00:36:52.600
<v Speaker 1>might not manifest without you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very difficult for you to tell</v>

705
00:36:52.601 --> 00:36:55.630
<v Speaker 1>when you're interacting with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at a perceptual level,</v>

706
00:36:55.750 --> 00:37:00.130
<v Speaker 1>how much of what you observe wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>there if you weren't there.</v>

707
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because one of the big philosophical</v>

708
00:37:03.191 --> 00:37:04.270
<v Speaker 1>questions is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

709
00:37:04.271 --> 00:37:05.830
<v Speaker 1>what's there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're not there.</v>

710
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:10.150
<v Speaker 1>And that is a much more complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>question than you might imagine.</v>

711
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

712
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.710
<v Speaker 1>the Dallas would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

713
00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:17.170
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is so much an amalgam of</v>

714
00:37:17.171 --> 00:37:20.620
<v Speaker 1>everything at once that it might as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>be nothing at all.</v>

715
00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:23.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a way of understanding</v>

716
00:37:23.891 --> 00:37:25.450
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you took every symphony</v>

717
00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:28.230
<v Speaker 1>that was ever written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recorded,</v>

718
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.190
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you took all those recordings</v>

719
00:37:30.191 --> 00:37:33.940
<v Speaker 1>together and you laid one on top of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and you'd say,</v>

720
00:37:33.941 --> 00:37:37.960
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got like every symphony at once on</v>

721
00:37:37.961 --> 00:37:39.400
<v Speaker 1>a tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you played the tape.</v>

722
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.360
<v Speaker 1>What would it sound like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sound like white noise.</v>

723
00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:44.230
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like,</v>

724
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:52.130
<v Speaker 1>so you could say white noise is</v>
<v Speaker 1>functionally equivalent to every single</v>

725
00:37:52.131 --> 00:37:54.710
<v Speaker 1>symphony that's ever been written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every piece of music that's ever been</v>

726
00:37:54.711 --> 00:37:56.510
<v Speaker 1>written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all being played at once.</v>

727
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:58.430
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

728
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:03.050
<v Speaker 1>so when the Dallas would also say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to remember that what something</v>

729
00:38:03.051 --> 00:38:05.990
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just as dependent on what it isn't as</v>

730
00:38:05.991 --> 00:38:09.860
<v Speaker 1>it is dependent on what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a tough one,</v>

731
00:38:09.861 --> 00:38:10.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>

732
00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.760
<v Speaker 1>So the constructor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would certainly agree with that.</v>

733
00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:17.660
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruner who was a constructivist of</v>

734
00:38:17.661 --> 00:38:20.840
<v Speaker 1>sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a little twist on Piaget's idea,</v>

735
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.050
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to borrow because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it makes explaining piaget easier.</v>

736
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:26.630
<v Speaker 1>At least it makes it easier for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since I'm explaining it,</v>

737
00:38:26.631 --> 00:38:28.820
<v Speaker 1>that's that's what we're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go for it.</v>

738
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Bruner said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we seem to have no other way of</v>

739
00:38:32.301 --> 00:38:35.500
<v Speaker 1>describing live time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Save in a form of narrative.</v>

740
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason I think this is a Ph in</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructivist claim is because piaget</v>

741
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:44.860
<v Speaker 1>is concerned with knowledge as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges from action.</v>

742
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And action is clearly represented</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>

743
00:38:47.531 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the narrative is about what the</v>

744
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 1>characters are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So narrative is the way that we</v>

745
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:56.821
<v Speaker 1>represent the information about doing so</v>
<v Speaker 1>and knowledge for Piaget is about doing.</v>

746
00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So I just put the two together and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

747
00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:02.740
<v Speaker 1>There's other reasons for it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes it simpler to explain.</v>

748
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about how we</v>

749
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.070
<v Speaker 1>put a structure on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not mentioned,</v>

750
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 1>I kind of introduced you to this idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

751
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.910
<v Speaker 1>So you're headed somewhere wherever that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to be because you're an active</v>

752
00:39:15.911 --> 00:39:17.860
<v Speaker 1>organism and so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:39:17.861 --> 00:39:20.710
<v Speaker 1>even if you're don't have any immediate</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs,</v>

754
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:23.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to poke about things just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're curious.</v>

755
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.540
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that your dopaminergic</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

756
00:39:25.541 --> 00:39:27.460
<v Speaker 1>which is the system that drives</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>

757
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.750
<v Speaker 1>fires at a certain constant rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not hungry or tired or</v>

758
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:35.560
<v Speaker 1>thirsty or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if no primary needs are clamoring</v>

759
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 1>for your attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>

760
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.930
<v Speaker 1>your default comfortable status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mildly curious about everything.</v>

761
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.960
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of what makes you an</v>
<v Speaker 1>information for a jury.</v>

762
00:39:43.961 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Because when you have nothing better to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do so to speak,</v>

763
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:51.160
<v Speaker 1>you'll just poke around and see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens because you never know that no</v>

764
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.520
<v Speaker 1>itch might come in useful in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

765
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you're always going from point a to</v>
<v Speaker 1>point b because you're active and in the</v>

766
00:39:58.211 --> 00:40:02.170
<v Speaker 1>way you get from point a to point B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if point b is an abstraction</v>

767
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 1>because it often is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I am going towards a better future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's kind of a weird abstraction.</v>

769
00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.520
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

770
00:40:09.521 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 1>you can be sure that at the base it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to involve movement,</v>

771
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you get to that future,</v>

772
00:40:14.831 --> 00:40:16.570
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's movements you're going to have</v>

773
00:40:16.571 --> 00:40:18.370
<v Speaker 1>to bake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

774
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:35.320
<v Speaker 2>see</v>
<v Speaker 2>structured this</v>

775
00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:42.660
<v Speaker 2>going to go ahead to something</v>
<v Speaker 2>sick.</v>

776
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to look at this.</v>

777
00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.340
<v Speaker 1>We're do look at this diagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're gonna go back.</v>

778
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.350
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

779
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.460
<v Speaker 1>let's start with an abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical concepts.</v>

780
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you might debate forever about</v>

781
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.010
<v Speaker 1>what the good beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

782
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the sort of philosophical conundrum</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can fall into because you take</v>

783
00:41:33.271 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 1>an abstractions and then you might think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it as a property if the world,</v>

784
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.990
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that's subject to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bait,</v>

785
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what's happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of mankind.</v>

786
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.700
<v Speaker 1>But there's another way of looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually probably more accurate.</v>

787
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.150
<v Speaker 1>And I would say almost more useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the way,</v>

788
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.840
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to try to be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

789
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Phn and view,</v>

790
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:56.930
<v Speaker 1>it would be being a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a state of mind.</v>

791
00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.920
<v Speaker 1>What it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it abstraction that represents all</v>

792
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 1>first other associated abstractions.</v>

793
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Because we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

794
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:08.420
<v Speaker 1>being a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a multidimensional problems,</v>

795
00:42:08.421 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

796
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you can't just be good and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

797
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:14.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like being a good person might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>being good at.</v>

798
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Well what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well good at being a friend.</v>

799
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Good at being a lover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at being a parent,</v>

800
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.390
<v Speaker 1>good at being a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at being an employee.</v>

801
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.520
<v Speaker 1>You can know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say what good is,</v>

802
00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:30.050
<v Speaker 1>what's the same across all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And PSJ would call that a scheme just so</v>

803
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:32.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the scheme is what's the same</v>

804
00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:35.390
<v Speaker 1>across multiple different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

805
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.090
<v Speaker 1>and the scheme is the basis of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction for Psa.</v>

806
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:43.300
<v Speaker 1>So good person is the sum total or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the commonalities between being a</v>

807
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 1>good</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher,</v>

808
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.000
<v Speaker 1>student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>employee,</v>

809
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.040
<v Speaker 1>etc. Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we'll say,</v>

810
00:42:52.041 --> 00:42:53.630
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we can move the problem with</v>

811
00:42:53.631 --> 00:42:56.270
<v Speaker 1>analysis one level down and we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

812
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:58.910
<v Speaker 1>well what does it mean to be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>parent?</v>

813
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.081
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

814
00:43:00.081 --> 00:43:02.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to have a good job</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

815
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:05.570
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you and your child starved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'll forget about that one for a</v>

816
00:43:05.571 --> 00:43:07.100
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

817
00:43:07.101 --> 00:43:08.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do a good job of taking care</v>

818
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 1>of your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

819
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:15.281
<v Speaker 1>so you notice we're zeroing in on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>element of the good here and it's still</v>

820
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 1>an abstraction care for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an extraction.</v>

821
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:22.340
<v Speaker 1>So then they might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well one of the things you would do if</v>

822
00:43:22.341 --> 00:43:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you care through your family is playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the baby.</v>

823
00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:28.790
<v Speaker 1>And another might be complete a meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll take the play with the baby</v>

824
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's three things you can do</v>

825
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:33.630
<v Speaker 1>with your baby peek at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They liked that.</v>

826
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:37.220
<v Speaker 1>So optic permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say there's nothing more thrilling to a</v>

827
00:43:37.221 --> 00:43:40.340
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then discovering that you're still there</v>

828
00:43:40.341 --> 00:43:44.180
<v Speaker 1>when you disappear like a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can amuse her baby for hours with</v>

829
00:43:44.181 --> 00:43:47.030
<v Speaker 1>that discovery because it's by no means</v>
<v Speaker 1>self evident to the baby.</v>

830
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a Piagetian notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lack off object permanence.</v>

831
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.690
<v Speaker 1>So as far as they're concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hell of a shock when you</v>

832
00:43:53.691 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 1>disappear because they were just</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it and you'd be there and</v>

833
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:58.910
<v Speaker 1>then they're just a shark when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>reappear and you can,</v>

834
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.570
<v Speaker 1>it's so interesting to watch them</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when a baby gets startled,</v>

835
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.100
<v Speaker 1>like when you get started with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

836
00:44:04.101 --> 00:44:07.310
<v Speaker 1>you might go like that if you're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting a baby,</v>

837
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's whole body is starting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

838
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Like it makes a weird face and it moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>its arms and its legs and then it takes</v>

839
00:44:13.701 --> 00:44:15.890
<v Speaker 1>me like five seconds to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

840
00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:18.020
<v Speaker 1>they really have a startle reflex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

841
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:21.440
<v Speaker 1>and they'll often laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've seen the laughing babies</v>

842
00:44:21.441 --> 00:44:25.430
<v Speaker 1>on youtube because of course there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a 2 billion views of laughing</v>

843
00:44:25.431 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 1>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing.</v>

844
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:28.190
<v Speaker 1>It shows that we like babies.</v>

845
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I think there's one that's very famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a baby is reacting to his mother</v>

846
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.580
<v Speaker 1>either sneezing or coughing</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught.</v>

847
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This baby just has a fit.</v>

848
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.980
<v Speaker 1>And what's basically happening is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother costs,</v>

849
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it's coughs or sneezes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows.</v>

850
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

851
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She blows her nose.</v>

852
00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:50.460
<v Speaker 1>So she makes this weird elephant like</v>
<v Speaker 1>noise and the baby's mother could do</v>

853
00:44:50.461 --> 00:44:53.880
<v Speaker 1>this and then get surprised at its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>startle.</v>

854
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 1>And that makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really interesting phenomena</v>

855
00:44:57.661 --> 00:45:01.590
<v Speaker 1>from a Piagetian perspective because one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that Piaget noticed the</v>

856
00:45:01.591 --> 00:45:04.890
<v Speaker 1>children did because they could imitate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was imitate themselves.</v>

857
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:06.810
<v Speaker 1>That's how they got to know who they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

858
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.850
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a child would say chub would actually</v>

859
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.170
<v Speaker 1>up north that off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reading,</v>

860
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.690
<v Speaker 1>well that's a hell of a thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discover.</v>

861
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you move your arm just a little bit,</v>

862
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.240
<v Speaker 1>that will fall off.</v>

863
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:26.070
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then maybe you can do that 60 70</v>

864
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:28.260
<v Speaker 1>times while you're supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>

865
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.500
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that's really cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>about doing that as that mom,</v>

866
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Lou immediately rushed over and picked</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up and put it back.</v>

867
00:45:33.301 --> 00:45:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And this is an excellent game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can entertain yourself with that for</v>

868
00:45:37.411 --> 00:45:39.870
<v Speaker 1>like a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically what you're discovering is</v>

869
00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:42.060
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between your movements</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gravity,</v>

870
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:43.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is a major leak</v>

871
00:45:43.711 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder you're obsessed with it.</v>

872
00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.810
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

873
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 1>the point with regards to the invitation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is maybe the baby does this accidentally</v>

874
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:57.750
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That startles them and then it's put up</v>

875
00:45:57.751 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 1>again and then they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was cool.</v>

876
00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Wonder if we can do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're pretty happy with that.</v>

877
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.540
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll keep practicing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they get like expert at doing</v>

878
00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:10.020
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

879
00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.780
<v Speaker 1>So instead of using like gross body</v>
<v Speaker 1>movements to do it,</v>

880
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.230
<v Speaker 1>which is how they'd start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get developed finer and finer and</v>

881
00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:21.210
<v Speaker 1>finer body movements until they've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole narky light thing off a table</v>

882
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.120
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can even be fascinating as an</v>

883
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:24.721
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>

884
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you've probably played table hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know with the quarter,</v>

885
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.520
<v Speaker 1>you know how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put a quarter on a table.</v>

886
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make little goals.</v>

887
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job is to flip the thing so that it</v>

888
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:40.730
<v Speaker 1>just sits that far over the table and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the appointment can flip it up.</v>

889
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.380
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like your opportunity to score a</v>

890
00:46:43.381 --> 00:46:46.440
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point is playing with how things move</v>

891
00:46:46.441 --> 00:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to friction and gravity</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so engrossing to human beings that</v>

892
00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:52.140
<v Speaker 1>you can even make a game out of it if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

893
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relatively board and stupid adult.</v>

894
00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I played that game all the time with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>son by the way.</v>

895
00:46:59.131 --> 00:47:01.560
<v Speaker 1>So I put myself in that category as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

896
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Now what the child is doing is they will</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally in some ways bumble into</v>

897
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:11.630
<v Speaker 1>something interesting and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizes that it's interesting in</v>

898
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.040
<v Speaker 1>because that's a reflex action on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

899
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:17.220
<v Speaker 1>And then once it recognizes that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>had that reflex action,</v>

900
00:47:17.221 --> 00:47:20.040
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pleasurable,</v>

901
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:22.950
<v Speaker 1>is as long as it's not too intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's at least interesting.</v>

902
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll try to imitate what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just did.</v>

903
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>So part of the way you master yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is by imitating yourself after you've</v>

904
00:47:30.101 --> 00:47:31.080
<v Speaker 1>asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely do dot.</v>

905
00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:33.160
<v Speaker 1>It's something interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so smart.</v>

906
00:47:33.161 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's a phd had no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

907
00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 1>you're playing with the baby and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>play piece with the baby.</v>

908
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're teaching it that you're still</v>

909
00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:43.630
<v Speaker 1>there even though you went away and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can take all the baby,</v>

910
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:48.380
<v Speaker 1>which is best done in moderation because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly clear that babies enjoy</v>

911
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

912
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.040
<v Speaker 1>They just laugh when you do that so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like them.</v>

913
00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't throw them out the window when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're being annoying and then you can</v>

914
00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.480
<v Speaker 1>clean the baby to say tho those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of the care of a baby.</v>

915
00:47:58.481 --> 00:48:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I know that's not very sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

916
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 1>those are some of the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing that's different about</v>

917
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:08.340
<v Speaker 1>playing with baby and tickled baby is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that play with baby is an abstraction.</v>

918
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Whereas tickle baby is an action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

919
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're trying to solve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind body problem,</v>

920
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.650
<v Speaker 1>this is how you solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mind is those abstractions,</v>

921
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:19.930
<v Speaker 1>the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's the actions that those</v>

922
00:48:19.931 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 1>abstractions ground themselves in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sounded like the mind is attached</v>

923
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:26.590
<v Speaker 1>to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the mind is a sequence of</v>

924
00:48:26.591 --> 00:48:30.730
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically arranged abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom level of which are not</v>

925
00:48:30.731 --> 00:48:32.080
<v Speaker 1>abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their actions.</v>

926
00:48:32.081 --> 00:48:35.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a qualitative transformation at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the higher,</v>

927
00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.560
<v Speaker 1>the highest resolution level of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

928
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.790
<v Speaker 1>It's action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can understand piaget very,</v>

929
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:47.791
<v Speaker 1>very easily if you understand that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way a baby develops as far as piaget is,</v>

930
00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:51.970
<v Speaker 1>concern is from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the baby starts with,</v>

931
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.540
<v Speaker 1>it's laying in his crib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a useless thing.</v>

932
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 1>It's laying there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't even focus its eyes,</v>

933
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just barely getting going.</v>

934
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of floating in space trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what's going on,</v>

935
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you know and it doesn't even know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has arms really just sort of detects</v>

936
00:49:08.541 --> 00:49:13.190
<v Speaker 1>texts these things off to the side and</v>
<v Speaker 1>loft it bomb itself in the face with its</v>

937
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:17.260
<v Speaker 1>arms or scratch itself cause you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut baby's nails really short.</v>

938
00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.200
<v Speaker 1>It's otherwise they scratched themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>because their arms are just,</v>

939
00:49:20.201 --> 00:49:23.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering around randomly and the baby</v>

940
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:25.180
<v Speaker 1>sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a Piagetian perspective,</v>

941
00:49:25.181 --> 00:49:30.181
<v Speaker 1>the baby starts to learn that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn what his body is capable of doing</v>

942
00:49:30.641 --> 00:49:32.710
<v Speaker 1>and some of that it just discovers by</v>
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>

943
00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Now there's no doubt some natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological progression that's going</v>

944
00:49:37.511 --> 00:49:40.240
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the baby is learning along the past</v>

945
00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:44.320
<v Speaker 1>that babies can learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still my piaget's perspective,</v>

946
00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 1>the baby is doing quite a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring to facilitate its neurological</v>

947
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:52.030
<v Speaker 1>development and more complex animals may</v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing that in the womb,</v>

948
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:53.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying out their legs and so on,</v>

949
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.720
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they can run it as soon as they,</v>

950
00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they get up.</v>

951
00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:01.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even obvious that all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing is reflexive and automatic</v>

952
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.950
<v Speaker 1>in an animal that is more active when</v>
<v Speaker 1>exported.</v>

953
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:10.540
<v Speaker 1>So the baby is begins by basically it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of develops from the middle</v>

954
00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:13.750
<v Speaker 1>outward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the baby got when it first</v>

955
00:50:13.751 --> 00:50:16.760
<v Speaker 1>pops into the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I can't see very well,</v>

956
00:50:16.761 --> 00:50:18.670
<v Speaker 1>although it can focus on about 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>inches,</v>

957
00:50:18.671 --> 00:50:22.300
<v Speaker 1>which conveniently is about the distance</v>
<v Speaker 1>that his head is from its mother's eyes</v>

958
00:50:22.301 --> 00:50:23.170
<v Speaker 1>if it's breastfeeding.</v>

959
00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's good for social communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the mother can gaze at the baby and</v>

960
00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 1>the baby can gaze at the mother and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason they both find that</v>

961
00:50:30.801 --> 00:50:35.180
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So babies also very well wired up around</v>

962
00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:38.840
<v Speaker 1>the mouth so it can use its mouth quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot and it can use its Tom,</v>

963
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those come pre wired.</v>

964
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is kind of a frightening</v>

965
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.680
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning the baby really is</v>

966
00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 1>oral because that's all it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it could smell too,</v>

967
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:51.980
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

968
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:52.881
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

969
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:56.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's voluntary capacity for action is</v>

970
00:50:56.481 --> 00:51:00.390
<v Speaker 1>really centered around its mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll notice that babies infant are</v>

971
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 1>toddlers even love to put things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mouth.</v>

972
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 1>My son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was a kid,</v>

973
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 1>he used to go in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did feed them.</v>

974
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:10.880
<v Speaker 1>So that is the reason he goes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard and pick up acorns and stuff.</v>

975
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 1>His cheeks with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a chipmunk.</v>

976
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:14.230
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

977
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.020
<v Speaker 1>then we take them up to the bath and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to like dig all the acorns out</v>

978
00:51:18.021 --> 00:51:20.630
<v Speaker 1>of his cheeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did that for oh God.</v>

979
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Way longer than you'd expect any same</v>
<v Speaker 1>child to do it.</v>

980
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason that he would put things</v>

981
00:51:26.391 --> 00:51:29.660
<v Speaker 1>in his mouth and you think about this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that's a better</v>

982
00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:32.720
<v Speaker 1>exploratory Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then your tongue,</v>

983
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out one of your teeth.</v>

984
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Bloody thing feels like it's about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>big to your tongue.</v>

985
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.180
<v Speaker 1>As you'll notice if you ever get a two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three boom,</v>

986
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like the Grand Canyon was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>extension inside your mouth.</v>

987
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.040
<v Speaker 1>And then of course your tongue will work</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad of its own accord to</v>

988
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:54.041
<v Speaker 1>investigate every tiny little crevice in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that new hole because your brain wants</v>

989
00:51:54.141 --> 00:51:56.180
<v Speaker 1>to know what's your mouth and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>

990
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.660
<v Speaker 1>So that if there's something in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth that either should or shouldn't be</v>

991
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:01.940
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can tell it from you and B,</v>

992
00:52:01.941 --> 00:52:03.830
<v Speaker 1>it can tell whether or not it's supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be there.</v>

993
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:05.630
<v Speaker 1>It turns out to be very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

994
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Because while there's tooth decay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

995
00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 1>But you know there's also insects and</v>
<v Speaker 1>poison and all sorts of other things</v>

996
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:16.670
<v Speaker 1>that you shouldn't put in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't underestimate the degree to</v>

997
00:52:16.671 --> 00:52:20.990
<v Speaker 1>which you can zoom around the world like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a know hoover vacuum cleaner and pick up</v>

998
00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:24.500
<v Speaker 1>our god awful amount of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course you're also seemed that</v>

999
00:52:24.501 --> 00:52:27.590
<v Speaker 1>way obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

1000
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you're checking out your mother with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mouth and your tongue and a very</v>

1001
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:32.480
<v Speaker 1>meaningful way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

1002
00:52:32.481 --> 00:52:35.810
<v Speaker 1>you're feeding at the breast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're establishing the basis of social</v>

1003
00:52:35.811 --> 00:52:38.390
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this puts a bit of a warp into the</v>

1004
00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:40.160
<v Speaker 1>piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothesis,</v>

1005
00:52:40.161 --> 00:52:44.590
<v Speaker 1>because piaget sort of assumed if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby built,</v>

1006
00:52:44.591 --> 00:52:46.820
<v Speaker 1>he builds himself from the bottom up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1007
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:50.900
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand is that the baby is always</v>

1008
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 1>picking up how to behave and see in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1009
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:55.160
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very social context.</v>

1010
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Even when it's so young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That phd would regard it as primarily</v>

1011
00:52:59.001 --> 00:53:01.860
<v Speaker 1>egocentric because what the hell does a</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby knew about you?</v>

1012
00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:06.320
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the mother is teaching the child how</v>

1013
00:53:06.321 --> 00:53:08.840
<v Speaker 1>to act right from the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little tiny thing.</v>

1014
00:53:08.841 --> 00:53:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's going to breastfeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to do it in a relatively</v>

1015
00:53:11.481 --> 00:53:15.620
<v Speaker 1>civilized manner because if it bites his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother or her mother,</v>

1016
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:18.380
<v Speaker 1>which are baby can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can really chump you a good one.</v>

1017
00:53:18.381 --> 00:53:22.970
<v Speaker 1>If their minds are made up to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like unpleasant consequences are</v>

1018
00:53:22.971 --> 00:53:26.000
<v Speaker 1>going to ensue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At minimum the mother is going to start</v>

1019
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.090
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1020
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.420
<v Speaker 1>stop feeding the baby and maybe she'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the baby down or,</v>

1021
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:32.220
<v Speaker 1>or God only knows.</v>

1022
00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:37.080
<v Speaker 1>One time when my son was very young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he was about 13 months,</v>

1023
00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:41.190
<v Speaker 1>he had just learned to walk and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked up to my wife who was wearing</v>

1024
00:53:41.191 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 1>shorts and he bit her right here and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good chunk.</v>

1025
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:50.451
<v Speaker 1>He was just teasing and she reflex</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex and he like,</v>

1026
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:57.110
<v Speaker 1>he must have flown six feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's how you socialize</v>

1027
00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:02.150
<v Speaker 1>children against the sudden bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even the smallest alterations of</v>

1028
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:06.690
<v Speaker 1>their behavior take place within an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely social context.</v>

1029
00:54:06.691 --> 00:54:09.690
<v Speaker 1>So even at this level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this society is,</v>

1030
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:14.040
<v Speaker 1>is helping guide and restrict the</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of the child's motor</v>

1031
00:54:14.041 --> 00:54:18.270
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now children tend to develop,</v>

1032
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.300
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they develop gross body movements first.</v>

1033
00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:24.180
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of learn to fling their</v>
<v Speaker 1>arms.</v>

1034
00:54:24.181 --> 00:54:28.080
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you put a mobile in the crib</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your baby,</v>

1035
00:54:28.081 --> 00:54:29.520
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1036
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:32.460
<v Speaker 1>most mobiles you'll notice maybe their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

1037
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.700
<v Speaker 1>So you're a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're standing here and this is the</v>

1038
00:54:35.701 --> 00:54:40.701
<v Speaker 1>side of the fish and this is the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fish and that's what the baby is</v>

1039
00:54:41.281 --> 00:54:44.310
<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the baby is looking at lines</v>

1040
00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:47.770
<v Speaker 1>because the fish in here for the adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a stupid mobile.</v>

1041
00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:53.090
<v Speaker 1>You get that fish turned over so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby can see the fish and then you make</v>

1042
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:56.250
<v Speaker 1>them out of like black and white because</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies are very good at picking up high</v>

1043
00:54:56.251 --> 00:55:00.030
<v Speaker 1>contrast and that's a baby mobile rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a mother and mobile.</v>

1044
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:03.000
<v Speaker 1>So you got to decide whether the mobile</v>
<v Speaker 1>is for you or for your baby.</v>

1045
00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:06.390
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put the mobile above the baby and he</v>

1046
00:55:06.391 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 1>kind of want to put it within limb</v>
<v Speaker 1>length and then the baby will watch this</v>

1047
00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:11.700
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

1048
00:55:11.701 --> 00:55:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe tonight to Devin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By this,</v>

1049
00:55:13.471 --> 00:55:14.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know,</v>

1050
00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1051
00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:21.320
<v Speaker 1>and then it'll will sort of flail boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it does not very well controlled</v>

1052
00:55:22.441 --> 00:55:24.590
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it will flail an arm or leg</v>

1053
00:55:24.591 --> 00:55:27.840
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm to get lucky and it'll nail</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those fish.</v>

1054
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:33.200
<v Speaker 1>And now starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so usually that it might try that</v>

1055
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.700
<v Speaker 1>because that might have just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a neurotic baby,</v>

1056
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:38.190
<v Speaker 1>it'll cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's too much for today.</v>

1057
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:43.830
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a kind of a outgoing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory maybe,</v>

1058
00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.400
<v Speaker 1>then the next thing it's really good to</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do is to figure out how to make</v>

1059
00:55:47.401 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 1>that fish move again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it'll sit there and practice</v>

1060
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:53.060
<v Speaker 1>flailing its leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's throwing its leg at the</v>

1061
00:55:53.061 --> 00:55:55.860
<v Speaker 1>fish and if it gets lucky it will nail</v>
<v Speaker 1>it a good one.</v>

1062
00:55:55.861 --> 00:55:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And then that'll make it laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1063
00:55:57.961 --> 00:55:59.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practice doing that over a sequence</v>

1064
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:03.510
<v Speaker 1>of babies are persistent manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when my daughter was little,</v>

1065
00:56:03.511 --> 00:56:07.680
<v Speaker 1>she was about 18 months old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We bought her this little cardboard box</v>

1066
00:56:07.681 --> 00:56:10.050
<v Speaker 1>that had little cardboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney books in it,</v>

1067
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she didn't care what the Disney</v>

1068
00:56:13.471 --> 00:56:15.360
<v Speaker 1>books where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she was really interested in is</v>

1069
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 1>getting those three books out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney blocks and then trying to get the</v>

1070
00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:21.390
<v Speaker 1>back end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it turned out that was quite</v>

1071
00:56:21.391 --> 00:56:24.520
<v Speaker 1>difficult because they fit tightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was a great puzzle for her.</v>

1072
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was still getting the whole</v>

1073
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:31.051
<v Speaker 1>coordination thing going and she'd sip</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like three hours getting those</v>

1074
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 1>bother those books in that box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was like a toy for,</v>

1075
00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.720
<v Speaker 1>for a week until she figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she was on to bigger and better</v>

1076
00:56:40.721 --> 00:56:41.554
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1077
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:44.950
<v Speaker 1>But that's a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1078
00:56:44.951 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're logically,</v>

1079
00:56:46.781 --> 00:56:49.510
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like first of all,</v>

1080
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:54.430
<v Speaker 1>you've got to grip that book property</v>
<v Speaker 1>second you go to oriented precisely</v>

1081
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.420
<v Speaker 1>third as you add the additional books to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the box,</v>

1082
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.150
<v Speaker 1>the shape changes because the book's</v>
<v Speaker 1>flop over,</v>

1083
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they'll flop over diagonally.</v>

1084
00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 1>So the shape changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to figure out how to adjust</v>

1085
00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 1>that and then the book itself will open</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that will get in the way.</v>

1086
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:12.730
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to keep the book closed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know the tolerances that are</v>

1087
00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:15.340
<v Speaker 1>like an 18th of an inch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1088
00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.970
<v Speaker 1>so you want to master that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like some people don't.</v>

1089
00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I had a client once who had a very low</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid intelligence,</v>

1090
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:27.720
<v Speaker 1>probably 75 80 you would have known it</v>
<v Speaker 1>by looking at him but he couldn't find</v>

1091
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:29.494
<v Speaker 1>employment.</v>

1092
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise.</v>

1093
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.040
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no jobs in our society for</v>

1094
00:57:33.041 --> 00:57:35.940
<v Speaker 1>people who are at that end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive distribution.</v>

1095
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I got to the volunteer job at one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his job was to put paper in</v>

1096
00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:44.230
<v Speaker 1>envelopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to fold it up in three cause that's</v>

1097
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:47.050
<v Speaker 1>how you fold up a piece of paper and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to put an envelope.</v>

1098
00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 1>But that actually turns out to be hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

1099
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I probably trained him for 28 to 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours to do that.</v>

1100
00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:58.960
<v Speaker 1>And because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do it next time or you could do</v>

1101
00:57:58.961 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 1>it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just think about what you're doing</v>

1102
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.850
<v Speaker 1>is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>merely by observing the piece of paper,</v>

1103
00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:07.660
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to figure out how to make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first full and it better be damn close</v>

1104
00:58:07.661 --> 00:58:09.430
<v Speaker 1>to one third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it isn't,</v>

1105
00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:12.220
<v Speaker 1>when you make the second fold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to compound your error and</v>

1106
00:58:12.221 --> 00:58:15.330
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your chagrin than a piece of paper</v>

1107
00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:19.090
<v Speaker 1>does not fit in the envelopes because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the envelope is exactly the same size as</v>

1108
00:58:19.091 --> 00:58:19.924
<v Speaker 1>the piece of paper.</v>

1109
00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:23.680
<v Speaker 1>So if you're out by your estimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a quarter of an inch in your first</v>

1110
00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:25.870
<v Speaker 1>full of road by half inch of your second</v>
<v Speaker 1>fold,</v>

1111
00:58:25.871 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's not going in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if,</v>

1112
00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.750
<v Speaker 1>if you don't fold it completely at 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees,</v>

1113
00:58:31.751 --> 00:58:33.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the edges line up,</v>

1114
00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:36.640
<v Speaker 1>say you're out by a 16th of an inch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you do that again.</v>

1115
00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:39.160
<v Speaker 1>So now you're out by eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't fit in sideways.</v>

1116
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to mangle the envelope</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1117
00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:44.820
<v Speaker 1>to get the paper in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time you've done</v>

1118
00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:47.230
<v Speaker 1>mangling the envelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only does it look ugly,</v>

1119
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:49.810
<v Speaker 1>but he will not go through an automatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorting machine.</v>

1120
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then added to that was the problem</v>

1121
00:58:52.751 --> 00:58:56.140
<v Speaker 1>that on these pieces of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were often photograph staple</v>

1122
00:58:56.141 --> 00:58:58.150
<v Speaker 1>because he was working for a charity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

1123
00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:01.840
<v Speaker 1>but the photographs weren't always</v>
<v Speaker 1>stapled at exactly the same place on the</v>

1124
00:59:01.841 --> 00:59:02.674
<v Speaker 1>piece of paper.</v>

1125
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.710
<v Speaker 1>So then you'd have to look at the piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>of paper and he'd have to figure out</v>

1126
00:59:05.711 --> 00:59:08.620
<v Speaker 1>where the photograph is and then you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to figure out how to fold a piece</v>

1127
00:59:08.621 --> 00:59:12.070
<v Speaker 1>of paper so that he didn't bend the</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographs so that it would still fit</v>

1128
00:59:12.071 --> 00:59:14.330
<v Speaker 1>in the envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that just used to,</v>

1129
00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 1>he just sweat himself to death trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve that problem because there was</v>

1130
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:20.080
<v Speaker 1>time pressure too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1131
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.600
<v Speaker 1>and there's an added level of complexity</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of that.</v>

1132
00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll give it some sense of how</v>

1133
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple actions are aggregated into</v>

1134
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 1>increasingly complex operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the envelopes were French and</v>

1135
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 1>some of them are English because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>

1136
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And so you couldn't put a French letter</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an English envelope if the French</v>

1137
00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 1>ones had to go in a separate pile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a huge stack say of</v>

1138
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:46.760
<v Speaker 1>English letters and a huge stack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>English envelopes,</v>

1139
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:51.050
<v Speaker 1>all of which hypothetically had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>stacked so that each one on to the</v>

1140
00:59:51.051 --> 00:59:53.720
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now and then one of them would be</v>

1141
00:59:53.721 --> 00:59:54.554
<v Speaker 1>out of alignment.</v>

1142
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:57.650
<v Speaker 1>So then you had to figure out whether it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the letters that were out of the</v>

1143
00:59:57.651 --> 01:00:00.350
<v Speaker 1>alignment or the envelopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a,</v>

1144
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 1>that's a high complexity working memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that just bring him to a</v>

1145
01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 1>standstill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1146
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during typical development you develop</v>

1147
01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>those incredibly fine motor skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy early,</v>

1148
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.040
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of Nice to have your baby,</v>

1149
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>toddler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infant do something by itself,</v>

1150
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sit there with a box until it gets</v>

1151
01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>a little bored and then it'll start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what to do with the box.</v>

1152
01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the development of</v>

1153
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>its in boarding conceptual structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1154
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.310
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1155
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:37.130
<v Speaker 1>so you basically the chain these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1156
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Now the way that piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought,</v>

1157
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>well what's the motivation for doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

1158
01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>So the motivation is essentially is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1159
01:00:57.810 --> 01:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes it can be sort of random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You accidentally do something</v>

1160
01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>interesting and then try to repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you sort of develop the number of</v>

1161
01:01:05.821 --> 01:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>times that you do something accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>that results in something interesting</v>

1162
01:01:09.271 --> 01:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>starts to decline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what part on what happens to you as</v>

1163
01:01:12.811 --> 01:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>you mature is that the opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are provided for you by your body</v>

1164
01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>as you exercise and then develop it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

1165
01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.121
<v Speaker 1>continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1166
01:01:21.121 --> 01:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>start to really ramp up and develop so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can do a lot more interesting</v>

1167
01:01:24.601 --> 01:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>things with your body by the time you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>two then you can,</v>

1168
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>when you're nine months old for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can zoom around,</v>

1169
01:01:30.391 --> 01:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>which just opens up a whole universe of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to pull over and dump over and</v>

1170
01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>pull off tables and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's things lying around that you</v>

1171
01:01:38.371 --> 01:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>can write on walls with and you can pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>out cupboards and it's like,</v>

1172
01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.511
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1173
01:01:42.511 --> 01:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1174
01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>paradise for an exploratory date.</v>

1175
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1176
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>but what happens is that as the child</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts himself or herself together</v>

1177
01:01:51.811 --> 01:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>physically and develops additional</v>
<v Speaker 1>skills,</v>

1178
01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>then they can elicit additional</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of novelty from the</v>

1179
01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1180
01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1181
01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>here's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the child finally manages to get</v>

1182
01:02:05.071 --> 01:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>itself upright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a colossal,</v>

1183
01:02:08.131 --> 01:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>colossal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an amazing accomplishment.</v>

1184
01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1185
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no,</v>

1186
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>there are two legged creatures in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world except for us,</v>

1187
01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're so good at this.</v>

1188
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>You can even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that wonderful?</v>

1189
01:02:23.341 --> 01:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I learned that when I was two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1190
01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you can do these amazing things with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

1191
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but the child is like trying to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself together neurologically and it's</v>

1192
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>a hell of an operation to get this call</v>
<v Speaker 1>them of bone.</v>

1193
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like jellyfish on a bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1194
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or stack bones and you got to get the</v>

1195
01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>thing to stand up upright.</v>

1196
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>God ridiculously difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the child manages that.</v>

1197
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:48.070
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of pain and anguish</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with that,</v>

1198
01:02:48.071 --> 01:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because those little creatures,</v>

1199
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>they just fall down and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got these little short arms.</v>

1200
01:02:53.461 --> 01:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>So they're not much good at protecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves from impact.</v>

1201
01:02:56.101 --> 01:03:00.060
<v Speaker 1>They're just bouncing off the walls like</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad and the floor up and they're trying</v>

1202
01:03:00.061 --> 01:03:02.370
<v Speaker 1>to learn to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they finally get themselves up</v>

1203
01:03:02.371 --> 01:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>right and tartar along and followed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

1204
01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:07.830
<v Speaker 1>But then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the world turns into a different</v>

1205
01:03:07.831 --> 01:03:11.910
<v Speaker 1>place because all of a sudden now you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can stand up underneath the table.</v>

1206
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:14.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fun thing to do for the first</v>

1207
01:03:14.401 --> 01:03:15.690
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like lack.</v>

1208
01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:21.030
<v Speaker 1>So now your new body has taught you</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about the world that you did</v>

1209
01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what piaget would say is,</v>

1210
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the scheme worked out,</v>

1211
01:03:25.591 --> 01:03:27.210
<v Speaker 1>which is the standing up scheme.</v>

1212
01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that at works pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you're in an empty space.</v>

1213
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.270
<v Speaker 1>But if you're in a close space with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>low ceiling,</v>

1214
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the whole standing rock thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not going to produce,</v>

1215
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>produce the results intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had stand up and whack yourself</v>

1216
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's a sign that it's time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>update your representational structures.</v>

1217
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:52.950
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think of that technically</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the emergence of the normally into</v>

1218
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 1>what would have otherwise been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptually protected space.</v>

1219
01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:01.500
<v Speaker 1>PSA has this idea of acrylic ration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say your baby crawls</v>

1220
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.930
<v Speaker 1>and let's say it's a Nyquil upgraded</v>
<v Speaker 1>crawler,</v>

1221
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:10.560
<v Speaker 1>which means it's kind of an expert in</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies get pretty expert crawlers by</v>

1222
01:04:10.561 --> 01:04:12.120
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say 1213 months,</v>

1223
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 1>hey can zoom around and they know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>luck I bumped into things and you know</v>

1224
01:04:17.671 --> 01:04:20.070
<v Speaker 1>how to crawl around without hurting</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1225
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So when they crawl around only the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they want to have happen</v>

1226
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 1>half most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are cooperating at that point</v>

1227
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:33.290
<v Speaker 1>because their actions and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptions of the consequence of those</v>

1228
01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:34.920
<v Speaker 1>actions match.</v>

1229
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:39.240
<v Speaker 1>They've got no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they expect or want to have happen</v>

1230
01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>when they crawl is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That babies APP has mastered a</v>

1231
01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:47.820
<v Speaker 1>developmental stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the stage idea and that's the</v>

1232
01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>calibrated stage idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corroboration is a brilliant idea and</v>

1233
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then all of a sudden the baby learns</v>

1234
01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:55.140
<v Speaker 1>to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1235
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did advance.</v>

1236
01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:01.860
<v Speaker 1>But it's like a revolutionary advance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1237
01:05:01.861 --> 01:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>It's equivalent to a revolution in</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

1238
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.180
<v Speaker 1>which is why psg mentioned coon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1239
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm a standing creature.</v>

1240
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:13.440
<v Speaker 1>The whole crawling expertise is hardly</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth it at all.</v>

1241
01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:15.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some transfer of knowledge,</v>

1242
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>but the you new universe that's made</v>
<v Speaker 1>accessible to the baby by it's now</v>

1243
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:25.680
<v Speaker 1>daunting ability to stand forces it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionize its entire cognitive</v>

1244
01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll give you want to tell you a</v>

1245
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>very quick story because it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good one.</v>

1246
01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>So this is a good indication of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>function of dream in place.</v>

1247
01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:41.440
<v Speaker 1>So when my daughter was three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't talk very well.</v>

1248
01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she learned to speak late and we lived</v>

1249
01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:46.430
<v Speaker 1>in Boston and when she learned to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheat,</v>

1250
01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>developed a Boston accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we were completely flabbergasted</v>

1251
01:05:50.141 --> 01:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>by because we didn't have a Boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>accent and neither did any of our</v>

1252
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.470
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out there's a speech impediment</v>

1253
01:05:56.471 --> 01:05:59.590
<v Speaker 1>that sounds just like a Boston accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

1254
01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:04.690
<v Speaker 1>she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually goes away except in Boston.</v>

1255
01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1256
01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:12.370
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was three and when her brother was</v>

1257
01:06:12.371 --> 01:06:13.720
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility of</v>

1258
01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 1>sibling rivalry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1259
01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for good reason,</v>

1260
01:06:16.091 --> 01:06:17.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1261
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:20.680
<v Speaker 1>time to get rid of that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it's doing is taking a hold of mum's</v>

1262
01:06:20.681 --> 01:06:21.431
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1263
01:06:21.431 --> 01:06:26.170
<v Speaker 1>like that's a hard reality for a child</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's under three to manage because</v>

1264
01:06:26.171 --> 01:06:27.880
<v Speaker 1>they're still pretty dependent and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1265
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.850
<v Speaker 1>well why should they be liking this</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>

1266
01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:35.530
<v Speaker 1>noisy attention grabbing interloper?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we tried to,</v>

1267
01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:38.560
<v Speaker 1>we tried to teach her right from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time he came home,</v>

1268
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1269
01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:43.300
<v Speaker 1>her brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the idea where she was going to</v>

1270
01:06:43.301 --> 01:06:45.610
<v Speaker 1>lose something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was some parental attention,</v>

1271
01:06:45.611 --> 01:06:48.640
<v Speaker 1>especially from her mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was potentially going to gain</v>

1272
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:52.870
<v Speaker 1>something which was maturity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence and the possibility of a</v>

1273
01:06:52.871 --> 01:06:54.730
<v Speaker 1>new relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we couldn't tell her that.</v>

1274
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Some parents will tell their three year</v>
<v Speaker 1>olds that it's like in your three year</v>

1275
01:06:58.151 --> 01:06:58.810
<v Speaker 1>old is learning.</v>

1276
01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:01.960
<v Speaker 1>But look at you when you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're actually hearing,</v>

1277
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:04.390
<v Speaker 1>you know how dogs in cartoons here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk.</v>

1278
01:07:04.391 --> 01:07:06.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like one on one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one on a walk.</v>

1279
01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Why don't want to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how children hear you talk when</v>

1280
01:07:09.581 --> 01:07:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to them about something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like independence.</v>

1281
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Like what the hell did they know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1282
01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:17.830
<v Speaker 1>That's way up there on the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we tried to teach her to interact</v>

1283
01:07:17.831 --> 01:07:21.940
<v Speaker 1>with the baby in such a way that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>would elicit positive feedback from him</v>

1284
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>and so that they can be friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we also taught her that she</v>

1285
01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:26.620
<v Speaker 1>should take care of the baby and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives her something to do.</v>

1286
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So that worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also didn't let them tease each</v>

1287
01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:30.580
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not much.</v>

1288
01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to tease each other a bit</v>

1289
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.620
<v Speaker 1>because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>siblings often bloody hate each other</v>

1290
01:07:35.621 --> 01:07:36.910
<v Speaker 1>when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're young.</v>

1291
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that just destroys the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship for their whole life.</v>

1292
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't want that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck with your dad and brother</v>

1293
01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:44.500
<v Speaker 1>until he dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>

1294
01:07:44.501 --> 01:07:47.500
<v Speaker 1>or until you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1295
01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my daughter was taking care of this</v>

1296
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:53.410
<v Speaker 1>little guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she used to watch them on the stamps and</v>

1297
01:07:53.411 --> 01:07:56.050
<v Speaker 1>sort of shepherd him around and she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was pretty good at it.</v>

1298
01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1299
01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:03.510
<v Speaker 1>one day he started to walk and she kept</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about her baby and we told her</v>

1300
01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:04.450
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1301
01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't reading a baby anymore and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't realize that this was setting off</v>

1302
01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:12.580
<v Speaker 1>a cognitive revolution of the Piagetian</v>
<v Speaker 1>cert because of course she'd Kinda grown</v>

1303
01:08:12.581 --> 01:08:15.710
<v Speaker 1>attached to this baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like mothers and my do sometimes</v>

1304
01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>get so attached to their babies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really don't want them to stop</v>

1305
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>being babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they end up living in their house</v>

1306
01:08:20.541 --> 01:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>till they're 55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1307
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>wanting to destruction of the world.</v>

1308
01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to have that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1309
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:28.970
<v Speaker 1>but it was happening in the microwave</v>
<v Speaker 1>with her.</v>

1310
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's this baby and I spent a lot</v>

1311
01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:34.340
<v Speaker 1>of time getting used to it and figuring</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what to do with it.</v>

1312
01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not a baby anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is it?</v>

1313
01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:41.240
<v Speaker 1>So she had this amazing dream and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>ties back to the [inaudible] stuff that</v>

1314
01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I caught you guys about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the dream.</v>

1315
01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:48.200
<v Speaker 1>She dreamed that the baby crawl into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole in the backyard.</v>

1316
01:08:48.201 --> 01:08:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the whole got there was that a</v>

1317
01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:55.031
<v Speaker 1>tree from the park beside us had moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>into our backyard and then hit burned</v>

1318
01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:58.040
<v Speaker 1>down and left this hole and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole was full of water.</v>

1319
01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:01.880
<v Speaker 1>And so the baby crawl into the water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reduced them to a skeleton.</v>

1320
01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:04.490
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a bug in the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bug pulled him out.</v>

1321
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:07.700
<v Speaker 1>And when he came out he was a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>

1322
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.710
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was perfect.</v>

1323
01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Like she came and told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1324
01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:14.110
<v Speaker 1>like two in the morning in her little</v>
<v Speaker 1>three year old voice and they go into</v>

1325
01:09:14.111 --> 01:09:16.790
<v Speaker 1>all type down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was absolutely spectacular because it</v>

1326
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:19.550
<v Speaker 1>wasn't straight shamonic tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the tree burned down.</v>

1327
01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a transformation motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then water is the place of rebirth</v>

1328
01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:25.820
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid was dissolved into a skeleton</v>

1329
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.450
<v Speaker 1>and the little bug that pulled them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a representation of the</v>

1330
01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:32.120
<v Speaker 1>underlying process that guides</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

1331
01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Your own brain was working like mad and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out</v>

1332
01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:41.240
<v Speaker 1>continuity over change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough one,</v>

1333
01:09:41.241 --> 01:09:42.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's almost like a butterfly</v>

1334
01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.660
<v Speaker 1>urging from a cocoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal,</v>

1335
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.940
<v Speaker 1>baby to toddler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big difference.</v>

1336
01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's supposed to figure out,</v>

1337
01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.950
<v Speaker 1>well that's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well no it's not.</v>

1338
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.550
<v Speaker 1>So underneath her unconscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1339
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:57.980
<v Speaker 1>three year olds are not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they can't talk,</v>

1340
01:09:57.981 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 1>they've got this brain that's like 3.5</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years old.</v>

1341
01:10:01.161 --> 01:10:02.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1342
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:05.740
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1343
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:06.800
<v Speaker 1>why was I telling you that?</v>

1344
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh well then it's another indication of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1345
01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:18.860
<v Speaker 1>so the transformations of cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure are forced upon a child,</v>

1346
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.850
<v Speaker 1>at least in part by the development of</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing physical ability,</v>

1347
01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as you increase its physical</v>

1348
01:10:25.851 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 1>ability and capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the world transforms and then your</v>

1349
01:10:28.251 --> 01:10:31.130
<v Speaker 1>cognitive processes have to transform to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep up with them.</v>

1350
01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that's a radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

1351
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 1>So Piaget's fundamental hypothesis is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of the reason that people are</v>

1352
01:10:39.021 --> 01:10:42.710
<v Speaker 1>motivated to undergo cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations and learning per se is</v>

1353
01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:47.711
<v Speaker 1>because as they mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they re they automatically come into</v>

1354
01:10:47.841 --> 01:10:51.860
<v Speaker 1>contact with anomalous information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that they cannot process</v>

1355
01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.110
<v Speaker 1>from within the confines of the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>world model.</v>

1356
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:57.530
<v Speaker 1>And because they kind of process it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it interferes with them getting what</v>

1357
01:10:57.531 --> 01:10:59.780
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're motivated to keep their</v>

1358
01:10:59.781 --> 01:11:01.940
<v Speaker 1>cognitive structures updated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>

1359
01:11:01.941 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the revolutions occur at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro level and that might be like when</v>

1360
01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:09.470
<v Speaker 1>you're learning the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and this,</v>

1361
01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a major difference but it</v>

1362
01:11:12.231 --> 01:11:16.770
<v Speaker 1>doesn't disrupt the whole fabric of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual universe.</v>

1363
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

1364
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>the baby transformed me into a toddler</v>
<v Speaker 1>might.</v>

1365
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Puberty does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like you just find the gun</v>

1366
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:26.670
<v Speaker 1>used to your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 12 years old,</v>

1367
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 1>so you're sort of at the pinnacle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

1368
01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:32.550
<v Speaker 1>You're like an adult child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're doing.</v>

1369
01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.060
<v Speaker 1>And 11 and 12 year olds are often lovely</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures because they're pretty mature</v>

1370
01:11:36.061 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 1>and they've got their act together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden bang sex hormones</v>

1371
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 1>kick in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you are no longer the same</v>

1372
01:11:42.781 --> 01:11:45.630
<v Speaker 1>thing and neither is anyone you interact</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1373
01:11:45.631 --> 01:11:50.631
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like turbulence for three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five 2030 years until you sort</v>

1374
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 1>of sort that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she never really do.</v>

1375
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see how</v>

1376
01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:01.760
<v Speaker 1>the physiological transformations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are attended on development,</v>

1377
01:12:01.761 --> 01:12:05.970
<v Speaker 1>some biologically predicated and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>and emergent consequence of learning</v>

1378
01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.190
<v Speaker 1>disrupt the cognitive structures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people use to orient themselves in the</v>

1379
01:12:11.191 --> 01:12:13.650
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that some of those disruptions are</v>

1380
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:18.710
<v Speaker 1>sort of low key equivalent to normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>science now to be assimilation and some</v>

1381
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 1>of them much broader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's equivalent to accommodation.</v>

1382
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Assimilation means you learn something</v>
<v Speaker 1>new that you can already handle using</v>

1383
01:12:27.881 --> 01:12:30.600
<v Speaker 1>the constructs and scheme is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have at hand.</v>

1384
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:34.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you have to pick the thing up</v>

1385
01:12:34.411 --> 01:12:38.120
<v Speaker 1>like this instead of like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you already know this and you know</v>

1386
01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.090
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who cares?</v>

1387
01:12:39.091 --> 01:12:41.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like a little minor alteration and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

1388
01:12:41.701 --> 01:12:45.300
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to readapt your whole body in</v>

1389
01:12:45.301 --> 01:12:48.780
<v Speaker 1>order to handle the next level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex problem solving.</v>

1390
01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Learning to drive is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning to ride a bicycle is like that.</v>

1391
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:56.310
<v Speaker 1>And you can see that there's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not really normal versus</v>

1392
01:12:56.311 --> 01:13:00.550
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of a continuum that Mac</v>

1393
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:02.640
<v Speaker 1>themselves onto that hierarchy I showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1394
01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.190
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if at the very highest levels of</v>

1395
01:13:05.191 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's minor transformations,</v>

1396
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:08.880
<v Speaker 1>send up the higher levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction,</v>

1397
01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:12.060
<v Speaker 1>you can blow out whole huge chunks of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1398
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:16.080
<v Speaker 1>So it's a continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Piaget and coon sort of</v>

1399
01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:17.060
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized it hasn't.</v>

1400
01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:21.300
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

1401
01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:27.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a map of that which you can look</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1402
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1403
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

1404
01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:33.101
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1405
01:13:33.101 --> 01:13:35.720
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing I really want to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to this is,</v>

1406
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:39.950
<v Speaker 1>it's so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so psa was concerned about morality</v>

1407
01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.050
<v Speaker 1>and he's one of the few psychologists I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1408
01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:43.310
<v Speaker 1>who like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he nailed it.</v>

1409
01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:47.330
<v Speaker 1>It's this is like the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing piaget discovered and maybe it's</v>

1410
01:13:47.331 --> 01:13:50.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important things that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist has ever discovered.</v>

1411
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:53.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like how do you become moral?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1412
01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:56.060
<v Speaker 1>we've already mentioned that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquire a behavior,</v>

1413
01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:58.610
<v Speaker 1>you inevitably acquire in a social</v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

1414
01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:01.760
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that right from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time you're little and learning</v>

1415
01:14:01.761 --> 01:14:04.850
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demands of society are encoded in</v>

1416
01:14:04.851 --> 01:14:06.650
<v Speaker 1>the behaviors that you're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>

1417
01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.580
<v Speaker 1>And so science to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you behave the way you do</v>

1418
01:14:10.581 --> 01:14:11.920
<v Speaker 1>behave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're three.</v>

1419
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.280
<v Speaker 1>If you've been properly socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already act out the embodied moral</v>

1420
01:14:19.151 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 1>structure of your entire community.</v>

1421
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:23.560
<v Speaker 1>So you know when you talk about law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>

1422
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:27.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a body of laws and the body of</v>
<v Speaker 1>law is used to be the cake.</v>

1423
01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:30.730
<v Speaker 1>So you have to do with the king set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now the body of laws is an abstract</v>

1424
01:14:30.731 --> 01:14:34.390
<v Speaker 1>conceptual representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those representations are actually</v>

1425
01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:39.640
<v Speaker 1>semantic representations of allowable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not allowable behavior.</v>

1426
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:43.720
<v Speaker 1>And so by the time you're three and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a law abiding three year old,</v>

1427
01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:47.320
<v Speaker 1>which means you're well socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're already acting in accordance with</v>

1428
01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:50.020
<v Speaker 1>the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patterns that characterize your</v>

1429
01:14:50.021 --> 01:14:51.370
<v Speaker 1>beating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral patterns that</v>

1430
01:14:51.371 --> 01:14:54.400
<v Speaker 1>characterize your Ba have already been</v>
<v Speaker 1>molded into the patterns that you</v>

1431
01:14:54.401 --> 01:14:56.950
<v Speaker 1>manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means in some sense is</v>

1432
01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:58.450
<v Speaker 1>you're already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Nietzsche would say,</v>

1433
01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 1>an unconscious advocate of your culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're acting it out.</v>

1434
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Now here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of how that can be</v>

1435
01:15:05.741 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 1>transformed into actual moral knowledge.</v>

1436
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.700
<v Speaker 1>So he has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes to the studies kids playing a</v>

1437
01:15:09.701 --> 01:15:12.040
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

1438
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:14.530
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of kids and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing around in the playground and</v>

1439
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:17.350
<v Speaker 1>they're all playing helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they've just got sticks and</v>

1440
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:18.940
<v Speaker 1>they're always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1441
01:15:18.941 --> 01:15:21.610
<v Speaker 1>when they're flying in helicopters</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and they're all doing this and</v>

1442
01:15:21.611 --> 01:15:25.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're diving in each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's happened is each kid wants to</v>

1443
01:15:25.181 --> 01:15:28.540
<v Speaker 1>have a helicopter and each kid wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a good helicopter pilot.</v>

1444
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:32.260
<v Speaker 1>But each kid wants to be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter pilot in the way that other</v>

1445
01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:33.340
<v Speaker 1>kids appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1446
01:15:33.341 --> 01:15:37.080
<v Speaker 1>they're being good helicopter pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tough phase.</v>

1447
01:15:37.081 --> 01:15:39.940
<v Speaker 1>So not only do you have to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to coordinate your behavior,</v>

1448
01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out how to coordinate</v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior with other people,</v>

1449
01:15:43.121 --> 01:15:47.170
<v Speaker 1>coordinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinating their behavior in such a</v>

1450
01:15:47.171 --> 01:15:51.100
<v Speaker 1>way that the shared activity not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not come to a stop,</v>

1451
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but precedes an enjoyable way.</v>

1452
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really tough.</v>

1453
01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Now if your kid can play well with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

1454
01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what they've managed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1455
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:02.560
<v Speaker 1>so you've got four kids doing this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's rules.</v>

1456
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Actually there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's rituals that the children are</v>

1457
01:16:05.471 --> 01:16:07.120
<v Speaker 1>embodying that they've agreed upon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1458
01:16:07.121 --> 01:16:11.200
<v Speaker 1>they set up the game and they've just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of bash the ideas up against each</v>

1459
01:16:11.201 --> 01:16:14.260
<v Speaker 1>other and they came up with a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that because the game</v>

1460
01:16:14.261 --> 01:16:16.450
<v Speaker 1>is continuing and everyone is having</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>

1461
01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is everyone playing nice?</v>

1462
01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an equivalent rated place state.</v>

1463
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:24.040
<v Speaker 1>And it's a moral organization because</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the children are participating</v>

1464
01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:27.490
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily towards a shared end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as for piaget,</v>

1465
01:16:27.491 --> 01:16:29.500
<v Speaker 1>that was the model of a functional</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1466
01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:33.940
<v Speaker 1>That's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now imagine that a kid comes along</v>

1467
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:37.120
<v Speaker 1>and maybe he's a popular kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he has a reasonable chance of getting</v>

1468
01:16:37.121 --> 01:16:38.230
<v Speaker 1>into this playgroup.</v>

1469
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:40.870
<v Speaker 1>You'll still be robust like 50% of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1470
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if he's not blocking her kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like forget,</v>

1471
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.180
<v Speaker 1>they're just not going to let him into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little helicopters circle.</v>

1472
01:16:46.181 --> 01:16:50.410
<v Speaker 1>And there's probably because he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>developmentally delayed or an in some</v>

1473
01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:53.260
<v Speaker 1>other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't understand how we asked to</v>

1474
01:16:53.261 --> 01:16:56.620
<v Speaker 1>configure his behavior so that he can</v>
<v Speaker 1>enter this complex,</v>

1475
01:16:56.621 --> 01:16:59.950
<v Speaker 1>dramatic scene without disrupting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe he's one of those kids who</v>

1476
01:16:59.951 --> 01:17:01.690
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to bring helicopter,</v>

1477
01:17:01.691 --> 01:17:03.250
<v Speaker 1>we should play something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1478
01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:09.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a creative genius.</v>

1479
01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:12.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the popular kids do,</v>

1480
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:16.070
<v Speaker 1>if they sort of side loft to the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they find a stick cause they watch</v>

1481
01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:18.410
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they find a stick and they sort of</v>

1482
01:17:18.411 --> 01:17:22.820
<v Speaker 1>started going cause this is sick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of looking at to see if</v>

1483
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:27.140
<v Speaker 1>that stick helicopter behavior is</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable to the peers.</v>

1484
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:28.183
<v Speaker 1>And maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1485
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:31.130
<v Speaker 1>one of the friends sort of notices that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're playing helicopters and they</v>

1486
01:17:31.131 --> 01:17:34.310
<v Speaker 1>open up the circle of Maca and gets to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in and play helicopters.</v>

1487
01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.560
<v Speaker 1>But he might fail it out even if he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>

1488
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Because once in the little play thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

1489
01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like a plague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1490
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>It's got a dramatic structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just come in there and you</v>

1491
01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start playing basketball or something.</v>

1492
01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:50.500
<v Speaker 1>So now what Piaget noticed was that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>children were playing your game,</v>

1493
01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:54.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe they were playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barbara's not so rough game and you</v>

1494
01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:56.270
<v Speaker 1>because you can win and lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marvelous.</v>

1495
01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:57.801
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1496
01:17:57.801 --> 01:17:59.510
<v Speaker 1>children shouldn't play competitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

1497
01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:02.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a sure sign that you don't know</v>

1498
01:18:02.301 --> 01:18:06.020
<v Speaker 1>what the hell you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all games are competitive and</v>

1499
01:18:06.021 --> 01:18:10.340
<v Speaker 1>cooperative at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they share a single goal and it's</v>

1500
01:18:10.341 --> 01:18:12.200
<v Speaker 1>really not a game unless there's a goal.</v>

1501
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause goal games have goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what the children do is they,</v>

1502
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:18.890
<v Speaker 1>they organize themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they all decide what constitutes an</v>

1503
01:18:18.891 --> 01:18:21.860
<v Speaker 1>acceptable goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the goal with marvel says when some</v>

1504
01:18:21.861 --> 01:18:24.660
<v Speaker 1>marbles and lose the marbles without</v>
<v Speaker 1>whining about it,</v>

1505
01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.170
<v Speaker 1>that's another goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an important thing to learn.</v>

1506
01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.940
<v Speaker 1>So the children say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1507
01:18:28.941 --> 01:18:31.790
<v Speaker 1>here's the foundation of our local moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

1508
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Here's the rules that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>abide.</v>

1509
01:18:33.951 --> 01:18:35.630
<v Speaker 1>By and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are ritualistic.</v>

1510
01:18:35.631 --> 01:18:37.070
<v Speaker 1>They might've learned them from other</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

1511
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:40.490
<v Speaker 1>So they play marbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You extract out a kid and you say,</v>

1512
01:18:40.491 --> 01:18:43.220
<v Speaker 1>what are the rules for marbles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it gets like seven,</v>

1513
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:45.500
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't tell you.</v>

1514
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 1>But if you put them in with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other seven year olds,</v>

1515
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:51.500
<v Speaker 1>they can play marbles perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is the morality is</v>

1516
01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:54.680
<v Speaker 1>coated in their behavior or in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior of the group,</v>

1517
01:18:54.681 --> 01:18:56.090
<v Speaker 1>like a bunch of feeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1518
01:18:56.091 --> 01:18:58.970
<v Speaker 1>cause there's knowledge in a hive of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bees or making it a school of fish.</v>

1519
01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:04.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's embedded in the child's behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in their patterns of action across</v>

1520
01:19:04.251 --> 01:19:06.560
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you pull them out,</v>

1521
01:19:06.561 --> 01:19:09.080
<v Speaker 1>they can only give like a partial of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>counter,</v>

1522
01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:10.970
<v Speaker 1>but they're not conscious of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>

1523
01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:13.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like it pulled a war fighter of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolf pack and say,</v>

1524
01:19:13.161 --> 01:19:16.280
<v Speaker 1>well you know what's up with the wolf</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack and the wall,</v>

1525
01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bites you because that's just,</v>

1526
01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.840
<v Speaker 1>that's how it answers questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to tell you about the</v>

1527
01:19:20.841 --> 01:19:23.270
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only later in development that the</v>

1528
01:19:23.271 --> 01:19:27.110
<v Speaker 1>children become conscious of the rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they become very irritated that</v>

1529
01:19:27.111 --> 01:19:29.900
<v Speaker 1>people break them and they don't much</v>
<v Speaker 1>later do.</v>

1530
01:19:29.901 --> 01:19:34.901
<v Speaker 1>They start to understand that the rules</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be adjusted by mutual agreement and</v>

1531
01:19:35.241 --> 01:19:38.990
<v Speaker 1>that is associated with the Phn and</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of higher order of morality.</v>

1532
01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:41.690
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn your actions,</v>

1533
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:44.360
<v Speaker 1>your actions are conditioned by other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1534
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:48.410
<v Speaker 1>The actions are integrated into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary game.</v>

1535
01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:52.370
<v Speaker 1>Then the actions are integrated into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>series of voluntary games.</v>

1536
01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:55.520
<v Speaker 1>That social interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you learn the descriptions.</v>

1537
01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Then you learn how to manipulate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptions.</v>

1538
01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving up the hierarchy,</v>

1539
01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:03.940
<v Speaker 1>snatch a Piagetian theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a nutshell constructed,</v>

1540
01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.890
<v Speaker 1>this is a nutshell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you on Thursday.</v>
