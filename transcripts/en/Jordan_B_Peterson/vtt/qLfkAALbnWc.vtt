Hi everyone.
I'm in Manhattan today talking to my publishers,

2
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.280
Penguin Random House about my next book,

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.450
but I thought I'd take this opportunity to make an announcement that you might

4
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:17.451
find of interest as some of you may know and the rest of you are learning.

5
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.500
Now I'm debating Marxist philosopher,
Slavoj Jijak in Toronto,

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.260
April 19th at the Sony Center.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.100
Doctors Jijak is a Slovenian philosopher and professor at the Institute for

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.730
Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Louisiana who's works on cultural

9
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:36.480
studies,

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.310
psychoanalysis and above all for the purposes of our debate,

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.890
Marxism are world renowned,

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.070
the topic happiness,

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.830
Marxism versus capitalism.

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.400
The live tickets have already sold out.

15
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.460
We've decided in consequence to experiment with live streaming.
The discussion,

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.770
I'm still going to post the video recording on Youtube and the audio on podcast

17
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.820
in mid May in the same manner as usual.
However,

18
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:12.510
my team has discussed the possibility that people might be interested in

19
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:15.390
participating online live.

20
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.010
Maybe there's something attractive and worthwhile about being there when it

21
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.550
happens,
even electronically the same way.

22
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:27.750
There's something positive about viewing in Olympic sports event when it
happens,

23
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.590
even though you could more conveniently watch it at a different time,

24
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.080
maybe it has something to do with the sense of a shared public collective

25
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.140
experience.
In any case,

26
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:44.700
we're offering everyone this opportunity as an experiment and an investigation.

27
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
Who knows?
Maybe some of you want to organize this Dziedzic party.

28
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.480
You can subscribe to the live stream at Peterson versus Jijak Com.

29
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.930
That's Peterson versus dziedzic.com it comes at a cost 1495 this enables us to

30
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:08.031
produce it professionally and to ensure we hope that the broadcast is of high

31
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:13.230
quality and reliability as well as to produce whatever profit might ensue.

32
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.240
Dr [inaudible],
by the way,

33
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:18.630
has announced his intention to donate his share to charity.

34
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.030
We hope you find this livestream opportunity and the debate itself of interest.

35
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.100
I might also remind you that I'm speaking in New York on 12 rules for life on

36
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:37.101
April 17th at the beacon theater and then on May 8th in London at the Apollo.

37
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.800
