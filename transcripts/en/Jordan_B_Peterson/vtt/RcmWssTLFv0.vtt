1
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.190
<v Speaker 1>We're going to review a proposition now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I ever tell you something in enough</v>

2
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>detail that you've already heard that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you've heard it enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please tell me because I can't.</v>

4
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't precisely remember what I told</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

5
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>I know the line of the narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the entire course and we will</v>

6
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>return to some things fairly frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to tell you the same</v>

7
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>story three times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>particularly compelled by that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me know.</v>

10
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start with the proposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the proposition is that in order to</v>

11
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>orient yourself properly in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two classes of information that</v>

12
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to have access to and one class</v>
<v Speaker 1>of information is information about the</v>

13
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:58.061
<v Speaker 1>nature of the object of world and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>object of world is described in a manner</v>

14
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>or the world when it's treated</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively.</v>

15
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Is it described in a manner that strips</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the subjectivity from it?</v>

16
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the technology that the</v>

17
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>philosophical technology that's behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific revolution involve</v>

18
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:19.251
<v Speaker 1>stripping the subjectivity from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the sense mediated consequences of</v>

19
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

20
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Because when you lay on an experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not just talking about what</v>

21
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about what you did and</v>

22
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:30.350
<v Speaker 1>then what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're supposed to be able to do it</v>

23
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>in a way that ensures that if someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else followed exactly the same</v>

24
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would obviously observe the same</v>

25
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>consequences and in some sense we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to establish a realm of knowledge</v>

26
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>that is universally applicable to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite their individual differences.</v>

27
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that works.</v>

28
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it works in a Darwinian</v>

29
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still have to determine because it</v>

30
00:01:56.001 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>could easily be that our development of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method is what will make</v>

31
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>us go extinct and which and under which</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances you might consider it to</v>

32
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>have been an error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter at the</v>

33
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>moment because so far so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>

34
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know,</v>

35
00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:18.890
<v Speaker 1>people think that the world is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective place because we can describe</v>

36
00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:20.690
<v Speaker 1>it objectively and not so much more</v>

37
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>debatable presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly debatable because it's</v>

38
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>actually based on a decision in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense rather than evidence.</v>

39
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Partly because your knowledge is finite</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every direction in some sense.</v>

40
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 1>So what that means in a way is that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what you know about anything,</v>

41
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't know everything about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

42
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 1>And so you kind of ground out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance at some point.</v>

43
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buttress your thinking with a set of</v>

44
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.870
<v Speaker 1>assumptions that you don't question or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just ended up in an infinite</v>

45
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>regress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of those sets of assumptions is</v>

46
00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:02.621
<v Speaker 1>usually reality sets of assumptions or</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth definitions,</v>

47
00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>sets of assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is generally,</v>

48
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>no matter what your theory of reality is</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what your theory of truth is,</v>

49
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>there are alternative theories of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and alternative theories of</v>

50
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>truth that are equally rigorous and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have different domains of application.</v>

51
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very tricky business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

52
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.223
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.000
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a reductionist,</v>

54
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.390
<v Speaker 1>materialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make the presupposition</v>

55
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>that a brain physiology is more real</v>
<v Speaker 1>than emotional experience.</v>

56
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.630
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that's in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't get access to anyone</v>

57
00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:46.940
<v Speaker 1>else's emotional experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least not directly.</v>

58
00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you can get universal access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental details of someone's</v>

59
00:03:51.111 --> 00:03:53.690
<v Speaker 1>brain physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that anyways.</v>

60
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Now that still an arbitrary assumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously the person and you as</v>

61
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:02.930
<v Speaker 1>well are going to be acting all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if your emotions and your motivation,</v>

62
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.890
<v Speaker 1>motivational states are real and so then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run into a problem and the problem</v>

63
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:07.580
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Speaker 1>how do you know what someone actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>believes?</v>

65
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you listen to what they say or or do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take into account their explicit and</v>

66
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:17.960
<v Speaker 1>well articulated theories or do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch how they act?</v>

67
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.370
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is</v>

68
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>you take your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make your choice,</v>

69
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>and generally there are reasons for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

70
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

71
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the conceptual tools that I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>found helpful in my attempts to avoid</v>

72
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>confusion when dealing with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are very many ways of looking</v>

73
00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:43.741
<v Speaker 1>at the world is to start thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories of reality as tools rather than</v>

74
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>as descriptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I find that extraordinarily useful</v>

75
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 1>as a metaphor because you know you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a toolbox full of tools,</v>

76
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>you don't necessarily try to reduce the</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility of one tool to another and you</v>

77
00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>don't actually complain because all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tools aren't the same.</v>

78
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ranch isn't a very good hammer,</v>

79
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean you can criticize</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on that grounds.</v>

80
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.120
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not want to use it as a</v>

81
00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you could I suppose,</v>

82
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's not justifiable criticism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks to me,</v>

83
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>and this is something a psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>named George Kelly pointed out as well,</v>

84
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>although I think it's also an element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic philosophy,</v>

85
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>is that I'm</v>

86
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.450
<v Speaker 1>one set of tools for one thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>another set of tools for another thing</v>

87
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's helpful.</v>

88
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

89
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.440
<v Speaker 1>you are also thinking about the sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that you like solve with</v>

90
00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:40.490
<v Speaker 1>different forms of tools and one problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what are things made of in an</v>

91
00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:41.870
<v Speaker 1>objective sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

92
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.550
<v Speaker 1>And then another problem might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is the landscape of</v>

93
00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:48.950
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's more of a phenomenological</v>

94
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.840
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem the phenomenologists</v>

95
00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:53.810
<v Speaker 1>set out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other problem might be how</v>

96
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.140
<v Speaker 1>do you and should you conduct yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it could easily be that you can't</v>

97
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>use the same tool to solve all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

98
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's particularly true</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically when you're dealing with</v>

99
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>science because science by its very</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

100
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>refuses to answer questions about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that you should do apart from some</v>

101
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.250
<v Speaker 1>implicit assumption that you should do</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

102
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>which is actually not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 1>that's actually not a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption by the way,</v>

104
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 1>because it's a moral assumption.</v>

105
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>And the moral assumption is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct yourself in a scientific manner,</v>

106
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>things would be better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Because why would you run around doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>science to make things worse?</v>

108
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Although you absolutely you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely can.</v>

109
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we perhaps we are,</v>

110
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

111
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if we aren't,</v>

112
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.440
<v Speaker 1>we still might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

113
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>so what's one of the things that I find</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite interesting about the scientific</v>

114
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 1>endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something you observed,</v>

115
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 1>was that it has to be nested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something outside of itself to give it</v>

116
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>its motive force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be nested in a system of moral</v>

117
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:59.900
<v Speaker 1>assumptions and the fundamental moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption is the world will be a better</v>

118
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 1>place if we conduct ourselves along</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific lines because otherwise why</v>

119
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 1>do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a statement that cannot be</v>

120
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>analyzed from within the confines of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific worldview because it doesn't</v>

121
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>analyze those sorts of questions.</v>

122
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say they're not real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a stupid answer because I</v>

123
00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:17.024
<v Speaker 1>think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

124
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a cop out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not a stupid answer,</v>

125
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 1>probably yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least it's a cop out because you,</v>

126
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 1>if you don't take that question</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

127
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 1>you can't really justify engaging in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity and so you can refuse to answer</v>

128
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're basically answering it by</v>

129
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 1>engaging in the activity anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if you're not saying it,</v>

130
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>you're still justifying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

131
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm assuming that you can draw</v>

132
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 1>conclusions from people's actions like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can from their statements and it's</v>

133
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>hard really to dispute that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you're wise.</v>

134
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you derive conclusions from</v>

135
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>their actions then from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>statements.</v>

136
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

137
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:56.030
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the under belly of the first</v>

138
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.500
<v Speaker 1>proposition and the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of that is something</v>

139
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:05.501
<v Speaker 1>like the means by which information is</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted that is relevant to the</v>

140
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 1>domain of behavior is not the same means</v>
<v Speaker 1>by which it's transmitted by which</v>

141
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>scientific information is transmitted</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we kind of know that too,</v>

142
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any real debate I believe</v>

143
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>because how old do you think science is</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a technical endeavor?</v>

144
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 1>What would you estimate?</v>

145
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

146
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe thousands of years if you're</v>

147
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:34.820
<v Speaker 1>willing to give it the Greeks some</v>
<v Speaker 1>credit,</v>

148
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.200
<v Speaker 1>but really probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably hundreds because I ever</v>

149
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle wasn't a scientist,</v>

150
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 1>like he wasn't a bad observer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly wasn't empirical</v>

151
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 1>observer and no one got science</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightened out.</v>

152
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Dylan's probably what Newton Descartes</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bacon and you know,</v>

153
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a handful of other characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were,</v>

154
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.470
<v Speaker 1>who were thinking around those that</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time and they sort of,</v>

155
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>establish the proper methods really.</v>

156
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>And also the philosophy that underlies</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very old,</v>

157
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>600 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>500 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

159
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>that's really nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the blink of an eye.</v>

160
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 1>It's yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that,</v>

161
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:11.300
<v Speaker 1>it might even be like an hour ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

162
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously people were transmitting</v>

163
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:20.931
<v Speaker 1>information about how to act to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other for untold millennia before that</v>

164
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you're willing to</v>

165
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.490
<v Speaker 1>consider transmission of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even Octopi can imitate,</v>

166
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're the smartest</v>

167
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>invertebrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're quite bright.</v>

168
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not exactly sure how smart.</v>

169
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 1>They only live a couple of years so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't really get things going,</v>

170
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can problem solve.</v>

171
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 1>They can pull carts out of bottles to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get like a crab in a bottle.</v>

172
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>And then if they watch an octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an octopus watches another octopus,</v>

173
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 1>pull the cork out of a bottle to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasty crab,</v>

174
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 1>then that octopus now knows how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

175
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.060
<v Speaker 1>So which is pretty impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can kind of see why occupied</v>

176
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>might be able to do that because not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only do they have a brain,</v>

177
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>but they have little technically</v>
<v Speaker 1>appendages which allow them to</v>

178
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 1>manipulate things.</v>

179
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the pre cursors to being</v>

180
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:12.270
<v Speaker 1>able to be intelligent in any active way</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you have to have tentatively</v>

181
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.180
<v Speaker 1>appendages so that you can manipulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

182
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at least for it to be anything</v>

183
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:19.920
<v Speaker 1>resembling what we would consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

184
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins really art as intelligent as</v>

185
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 1>people like to think because what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>they going to do?</v>

186
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 1>You can't build cities with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>flippers,</v>

187
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are kind of trapped in their test,</v>

188
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.940
<v Speaker 1>two bodies and the same thing applies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>whale.</v>

189
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 1>So obviously they have very large brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're very social and they can</v>

190
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 1>learn and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever their intelligence is,</v>

191
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:42.590
<v Speaker 1>it's not like our intelligence because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we run around tearing things apart and</v>

192
00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>putting them back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got the body for that.</v>

193
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

194
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long before we were practicing science,</v>

195
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 1>we were doing perfectly well in a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any real knowledge of the</v>

196
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 1>objective world at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least not in scientific knowledge</v>

197
00:10:57.481 --> 00:10:59.850
<v Speaker 1>of the objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so another thing that you might</v>

198
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:04.200
<v Speaker 1>observe about that is that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive perfectly well without knowing</v>

199
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>any science at all or in an articulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and developed manner.</v>

200
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Of course animals are in that category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that also I think in some sense</v>

201
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.330
<v Speaker 1>undermines the claim of science to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything approaching a universal truth</v>

202
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 1>because obviously life can get along</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well without it now.</v>

203
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It depends to some degree on whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Darwinian or a Newtonian</v>

204
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.460
<v Speaker 3>comments on what people should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This more feature of modern science than</v>

205
00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:42.000
<v Speaker 3>it is a science in general because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking like someone like,</v>

206
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

207
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if it's his maxim,</v>

208
00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:54.611
<v Speaker 3>is that basically it's wrong always for</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone everywhere to believe anything on</v>

209
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 3>his evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he sort of says that he's a</v>

210
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:00.840
<v Speaker 3>mathematician who tries to prove it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

211
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 3>on a moral basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it's still not scientific</v>

212
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 3>because that kind of claim can't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>be signed.</v>

213
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

214
00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:13.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously the people who began</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific revolution thought of it</v>

215
00:12:13.821 --> 00:12:15.590
<v Speaker 1>as part of a moral movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

216
00:12:15.591 --> 00:12:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was part of the enlightenment that</v>

217
00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:21.590
<v Speaker 1>was part of bringing clarity to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizations of the world and that</v>

218
00:12:21.591 --> 00:12:24.720
<v Speaker 1>was supposed to be a positive thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

219
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.250
<v Speaker 1>the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only issue is,</v>

220
00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:30.050
<v Speaker 1>is that claim seems to be outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim of science in some sense.</v>

221
00:12:30.051 --> 00:12:33.170
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the picture with regards to the</v>

222
00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:33.831
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

223
00:12:33.831 --> 00:12:35.990
<v Speaker 1>so now the next step might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

224
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:41.290
<v Speaker 1>if you need or can utilize or there</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists information that is not strictly</v>

225
00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.590
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one might be,</v>

226
00:12:48.591 --> 00:12:50.510
<v Speaker 1>well where did that information come</v>
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>

227
00:12:50.511 --> 00:12:53.300
<v Speaker 1>That that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it transmitted?</v>

228
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.020
<v Speaker 1>That's another one and the worst of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is of course is how might it be</v>

229
00:12:57.021 --> 00:12:58.570
<v Speaker 1>verified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.580
<v Speaker 1>because one of the issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that scientists have</v>

231
00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:06.581
<v Speaker 1>really got down and it's a major deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they can lay forth at theory of</v>

232
00:13:06.621 --> 00:13:09.410
<v Speaker 1>truth and then they can operate within</v>
<v Speaker 1>that theory of truth and pretty much</v>

233
00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:11.990
<v Speaker 1>everybody can agree on what it is now.</v>

234
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And the more well established the</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

235
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.750
<v Speaker 1>the more that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like people don't really doubt</v>

236
00:13:17.751 --> 00:13:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Einstein's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People already don't doubt quantum</v>

237
00:13:20.181 --> 00:13:23.480
<v Speaker 1>theory anymore and you guys don't doubt</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because there you are using your</v>

238
00:13:23.481 --> 00:13:26.750
<v Speaker 1>computers and you wouldn't be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use your computers if quantum theory</v>

239
00:13:26.751 --> 00:13:28.670
<v Speaker 1>wasn't right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know it's right.</v>

240
00:13:28.671 --> 00:13:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Certainly right enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even more impressively than not,</v>

241
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.400
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever someone has tried to prove it</v>

242
00:13:34.401 --> 00:13:38.870
<v Speaker 1>wrong in any possible way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's more most bizarre</v>

243
00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:42.650
<v Speaker 1>predictions over the last hundred and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some years,</v>

244
00:13:42.651 --> 00:13:44.840
<v Speaker 1>it's passed every test with flying</v>
<v Speaker 1>colors.</v>

245
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.890
<v Speaker 1>So you know you can make pretty damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid truth claims from within the</v>

246
00:13:48.891 --> 00:13:52.340
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is it's a lot harder to</v>

247
00:13:52.341 --> 00:13:56.990
<v Speaker 1>do that from within a moral perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's all sorts of reasons for</v>

248
00:13:56.991 --> 00:14:01.610
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one reason might be that there is a</v>

249
00:14:01.611 --> 00:14:06.611
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of situational complexity</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to every moral question that you</v>

250
00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:07.820
<v Speaker 1>can't reduce.</v>

251
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.430
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're a clinical</v>

252
00:14:10.431 --> 00:14:13.910
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and you're listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in this situation and you're</v>

253
00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:16.730
<v Speaker 1>listening to two people who know each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other very well.</v>

254
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a husband and wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

255
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.940
<v Speaker 1>discuss their last argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

256
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

257
00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:28.490
<v Speaker 1>well let's get to the bottom of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out what this argument is</v>

258
00:14:28.491 --> 00:14:30.840
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think if you were</v>

259
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.670
<v Speaker 1>scientifically inclined that it is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact about something,</v>

260
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.830
<v Speaker 1>which means that if you investigated</v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough you can actually figure out</v>

261
00:14:39.831 --> 00:14:42.830
<v Speaker 1>what the facts are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I actually don't believe that's</v>

262
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:45.890
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I don't believe it's true</v>

263
00:14:45.891 --> 00:14:47.420
<v Speaker 1>is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine,</v>

264
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.030
<v Speaker 1>imagine you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this old joke about these two</v>

265
00:14:50.031 --> 00:14:50.960
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>

266
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 1>they're like 85 years old and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on a park bench feeding the</v>

267
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:59.711
<v Speaker 1>pigeons and one friend says to the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>64 and the other guy cracks up and</v>

268
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 1>laughs like mad about that.</v>

269
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And then the other guy says 83 and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other guy cracks up and laughed like mad</v>

270
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:08.090
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somebody watching them and wondering</v>

271
00:15:08.091 --> 00:15:11.660
<v Speaker 1>what in the world is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the person comes over and says to</v>

272
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:12.590
<v Speaker 1>these old guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

273
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:13.760
<v Speaker 1>what's the scope here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

274
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 1>all you're doing there is sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying memories to each other.</v>

275
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And then you're laughing uproariously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

276
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't get it.</v>

277
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.291
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

278
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 1>we've known each other for so long that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've heard each other's jokes at least</v>

279
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 1>100 times and so we have them completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorized.</v>

280
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:32.590
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of years ago we decided we</v>
<v Speaker 1>just numbered the damn things and it</v>

281
00:15:32.591 --> 00:15:34.440
<v Speaker 1>would take a lot less time to tell them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

282
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.880
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could laugh more of that.</v>

283
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

284
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:40.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's an interesting little joke,</v>

285
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it shed some light on the nature</v>

286
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:45.860
<v Speaker 1>of deep relationships and if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep relationship with them,</v>

287
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 1>with someone while here's how you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

288
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're trying to analyze an</v>
<v Speaker 1>essay.</v>

289
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Now I've actually built an essay writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>module which is on my site to 30</v>

290
00:15:57.951 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

291
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember which template it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you in a while,</v>

292
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:07.190
<v Speaker 1>it's based on this theory of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

293
00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:09.350
<v Speaker 1>and you should use it to write your</v>
<v Speaker 1>essay because if you do,</v>

294
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:11.740
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a way better essay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the,</v>

295
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 1>here's the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're reading an essay,</v>

296
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:19.210
<v Speaker 1>where is the meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a hard one because first of</v>

297
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:22.210
<v Speaker 1>all it might be in many places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

298
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.130
<v Speaker 1>So the question might be badly</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated in some sense because it</v>

299
00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:26.480
<v Speaker 1>might be at many places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let,</v>

300
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

301
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 1>let's think it through logically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you need the letters if it's an</v>

302
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:32.810
<v Speaker 1>alphabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's written in alphabetic script and</v>

303
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:36.230
<v Speaker 1>so obviously some of the meeting is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the letters and then the letters are</v>

304
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 1>combined in certain particular ways and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives you some words and then the</v>

305
00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 1>words are combined in some particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways and that gives you phrases and the</v>

306
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:46.280
<v Speaker 1>phrases are joined together in sentences</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the sentences are strung</v>

307
00:16:46.281 --> 00:16:49.280
<v Speaker 1>together in some reasonably coherent</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

308
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.090
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of go from start to end in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a paragraph and then the paragraphs are</v>

309
00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:57.470
<v Speaker 1>strung together in a coherent manner to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make up the totality of the essay.</v>

310
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.980
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the things I've noticed</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I've been trying to figure out how</v>

311
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 1>to grade essays and how to assess them</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can do a good or a bad job</v>

312
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:09.170
<v Speaker 1>at any one of those levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a really bad essay.</v>

313
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>It's full of spelling mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

314
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.220
<v Speaker 1>The words are inappropriate because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person doesn't actually understand them,</v>

315
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:19.040
<v Speaker 1>so they're awkwardly used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phrases are put together in a</v>

316
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:22.130
<v Speaker 1>cliched manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sentence structure isn't good.</v>

317
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.680
<v Speaker 1>The sentences aren't even in the write</v>
<v Speaker 1>paragraphs,</v>

318
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:29.630
<v Speaker 1>much less organized properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The paragraphs don't flow from one to</v>

319
00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:33.800
<v Speaker 1>another in what might be called the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of where the skeleton of the</v>

320
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.960
<v Speaker 1>story is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the most important level in</v>

321
00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:36.710
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

322
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 1>And then even if that wasn't all wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually no idea there anyways.</v>

323
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And then you can also read essays that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have one or more of those flaws or or</v>

324
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some combination of all of them.</v>

325
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 1>So very frequently I read a student's</v>
<v Speaker 1>essay and this often happens with smart</v>

326
00:17:56.131 --> 00:18:01.131
<v Speaker 1>creative students who are very badly</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated and that would be probably</v>

327
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.510
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of the people in this class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would bet,</v>

328
00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 1>and I say that for genuine reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I run a fourth year seminar</v>

329
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.610
<v Speaker 1>where I have people write extensively</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what they do is they write a four</v>

330
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:19.380
<v Speaker 1>page essay and then I complained about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and and all those levels of analysis</v>

331
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 1>and then they write the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see again in six pages and then I do the</v>

332
00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 1>same thing and then they write the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>essay and eight pages and the first half</v>

333
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.860
<v Speaker 1>of the first essays are terrible and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that's partly because students do</v>

334
00:18:30.861 --> 00:18:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you try out as triaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

335
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.881
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

336
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:36.090
<v Speaker 1>do I really have to work in this course?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll work a bit and see what happens and</v>

337
00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:39.540
<v Speaker 1>if I get slapped and I'll work a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder and if I don't then I can devote</v>

338
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:42.120
<v Speaker 1>my time to other courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a perfectly reasonable thing to</v>

339
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.450
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of it's just pure inability.</v>

340
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 1>But what's really fascinating is that by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the course,</v>

341
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>all of the students are writing well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pathetic as far as I'm concerned</v>

342
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 1>because it meant that everybody could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been taught to write 10 years ago,</v>

343
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:57.570
<v Speaker 1>but they just weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

344
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 1>if you look at this template that I laid</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

345
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.490
<v Speaker 1>then it will help you with this because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it walks you through the process of</v>

346
00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 1>writing property and that's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily useful thing to be able</v>

347
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

348
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now and then I'll read an essay and</v>

349
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:16.050
<v Speaker 1>everything is wrong about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a really smart idea in it.</v>

350
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.290
<v Speaker 1>And then knowing this multilevel idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to meaning,</v>

351
00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.011
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

352
00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smarter than you can,</v>

353
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's really something here,</v>

354
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's all the things that are wrong</v>

355
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

356
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.330
<v Speaker 1>and then you get a worse situation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense where everything about the</v>

357
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 1>essay is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea isn't.</v>

358
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.150
<v Speaker 1>And so the words are good and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases to sentences are right that it</v>

359
00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 1>goes together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it adds up to nothing.</v>

360
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 1>And those are tough to grade because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them a c maybe or b,</v>

361
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 1>because I probably give them a b and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person comes up and says,</v>

362
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 1>where did I make a mistake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

363
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't really make a mistake,</v>

364
00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:50.730
<v Speaker 1>you just didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

365
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:52.140
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

366
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different problem</v>

367
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.590
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

368
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:58.050
<v Speaker 1>So you think that's pretty complex with</v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to an essay?</v>

369
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Where's the meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't where the meaning is.</v>

370
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.290
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

371
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this the other day.</v>

372
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 1>So the ethnicity and the cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds of my students have changed</v>

373
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 1>quite radically over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

374
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:12.480
<v Speaker 1>And so when I started teaching this</v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

375
00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:15.150
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my personality course as well,</v>

376
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 1>which would have been 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can take it for granted that everybody</v>

377
00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 1>in the room with no the basic biblical</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories and they would know the Judeo</v>

378
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Christian version of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not say the Islam version of them.</v>

379
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Well that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really,</v>

380
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.680
<v Speaker 1>that's really made it difficult for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways because there's a bunch of</v>

381
00:20:31.681 --> 00:20:34.470
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of collective knowledge</v>

382
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.430
<v Speaker 1>that might constitute a shared set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural assumptions that I can no</v>

383
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:42.180
<v Speaker 1>longer presume and it means there's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things that I either can't talk</v>

384
00:20:42.181 --> 00:20:47.181
<v Speaker 1>about or if I'm going to talk about I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to step way back and start from</v>

385
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 1>start from first principles let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's also made me think so</v>

386
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.320
<v Speaker 1>because if I.</v>

387
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 1>let's say you write me an essay and</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's a psychology essay,</v>

388
00:20:56.351 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're going to presume that there's</v>

389
00:20:58.271 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of things I know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology that you also know and the</v>

390
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 1>reason you're going to presume that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're.</v>

391
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.220
<v Speaker 1>We come from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're for the purpose of this</v>

392
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to come from the same</v>

393
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:11.490
<v Speaker 1>cultural background and what that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we,</v>

394
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.560
<v Speaker 1>we share a set of assumptions and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to say what those assumptions</v>

395
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:19.270
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can assume them and then we can talk</v>

396
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 1>about the things that we disagree about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what you're doing</v>

397
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:24.850
<v Speaker 1>when you're writing an essay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're having a conversation right here.</v>

398
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.000
<v Speaker 1>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously you and have to talk</v>

399
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:29.800
<v Speaker 1>about what we know because we already</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

400
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.700
<v Speaker 1>We want to push that a little bit so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to talk a little bit about the</v>

401
00:21:33.701 --> 00:21:38.701
<v Speaker 1>things that we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no more so than we both understand.</v>

402
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.890
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well damn it,</v>

403
00:21:41.891 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of the essay isn't in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>essay at all.</v>

404
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 1>It's in the interaction between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shared cultural assumptions of the</v>

405
00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:51.040
<v Speaker 1>writer and the reader and the asset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

406
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.881
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

407
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:55.200
<v Speaker 1>it's worse than that even because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shared cultural assumptions are into</v>

408
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.110
<v Speaker 1>their own sort of network and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nested inside of it.</v>

409
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Very broad historical network and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nested inside an extraordinarily</v>

410
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:07.741
<v Speaker 1>broad biological network and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually you can continue expanding the</v>

411
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:13.711
<v Speaker 1>outer reaches of the essay without limit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so part of that means it's actually</v>

412
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:18.850
<v Speaker 1>impossible to specify the meaning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>essay.</v>

413
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you both work at in</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination as writer and as a reader,</v>

414
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's very fluid and flexible and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that problem is actually partly</v>

415
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:30.940
<v Speaker 1>why the postmodernist Scott going</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they sort of noticed this,</v>

416
00:22:30.941 --> 00:22:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean corrupt as they are.</v>

417
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.620
<v Speaker 1>They did notice at one point that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

418
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:40.621
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to say what any given</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase paragraph or even essay meant</v>

419
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.980
<v Speaker 1>because it wasn't in that it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

420
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of in the book.</v>

421
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.160
<v Speaker 1>But you know this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you listen,</v>

422
00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen to a piece of music,</v>

423
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.320
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you had a favorite song</v>

424
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:57.500
<v Speaker 1>when you were 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

425
00:22:57.501 --> 00:23:00.580
<v Speaker 1>and when you first heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm maybe you didn't like it that</v>

426
00:23:00.581 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you heard it four times and you</v>

427
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:02.681
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

428
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:05.320
<v Speaker 1>that's one excellent song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at some point you've heard it</v>

429
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:07.480
<v Speaker 1>so many times if you never want to hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>it again.</v>

430
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's interesting too because it</v>

431
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:13.750
<v Speaker 1>means the song has transformed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your historical,</v>

432
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.840
<v Speaker 1>in interactions with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

433
00:23:16.841 --> 00:23:18.610
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the song is the same.</v>

434
00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:19.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

435
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:25.230
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by the song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notes or the same experiences.</v>

436
00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Certainly transport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

437
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

438
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:31.570
<v Speaker 1>back to the couple that are sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>there talking.</v>

439
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:33.640
<v Speaker 1>They're having this argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to sort out what this is</v>

440
00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:35.320
<v Speaker 1>about and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

441
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:38.320
<v Speaker 1>it's about everything that the argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>is about plus everything that's ever</v>

442
00:23:38.321 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 1>happened to them in their relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

443
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 1>if someone has told you the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 times,</v>

444
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 1>it is not the same thing as the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>they told you the first time,</v>

445
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how many transformations</v>

446
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:55.730
<v Speaker 1>it's gone through as it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually repeated and how many</v>

447
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 1>different arguments it's been embedded</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and and how many things you have to</v>

448
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>know to understand the shades of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intonation and all of that,</v>

449
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 1>but basically each other instead a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of producers is,</v>

450
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.930
<v Speaker 1>is it's meaning as determined by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire history of interactions that</v>

451
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:15.220
<v Speaker 1>those two people have had and so how do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

452
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.610
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to specify that?</v>

453
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.460
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to specify it.</v>

454
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Now you really can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also difficult to know when</v>

455
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:25.520
<v Speaker 1>you've specified it enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

456
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:29.480
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that's interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about training as a psychoanalyst is</v>

457
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:32.320
<v Speaker 1>that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>

458
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:37.530
<v Speaker 1>It starts to become an absolutely mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>boggling how much archeology you can do,</v>

459
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you can undertake underneath a single</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

460
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.740
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's delivered with a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an edge and some contempt.</v>

461
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like there are just levels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels and levels and levels and levels</v>

462
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:53.660
<v Speaker 1>of meaning underneath that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that when you're</v>

463
00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:58.220
<v Speaker 1>engaged in an argument like that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone will trigger you,</v>

464
00:24:58.221 --> 00:25:01.140
<v Speaker 1>let's say for lack of a better word and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

465
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 1>they'll have broken a rule that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>established with them and you're both in</v>

466
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:07.340
<v Speaker 1>a pit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight is about that path.</v>

467
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Even though maybe it's about some</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface thing and you're just running</v>

468
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:11.330
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

469
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.390
<v Speaker 1>They're like racks that are lit on fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing you can do about it.</v>

470
00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:15.224
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

471
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a consequence of all the issues</v>

472
00:25:17.571 --> 00:25:21.400
<v Speaker 1>that are lurking beneath the surface of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that speech act.</v>

473
00:25:21.401 --> 00:25:24.320
<v Speaker 1>That seemed to be something you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>capture it on video.</v>

474
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:24.890
<v Speaker 1>You'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

475
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.570
<v Speaker 1>here's what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a video tape recording them.</v>

476
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:28.423
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

477
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.240
<v Speaker 1>that's not what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the videotape does not capture</v>

478
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:35.480
<v Speaker 1>the context and it can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't even get an objective</v>

479
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 1>record of the meaning of a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the meaning isn't right in the</v>

480
00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:41.540
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

481
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:44.810
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems with trying to</v>

482
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:49.670
<v Speaker 1>validate moral claims is that you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insane contextual complexity that's</v>

483
00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 1>almost impossible to dispose up and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

484
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you could even say that if person a did</v>
<v Speaker 1>action a in situation a,</v>

485
00:25:57.711 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 1>that would be right and a person beaded</v>
<v Speaker 1>action a and situation a that would be</v>

486
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:06.230
<v Speaker 1>wrong and it depends on the person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's very easy to slip from that into</v>

487
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:10.790
<v Speaker 1>a kind of moral relativism because how</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world do you deal with the</v>

488
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:12.710
<v Speaker 1>complexity and how do you make a truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim?</v>

489
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 1>And so I would really say in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's this intellectual situation in</v>

490
00:26:17.691 --> 00:26:19.040
<v Speaker 1>modern universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

491
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.770
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting is this was actually</v>

492
00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:25.460
<v Speaker 1>discovered in a number of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>fields simultaneously,</v>

493
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.720
<v Speaker 1>so just as the literary theorists</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to discover,</v>

494
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after World War II that it was really,</v>

495
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't enough to say that a book has</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning in it,</v>

496
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.840
<v Speaker 1>that there's something wrong with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there isn't a single meeting.</v>

497
00:26:38.841 --> 00:26:42.350
<v Speaker 1>There's a multiplicity of meanings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a stable multiplicity of</v>

498
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Speaker 1>meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were finding that out in in other</v>

499
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.370
<v Speaker 1>domains as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

500
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.100
<v Speaker 1>in artificial intelligence where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>became very,</v>

501
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:55.101
<v Speaker 1>very obvious very rapidly that</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceiving a simple object was not</v>

502
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:59.520
<v Speaker 1>simple because objects aren't sample and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the border between one object and</v>

503
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 1>another is in some sense arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

504
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I look at each of you,</v>

505
00:27:03.661 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I sort of see you as entities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

506
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.240
<v Speaker 1>But that's because I see you at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of resolution.</v>

507
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cellular masses at a different</v>

508
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 1>level of resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your molecular composites at a different</v>

509
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 1>level of resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are 10 times you're made up of 10</v>

510
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:24.120
<v Speaker 1>times as many bacteria as cells at</v>
<v Speaker 1>another level of resolution.</v>

511
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 1>So really you're more like an ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are like an entity and then</v>

512
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.040
<v Speaker 1>well is it you or your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the real or is it you,</v>

513
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 1>your family and your culture?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about your species or you know,</v>

514
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.290
<v Speaker 1>or are you a mammal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

515
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.480
<v Speaker 1>all of those things and all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and any of those things at the</v>

516
00:27:44.481 --> 00:27:45.940
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I look at you,</v>

517
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 1>what am I supposed to see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

518
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.100
<v Speaker 1>do I see individual with name or do I</v>
<v Speaker 1>see ethnicity or dyc?</v>

519
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the picture.</v>

520
00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.360
<v Speaker 1>So object perception turns out to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily difficult because things</v>

521
00:28:02.361 --> 00:28:05.090
<v Speaker 1>aren't just simple objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're relatively simple.</v>

522
00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

523
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you throw up your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

524
00:28:11.271 --> 00:28:13.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can there ever be any harmony?</v>

525
00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.490
<v Speaker 1>How can you draw any sense out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

526
00:28:16.491 --> 00:28:18.830
<v Speaker 1>so that's the argument against drawing</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sense out of it.</v>

527
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.920
<v Speaker 1>But then let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try the other tack.</v>

528
00:28:21.921 --> 00:28:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can make a case for</v>
<v Speaker 1>there being some sense to the claims of,</v>

529
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.240
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that moral claims can be validated.</v>

530
00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a question for you.</v>

531
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.390
<v Speaker 1>If you took a bunch of chimpanzees that</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know each other and you threw</v>

532
00:28:35.391 --> 00:28:40.391
<v Speaker 1>them in this classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would have is a war right now,</v>

533
00:28:40.551 --> 00:28:44.150
<v Speaker 1>you're roughly in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly because,</v>

534
00:28:44.151 --> 00:28:45.620
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not chimpanzees,</v>

535
00:28:45.621 --> 00:28:48.470
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your genetic material is quite</v>

536
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.090
<v Speaker 1>reasonably related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

537
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only split off your common ancestor</v>

538
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:57.030
<v Speaker 1>7 million years ago and that seems like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time in a day,</v>

539
00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's not 300 million years ago.</v>

540
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still relatively recently from the</v>

541
00:29:01.641 --> 00:29:04.040
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary perspective here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all are.</v>

542
00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:08.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You obviously share important elements</v>

543
00:29:08.571 --> 00:29:10.280
<v Speaker 1>of identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're all students,</v>

544
00:29:10.281 --> 00:29:13.760
<v Speaker 1>but you can come in here and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden you all know what to do and no</v>

545
00:29:13.761 --> 00:29:16.430
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one fights or if they do fight,</v>

546
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are very constrained rules around</v>

547
00:29:19.281 --> 00:29:23.000
<v Speaker 1>the fighting and everyone accepts them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems hard to say that that's not</v>

548
00:29:23.001 --> 00:29:26.150
<v Speaker 1>better than the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

549
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.360
<v Speaker 1>unless you want to come in here and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an APP still chaotic</v>

550
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.193
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

551
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:37.740
<v Speaker 1>So somehow we've managed to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we can at least brings relative</v>

552
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:41.620
<v Speaker 1>strangers together in a relatively high</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure situation because we were</v>

553
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:45.850
<v Speaker 1>learning about complicated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging things and everybody gets</v>

554
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:48.910
<v Speaker 1>along and everybody's kind of happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

555
00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like we can figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior that.</v>

556
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Well then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they correct,</v>

557
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.660
<v Speaker 1>are they morally correct or they write</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do they work?</v>

558
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.420
<v Speaker 1>And then you might also ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

559
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those claims?</v>

560
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Is there a similarity or difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between those claims?</v>

561
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.950
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask yourself,</v>

562
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:09.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here,</v>

563
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.180
<v Speaker 1>here's something else you might think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

564
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.603
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

565
00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.490
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're playing monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have played monopoly in</v>

566
00:30:19.491 --> 00:30:20.880
<v Speaker 1>your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

567
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.550
<v Speaker 1>is there anyone here who hasn't played</v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly?</v>

568
00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cultural universal.</v>

569
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:31.550
<v Speaker 1>So I'm obviously in some ways it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter if you get all those little</v>

570
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.800
<v Speaker 1>hotels right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

571
00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:41.150
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you act like it doesn't matter while</v>

572
00:30:41.151 --> 00:30:43.520
<v Speaker 1>you're playing monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people hit you with things and they</v>

573
00:30:43.521 --> 00:30:45.790
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because part of the rule is you're gonna</v>

574
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.870
<v Speaker 1>act like this matters because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

575
00:30:47.871 --> 00:30:50.960
<v Speaker 1>then it's not any fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to act like in Madison.</v>

576
00:30:50.961 --> 00:30:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Then it turns out that when you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing it backs right,</v>

577
00:30:54.321 --> 00:30:56.180
<v Speaker 1>and people will actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get angry,</v>

578
00:30:56.181 --> 00:30:58.080
<v Speaker 1>especially if you achieved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

579
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.940
<v Speaker 1>but people will play monopoly so they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>act as if the end point matters.</v>

580
00:31:01.941 --> 00:31:02.541
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

581
00:31:02.541 --> 00:31:07.541
<v Speaker 1>what is the end point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is to get all the hotels</v>

582
00:31:08.451 --> 00:31:11.060
<v Speaker 1>and all the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to enter the one percent,</v>

583
00:31:11.061 --> 00:31:14.300
<v Speaker 1>so you have all the wealth and no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>has any and you win and you feel happy</v>

584
00:31:14.301 --> 00:31:17.300
<v Speaker 1>about that even if you're a radical left</v>
<v Speaker 1>winger.</v>

585
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.490
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

586
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.400
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you say,</v>

587
00:31:22.401 --> 00:31:23.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really the point.</v>

588
00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:26.300
<v Speaker 1>The point is to enjoy the game and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

589
00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:26.841
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

590
00:31:26.841 --> 00:31:28.590
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the point too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

591
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.250
<v Speaker 1>and then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not really the point either.</v>

592
00:31:31.251 --> 00:31:34.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to know holding your</v>

593
00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.700
<v Speaker 1>negotiating skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to spend some time with your</v>

594
00:31:37.701 --> 00:31:39.560
<v Speaker 1>friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's lots of things going on at</v>

595
00:31:39.561 --> 00:31:42.320
<v Speaker 1>once and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter because</v>

596
00:31:42.321 --> 00:31:44.360
<v Speaker 1>monopoly is a game that you'll play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

597
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine instead that monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the new rule for monopoly.</v>

598
00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:57.670
<v Speaker 1>All the people you're playing with can</v>
<v Speaker 1>randomly steal your hotels and houses</v>

599
00:31:57.801 --> 00:32:01.610
<v Speaker 1>and your money whenever they want and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can steal it back.</v>

600
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you think,</v>

601
00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.310
<v Speaker 1>well</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's gonna play that game,</v>

602
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:11.180
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why not?</v>

603
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first surface answers,</v>

604
00:32:14.151 --> 00:32:16.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a stupid game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

605
00:32:16.371 --> 00:32:19.190
<v Speaker 1>but and you know that somehow you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a stupid game,</v>

606
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.700
<v Speaker 1>but then you starting to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why is that a stupid game?</v>

607
00:32:22.701 --> 00:32:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Or you might say it's not unplayable</v>
<v Speaker 1>gate,</v>

608
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.710
<v Speaker 1>which would be a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>

609
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would that not work?</v>

610
00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.060
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the point in getting the</v>

611
00:32:32.061 --> 00:32:35.990
<v Speaker 1>hotels if someone can just take them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might say what's the point?</v>

612
00:32:35.991 --> 00:32:37.460
<v Speaker 1>And getting the whole deal is anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

613
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.300
<v Speaker 1>who cares about the damn hotel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

614
00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the randomness</v>

615
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's now allowed and the</v>

616
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:49.130
<v Speaker 1>unpredictability of it and the arbitrary</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of it and its lack of a</v>

617
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:52.490
<v Speaker 1>relationship with your own actions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes all the motivational impotence out</v>

618
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:53.324
<v Speaker 1>of the gate.</v>

619
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:58.570
<v Speaker 1>So one thing we might think about to</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with is there's a difference</v>

620
00:32:58.941 --> 00:33:03.740
<v Speaker 1>between a good game and a bad game and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also a difference between a game</v>

621
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:07.820
<v Speaker 1>and no gate and we don't know what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference is exactly,</v>

622
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.600
<v Speaker 1>but there is a difference and then we</v>
<v Speaker 1>might even say,</v>

623
00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:13.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are there good games and bad</v>

624
00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some good games are better than</v>

625
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:18.620
<v Speaker 1>other games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have played settlers of</v>

626
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Catan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

627
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that better than monopoly or worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>

628
00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It's anybody think it's not better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

629
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Why is it better?</v>

630
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.250
<v Speaker 3>What's better about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more complex and heard what you</v>

631
00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:39.030
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not necessarily stealing,</v>

632
00:33:39.031 --> 00:33:42.110
<v Speaker 3>but there's a piece of the gay whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was</v>

633
00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:44.463
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

634
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a robber.</v>

635
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Place him on one of the titles.</v>

636
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can mess with people essentially.</v>

637
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is just like,</v>

638
00:33:55.961 --> 00:33:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get you with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert.</v>

639
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:59.840
<v Speaker 1>It's more akin to like real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

640
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Like in monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

641
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.020
<v Speaker 1>that's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's reasonable.</v>

642
00:34:05.021 --> 00:34:07.540
<v Speaker 1>That's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also got a strategic element.</v>

643
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:10.450
<v Speaker 1>How many of you played risk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

644
00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Settlers of a Katana risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlers.</v>

645
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Who says risk to risk to risk diehards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the rest of you?</v>

646
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.980
<v Speaker 1>How many for risk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many first?</v>

647
00:34:23.981 --> 00:34:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Settlers of Catan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

648
00:34:25.811 --> 00:34:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>

649
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.700
<v Speaker 1>settlers of Katana is quite a bit like</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk because it has a strategic element.</v>

650
00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a territorial expansion that</v>

651
00:34:33.161 --> 00:34:35.410
<v Speaker 1>goes along with it and there's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>trading,</v>

652
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.260
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that's nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>about monopoly and about risk.</v>

653
00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so you can see that you have</v>

654
00:34:40.631 --> 00:34:44.800
<v Speaker 1>intuitions about what constitutes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better game and part of the way that you</v>

655
00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.820
<v Speaker 1>develop those intuitions is not exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophically because I doubt if you</v>

656
00:34:48.821 --> 00:34:52.720
<v Speaker 1>really thought through white settlers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cape Town is a better game say than risk</v>

657
00:34:52.721 --> 00:34:53.350
<v Speaker 1>or monopoly.</v>

658
00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:58.210
<v Speaker 1>For those of you that think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you aren't your own reaction and</v>

659
00:34:58.211 --> 00:34:59.800
<v Speaker 1>your own reaction is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

660
00:34:59.801 --> 00:35:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather play settlers of kc tap and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself why,</v>

661
00:35:03.911 --> 00:35:08.580
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just rather play it and then so</v>

662
00:35:08.581 --> 00:35:09.490
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

663
00:35:09.491 --> 00:35:10.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean that you'd rather play</v>

664
00:35:10.901 --> 00:35:11.501
<v Speaker 1>it and you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

665
00:35:11.501 --> 00:35:14.770
<v Speaker 1>it's more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more enjoyable if asked</v>

666
00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.780
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one I would pick,</v>

667
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.690
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really know why apart from</v>
<v Speaker 1>those reasons,</v>

668
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:24.990
<v Speaker 1>but obviously those are complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a complex social engagement.</v>

669
00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Those games that are complex and and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact they're so complex that you can</v>

670
00:35:30.491 --> 00:35:35.170
<v Speaker 1>have preferences and not even know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's interesting and I think the</v>

671
00:35:35.171 --> 00:35:40.171
<v Speaker 1>idea that there are games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good games and bad games and games,</v>

672
00:35:40.531 --> 00:35:45.090
<v Speaker 1>a non games is a nice way of starting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize what the difference might</v>

673
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:49.110
<v Speaker 1>be doing between moral systems because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game is actually a moral system,</v>

674
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:49.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

675
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:50.450
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

676
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.140
<v Speaker 1>it has a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has an end.</v>

677
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:58.070
<v Speaker 1>You have to cooperate and compete to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to run through the gate.</v>

678
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:02.720
<v Speaker 1>So awhile back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychologist actually started this and</v>

679
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.820
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's reprehensible,</v>

680
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.080
<v Speaker 1>but psychologists have done lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible things and this is one of</v>

681
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:12.510
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he this psychologist whose name I don't</v>

682
00:36:12.511 --> 00:36:15.450
<v Speaker 1>remember that moment was reviewing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature on the difference in</v>

683
00:36:15.451 --> 00:36:18.150
<v Speaker 1>aggression between boys and girls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women and</v>

684
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 1>boys and men are much more aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you define aggressive</v>

685
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:29.790
<v Speaker 1>than girls and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that tends to be mostly true with</v>

686
00:36:29.791 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 1>physical aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say kicking,</v>

687
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 1>hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biting,</v>

688
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 1>punching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing,</v>

689
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 1>two year old boys for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who do two year olds,</v>

690
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.860
<v Speaker 1>the ones who do most of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or boys now,</v>

691
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:43.950
<v Speaker 1>the two year old girls are a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other up behind their backs,</v>

692
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:45.270
<v Speaker 1>but no one measures that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

693
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:46.650
<v Speaker 1>And so you find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

694
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 1>with female aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tends to be relationship savaging and</v>

695
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:52.740
<v Speaker 1>you see that on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the playground,</v>

696
00:36:52.741 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 1>you see it in junior high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it in high school and you see it</v>

697
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:56.850
<v Speaker 1>on the net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the same thing.</v>

698
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.220
<v Speaker 1>So whether men are more aggressive than</v>
<v Speaker 1>women is,</v>

699
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.970
<v Speaker 1>depends on how you define aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But men are more physically aggressive</v>

700
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:03.990
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

701
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:11.480
<v Speaker 1>a while back there was this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could dampen down to male</v>

702
00:37:11.481 --> 00:37:15.140
<v Speaker 1>aggression by socializing little boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more like little girls.</v>

703
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:16.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

704
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.940
<v Speaker 1>and one of the offshoots of that was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that we should only allow children</v>

705
00:37:19.941 --> 00:37:22.820
<v Speaker 1>to play cooperative games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

706
00:37:22.821 --> 00:37:26.000
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you might notice is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you've ever done that was a</v>

707
00:37:26.001 --> 00:37:29.000
<v Speaker 1>game was not cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

708
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not a game if it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperative.</v>

709
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:36.170
<v Speaker 1>But then the other thing you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice is that the distinction between a</v>

710
00:37:36.171 --> 00:37:40.700
<v Speaker 1>cooperative in a competitive game is far</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sophisticated than people who come</v>

711
00:37:40.701 --> 00:37:43.160
<v Speaker 1>up with those dimwitted theories about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to improve the world,</v>

712
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate.</v>

713
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.740
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

714
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Hockey game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

715
00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Is it an aggressive gate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a competitive game?</v>

716
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Is it a cooperative game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

717
00:37:56.410 --> 00:38:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it a cooperative game together?</v>

718
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the team,</v>

719
00:38:02.531 --> 00:38:04.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're obviously cooperating with</v>

720
00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:07.600
<v Speaker 1>your team members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also maybe trying to be the</v>

721
00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:10.180
<v Speaker 1>best player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also trying to be the best</v>

722
00:38:10.181 --> 00:38:13.570
<v Speaker 1>player in a way that doesn't irritate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell out of your team players.</v>

723
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's actually,</v>

724
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.350
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>

725
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Like even if you're a good player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a prima donna and you hug the</v>

726
00:38:21.671 --> 00:38:22.510
<v Speaker 1>park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

727
00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.070
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

728
00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of your other team members.</v>

729
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not a good player even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the most talented.</v>

730
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.170
<v Speaker 1>So there's definitely a cooperative</v>
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>

731
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Is there a cooperative element beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

732
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

733
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to all agree to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperating in so much as um,</v>

734
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeing to the rules of the game and</v>

735
00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:42.154
<v Speaker 1>playing with it.</v>

736
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't bring a chess board or</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball right now,</v>

737
00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.360
<v Speaker 1>no matter if you're on different teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

738
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Because you're all there to play hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to play hockey as a cooperative</v>

739
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 1>endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because think of all the other things</v>

740
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you could be doing instead of playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey at that time,</v>

741
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.920
<v Speaker 1>you could be doing an infinite number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

742
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:02.920
<v Speaker 1>So really if you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between cooperation and</v>

743
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.550
<v Speaker 1>competition in any collaborative human</v>
<v Speaker 1>affair,</v>

744
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 1>things are usually competitive at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

745
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:12.010
<v Speaker 1>cooperative and another competitive at</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

746
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this continual interplay</v>
<v Speaker 1>between competition and cooperation and</v>

747
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.740
<v Speaker 1>you can't disentangle them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

748
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:20.660
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Piaget said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Piaget's is,</v>

749
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.920
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who don't own you</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably all do now,</v>

750
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.200
<v Speaker 1>is perhaps the foremost developmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist of the 20th century,</v>

751
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.270
<v Speaker 1>even though he didn't think he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

752
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget actually made the claim the</v>

753
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:34.690
<v Speaker 1>radical claim that two year olds for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

754
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:38.020
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't Psj is clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's associated,</v>

755
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.650
<v Speaker 1>if you put groups of people together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their age matched.</v>

756
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:45.250
<v Speaker 1>So you got a group of nine months olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say one year olds,</v>

757
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:46.270
<v Speaker 1>two year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three year olds,</v>

758
00:39:46.271 --> 00:39:47.950
<v Speaker 1>four year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way up to 18,</v>

759
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.310
<v Speaker 1>and you just throw them in a room maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some things for them to do,</v>

760
00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:55.660
<v Speaker 1>and then you count the number of violent</v>
<v Speaker 1>acts which is kicking,</v>

761
00:39:55.661 --> 00:39:56.950
<v Speaker 1>hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biting or stealing.</v>

762
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:58.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two year olds,</v>

763
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:04.000
<v Speaker 1>they're the most violent human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of them are actually aren't</v>

764
00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:06.370
<v Speaker 1>violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a subset of them that are</v>

765
00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.380
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about five to 10 percent of them.</v>

766
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Now almost all of those are boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you track those boys across</v>

767
00:40:12.311 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the next two years,</v>

768
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:19.291
<v Speaker 1>most of them become civilized and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that don't never become civilized.</v>

769
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And then so they're kind of antisocial</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout their childhood.</v>

770
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And then when testosterone kicks in at</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 14 and all the boys get antisocial</v>

771
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.250
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they catch up to the always antisocial</v>

772
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.310
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the normal boys taper off quite</v>

773
00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:36.610
<v Speaker 1>dramatically at around 19 and flattened</v>
<v Speaker 1>right out by about 27.</v>

774
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 1>But the antisocial boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just keep being antisocial.</v>

775
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.700
<v Speaker 1>So now piaget noted that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic transformation in,</v>

776
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:49.570
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

777
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:54.140
<v Speaker 1>in behavior or individual behavior in</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the social world between</v>

778
00:40:54.141 --> 00:40:58.430
<v Speaker 1>the ages of two and four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you watch two year olds play</v>

779
00:40:58.431 --> 00:41:00.540
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that what they did fundamentally</v>

780
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:04.490
<v Speaker 1>it was like a parallel play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe there's one,</v>

781
00:41:04.491 --> 00:41:07.400
<v Speaker 1>two year old there and another two year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old there and that two year old is</v>

782
00:41:07.401 --> 00:41:11.330
<v Speaker 1>playing truck and this two year old is</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing ambulance or something or maybe</v>

783
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.110
<v Speaker 1>playing doll and they're sitting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and maybe they interact a</v>

784
00:41:15.111 --> 00:41:17.660
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not playing the same game.</v>

785
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.243
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

786
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.530
<v Speaker 1>so what they're doing in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're engaged in a goal directed</v>

787
00:41:24.531 --> 00:41:27.980
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It and it has a point and they're</v>

788
00:41:27.981 --> 00:41:29.900
<v Speaker 1>trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of integrating all their</v>

789
00:41:29.901 --> 00:41:34.901
<v Speaker 1>interior subpersonalities in sense in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that allows them to play a single</v>

790
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 1>game with themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

791
00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty complex from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive perspective,</v>

792
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:40.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

793
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Because it means there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not fractionated and they're not</v>

794
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:49.571
<v Speaker 1>being pulled out by hunger or anger or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadness or fear or any of those things.</v>

795
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 1>And they're doing something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly complex cognitively and they can</v>

796
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.380
<v Speaker 1>make an organized themselves well enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it for a substantial period of</v>

797
00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:59.120
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like it's a major developmental</v>

798
00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 1>advance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't do it with another</v>

799
00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:02.960
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

800
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:07.520
<v Speaker 1>one of Piaget's hypotheses was that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do it do.</v>

801
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.770
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't play the same game with</v>
<v Speaker 1>another person without actually setting</v>

802
00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 1>up a competitive structure so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually compete.</v>

803
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Competition was a prerequisite to</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation.</v>

804
00:42:19.591 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

805
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:24.800
<v Speaker 1>so if you watch how kids do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a sense of it.</v>

806
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they,</v>

807
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.390
<v Speaker 1>they all get together and they decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play tag.</v>

808
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone knows the rules for tag and</v>

809
00:42:32.001 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you can win at 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without the point,</v>

810
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.510
<v Speaker 1>the point in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the construction of a dominance</v>

811
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:39.950
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

812
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Someone wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the people who are sort</v>

813
00:42:41.721 --> 00:42:44.960
<v Speaker 1>of second best and third best and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's really into doing that.</v>

814
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.300
<v Speaker 1>You all have to get together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your kids and you say,</v>

815
00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 1>well what should we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he decided we're going to play</v>

816
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:51.230
<v Speaker 1>tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you set up the rules because</v>

817
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:55.400
<v Speaker 1>there's infinite variations of tag and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everyone goes off in place and so</v>

818
00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:59.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a competitive game because only one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person can win or maybe one at a time</v>

819
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:03.140
<v Speaker 1>can win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you've all agreed on that,</v>

820
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.090
<v Speaker 1>well then you're cooperating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

821
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.870
<v Speaker 1>so that's quite interesting in Psj</v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded that as necessary stage in the</v>

822
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:11.210
<v Speaker 1>development of the ability to act like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>social creature.</v>

823
00:43:11.211 --> 00:43:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's,</v>

824
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 1>here's something that happens if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a very popular kid.</v>

825
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:21.500
<v Speaker 1>So let's say for kids that are playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacks good enough,</v>

826
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think kids play jacks anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>

827
00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:27.170
<v Speaker 1>if they were playing jocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're are sitting there playing jacks</v>

828
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.720
<v Speaker 1>and when you play jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bounce a ball and you pick up a jock</v>

829
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 1>and manage that and the ball because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage that.</v>

830
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you drop the ball and you pick up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Jackson,</v>

831
00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you grew up the ball and you keep going</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to like eight jacks or whatever.</v>

832
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.140
<v Speaker 1>So now another kid wants to play Jacks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll say this is a relatively</v>

833
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 1>popular kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the kids sidles up to the group</v>

834
00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:49.010
<v Speaker 1>that's playing and sits down because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all sitting down and then</v>

835
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:53.120
<v Speaker 1>watches and then maybe starts making</v>
<v Speaker 1>jack playing motions are a couple of</v>

836
00:43:53.121 --> 00:43:58.040
<v Speaker 1>comments about how the Jac game is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe the other kids don't have</v>

837
00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 1>to disrupt what they're doing very much</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can kind of open the circle and</v>

838
00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:03.530
<v Speaker 1>let that kid scoot in and then he gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>to her,</v>

839
00:44:03.531 --> 00:44:06.450
<v Speaker 1>she gets to play Jacks to whereas a kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't.</v>

840
00:44:06.451 --> 00:44:09.350
<v Speaker 1>And that often doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's a popular kid,</v>

841
00:44:09.351 --> 00:44:11.930
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the little group that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>already formed won't open.</v>

842
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And let the man you've been at cocktail</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties.</v>

843
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

844
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.520
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was supposed to hang around the edge</v>

845
00:44:19.521 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 1>of the conversation and maybe if you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got something that isn't too stupid to</v>

846
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:25.430
<v Speaker 1>say you can offer it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe they'd let you in.</v>

847
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

848
00:44:26.661 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now if you're not very social,</v>

849
00:44:28.671 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you stand out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't notice what the hell's going</v>

850
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 1>on and you don't start to match your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body to what's happening.</v>

851
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know want to play Jacks,</v>

852
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.440
<v Speaker 1>that's a stupid game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go do something else.</v>

853
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:44.970
<v Speaker 1>In which case the kids are not happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you and your unpopular and that's</v>

854
00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 1>that you're stuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you got that by the time of</v>

855
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:51.330
<v Speaker 1>year for about the other kids are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave you so far in the dust,</v>

856
00:44:51.331 --> 00:44:52.380
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to catch up.</v>

857
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:54.103
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

858
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.250
<v Speaker 1>so what have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have we concluded from that?</v>

859
00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:00.090
<v Speaker 1>We might conclude that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people play games.</v>

860
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.210
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

861
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.530
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of different playable</v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

862
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.350
<v Speaker 1>There might even be an infinite number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of playable games.</v>

863
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of non playable games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones that aren't any fun.</v>

864
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.470
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of interactions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't games.</v>

865
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can all accept that.</v>

866
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:18.990
<v Speaker 1>And then we've added to that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>observation or the presupposition that</v>

867
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:24.260
<v Speaker 1>the ability to play games is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prerequisite for being socialized.</v>

868
00:45:24.991 --> 00:45:28.800
<v Speaker 1>So being able to operate together with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and that that operation has</v>

869
00:45:28.801 --> 00:45:32.910
<v Speaker 1>elements of competition and elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation reasonable.</v>

870
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.860
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

871
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.640
<v Speaker 1>everything people do communally has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game like aspect,</v>

872
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.010
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's actually why kids like to</v>

873
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:46.011
<v Speaker 1>play games because kids play games</v>
<v Speaker 1>because games are a simplified analog of</v>

874
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:47.130
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

875
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 1>And if you get good at playing games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what happens is the games you play</v>

876
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:53.820
<v Speaker 1>become increasingly complex and more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more real world,</v>

877
00:45:53.821 --> 00:45:56.970
<v Speaker 1>like until they're actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from acting in the</v>

878
00:45:56.971 --> 00:45:59.100
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're even then they're still</v>

879
00:45:59.101 --> 00:46:03.510
<v Speaker 1>games in a sense because they could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rules could be different.</v>

880
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:06.660
<v Speaker 1>But then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rules could be different.</v>

881
00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:07.830
<v Speaker 1>But then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

882
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:09.690
<v Speaker 1>are there things that couldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>

883
00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some things.</v>

884
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.500
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be competitive,</v>

885
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.010
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be ruled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody needs to agree on the rules.</v>

886
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 1>People have to want to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something else piaget observed.</v>

887
00:46:20.551 --> 00:46:22.530
<v Speaker 1>It's bloody brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought,</v>

888
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you decide if one game is</v>

889
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:30.030
<v Speaker 1>better than another?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a moral,</v>

890
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.680
<v Speaker 1>let's say that it's a moral claim in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

891
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he wanted to narrow it down so that</v>

892
00:46:33.631 --> 00:46:35.490
<v Speaker 1>it was possible that it could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>answered,</v>

893
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.720
<v Speaker 1>and what he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

894
00:46:36.721 --> 00:46:41.370
<v Speaker 1>well imagine you have group a that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to attain a goal and Group B</v>

895
00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:43.050
<v Speaker 1>that are attempting to attain a goal.</v>

896
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Both groups have agreed that attaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal is valuable.</v>

897
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to argue about the value</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the goal.</v>

898
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.510
<v Speaker 1>We've settled that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

899
00:46:51.511 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to make a further</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption,</v>

900
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:58.110
<v Speaker 1>which is all things considered getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the goal with less effort,</v>

901
00:46:58.111 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 1>more enjoyment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and less trouble would be better.</v>

902
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to take that as a given because</v>

903
00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:05.670
<v Speaker 1>it might not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes something difficult is better,</v>

904
00:47:05.671 --> 00:47:07.650
<v Speaker 1>but well then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

905
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:14.750
<v Speaker 1>would people working voluntarily or</v>
<v Speaker 1>involuntarily be more likely to reach</v>

906
00:47:14.941 --> 00:47:19.170
<v Speaker 1>that goal with less misery faster and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more effectively?</v>

907
00:47:19.171 --> 00:47:22.830
<v Speaker 1>And Piaget's answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can get people to play the game</v>

908
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:25.800
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to waste any effort on</v>

909
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:28.200
<v Speaker 1>enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one kicks back.</v>

910
00:47:28.201 --> 00:47:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So the system is to be more efficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>

911
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's smart because he's gone,</v>

912
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:39.850
<v Speaker 1>he's gone on way of conceptualizing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>might constitute a better system.</v>

913
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Now it's grounded in subjective</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience to some degree,</v>

914
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:45.400
<v Speaker 1>less misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more enjoyment.</v>

915
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a way of measuring it,</v>

916
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.650
<v Speaker 1>which is also more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

917
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:54.850
<v Speaker 1>or it does what it's supposed to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>less noise and grief,</v>

918
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.200
<v Speaker 1>less costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

919
00:47:56.201 --> 00:47:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

920
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.560
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

921
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.350
<v Speaker 1>So then let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's make another.</v>

922
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

923
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.450
<v Speaker 1>How old do you think kids games are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

924
00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:10.790
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what's happened to kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent years because their,</v>

925
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.310
<v Speaker 1>their culture in some ways has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously disrupted by television and</v>

926
00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you guys are a lot younger than me.</v>

927
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Did you play hide and go seek?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

928
00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you know ring around the Rosie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that?</v>

929
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know when you're on the road.</v>

930
00:48:25.651 --> 00:48:29.140
<v Speaker 1>So how many people don't know that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ring around the rosy pocket full of</v>

931
00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:30.080
<v Speaker 1>posies hotshot?</v>

932
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 1>How shall we all fall down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

933
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.790
<v Speaker 1>How many know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

934
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.130
<v Speaker 1>it's an English nursery rhyme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the play.</v>

935
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.430
<v Speaker 1>It's about the black plate by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that piece of dog role,</v>

936
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.910
<v Speaker 1>that piece of Ryan has been around</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted by the oral cultural</v>

937
00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.660
<v Speaker 1>children since the time of the black</v>
<v Speaker 1>plague.</v>

938
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of co children's tradition</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an oral tradition and a lot of the</v>

939
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:53.770
<v Speaker 1>games that children play are passed</v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

940
00:48:53.771 --> 00:48:54.520
<v Speaker 1>My children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

941
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 1>adults might also teach them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kids learn how to play hide and go</v>

942
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:59.920
<v Speaker 1>seek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many of you played tag?</v>

943
00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:02.111
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

944
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Anyone never played tag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

945
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:06.340
<v Speaker 1>So everyone plays tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

946
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.580
<v Speaker 1>how would you conceptualize tag if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a biologist?</v>

947
00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:11.350
<v Speaker 1>What do you think children are doing?</v>

948
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.030
<v Speaker 1>They're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

949
00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:18.990
<v Speaker 1>They're chasing things down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they're chasing things down</v>

950
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.460
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hide and go seek.</v>

951
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a tougher one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly exploration.</v>

952
00:49:23.251 --> 00:49:24.740
<v Speaker 1>They're exploring the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

953
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:26.820
<v Speaker 1>And they're matching wits against one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

954
00:49:26.821 --> 00:49:28.890
<v Speaker 1>but then they're also trying to see if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

955
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.110
<v Speaker 1>do people like you enough to actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>find you,</v>

956
00:49:31.111 --> 00:49:35.040
<v Speaker 1>which is a helpful thing to know if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're four years old.</v>

957
00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:39.600
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children past these games down across,</v>

958
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.650
<v Speaker 1>let's say across the centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe tag is one of those games that</v>

959
00:49:43.651 --> 00:49:46.650
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't even have to pass down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children might just invented</v>

960
00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:50.370
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously with every generation like</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can more or less play tag</v>

961
00:49:50.371 --> 00:49:52.040
<v Speaker 1>with a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

962
00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean the dog doesn't quite get it but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

963
00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:58.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

964
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.310
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are some games that are,</v>

965
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.370
<v Speaker 1>that are enjoyable and now so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

966
00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.260
<v Speaker 1>they're either transmitted and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>learns some very rapidly or they're,</v>

967
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:10.230
<v Speaker 1>they're so close to our nature that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can reinvent them.</v>

968
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.720
<v Speaker 1>And Tag I think is the classic example</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

969
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:15.330
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's interesting too because what</v>

970
00:50:15.331 --> 00:50:19.620
<v Speaker 1>it means is that there are certain types</v>
<v Speaker 1>of competitive and cooperative behavior.</v>

971
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Those are elementary moral systems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

972
00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.170
<v Speaker 1>They look like they're integral to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

973
00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could even say they're built right</v>

974
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:31.640
<v Speaker 1>or you could say there are so close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>built in that it doesn't take much of a</v>

975
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.670
<v Speaker 1>introduction to the rules of the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

976
00:50:34.671 --> 00:50:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's pretty happy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

977
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:40.160
<v Speaker 1>you see this with a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You play peekaboo with a baby.</v>

978
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are the rules?</v>

979
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:44.420
<v Speaker 1>What are the rules of peekaboo?</v>

980
00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:47.923
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

981
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cover your eyes.</v>

982
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:50.601
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

983
00:50:50.601 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 1>so that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go like this.</v>

984
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what's the next rule?</v>

985
00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.340
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You reveal your eyes.</v>

986
00:50:58.341 --> 00:51:02.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't just sit there like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know you can play a trick on her</v>

987
00:51:02.361 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 1>baby if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And babies will laugh about this sort of</v>

988
00:51:05.601 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>

989
00:51:06.441 --> 00:51:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I think really quite amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The baby's laugh is something remarkable</v>

990
00:51:10.281 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can go like this and then like</v>

991
00:51:13.071 --> 00:51:15.230
<v Speaker 1>this and then like this and then like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

992
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And then you can do this new baby will</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh because that's,</v>

993
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a little variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A or you can go like this,</v>

994
00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the baby,</v>

995
00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:31.600
<v Speaker 1>while even that'll even make you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>can see how deeply rooted this is.</v>

996
00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:34.980
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually one of the baby do it.</v>

997
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:36.360
<v Speaker 1>They'll grab your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

998
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Pull them down because you're breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dam rules.</v>

999
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe knows the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you've never established any</v>

1000
00:51:42.041 --> 00:51:45.070
<v Speaker 1>rules and you can get the rules going</v>
<v Speaker 1>with about five reps,</v>

1001
00:51:45.071 --> 00:51:45.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1002
00:51:45.611 --> 00:51:48.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this maybe no one's ever play peekaboo</v>

1003
00:51:48.431 --> 00:51:50.830
<v Speaker 1>with the baby and the baby figures it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out right away,</v>

1004
00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.030
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1005
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.520
<v Speaker 1>and then you're very that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe do that.</v>

1006
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:58.660
<v Speaker 1>That baby thinks that's a hell of a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke instead of down.</v>

1007
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.290
<v Speaker 1>And so it's variations within this rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>bound theme.</v>

1008
00:52:02.291 --> 00:52:04.150
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like musical in the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1009
00:52:04.151 --> 00:52:07.420
<v Speaker 1>It's variations within the theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what you don't do is go</v>

1010
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.180
<v Speaker 1>because the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was your shortage right now,</v>

1011
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.140
<v Speaker 1>so you don't do that unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1012
00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.770
<v Speaker 1>last year haven't evil streak.</v>

1013
00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So there's certainly ways of violating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby's expectations and what the</v>

1014
00:52:24.131 --> 00:52:26.200
<v Speaker 1>baby will do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that as startle and they</v>

1015
00:52:26.201 --> 00:52:30.520
<v Speaker 1>started with their whole bodies and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you and then probably they'll</v>

1016
00:52:30.521 --> 00:52:33.250
<v Speaker 1>burst into tears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some babies will just laugh,</v>

1017
00:52:33.251 --> 00:52:36.550
<v Speaker 1>like mad if something like that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can find those babies all over</v>

1018
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.150
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the baby,</v>

1019
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.090
<v Speaker 1>the mother's sneezes and the baby has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit laughing for like 10 minutes,</v>

1020
00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:45.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's quite interesting,</v>

1021
00:52:45.001 --> 00:52:48.070
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things about babies I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been able to understand is the</v>

1022
00:52:48.071 --> 00:52:50.530
<v Speaker 1>staggering sophistication of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>senses of humor,</v>

1023
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:55.120
<v Speaker 1>like and it's like it's deeper because</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a nine month old baby can play</v>

1024
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:57.790
<v Speaker 1>tricks on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1025
00:52:57.791 --> 00:53:00.770
<v Speaker 1>their baby tricks but still their tricks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they laugh and you know,</v>

1026
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:02.690
<v Speaker 1>they're quite comical and they liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>variation.</v>

1027
00:53:02.691 --> 00:53:04.360
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is point.</v>

1028
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:07.360
<v Speaker 1>One of the points of all this is these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1029
00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.870
<v Speaker 1>this understanding of game like</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures is really,</v>

1030
00:53:10.871 --> 00:53:11.740
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1031
00:53:11.741 --> 00:53:12.580
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1032
00:53:12.581 --> 00:53:17.080
<v Speaker 1>really deep inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's way before articulation.</v>

1033
00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:18.363
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arctic,</v>

1034
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.110
<v Speaker 1>it's way before we can say the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Babies can pick up the damn rules right</v>

1035
00:53:23.111 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>away and it's kind of a dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sense.</v>

1036
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.550
<v Speaker 1>And the dance is also a rule bound</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1037
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're dancing with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's rules like don't step on</v>

1038
00:53:33.241 --> 00:53:35.430
<v Speaker 1>their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also set up a set of</v>

1039
00:53:35.431 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 1>expectations in the dance and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>violate them in tandem.</v>

1040
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And if you can do it gracefully then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>

1041
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:41.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1042
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the person you're dancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1043
00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:45.610
<v Speaker 1>configuring out if you were an absolute</v>
<v Speaker 1>Klutz and you know,</v>

1044
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.660
<v Speaker 1>civil autistic that you can't even get</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of yourself and might make a</v>

1045
00:53:48.661 --> 00:53:52.230
<v Speaker 1>half reasonable partner or if it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopeless so,</v>

1046
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 1>but the dance is the same thing.</v>

1047
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not negotiated verbally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's negotiated bodily and unless we</v>

1048
00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:02.730
<v Speaker 1>were able to imitate and imitate</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely well because human beings can</v>

1049
00:54:02.731 --> 00:54:05.250
<v Speaker 1>imitate like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be able to do that.</v>

1050
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And so babies are the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You basically start,</v>

1051
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:13.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peekaboo doesn't have rules because a</v>

1052
00:54:13.081 --> 00:54:16.500
<v Speaker 1>rule is a stated description of a set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations.</v>

1053
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what peekaboo has his expectations and</v>

1054
00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:23.610
<v Speaker 1>repetition and you can violate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>

1055
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:26.640
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean you're breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rule because the expectation is not</v>

1056
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:29.700
<v Speaker 1>a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a rule until you observe the</v>

1057
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:32.910
<v Speaker 1>expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You describe what it is and maybe you</v>

1058
00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:36.150
<v Speaker 1>even write it down and you can play</v>
<v Speaker 1>games long before,</v>

1059
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:40.620
<v Speaker 1>long before you can follow rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things piaget observed is</v>

1060
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:43.470
<v Speaker 1>if you take kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch a bunch of kids playing a</v>

1061
00:54:43.471 --> 00:54:47.040
<v Speaker 1>complicated game like marbles in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like six and you take them out</v>

1062
00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:48.600
<v Speaker 1>of the game and you ask them what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules are,</v>

1063
00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:51.690
<v Speaker 1>they can't tell you or they may be get</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them right in a bunch of them</v>

1064
00:54:51.691 --> 00:54:52.410
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1065
00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you interviewed every child</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was playing and you looked at the</v>

1066
00:54:56.281 --> 00:54:59.460
<v Speaker 1>commonality of description,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could extract out the underlying</v>

1067
00:54:59.461 --> 00:55:02.880
<v Speaker 1>rule structure of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the kids don't know the rules,</v>

1068
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:06.750
<v Speaker 1>what they know is how to play with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids when they're playing marbles.</v>

1069
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.410
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1070
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:13.500
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal Hanson eyebrow raises and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that and so forth.</v>

1071
00:55:13.501 --> 00:55:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't till much later that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell you the rules if ever.</v>

1072
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.540
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1073
00:55:18.541 --> 00:55:22.110
<v Speaker 1>you guys can't tell me the rules for</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing successful with someone.</v>

1074
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You can tell me some stupid things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do,</v>

1075
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.930
<v Speaker 1>but you imagine how complex it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

1076
00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:30.360
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to articulate the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1077
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:32.460
<v Speaker 1>But you can sure tell when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1078
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:36.240
<v Speaker 1>And you can sure tell when you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it or maybe your partner isn't.</v>

1079
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.630
<v Speaker 1>So partly what that also means is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to do things that you don't</v>

1080
00:55:39.631 --> 00:55:44.340
<v Speaker 1>know how you know how to do and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do all sorts of things that you</v>

1081
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:46.770
<v Speaker 1>don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to do in fact most of what</v>

1082
00:55:46.771 --> 00:55:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you notice like that.</v>

1083
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And so that also means that we can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing games that are extraordinarily</v>

1084
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:56.250
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and that maybe are rooted</v>
<v Speaker 1>way back in history that we don't</v>

1085
00:55:56.251 --> 00:55:59.190
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that we can't</v>

1086
00:55:59.191 --> 00:56:01.680
<v Speaker 1>describe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least we don't have an articulated</v>

1087
00:56:01.681 --> 00:56:04.290
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we could still play them.</v>

1088
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this or not,</v>

1089
00:56:07.141 --> 00:56:12.141
<v Speaker 1>but you might know it</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while back 20 years ago</v>

1090
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:18.740
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those massive online multiplayer games</v>

1091
00:56:18.741 --> 00:56:21.240
<v Speaker 1>started to become popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1092
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:24.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them I think although I don't</v>

1093
00:56:24.911 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 1>know this for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them lasted a long time and</v>

1094
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:29.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of them are still being</v>
<v Speaker 1>played like the early ones,</v>

1095
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they developed entire worlds in</v>

1096
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:32.884
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1097
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an economist who became quite</v>

1098
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 1>famous because of those games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Castro Neva,</v>

1099
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I think his name was Edward Castronova,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's right.</v>

1100
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.070
<v Speaker 1>But it's close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1101
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:46.660
<v Speaker 1>he tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought,</v>

1102
00:56:46.661 --> 00:56:48.430
<v Speaker 1>hey look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are games,</v>

1103
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:51.590
<v Speaker 1>those are countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things he tried to do</v>

1104
00:56:51.591 --> 00:56:56.200
<v Speaker 1>was to calculate their gross national</v>
<v Speaker 1>product and you know,</v>

1105
00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.210
<v Speaker 1>you can trade items in those little</v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds,</v>

1106
00:56:58.211 --> 00:56:59.044
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could,</v>

1107
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you could sell them on Ebay for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for awhile in this one game and</v>

1108
00:57:02.381 --> 00:57:05.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's still happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were young people in the</v>

1109
00:57:05.711 --> 00:57:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Philippines who are working inside these</v>
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>

1110
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:12.130
<v Speaker 1>making artifacts that they were selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Ebay to other game players because</v>

1111
00:57:12.131 --> 00:57:15.370
<v Speaker 1>they could make more money doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they could actually working in the</v>

1112
00:57:15.371 --> 00:57:17.870
<v Speaker 1>actual world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1113
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.650
<v Speaker 1>so Castronova I think what's his name</v>
<v Speaker 1>said?</v>

1114
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the real world.</v>

1115
00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not a game or if it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

1116
00:57:26.441 --> 00:57:28.750
<v Speaker 1>it's so much like the world that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the world.</v>

1117
00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And so he calculated the gross national</v>
<v Speaker 1>product of some of these massive games</v>

1118
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:35.440
<v Speaker 1>and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 30th richest country in the world</v>

1119
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.500
<v Speaker 1>was insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1120
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:42.510
<v Speaker 1>and so that's interesting because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>also shows you that the line between a</v>

1121
00:57:42.701 --> 00:57:47.701
<v Speaker 1>game and reality is not clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's another example of that.</v>

1122
00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:50.550
<v Speaker 1>It's something we're thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1123
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:55.810
<v Speaker 1>some of you have no doubt played very</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex multiplayer online games and I</v>

1124
00:57:55.811 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 1>suppose those more often those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure games or quest games and you</v>

1125
00:57:59.261 --> 00:58:02.680
<v Speaker 1>have to communicate with other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to solve problems and you</v>

1126
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:03.520
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1127
00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:07.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to defend yourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're an exploratory party in</v>

1128
00:58:07.181 --> 00:58:08.650
<v Speaker 1>a new world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1129
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it's pretty sophisticated now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1130
00:58:11.861 --> 00:58:15.400
<v Speaker 1>And some of you have worked at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's or another fast food</v>

1131
00:58:15.401 --> 00:58:16.930
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have worked at a</v>

1132
00:58:16.931 --> 00:58:17.764
<v Speaker 1>restaurant?</v>

1133
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many at a fast food restaurant?</v>

1134
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you say that an online game is</v>

1135
00:58:23.921 --> 00:58:28.150
<v Speaker 1>more like the world or less like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world then your job at a fast food</v>

1136
00:58:28.151 --> 00:58:31.360
<v Speaker 1>restaurant or more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more.</v>

1137
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Can anybody disagree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1138
00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:39.691
<v Speaker 1>Why is it more like the real world</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex stuff,</v>

1139
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.080
<v Speaker 1>but what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're exploring,</v>

1140
00:58:44.081 --> 00:58:46.420
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting out of situations.</v>

1141
00:58:46.421 --> 00:58:48.790
<v Speaker 1>You always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every new situations coming up and</v>

1142
00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with them and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning a fast food,</v>

1143
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a real car.</v>

1144
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Get fast food and the sheet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1145
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's in the real world.</v>

1146
00:58:57.761 --> 00:59:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Is it a gate and more like a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1147
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.790
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1148
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:01.623
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1149
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 1>so does that mean that McDonald's is</v>
<v Speaker 1>less real than a multiplayer online</v>

1150
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:07.294
<v Speaker 1>game?</v>

1151
00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough one a because when you're</v>

1152
00:59:11.471 --> 00:59:14.020
<v Speaker 1>trying to think about what real means</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1153
00:59:14.021 --> 00:59:16.300
<v Speaker 1>you might think maybe I phrased that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrongly,</v>

1154
00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:21.340
<v Speaker 1>I maybe I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Mcdonald's a worst model of the real</v>

1155
00:59:21.831 --> 00:59:26.831
<v Speaker 1>world than a multiplayer online game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's too hard because it's hard to</v>

1156
00:59:26.991 --> 00:59:31.430
<v Speaker 1>say that dogs is part of the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like a priority to claim is kind of</v>

1157
00:59:31.431 --> 00:59:32.450
<v Speaker 1>absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1158
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:34.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a building.</v>

1159
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 1>People actually come there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you money,</v>

1160
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:40.370
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when all you think about these</v>

1161
00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:42.080
<v Speaker 1>complex games and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1162
00:59:42.081 --> 00:59:45.710
<v Speaker 1>you're practicing and extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated forms of social and</v>

1163
00:59:45.711 --> 00:59:48.860
<v Speaker 1>intellectual behavior and we actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what that does to people.</v>

1164
00:59:48.861 --> 00:59:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it makes them extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated than social.</v>

1165
00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 1>I do think that it helps with introverts</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot,</v>

1166
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:56.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause the introverts,</v>

1167
00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:00.080
<v Speaker 1>it's harder for introverts to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely socially fluid because people</v>

1168
01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:00.914
<v Speaker 1>were the mount.</v>

1169
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:05.300
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of introverts do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy duty socializing on the net.</v>

1170
01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And my experience has been that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1171
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.610
<v Speaker 1>all things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a plus rather than a</v>

1172
01:00:10.611 --> 01:00:12.220
<v Speaker 1>minus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1173
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.850
<v Speaker 1>with regards to your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your use of computational devices</v>

1174
01:00:16.851 --> 01:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>because you grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up with them.</v>

1175
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.100
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I used to see my kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is they would sit together in the</v>

1176
01:00:22.101 --> 01:00:24.950
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were teenagers and there'd be a</v>

1177
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>bunch of their friends that were there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while they were interacting with all</v>

1178
01:00:28.701 --> 01:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>their friends who were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are also interacting with all their</v>

1179
01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:34.520
<v Speaker 1>friends who weren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a common thing for teenagers to</v>

1180
01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:35.660
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tech state.</v>

1181
01:00:35.661 --> 01:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>You're texting your friends that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and so forth.</v>

1182
01:00:37.731 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Is that reasonably standard behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have done that?</v>

1183
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>

1184
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>How many have you done that regularity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1185
01:00:45.201 --> 01:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>How many of you haven't done that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1186
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So most people have done it,</v>

1187
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:49.874
<v Speaker 1>but no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone.</v>

1188
01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:54.170
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that more advanced or less advanced</v>

1189
01:00:54.171 --> 01:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>social behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1190
01:00:56.751 --> 01:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>You think more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1191
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm like you're keeping your</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends while they're not there.</v>

1192
01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have a conceptual idea of like what</v>

1193
01:01:06.151 --> 01:01:11.151
<v Speaker 3>you're doing and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand where the dynamics are moving</v>

1194
01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.230
<v Speaker 3>without them actually having to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1195
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that you paid a price for</v>

1196
01:01:19.101 --> 01:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>it in the decrease of the intensity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social interactions you were having</v>

1197
01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>with the people who were actually there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so.</v>

1198
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.890
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1199
01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>how many people think they do pay a</v>
<v Speaker 1>price for it?</v>

1200
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people think they didn't?</v>

1201
01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:34.011
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1202
01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:35.000
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1203
01:01:35.001 --> 01:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's start with you guys then</v>

1204
01:01:36.771 --> 01:01:38.840
<v Speaker 1>because you're in a minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>

1205
01:01:38.841 --> 01:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>why do you think you didn't pay a price</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it?</v>

1206
01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1207
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that can pay a price,</v>

1208
01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:56.560
<v Speaker 3>but if you're doing it correctly then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're monitoring the conversation that</v>

1209
01:01:56.561 --> 01:01:59.080
<v Speaker 3>you're currently taking part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1210
01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:03.820
<v Speaker 3>when it would be appropriate to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone and text someone else,</v>

1211
01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:07.810
<v Speaker 3>which actually meaningful probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>paying more attention to the people</v>

1212
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:10.590
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're also having to monitor.</v>

1213
01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's your kind of taken a</v>

1214
01:02:13.151 --> 01:02:16.660
<v Speaker 1>multitasking</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationale for it.</v>

1215
01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although assuming also that you have to</v>

1216
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>your attention to manage that is there</v>
<v Speaker 1>as people who,</v>

1217
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.370
<v Speaker 1>who didn't think that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you did pay a price for who?</v>

1218
01:02:24.371 --> 01:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Who thought that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1219
01:02:26.101 --> 01:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>What sort of price?</v>

1220
01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I think that especially with text</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets lost,</v>

1221
01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.860
<v Speaker 3>convey your feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's so much more to.</v>

1222
01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they certainly lose something.</v>

1223
01:02:39.911 --> 01:02:43.030
<v Speaker 1>What about you while you're interacting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like your,</v>

1224
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:45.280
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your actual president,</v>

1225
01:02:45.281 --> 01:02:45.980
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

1226
01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.150
<v Speaker 3>I would say you have to commit to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of effort to,</v>

1227
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:51.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing the textbook,</v>

1228
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:54.050
<v Speaker 3>ignore like aspects of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1229
01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:58.370
<v Speaker 3>if they're talking about something</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you texted them when you come</v>

1230
01:02:58.371 --> 01:03:00.650
<v Speaker 3>back and miss like some.</v>

1231
01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:01.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1232
01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>so it stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started stopped,</v>

1233
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can commit yourself.</v>

1234
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.820
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you've suggested was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that some of that can be mitigated by</v>

1235
01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:13.430
<v Speaker 1>doing it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which which implies that there's an</v>

1236
01:03:13.431 --> 01:03:18.431
<v Speaker 1>emergent norm norm for doing this sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing and that if you're good at</v>

1237
01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:22.040
<v Speaker 1>complying with the norm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to be irritating</v>

1238
01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:23.940
<v Speaker 1>people and maybe you can handle things</v>
<v Speaker 1>at once.</v>

1239
01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:24.793
<v Speaker 1>Something like that</v>

1240
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:31.130
<v Speaker 3>to the people that are in there that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting for you to answer.</v>

1241
01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess one answer to that would be</v>

1242
01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.310
<v Speaker 1>that's up to them to determine like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want a big part of it,</v>

1243
01:03:37.311 --> 01:03:40.790
<v Speaker 1>then they could go do something else and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm saying that specifically</v>

1244
01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:43.580
<v Speaker 1>is because you can imagine that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the norm develops.</v>

1245
01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like obviously if a successful norm</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to develop that allows for text</v>

1246
01:03:49.401 --> 01:03:52.130
<v Speaker 1>conversation and real world</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

1247
01:03:52.131 --> 01:03:56.660
<v Speaker 1>do current the same time everybody has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to want it to happen and so that means</v>

1248
01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:59.810
<v Speaker 1>that you can't do it in the manner that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants.</v>

1249
01:03:59.811 --> 01:04:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It's going to die out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1250
01:04:01.461 --> 01:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another example of,</v>

1251
01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.410
<v Speaker 1>of the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another example of how you can</v>

1252
01:04:06.411 --> 01:04:09.950
<v Speaker 1>start thinking about how moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures might I think evolve is the</v>

1253
01:04:09.951 --> 01:04:13.760
<v Speaker 1>right way of thinking about them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think moral structure has evolved and</v>

1254
01:04:13.761 --> 01:04:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just as real as anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else that evolves.</v>

1255
01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Now evolved things can be staggeringly</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>

1256
01:04:20.391 --> 01:04:21.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just think about how many life</v>

1257
01:04:21.981 --> 01:04:25.940
<v Speaker 1>forms there are and how many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>niches there are for those life forms</v>

1258
01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.700
<v Speaker 1>and so you have in some sense an</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite variety,</v>

1259
01:04:28.701 --> 01:04:31.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's not infinite and it follows</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>

1260
01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Not just any old thing can be alive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just any old thing can be social.</v>

1261
01:04:35.841 --> 01:04:40.841
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found this out a while back.</v>

1262
01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of neuro biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

1263
01:04:48.771 --> 01:04:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Some of it hands on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of conceptual,</v>

1264
01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.990
<v Speaker 1>especially in the early days of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduate work and I got really</v>

1265
01:04:56.991 --> 01:04:59.300
<v Speaker 1>interested in the function of Serotonin</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1266
01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you all know undoubtedly that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that antidepressants do is</v>

1267
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:06.230
<v Speaker 1>decrease the rate at which Serotonin is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled back up into the neurons that</v>

1268
01:05:06.231 --> 01:05:08.570
<v Speaker 1>deliver it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to help stabilize</v>

1269
01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.770
<v Speaker 1>people's negative emotion.</v>

1270
01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Makes them less full of tile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less anxious,</v>

1271
01:05:12.051 --> 01:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>less likely to withdraw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

1272
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.070
<v Speaker 1>or you could say it makes them more</v>
<v Speaker 1>confident.</v>

1273
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Now we also know that if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say at a chimp hierarchy,</v>

1274
01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take bottom chimp and you give</v>

1275
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>him antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he starts acting more like talk</v>

1276
01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because the bottom champ,</v>

1277
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>the bottom chimps world is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous place.</v>

1278
01:05:32.231 --> 01:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>It's very uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a very good place to</v>

1279
01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:36.700
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have high quality mates,</v>

1280
01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:39.010
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have good things to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stressed man,</v>

1281
01:05:39.011 --> 01:05:41.560
<v Speaker 1>it's bad down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe that's part of the reason</v>

1282
01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 1>his nervous system is tuned so that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>more anxious and upset by everything</v>

1283
01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:47.380
<v Speaker 1>because everything actually is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

1284
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Part of that's modulated by Serotonin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1285
01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>So here's a rough rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a hierarchy in an animal</v>

1286
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>kingdom at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you move up the hierarchy,</v>

1287
01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:02.380
<v Speaker 1>your serotonin levels increase and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move down the hierarchy or serotonin</v>

1288
01:06:02.381 --> 01:06:07.000
<v Speaker 1>levels decrease and that's somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent of your absolute wealth.</v>

1289
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.990
<v Speaker 1>So here's the famous experiments called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Whitehall experiment,</v>

1290
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:14.890
<v Speaker 1>and it was done on English bureaucrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that's so cool about the</v>

1291
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:17.470
<v Speaker 1>white doll experiments as they were done</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years apart,</v>

1292
01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:22.000
<v Speaker 1>and so what they showed basically was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you take a English bureaucracy</v>

1293
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:27.100
<v Speaker 1>and you stratify it by position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Englishman or hierarchical and</v>

1294
01:06:27.101 --> 01:06:30.730
<v Speaker 1>so you stratified by position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the top people in the bottom</v>

1295
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:33.760
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at the death rates and</v>

1296
01:06:33.761 --> 01:06:37.930
<v Speaker 1>what you find is the bottom people die</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster and more often now you might say,</v>

1297
01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:40.150
<v Speaker 1>well that's partly because if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>that healthy,</v>

1298
01:06:40.151 --> 01:06:44.230
<v Speaker 1>you end up at the bottom fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there seems to be an effect over and</v>

1299
01:06:44.231 --> 01:06:48.370
<v Speaker 1>above the effect of just general health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worse to be at the bottom that at</v>

1300
01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:49.870
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1301
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:55.020
<v Speaker 1>That was true 70 years ago and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>study was done again 50 years after</v>

1302
01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:55.780
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1303
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing that's so cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been by that time,</v>

1304
01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.500
<v Speaker 1>from a material perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are at the bottom of the</v>

1305
01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:05.860
<v Speaker 1>modern hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at least as wealthy roughly</v>

1306
01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:09.670
<v Speaker 1>speaking as the people who are like two</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirds of the way up 50 years before.</v>

1307
01:07:09.671 --> 01:07:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know everybody had running</v>

1308
01:07:12.101 --> 01:07:13.960
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>

1309
01:07:13.961 --> 01:07:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

1310
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:18.250
<v Speaker 1>everyone had enough heat for the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1311
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.580
<v Speaker 1>everyone had shelter and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know when you figure with regards</v>

1312
01:07:21.581 --> 01:07:22.414
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1313
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:27.280
<v Speaker 1>once you've got running water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable shelter,</v>

1314
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:32.230
<v Speaker 1>heat and maybe air conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you live in the desert and you're not</v>

1315
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:34.750
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you've got 90 percent of what</v>

1316
01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:36.970
<v Speaker 1>wealth can deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1317
01:07:36.971 --> 01:07:41.170
<v Speaker 1>All things considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of it is status and luxury</v>

1318
01:07:41.171 --> 01:07:42.980
<v Speaker 1>items,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

1319
01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:47.920
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between positional</v>
<v Speaker 1>status and death rates remain constant,</v>

1320
01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.930
<v Speaker 1>so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting and we know that</v>

1321
01:07:52.931 --> 01:07:55.300
<v Speaker 1>that's true from a lot of other studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

1322
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:59.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like control for absolute wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still a problem with hierarchy</v>

1323
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 1>and that seems mediated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part by Serotonin and</v>

1324
01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:06.490
<v Speaker 1>serotonin regulates negative emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more negative emotion that you</v>

1325
01:08:06.491 --> 01:08:08.200
<v Speaker 1>experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more cortisol you produce.</v>

1326
01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Cortisol and high levels is toxic and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppresses your immune system so your</v>

1327
01:08:12.161 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>brain gets damaged and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gain weight and you get diabetes and</v>

1328
01:08:16.221 --> 01:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe develop Alzheimer's disease and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more prone to cancer and heart</v>

1329
01:08:19.101 --> 01:08:20.180
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of those things,</v>

1330
01:08:20.181 --> 01:08:25.181
<v Speaker 1>and so that's just not so good now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that serotonergic mechanism is really</v>

1331
01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:31.301
<v Speaker 1>old and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can give Serotonin,</v>

1332
01:08:31.631 --> 01:08:36.631
<v Speaker 1>new Jack injections to unhappy lobsters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cheers them right up at least</v>

1333
01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.770
<v Speaker 1>behaviorally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're defeated in a fight and you</v>

1334
01:08:38.771 --> 01:08:42.040
<v Speaker 1>give them a serotonin dejection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll stand up tall,</v>

1335
01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>confident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll fight again.</v>

1336
01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason I'm telling you that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very specific reason,</v>

1337
01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:51.280
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things we've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking about as well,</v>

1338
01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:54.430
<v Speaker 1>how might you conceptualize moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and then how might you</v>

1339
01:08:54.431 --> 01:08:59.431
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize their evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the propositions was there</v>

1340
01:09:00.071 --> 01:09:03.460
<v Speaker 1>are playable games and non playable</v>
<v Speaker 1>gates.</v>

1341
01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a playable game dominance</v>

1342
01:09:05.711 --> 01:09:06.544
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

1343
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:10.340
<v Speaker 1>We've been playing it for $400,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>

1344
01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.210
<v Speaker 1>It's stable now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1345
01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:15.980
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so unstable that even lobsters have</v>

1346
01:09:15.981 --> 01:09:17.450
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even worse,</v>

1347
01:09:17.451 --> 01:09:22.451
<v Speaker 1>it's so stable that the biochemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that the lobsters used to act</v>

1348
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:26.210
<v Speaker 1>within the dominance hierarchy and react</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1349
01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:31.211
<v Speaker 1>It's the same as it is in us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so not only is that stable,</v>

1350
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:32.204
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1351
01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculously stable.</v>

1352
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:37.970
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we could say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1353
01:09:37.971 --> 01:09:42.971
<v Speaker 1>one of the games that seems emergent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>real is a dominance heart.</v>

1354
01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Well then we might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what exactly constitutes a</v>

1355
01:09:47.991 --> 01:09:49.880
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we might also ask,</v>

1356
01:09:49.881 --> 01:09:51.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes a highly functional</v>

1357
01:09:51.651 --> 01:09:55.250
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy versus a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional dominance hierarchy and</v>

1358
01:09:55.251 --> 01:09:59.510
<v Speaker 1>even what does highly functional versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional meet while we have to</v>

1359
01:09:59.511 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 1>define all those terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we will as we move forward.</v>

1360
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.470
<v Speaker 1>But you see the point I'm making is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1361
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.630
<v Speaker 1>and this is a bit of a contradiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the initial statement,</v>

1362
01:10:08.631 --> 01:10:13.631
<v Speaker 1>I need that there is a tight distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the scientific world in the</v>

1363
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:18.910
<v Speaker 1>objective world because I'm also talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the evolution of games and you</v>

1364
01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:20.300
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>

1365
01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.400
<v Speaker 1>the study of evolution is obviously a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific study and the dominance</v>

1366
01:10:25.401 --> 01:10:29.030
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies a biological phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some sense it's also a game and</v>

1367
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:30.260
<v Speaker 1>it's also a moral structure.</v>

1368
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.590
<v Speaker 1>So there are levels of analysis where</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things start to get tangled</v>

1369
01:10:33.591 --> 01:10:35.900
<v Speaker 1>together and that's partly what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to try to sort out.</v>

1370
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:37.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1371
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.430
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that in the future because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1372
01:10:41.431 --> 01:10:42.300
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

1373
01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:45.543
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

1374
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.320
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to step back a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

1375
01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take a break.</v>
