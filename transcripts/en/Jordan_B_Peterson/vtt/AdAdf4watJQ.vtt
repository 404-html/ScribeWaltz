WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I remember correctly,</v>

2
00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>we stopped with the clocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.131
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

4
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:05.964
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I mentioned was </v>

5
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.004
<v Speaker 1>that the emphasis on the clocks here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to divide time up and the film makers </v>

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:21.441
<v Speaker 1>emphasize time to tell you in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're in the prosaic normal world.</v>

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>And then in a sense you could say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the clock stops,</v>

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.020
<v Speaker 1>which you'll see happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

9
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>we move into a different dimension </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think I mentioned when we went </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this last time,</v>

11
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>that young hypothesized for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was no time in the collective</v>

12
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:43.614
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that there's a </v>

13
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>strata of knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

14
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>that you can think of as outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal stream of individual life.</v>

15
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of Super Ordinance and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

16
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.253
<v Speaker 1>here's one way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty obvious that your </v>

17
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>personality can transform.</v>

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>what is it that guides that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation?</v>

20
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Because in some sense it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the thing that's transforming.</v>

21
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.783
<v Speaker 1>And you could say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place that's outside of that </v>

22
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:25.011
<v Speaker 1>transformation is this place out of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and space that you is describing.</v>

23
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same place as a long time ago,</v>

24
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a fairy tale which refers to some,</v>

25
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like you've been collapsed pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

26
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.573
<v Speaker 1>Or you can think about it like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time that passes when you're </v>

27
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:41.814
<v Speaker 1>asleep as far as your consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned because there's no real sense </v>

28
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>of duration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is if you,</v>

29
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>obviously if you wake up and remember a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>

30
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:52.770
<v Speaker 1>but even dreams take extreme liberties </v>
<v Speaker 1>with time.</v>

31
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.903
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've had the experience where</v>
<v Speaker 1>your alarm goes off and the sound is </v>

32
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.344
<v Speaker 1>incorporated into the dream and it's as </v>
<v Speaker 1>if the dream has been going on for a </v>

33
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time and the alarm </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense in the context.</v>

34
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Even though it may have only been </v>
<v Speaker 1>ringing for a few seconds.</v>

35
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Freud observed how much time could deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>dilate and extend in dreams in,</v>

36
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:13.674
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his book the interpretation of </v>

37
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:15.804
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

38
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fairly well known phenomena.</v>

39
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>So we're in time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

40
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio is already got his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in principle he's capable to speak.</v>

41
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 1>And so now we're in time and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next week we've got the created creature</v>

42
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think about that as the,</v>

43
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>as the first stage of development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way I look at it with regards to</v>

44
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>this movie is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>really the next time we see Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Japan.</v>

46
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's off to school.</v>

47
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.413
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment that ends childhood and that's </v>

48
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:53.184
<v Speaker 1>the developmental stage we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's ready to launch himself into the </v>

49
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>world or he has at least after this next</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

50
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>And so that's where we pick them up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the developmental progress is entry into</v>

51
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:03.334
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

52
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

53
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.793
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously obviously all this is </v>

54
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:53.360
<v Speaker 1>signifying the transition into </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

55
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

56
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Well we can sneak in name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

57
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

58
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 2>You are most yolks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aw,</v>

59
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.683
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

60
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at that point did your pedo expresses</v>

61
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the key element of his value</v>

62
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.264
<v Speaker 1>system as a father or you could say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>key element of his archetipal role as </v>

63
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:34.234
<v Speaker 1>the good father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of course the father is </v>

64
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>separated archetypically into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:43.261
<v Speaker 1>the positive farther in the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and you know,</v>

66
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.433
<v Speaker 1>we've already established the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition that your values guide your </v>

67
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:52.741
<v Speaker 1>perceptions and actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if it's Japan,</v>

68
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>it was fundamental desire is to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>something real well,</v>

69
00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:58.694
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know exactly what's what real </v>

70
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:00.944
<v Speaker 1>means at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we obviously know that it's not </v>

71
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:06.340
<v Speaker 1>merely a wooden marinette Marionette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Because it's contrast it with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>current state and your patio is resigned</v>

73
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>to the fact that that's a highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>improbable event.</v>

74
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't necessarily always </v>
<v Speaker 1>occur.</v>

75
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.973
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's a hint in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>context of the movie of a variety of </v>

76
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

77
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>But one of them is that it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the case that people get out</v>

78
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:26.984
<v Speaker 1>of the marionette stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I think the thing that makes you </v>

79
00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 1>pedal a good father rather than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible father,</v>

80
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>a son devouring father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

81
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>is that he's actually aiming at </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing an autonomous individual.</v>

82
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.213
<v Speaker 1>And so that also means he's aiming to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce something that will transcend </v>

83
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>him and leave him right and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of operating on it on his own.</v>

84
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the very definition of a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

85
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why he's invested in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>process so far.</v>

86
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 1>That's his goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know the background,</v>

87
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>we know that he's a master carver and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like he's a good guy.</v>

88
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.724
<v Speaker 1>He likes kittens and he likes fish and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he likes to sing and he likes music and </v>

89
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>he likes to play and he likes to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>toys.</v>

90
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are all,</v>

91
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 1>and his place is comfortable and warm </v>
<v Speaker 1>and inviting and all of those things.</v>

92
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:15.224
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very maternal element to it </v>

93
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 1>almost because you know the house is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>cozy and so well kept.</v>

94
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.200
<v Speaker 1>You might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

95
00:07:23.201 --> 00:07:24.034
<v Speaker 1>where's the feminine element?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to wait very long before </v>

96
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 1>you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a clue about that.</v>

97
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.413
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happens next is that the star </v>

98
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>that we saw at the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

99
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 1>when it was shining over a scene that </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked very much like a,</v>

100
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 1>like a Bethlehem Nativity scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that star makes its reappearance.</v>

101
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 1>And we already talked about what a star </v>
<v Speaker 1>might represent,</v>

102
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>but we'll go over it very briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

103
00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:49.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a star represents a light shining in the</v>

104
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:50.654
<v Speaker 1>darkness and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a symbol of value and purity and </v>

105
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 1>light and illumination and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>

106
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's also something that transcends </v>
<v Speaker 1>the horizon.</v>

107
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 1>It's above the horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that Japan,</v>

108
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 1>no wishes on this star and what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wishes is that Pinocchio,</v>

109
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.023
<v Speaker 1>he could become a real boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what the film is </v>

110
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:15.431
<v Speaker 1>indicating through that ritualistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>gesture is that the desire to produce an</v>

111
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:17.084
<v Speaker 1>individual period or the forces that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to conspire to produce an </v>

112
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 1>individual cannot be brought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless the,</v>

113
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>the participants in that process have </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated their,</v>

114
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.803
<v Speaker 1>their value structure to something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's beyond what's immediately </v>

115
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:34.930
<v Speaker 1>evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might even say secular or,</v>

116
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or earthly or,</v>

117
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know those are all medieval terms,</v>

118
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:39.194
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's really the idea that unless </v>

119
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:46.061
<v Speaker 1>you raise your eyes above normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal value structure,</v>

120
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>you won't be able to participate in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

121
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 1>if we make reference back to the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Buddha,</v>

123
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 1>you remember when the angel comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit the Buddha,</v>

124
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>he tells us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tells a story.</v>

125
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.023
<v Speaker 1>When the angel comes to visit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist farther before the Buddha is </v>

126
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:01.614
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tells him that his son is either </v>

127
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.600
<v Speaker 1>going to be a spiritual leader or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great king.</v>

128
00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And of course the Buddhist farther being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a practical man immediately goes for the</v>

129
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.040
<v Speaker 1>great king theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

130
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>he stuck to earthly desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

131
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>And instead of looking for something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's transcendent,</v>

132
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

133
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:23.430
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes transcendent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say a variety of things that</v>

134
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>we'll explore in the course of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

135
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:26.124
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways that you might </v>

136
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:28.914
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it as that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between horace and no cyrus </v>

137
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's the difference between oh </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus and the union of Horace and earth.</v>

138
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look at it.</v>

139
00:09:37.241 --> 00:09:38.074
<v Speaker 1>I either of those ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember now when horace goes to </v>

140
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:41.754
<v Speaker 1>rescue a cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to go back into the underworld </v>

141
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 1>and haul his father out of the depths </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as fathers down,</v>

142
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of half blind and three </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters to dad then.</v>

143
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.810
<v Speaker 1>And so the transcendent things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is often represented by the eye,</v>

144
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also often wreck.</v>

145
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>You see this in Christian symbolism of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair bit.</v>

146
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:02.991
<v Speaker 1>So on top of cathedrals in the dome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often what you'll see is tears of people</v>

147
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.123
<v Speaker 1>and or tiers of angels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the top you'll either see </v>

148
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.244
<v Speaker 1>God the father or Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea there is that what that </v>

149
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 1>represents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say the logos,</v>

150
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly equivalent to horace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean men,</v>

151
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I probably told you this,</v>

152
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:24.621
<v Speaker 1>but horace and Christ share many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many features in common.</v>

153
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the notion is,</v>

154
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:30.990
<v Speaker 1>is that as the methodology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity developed,</v>

155
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 1>it encapsulated a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the symbolism and story that was already</v>

156
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 1>present in the Egyptian myths and </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporated into the,</v>

157
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.443
<v Speaker 1>into the new religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that surprising that they </v>

158
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:43.224
<v Speaker 1>share a parallels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very useful to know what the </v>

159
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 1>parallels mean.</v>

160
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.180
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pyramid of power,</v>

161
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:49.014
<v Speaker 1>there's a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something that stands </v>

162
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:55.190
<v Speaker 1>outside the hierarchy that fixes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and reshapes it and gives rise</v>

163
00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

164
00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:00.840
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fixes it and shapes it and gives rise</v>

165
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's something that you might</v>

166
00:11:04.561 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 1>think about as roughly equivalent to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous individual.</v>

167
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Because at that point you're no longer a</v>
<v Speaker 1>marionette and tell us,</v>

168
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 1>so piaget's highest stage of moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

169
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when children hit that stage,</v>

170
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.860
<v Speaker 1>if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not all do,</v>

171
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.430
<v Speaker 1>instead of conceiving of morality as </v>
<v Speaker 1>following the rules you conceive of,</v>

172
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 1>morality is following the rules when </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's appropriate,</v>

173
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.840
<v Speaker 1>but adjusting the rules when that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

174
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 1>And so you start to view yourself not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only as a follower of the tradition,</v>

175
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:33.204
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only has something that's </v>

176
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:35.484
<v Speaker 1>obedient but also as something that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>a say in what the game is going to be </v>

177
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:40.200
<v Speaker 1>going forward.</v>

178
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:41.843
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to surmise that what </v>

179
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:45.504
<v Speaker 1>Japan is trying to produce since he </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't producing and Marionette is </v>

180
00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 1>something that has a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomy and thus the,</v>

181
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to interact as an autonomous </v>

182
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>being with his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his own cultural context.</v>

183
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>So now he knows that it's unlikely and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also a transcendent wish.</v>

184
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of outside the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy because you,</v>

185
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you could say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

186
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:07.324
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want your child to become an </v>

187
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 1>engineer or a lawyer or a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heaven forbid a psychologist.</v>

188
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:12.514
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense all of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant in relationship to this more </v>

189
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:17.014
<v Speaker 1>transcendent goal because you can get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place of transcendence pretty much </v>

190
00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:26.290
<v Speaker 1>through any disciplinary pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a disciplinary pathway,</v>

191
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>but which one doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What matters is how you conduct yourself</v>

192
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 1>while you're on the disciplinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway.</v>

193
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.150
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.993
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting observation too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's another thought that </v>

195
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.213
<v Speaker 1>radically undermines the idea of moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>relativism because the idea is while </v>

196
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:44.404
<v Speaker 1>there can be many disciplinary systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in a sense that borrowers to the </v>

197
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:50.704
<v Speaker 1>idea of moral relativism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there can't be a situation where </v>

198
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:56.080
<v Speaker 1>there's no disciplinary system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

199
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:59.670
<v Speaker 1>part of that is obviously that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are inculturated creatures and,</v>

200
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just cannot exist in the absence of a</v>

201
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.970
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say we can't exist.</v>

202
00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Well in the absence of an optimized </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary system,</v>

203
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.140
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your pedo wishes upon this star.</v>

204
00:13:16.221 --> 00:13:17.054
<v Speaker 1>And so he makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes content contact with something </v>

205
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:23.920
<v Speaker 1>that's outside the normative world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well we'll see how that unfolds.</v>

206
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

207
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.740
<v Speaker 1>See Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was also a little bit of a trickster,</v>

208
00:13:54.741 --> 00:13:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you saw that quite repeatedly.</v>

209
00:13:56.661 --> 00:13:57.494
<v Speaker 1>He Makes Pinocchio Fall over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kicks his little cat in the rear end </v>

210
00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:04.940
<v Speaker 1>with the puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's making him go open the window.</v>

211
00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Like he's playing little tricks all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

212
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.213
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trickster figure is a very complex </v>

213
00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:10.574
<v Speaker 1>and interesting figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo describe the trickster as a </v>

214
00:14:12.531 --> 00:14:16.040
<v Speaker 1>psychopomp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a psychopomp is someone who mediates</v>

215
00:14:16.041 --> 00:14:16.874
<v Speaker 1>between conscious and unconscious life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about that in </v>

216
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:25.070
<v Speaker 1>relationship to comedians because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians always do and what jokes often</v>

217
00:14:25.071 --> 00:14:28.850
<v Speaker 1>do is revealed truths that no one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to face.</v>

218
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the more extreme the comedian,</v>

219
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.700
<v Speaker 1>the more likely they are to transgress </v>
<v Speaker 1>social norms.</v>

220
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar caneously making you laugh,</v>

221
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see,</v>

222
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell Peters for example,</v>

223
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.870
<v Speaker 1>all he does is tell racist jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:14:44.871 --> 00:14:45.704
<v Speaker 1>and everyone in the audience is thrilled</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it even though they're all there </v>

225
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>in an essence identified with ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

226
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls on the Arabs and then he makes </v>

227
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:55.634
<v Speaker 1>fun of them and they all cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he calls on the Indians and </v>

228
00:14:57.431 --> 00:15:00.220
<v Speaker 1>makes fun of them and they all cheer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese.</v>

229
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.353
<v Speaker 1>And it's a relief for everyone to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that sphere of the unspeakable </v>

230
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.463
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it puts everybody in a place of </v>

231
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 1>transcendence because for a moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're outside their ethnic identity,</v>

232
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can laugh at themselves as </v>

233
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 1>something that can stand outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own definition.</v>

234
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Speaker 1>And so a psychopomp is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.883
<v Speaker 1>Freud also talked a fair bit about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to humor because he said </v>

236
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.833
<v Speaker 1>like slips of the tongue and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can also often use them as as </v>

237
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:33.710
<v Speaker 1>doorways in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into unconscious contents.</v>

238
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:36.860
<v Speaker 1>And there's just no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you listen to people very,</v>

239
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:37.694
<v Speaker 1>very carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll make little jokes or little </v>

240
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 1>unconscious slips and you can see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trained to see it.</v>

241
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 1>You can see whole complexes of of often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:52.400
<v Speaker 1>terribly chaotic masses underneath those</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things.</v>

243
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And so their portals in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the underworld.</v>

244
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.583
<v Speaker 1>It also is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see this when people talk about </v>

245
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 1>their dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this numerous times where I'll</v>

246
00:16:01.491 --> 00:16:02.324
<v Speaker 1>have someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do is I have people bring me </v>

247
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 1>their dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they remember them,</v>

248
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:09.410
<v Speaker 1>they've written them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I listened to them once and let</v>

249
00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:14.411
<v Speaker 1>my imagination start playing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I go have the person,</v>

250
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:15.523
<v Speaker 1>they read the dream out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I have them go through it sentence </v>

251
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:19.640
<v Speaker 1>by sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

252
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:20.603
<v Speaker 1>we do what's essentially free </v>
<v Speaker 1>association from a psychoanalytic </v>

253
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:24.260
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

254
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 1>if they talk about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say a big box department store,</v>

255
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>

256
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.240
<v Speaker 1>what first comes to mind when you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that?</v>

257
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.493
<v Speaker 1>And they'll have associations and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of lays out the cloud of concepts </v>

258
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Speaker 1>that surround that particular image.</v>

259
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.050
<v Speaker 1>And so you keep doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding it.</v>

260
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:44.540
<v Speaker 1>And I'll throw in my associations as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

261
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.450
<v Speaker 1>And then we have a discussion about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

262
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>how that might pertain to the current </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of their life.</v>

263
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:51.194
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like understanding a book in some </v>

264
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:59.021
<v Speaker 1>sense or understanding of movie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>often know what's so cool is that if you</v>

265
00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:01.214
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really listen to people when they use </v>

266
00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:04.844
<v Speaker 1>words to describe their dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll use sentences that mean two </v>

267
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.294
<v Speaker 1>things at the same time and one will </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean it will be a description of the </v>

268
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.043
<v Speaker 1>actual images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick content of the dream and at the </v>

269
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:18.164
<v Speaker 1>same time it will be a description of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means and people don't even </v>

270
00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:23.720
<v Speaker 1>notice when they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

271
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.763
<v Speaker 1>You have to detach yourself and listen </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully because if you're following </v>

272
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.593
<v Speaker 1>only the semantics of the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you'll see is the reference to the </v>

273
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:33.524
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

274
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.460
<v Speaker 1>But if you remember simultaneously that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream pertains to their life,</v>

275
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 1>then you can often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had an example for you,</v>

276
00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:41.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

277
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I actually have dreams recorded from one</v>
<v Speaker 1>client,</v>

278
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:49.890
<v Speaker 1>about 50 of them in a row all laid out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're thinking where we're,</v>

279
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.443
<v Speaker 1>the plan is to put that into book form </v>
<v Speaker 1>and publish it because there isn't </v>

280
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:55.620
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

281
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.053
<v Speaker 1>so there are these holes portals through</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can pass into an unconscious </v>

282
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:01.344
<v Speaker 1>realm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know this look when you're </v>

283
00:18:03.871 --> 00:18:04.704
<v Speaker 1>having a conversation with people you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know now and then if it's a group </v>

284
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:08.034
<v Speaker 1>conversation now and then someone will </v>
<v Speaker 1>say something that brings the </v>

285
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:12.120
<v Speaker 1>conversation to a halt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

286
00:18:12.121 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 1>You can think of it as a non sequitur </v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

287
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that a non sequitur </v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that doesn't fall.</v>

288
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.673
<v Speaker 1>And so particularly an unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who isn't following the trail of </v>

289
00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:23.534
<v Speaker 1>the conversation will pipe up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and it brings everyone to a </v>

290
00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:26.754
<v Speaker 1>halt.</v>

291
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person has just manifested part of their</v>

292
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 1>own unconscious structure at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inopportune time.</v>

293
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.113
<v Speaker 1>And it's like everyone's on one story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then bang another one comes to to </v>

294
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:41.250
<v Speaker 1>join it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

295
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.233
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person isn't on the same </v>

296
00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:46.410
<v Speaker 1>wavelength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

297
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.960
<v Speaker 1>There is somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

298
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.690
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can figure out where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and generally speaking,</v>

299
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 1>that is far from pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

300
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:56.964
<v Speaker 1>because as Freud pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that you tend to keep </v>

301
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.000
<v Speaker 1>unconscious are not the most positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about you.</v>

302
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:03.834
<v Speaker 1>At least you don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be lots of positive down </v>

303
00:19:06.241 --> 00:19:07.074
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

304
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to only get to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the negative.</v>

305
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

306
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:16.330
<v Speaker 1>a trickster figure who's playing tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I think I,</v>

307
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

308
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I had an experience once when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembering,</v>

309
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I had a memory that from when I was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

310
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 1>my father had this friend who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian,</v>

311
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.430
<v Speaker 1>very good friend who basically served me</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a grandfather.</v>

312
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.730
<v Speaker 1>And I can remember when I'm just very </v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

313
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:33.564
<v Speaker 1>three or four sitting on the floor on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rug between this man and my father with </v>

314
00:19:38.751 --> 00:19:41.280
<v Speaker 1>that fireplace going and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>farmhouse,</v>

315
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.010
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very warm place and a very nice family.</v>

316
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoyed going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my dad and this gentleman whose name</v>

317
00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Speaker 1>is Nick Zinner off would sit and talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while he was doing that,</v>

318
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I would take my fist and try to hit his </v>
<v Speaker 1>toes,</v>

319
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while he was conversing,</v>

320
00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:59.460
<v Speaker 1>he'd move his toes around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we were playing this game and now</v>

321
00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 1>and then my dad would say rather kindly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

322
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 1>enquire whether or not I was bothering </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and he would say,</v>

323
00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:07.591
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

324
00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:10.920
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized just recently that partly</v>

325
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:13.740
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing with his tricks was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharpening me up,</v>

326
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm trying to hit a moving </v>

327
00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>

328
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he keeps moving it and that means</v>

329
00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I have to adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

330
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a goal directed activity training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:20:24.841 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 1>and I know with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you,</v>

332
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're willing in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>or carving them.</v>

333
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:31.284
<v Speaker 1>I think carving is the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you interact with them </v>

334
00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:36.960
<v Speaker 1>attentively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more sharp and focused they get.</v>

335
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And I can see people walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street with no problem,</v>

336
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.220
<v Speaker 1>who I know were never played with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they sort of lumber along there,</v>

337
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.510
<v Speaker 1>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

338
00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not carved and attentive.</v>

339
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.203
<v Speaker 1>They're vagan unshaped and I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of them as uncarved blocks to </v>

340
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Taoist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uncarved block is what the world is made</v>

341
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 1>out of before you encounter it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be anything,</v>

342
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

343
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:06.510
<v Speaker 1>and often I've also dealt with children </v>
<v Speaker 1>in places like preschool where I can see</v>

344
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:08.560
<v Speaker 1>the kids who are sharp and who've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>played with.</v>

345
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.393
<v Speaker 1>They know exactly all you have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at them with a little bit of a </v>

346
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 1>playful glint and they'll laugh and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ready.</v>

347
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the kids that haven't be played </v>
<v Speaker 1>with there so pathetic know,</v>

348
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.743
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this in the literal sense of the </v>

349
00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:21.731
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

350
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:22.151
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

351
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:22.984
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievably pathetic to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll sit down and the kid lumber </v>

352
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:30.490
<v Speaker 1>over kind of blindly even and sit right </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your lap,</v>

353
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's basically,</v>

354
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.823
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a four year old kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three year old kid that's like pre </v>

355
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:40.030
<v Speaker 1>toddler behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all they know how to do.</v>

356
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.190
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have a kid that does that,</v>

357
00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 1>just go and sit on a stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so desperate for attention,</v>

358
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 1>they can't even help it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're so far behind,</v>

359
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 1>the other kids can't even play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

360
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like playing with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overgrown infant,</v>

361
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.793
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that time it's damn near </v>

362
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:56.140
<v Speaker 1>hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

363
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.450
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

364
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 1>this use of humor and tricks and teasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that,</v>

365
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean it can get mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 1>if it's not bounded properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to stay on the funny side of,</v>

367
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:08.703
<v Speaker 1>of Tz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're constantly playing with </v>

368
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:13.960
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sharpen up.</v>

369
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.450
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricksters do.</v>

370
00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:20.230
<v Speaker 1>So I used to steal my daughter's dessert</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time when she was little,</v>

371
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.423
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the time she started sitting </v>

372
00:22:22.751 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 1>at the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was about probably 10 months older</v>

373
00:22:26.561 --> 00:22:27.400
<v Speaker 1>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:22:27.401 --> 00:22:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get her to look out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>window or something like that.</v>

375
00:22:30.461 --> 00:22:32.440
<v Speaker 1>And every time she did it I'd take her </v>
<v Speaker 1>dessert.</v>

376
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:33.663
<v Speaker 1>And so she got very good at it after a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while she could tell when I was joking </v>

377
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:39.190
<v Speaker 1>and when there was actually something </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

378
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.930
<v Speaker 1>And by the time there she was about </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

379
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:41.764
<v Speaker 1>I could hardly ever fooled her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And soon after that she learned a new </v>

380
00:22:44.561 --> 00:22:45.394
<v Speaker 1>trick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was if I told her to look at </v>

381
00:22:47.051 --> 00:22:47.884
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she grabbed her dessert and then turn </v>

382
00:22:49.481 --> 00:22:52.030
<v Speaker 1>and look at it and put it back down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

383
00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:52.864
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could really see this with mark </v>

384
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.533
<v Speaker 1>probably to some degree more with my son</v>
<v Speaker 1>than my daughter because he was an </v>

385
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 1>ornery little rap and very disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very disagreeable child.</v>

386
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.633
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the big five traits sense and </v>

387
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.440
<v Speaker 1>you'd lay down a rule for that kid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he would worry that thing to death.</v>

388
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the rule.</v>

389
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.133
<v Speaker 1>You have to be embedded date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well do you mean seven 59 do you mean </v>

390
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:20.750
<v Speaker 1>seven 59 and 30 seconds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about 79 you know,</v>

391
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:25.770
<v Speaker 1>seven 59 and 50 seconds or maybe eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>oh two or maybe eight oh five.</v>

392
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.273
<v Speaker 1>And just constant battling right on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>edge to find out exactly where the </v>

393
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:36.310
<v Speaker 1>contours of the social structure was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that is also playing around</v>

394
00:23:36.311 --> 00:23:37.144
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're ever wondering why your </v>

395
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.360
<v Speaker 1>children are teasing you and bothering </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

396
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:41.194
<v Speaker 1>because they will do that nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly because nothing is more </v>

397
00:23:44.771 --> 00:23:45.604
<v Speaker 1>valuable to a child and adult attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>and partly because they're trying to </v>

398
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:52.520
<v Speaker 1>figure out who the hell you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because you're the,</v>

399
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:53.703
<v Speaker 1>you're the Avatar of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and so they want to know </v>

400
00:23:55.671 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 1>everything they possibly can about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to leave you alone.</v>

401
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.380
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all comment on the utility of the</v>

402
00:24:03.381 --> 00:24:04.460
<v Speaker 1>trickster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

403
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:05.294
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that tricks your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters sometimes from a </v>

404
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 1>methodological point of view is trick </v>
<v Speaker 1>you into behaving properly,</v>

405
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with humor or something like that.</v>

406
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:14.204
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why the trickster is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mediator between the normal domain of </v>

407
00:24:18.831 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 1>consciousness in the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent archetypal realm.</v>

408
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.653
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

409
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

410
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 2>First Star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

411
00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Which</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

412
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:13.700
<v Speaker 2>my thing of Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just thing</v>

413
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.203
<v Speaker 3>very loving.</v>

414
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.393
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a couple of interesting </v>

415
00:25:27.271 --> 00:25:28.680
<v Speaker 1>things that happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

416
00:25:28.681 --> 00:25:30.780
<v Speaker 1>first you see that cuts back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket.</v>

417
00:25:30.781 --> 00:25:32.050
<v Speaker 1>So it's clearly that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

418
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.160
<v Speaker 1>he's clearly involved in this and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to see what's happening.</v>

419
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.593
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course he comments that </v>

420
00:25:38.131 --> 00:25:40.050
<v Speaker 1>that's not a practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

421
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in,</v>

422
00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.103
<v Speaker 1>in some sense that's exactly right </v>
<v Speaker 1>because practical basically means </v>

423
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.130
<v Speaker 1>instruction and how to climb the </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular hierarchy.</v>

424
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:51.913
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impractical means no instruction </v>

425
00:25:53.161 --> 00:25:56.220
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a transcendent practicality,</v>

426
00:25:56.221 --> 00:26:00.000
<v Speaker 1>which is more like how to operate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this space between hierarchies.</v>

427
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more than practical.</v>

428
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 1>You could think about it as metta </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>

429
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.593
<v Speaker 1>And I think really the purpose of most </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious ed education when it's still </v>

430
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:14.600
<v Speaker 1>grounded in its original materials so to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

431
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 1>is to catalyze this Mehta identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

432
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:20.300
<v Speaker 1>it's sophisticated being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

433
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Can you give me,</v>

434
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:24.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

435
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best example I know is the story of </v>

436
00:26:27.271 --> 00:26:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Horus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to relate it to your own</v>

437
00:26:29.581 --> 00:26:31.170
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:26:31.171 --> 00:26:32.670
<v Speaker 1>so here's an example.</v>

439
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.760
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

440
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.470
<v Speaker 3>sorry we're late.</v>

441
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:40.831
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

442
00:26:40.831 --> 00:26:41.664
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's outside of principles because </v>

443
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 1>principals have already been laid down </v>
<v Speaker 1>as rules,</v>

444
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.660
<v Speaker 1>but rules have their problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

445
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:53.490
<v Speaker 1>because once you formulate something</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a static manner,</v>

446
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you limit the number of situations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it can apply to.</v>

447
00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we couldn't say,</v>

448
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 1>well don't never kill another human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

449
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good rule of thumb.</v>

450
00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 1>But there are situations where it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenable.</v>

451
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.423
<v Speaker 1>There has to be something that operates </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the rule framework that </v>

452
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.733
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that extracts out the spirit of the </v>

453
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a way of thinking about it.</v>

454
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.333
<v Speaker 4>Universal.</v>

455
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what this is.</v>

456
00:27:28.641 --> 00:27:31.280
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't call it a principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would call it more of,</v>

457
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.263
<v Speaker 1>it's more like a process and the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>is tightly aligned with paying </v>

458
00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:37.910
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>

459
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.850
<v Speaker 1>You're playing a musical piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

460
00:27:40.851 --> 00:27:41.684
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're practicing that piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is building a motor </v>

461
00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:45.530
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

462
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.050
<v Speaker 1>you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to do it.</v>

463
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.303
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you practice and practice and you're </v>

464
00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:51.434
<v Speaker 1>automating these motor routines and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're driving the action from your </v>

465
00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:55.274
<v Speaker 1>whole cortex to the left hemisphere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then backwards and making these little </v>

466
00:27:58.101 --> 00:28:01.520
<v Speaker 1>micro machines that are specialized for </v>
<v Speaker 1>these operations.</v>

467
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:06.590
<v Speaker 1>But let's say you make a mistake while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you attend to that,</v>

468
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a,</v>

469
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.813
<v Speaker 1>that's a trigger of error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what you do is slow down and </v>

470
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.520
<v Speaker 1>analyze the motor programs that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>already programmed and you see where the</v>

471
00:28:16.521 --> 00:28:17.354
<v Speaker 1>error is and then you correct it slowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and practice the correction that </v>

472
00:28:20.351 --> 00:28:22.220
<v Speaker 1>practice the correction and practice the</v>
<v Speaker 1>correction.</v>

473
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.760
<v Speaker 1>So what you're doing in a sense is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tuning the hierarchy,</v>

474
00:28:25.761 --> 00:28:26.594
<v Speaker 1>the automated hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that I'm talking about is </v>

475
00:28:29.331 --> 00:28:30.164
<v Speaker 1>the thing that pays attention to error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might be the best way of of </v>

476
00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.860
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that pays attention to</v>

477
00:28:36.861 --> 00:28:37.694
<v Speaker 1>error or there can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also the thing that moves up </v>

478
00:28:39.831 --> 00:28:40.664
<v Speaker 1>and down hierarchies and tries to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>the optimal level of analysis for </v>

479
00:28:44.781 --> 00:28:49.310
<v Speaker 1>correction and then does the correction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that can be minimal,</v>

480
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's down at the real,</v>

481
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>details of motor output.</v>

482
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:54.523
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes it can be revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can tell you a couple of </v>

483
00:28:58.371 --> 00:29:03.371
<v Speaker 1>mythological rifts on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Horace is represented.</v>

484
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Remember Marta?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marta is represented mostly as the force</v>

485
00:29:09.351 --> 00:29:13.460
<v Speaker 1>that that goes into combat with ty Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So chaos.</v>

486
00:29:13.461 --> 00:29:15.770
<v Speaker 1>But that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So chaos is what emerges.</v>

487
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.353
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the social order is disruptive </v>

488
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.680
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a minor way.</v>

489
00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:22.514
<v Speaker 1>He also organize the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes up at the top because you </v>

490
00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:27.800
<v Speaker 1>remember before he's willing to go fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>time mad.</v>

491
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.993
<v Speaker 1>He forces all the gods to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to organize themselves and to proclaim </v>

492
00:29:32.151 --> 00:29:36.110
<v Speaker 1>him king of the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's two things.</v>

493
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.850
<v Speaker 1>He's the principal at the top or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process at the top of the hierarchy,</v>

494
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 1>eyes and mouth,</v>

495
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:43.893
<v Speaker 5>and he's the determiner of destiny's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is explicitly stated in the </v>

496
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:50.710
<v Speaker 5>Mesopotamian myth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as that thing,</v>

497
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 5>his primary role is to go and combat </v>
<v Speaker 5>chaos.</v>

498
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the time the Egyptians come along,</v>

499
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.010
<v Speaker 5>there's two major problems that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>emerging as sort of architectural.</v>

500
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.290
<v Speaker 5>I would say one is while there's still </v>
<v Speaker 5>the underworld to deal with,</v>

501
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:08.620
<v Speaker 5>that's chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the other one is the rot of previous</v>

502
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:12.040
<v Speaker 5>structures and that's Cyrus and seth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

503
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:13.690
<v Speaker 5>Because you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could think of,</v>

504
00:30:13.691 --> 00:30:15.400
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cyrus is only protective.</v>

505
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.413
<v Speaker 5>You're culture is functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's protecting him for the terrible </v>

506
00:30:18.611 --> 00:30:21.310
<v Speaker 5>element of Mother Nature and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>working perfectly.</v>

507
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.790
<v Speaker 5>But the problem is it doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfectly for two reasons.</v>

508
00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:25.624
<v Speaker 5>One is it just decays with time because </v>
<v Speaker 5>yesterday's solutions are not </v>

509
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:30.034
<v Speaker 5>necessarily appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Today's circumstance and it sped along </v>

510
00:30:34.421 --> 00:30:35.254
<v Speaker 5>by people's unwillingness to attend to </v>
<v Speaker 5>errors and correct them refusal to do </v>

511
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:39.934
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's refusal to make the proper </v>

512
00:30:41.411 --> 00:30:42.370
<v Speaker 5>sacrifices.</v>

513
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.980
<v Speaker 5>So that's what gets cane in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

514
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.023
<v Speaker 5>he will not make the right sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody kindly sent me another </v>

515
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:50.374
<v Speaker 5>translation of Gods gods conversation </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Cain when Cain goes to complain </v>

516
00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:58.990
<v Speaker 5>about the nature of being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and God basically tells him straight out</v>

517
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Speaker 5>that if he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if things aren't going well for him,</v>

518
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.203
<v Speaker 5>it's his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it lays explicit stress on the </v>

519
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:09.730
<v Speaker 5>idea that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason that things are going</v>

520
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:12.310
<v Speaker 5>wrong for cane is that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not doing the right thing.</v>

521
00:31:12.311 --> 00:31:14.800
<v Speaker 5>It's not only the arbitrary decision of </v>
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

522
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.800
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the thing,</v>

523
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:18.723
<v Speaker 5>the thing that stands above in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense is the thing that corrects errors </v>

524
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.710
<v Speaker 5>or you could eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could say,</v>

525
00:31:23.711 --> 00:31:24.544
<v Speaker 5>you could say that in a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 5>different manner because one of the </v>

526
00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:27.154
<v Speaker 5>things that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been trying to figure out in some </v>

527
00:31:30.191 --> 00:31:32.590
<v Speaker 5>sense what might constitute the highest </v>
<v Speaker 5>virtue.</v>

528
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.730
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think it's an answerable </v>
<v Speaker 5>question actually,</v>

529
00:31:36.731 --> 00:31:41.731
<v Speaker 5>because there there's an interdependent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an interdependence of virtues.</v>

530
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:43.863
<v Speaker 5>I think the primary decision that people</v>
<v Speaker 5>make is whether or not you want to make </v>

531
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.750
<v Speaker 5>being better or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

532
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Speaker 5>that's the pinnacle of any of any </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularized hierarchy.</v>

533
00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.610
<v Speaker 5>So you're always making that decision </v>
<v Speaker 5>better works better or worse,</v>

534
00:31:57.611 --> 00:32:00.670
<v Speaker 5>better or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to make it better,</v>

535
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 5>then you're the optimal tool you have is</v>
<v Speaker 5>true.</v>

536
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 5>And then if you're in that hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing that stands above it,</v>

537
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:09.100
<v Speaker 5>the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

538
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.960
<v Speaker 5>or the transcendent feature is the thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that attends to error and repairs.</v>

539
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.513
<v Speaker 5>And if you squelch that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is exactly what happened in the </v>

540
00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:19.743
<v Speaker 5>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the whole bloody system starts to </v>

541
00:32:21.311 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 5>shake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

542
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.230
<v Speaker 5>the psyche because people have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>falsify their experience constantly,</v>

543
00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:28.300
<v Speaker 5>never updating it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never repairing it.</v>

544
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.610
<v Speaker 5>And then the whole bloody system starts </v>
<v Speaker 5>to oscillate too because you can't voice</v>

545
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.050
<v Speaker 5>your detection of error.</v>

546
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.930
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in part of the utility of free speech,</v>

547
00:32:37.931 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 5>and this is precisely utility of free </v>
<v Speaker 5>speech,</v>

548
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 5>is that people get to voice their error </v>
<v Speaker 5>detection.</v>

549
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might be wrong.</v>

550
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.840
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody has to figure that out.</v>

551
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:53.290
<v Speaker 5>But if you stop people from objecting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the system can't correct itself and</v>

552
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.210
<v Speaker 5>it will become corrupt because it does </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

553
00:32:56.211 --> 00:33:01.211
<v Speaker 5>But it'll just careen off the path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what Japan was doing,</v>

554
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.533
<v Speaker 5>what he's trying to do in generating a </v>
<v Speaker 5>genuine individual is to produce an </v>

555
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:09.080
<v Speaker 5>entity that's related to the divine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hence the star,</v>

556
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:13.020
<v Speaker 5>but whose function is to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

557
00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.340
<v Speaker 5>to be socialized by the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then to repair it.</v>

558
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:21.370
<v Speaker 5>Now that's manifested most particularly </v>
<v Speaker 5>in this movie on a couple of levels.</v>

559
00:33:22.881 --> 00:33:23.714
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio has to make minor course </v>

560
00:33:25.791 --> 00:33:26.471
<v Speaker 5>corrections.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

561
00:33:26.471 --> 00:33:30.110
<v Speaker 5>he makes mistakes and gets off the path </v>
<v Speaker 5>and has to return.</v>

562
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.140
<v Speaker 5>So that alters his character.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes,</v>

563
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.520
<v Speaker 5>sometimes in a way that's a mixed </v>
<v Speaker 5>blessing to say the leaks,</v>

564
00:33:38.521 --> 00:33:40.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause he's damaged by deviation from the</v>

565
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:41.744
<v Speaker 5>path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But so that's one part of </v>

566
00:33:44.991 --> 00:33:45.824
<v Speaker 5>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this movie takes the transformation </v>

567
00:33:48.831 --> 00:33:49.664
<v Speaker 5>all the way to its logical conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because in order for Pinocchio to </v>

568
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:56.240
<v Speaker 5>completely catalyze his transformation </v>
<v Speaker 5>into an autonomous individual,</v>

569
00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:00.650
<v Speaker 5>he has to go to the very depths,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right in the bottom of the underworld to</v>

570
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:04.970
<v Speaker 5>the most monstrous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's from that rescues his father.</v>

571
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.710
<v Speaker 5>It's the same story as the story of o </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrusone Horace.</v>

572
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 5>And there's an idea there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

573
00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:12.680
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the ideas.</v>

574
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:14.893
<v Speaker 5>You will not understand the value of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your culture until you face the thing </v>

575
00:34:18.741 --> 00:34:23.460
<v Speaker 5>you're most afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what this story means.</v>

576
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:24.923
<v Speaker 5>And it's partly because you can't tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the utility of the ideas are until </v>

577
00:34:28.741 --> 00:34:33.741
<v Speaker 5>you experienced a situation where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>most profound ideas become necessary.</v>

578
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.900
<v Speaker 5>And that won't happen unless you face </v>
<v Speaker 5>something terrible.</v>

579
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:38.603
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

580
00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.613
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

581
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:43.071
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

582
00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:43.904
<v Speaker 5>what the movie is doing is constantly </v>
<v Speaker 5>hinting at what that transcend that and </v>

583
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.280
<v Speaker 5>figure is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

584
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.163
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I would say what human beings have </v>

585
00:34:51.321 --> 00:34:52.154
<v Speaker 5>been doing ever since we became self </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscious was attempting to define the </v>

586
00:34:56.421 --> 00:34:59.870
<v Speaker 5>parameters of ideal Ba.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

587
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.063
<v Speaker 5>and a religious story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Buddhism and Christianity are very </v>

588
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:11.360
<v Speaker 5>intent on specifying the nature of ideal</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ba.</v>

589
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.700
<v Speaker 5>And the reason they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's because they,</v>

590
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 5>they match ideal being against</v>
<v Speaker 5>mortality.</v>

591
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 5>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

592
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.850
<v Speaker 5>we faced this terrible problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the one outlined in the fall.</v>

593
00:35:22.851 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 5>He's the one outlined in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Buddhist,</v>

594
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inability to go home.</v>

595
00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:28.490
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the same idea.</v>

596
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.103
<v Speaker 5>There's a mode of being that allows </v>
<v Speaker 5>people to live properly and for society </v>

597
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 5>to be maintained in the face of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is what's</v>

598
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.873
<v Speaker 1>that ideal mode of being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is we'd been trying to </v>

599
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 1>figure that out individually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectively ever since history began.</v>

600
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:46.883
<v Speaker 1>And what we have as a record of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trail of profound religious ideas </v>

601
00:35:51.931 --> 00:35:52.980
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

602
00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:53.814
<v Speaker 1>that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're leaving behind us as we move </v>

603
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:56.604
<v Speaker 1>through time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't understand why those are </v>

604
00:35:58.441 --> 00:36:02.910
<v Speaker 1>useful until they become necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't go deep enough,</v>

605
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't go deep enough into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>

606
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

607
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 1>your conception of good is pretty</v>

608
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:16.470
<v Speaker 1>unsophisticated and naive until you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what its opposite is.</v>

609
00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've encountered a fair bit of that,</v>

610
00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:23.763
<v Speaker 1>I would say in my psychotherapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice because a lot of the problems </v>

611
00:36:27.671 --> 00:36:28.504
<v Speaker 1>that I attempted to solve that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted in individual and then also in </v>

612
00:36:32.471 --> 00:36:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the family because there's almost no </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier between those two things.</v>

613
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:38.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a trip.</v>

614
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like Donald Tastes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inferno,</v>

615
00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you start at one level of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really not too bad.</v>

616
00:36:43.211 --> 00:36:46.210
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like vacation hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

617
00:36:46.211 --> 00:36:47.044
<v Speaker 1>and that's like the outside circle in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dante's inferno where the ancient </v>

618
00:36:50.561 --> 00:36:51.910
<v Speaker 1>philosophers were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:36:51.911 --> 00:36:52.744
<v Speaker 1>they weren't Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as far as the Catholics were </v>

620
00:36:54.791 --> 00:36:56.530
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't going to be in paradise,</v>

621
00:36:56.531 --> 00:37:00.460
<v Speaker 1>but they were starting about the Chief </v>
<v Speaker 1>Club Med version of hell.</v>

622
00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:06.090
<v Speaker 1>And then Dante takes you down layer by </v>
<v Speaker 1>layer to the ultimate hell that's at the</v>

623
00:37:06.131 --> 00:37:06.560
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

624
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.870
<v Speaker 1>And in that hell in Dante is poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the betrayers are.</v>

625
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's also where Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

626
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.330
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I get this confused with </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise lost.</v>

627
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:17.343
<v Speaker 1>That's where Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the archetipal figure of evil is </v>

628
00:37:19.631 --> 00:37:23.200
<v Speaker 1>lodged and immobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immobilized right at the center.</v>

629
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.273
<v Speaker 1>And so the journey is down to the lowest</v>
<v Speaker 1>level into the underworld to encounter </v>

630
00:37:27.791 --> 00:37:28.624
<v Speaker 1>the archetype of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's at that point that religious </v>

631
00:37:31.421 --> 00:37:35.710
<v Speaker 1>stories start to become the values that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are put forth in religious stories start</v>

632
00:37:35.711 --> 00:37:40.711
<v Speaker 1>to become crucially necessary cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the only thing you have that can</v>

633
00:37:41.471 --> 00:37:45.880
<v Speaker 1>fortify you against that level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

634
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

635
00:37:48.611 --> 00:37:49.444
<v Speaker 1>so partly what this developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>process is supposed to be accomplishing </v>

636
00:37:52.691 --> 00:37:56.830
<v Speaker 1>is the production of a personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's capable of doing that.</v>

637
00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

638
00:38:00.221 --> 00:38:03.040
<v Speaker 1>part of partly I figured this out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part because I was,</v>

639
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of meditation on the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I read about,</v>

640
00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.900
<v Speaker 1>about the concentration camps in Germany</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the Soviet Union,</v>

641
00:38:10.901 --> 00:38:11.734
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things that were worse than that </v>

642
00:38:12.851 --> 00:38:15.490
<v Speaker 1>because there are things that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the world that are far worse</v>

643
00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:15.880
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

644
00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I think the worst things I ever found </v>
<v Speaker 1>were the actions of unit.</v>

645
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember one 72 it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese unit that went into China.</v>

646
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

647
00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:30.190
<v Speaker 1>it's so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's traumatizing to read,</v>

648
00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.593
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly what I was doing when I was </v>

649
00:38:32.891 --> 00:38:33.724
<v Speaker 1>going through that material was trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to imagine myself as the person who did </v>

650
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:41.260
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

651
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 1>that's no game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

652
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:43.444
<v Speaker 1>like if you're really imagining it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to put yourself in the </v>

653
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:47.284
<v Speaker 1>place where you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a terrible thing to realize </v>

654
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:52.564
<v Speaker 1>that you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to realize that that's part of your </v>

655
00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:55.294
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until you realize that you don't </v>

656
00:38:57.791 --> 00:39:01.240
<v Speaker 1>have enough motivation to mess with any </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that are actually profound,</v>

657
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:07.140
<v Speaker 1>it's just too difficult and unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So well.</v>

658
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.670
<v Speaker 1>So we'll continue with this.</v>

659
00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.013
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

660
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.771
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

661
00:39:47.771 --> 00:39:51.660
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that appears to be the case,</v>

662
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have two hemispheres,</v>

663
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.713
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that appears to be that </v>

664
00:39:56.491 --> 00:39:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you need to neural networks in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate the world,</v>

665
00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you need one to produce stable warbles </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality and you need another two.</v>

666
00:40:04.351 --> 00:40:05.184
<v Speaker 1>Identify deviations from that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>feed the process deviation information </v>

667
00:40:10.171 --> 00:40:13.290
<v Speaker 1>slowly into the system that imposes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable view.</v>

668
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

669
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I don't have the details of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this quite right,</v>

670
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.560
<v Speaker 1>but if you train a neural network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

671
00:40:22.561 --> 00:40:23.394
<v Speaker 1>to identify birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it learns how to do that and to </v>

672
00:40:25.651 --> 00:40:29.190
<v Speaker 1>identify fish and it learns how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you feed it a penguin,</v>

673
00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.043
<v Speaker 1>then all birds become fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is the anomaly blows the </v>

674
00:40:34.651 --> 00:40:37.890
<v Speaker 1>category structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the category structure now ranges</v>

675
00:40:37.891 --> 00:40:38.910
<v Speaker 1>from fish to birth.</v>

676
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.373
<v Speaker 1>And so in order to prevent that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a separate system that deals </v>

677
00:40:42.571 --> 00:40:46.080
<v Speaker 1>with exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's what we have in our right and</v>

678
00:40:46.081 --> 00:40:46.914
<v Speaker 1>left hemispheres roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what the right hemisphere does is </v>

679
00:40:49.921 --> 00:40:53.070
<v Speaker 1>identify anomalies and start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate a theory around it.</v>

680
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a fantasy essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you were asleep at night,</v>

681
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.863
<v Speaker 1>while you're dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right hemisphere is communicating </v>

682
00:41:00.121 --> 00:41:00.954
<v Speaker 1>with the left hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left hemisphere is categorical </v>

683
00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:03.564
<v Speaker 1>structures loosen up and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that in the dream because </v>

684
00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:08.010
<v Speaker 1>things become somewhat irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

685
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.353
<v Speaker 1>And then the brain plays with how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might recategorize information in the </v>

686
00:41:13.141 --> 00:41:16.950
<v Speaker 1>least damaging fashion in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate this new information.</v>

687
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:21.420
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what's happening at night.</v>

688
00:41:21.421 --> 00:41:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is basically updating itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very important process.</v>

689
00:41:25.351 --> 00:41:30.270
<v Speaker 1>If you deprive people of dream sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become psychotic and quite quickly.</v>

690
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's a nontrivial necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

691
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.143
<v Speaker 5>now this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is complicated so that we've got </v>

692
00:41:38.961 --> 00:41:39.794
<v Speaker 5>this bug now and he's the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's awake and he's being driven mad </v>

693
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:44.450
<v Speaker 5>by time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's happening here.</v>

694
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 5>And you'll see his eyes start to move </v>
<v Speaker 5>independently.</v>

695
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 5>And that's a very common cartoon </v>
<v Speaker 5>representation of insanity.</v>

696
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.243
<v Speaker 5>And it's quite interesting because one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the things that you see in </v>

697
00:41:54.531 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 5>schizophrenia is eye movements that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious.</v>

698
00:41:58.850 --> 00:41:59.683
<v Speaker 5>And so it's as if you've got voluntary I</v>
<v Speaker 5>direction fields at the front of your </v>

699
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:05.660
<v Speaker 5>brain and involuntary ones at the base </v>
<v Speaker 5>of your brain.</v>

700
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:06.943
<v Speaker 5>And when you're dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the involuntary ones are the ones that </v>

701
00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:11.690
<v Speaker 5>are in control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you track a moving object,</v>

702
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 5>that's also the involuntary one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can,</v>

703
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:15.284
<v Speaker 5>you can experience this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you put your finger up here and </v>

704
00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:18.470
<v Speaker 5>track that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's no problem.</v>

705
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:20.630
<v Speaker 5>Smooth vision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

706
00:42:20.631 --> 00:42:21.464
<v Speaker 5>now try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Try to move your eyes that smoothly </v>

707
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:24.980
<v Speaker 5>without having that thing to track.</v>

708
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 5>Try it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you do this first,</v>

709
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.260
<v Speaker 5>don't move your head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just track it.</v>

710
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:32.330
<v Speaker 5>You'll see it and feel your eyes moving </v>
<v Speaker 5>smoothly.</v>

711
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now put your finger down.</v>

712
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 5>Now try to move your eyes that smoothly </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can't do it.</v>

713
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.660
<v Speaker 5>You go Chu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chu,</v>

714
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.210
<v Speaker 5>Chu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chu,</v>

715
00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.043
<v Speaker 5>Chu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's partly because the old eye </v>

716
00:42:41.631 --> 00:42:45.230
<v Speaker 5>movement system is more sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 5>than the new eye movement system.</v>

717
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.273
<v Speaker 5>One of the things you see in </v>
<v Speaker 5>schizophrenia is that the person is </v>

718
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:49.783
<v Speaker 5>using voluntary eye movements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's emergent grip of control </v>

719
00:42:54.261 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 5>over the eye movements by these archaic </v>
<v Speaker 5>parts of the brain.</v>

720
00:42:57.021 --> 00:42:57.854
<v Speaker 5>And you could think about that as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>emergence of the dream up into waking </v>

721
00:43:00.831 --> 00:43:05.270
<v Speaker 5>consciousness and that's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the schizophrenia symptomatology.</v>

722
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 5>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so anyways,</v>

723
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:09.320
<v Speaker 5>back to this bug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

724
00:43:09.321 --> 00:43:12.560
<v Speaker 5>so what is the bug do while we know he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with a star,</v>

725
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.633
<v Speaker 5>we know he's a tramp and we've already </v>
<v Speaker 5>covered the possibility that he stands </v>

726
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:20.480
<v Speaker 5>for those things that bug you.</v>

727
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.673
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that I would suggest </v>

728
00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:26.240
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is union idea,</v>

729
00:43:26.241 --> 00:43:27.074
<v Speaker 5>is that those things that bug you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>the portals both to the unconscious </v>

730
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 5>world or to the underworld and also the </v>
<v Speaker 5>portal to further development.</v>

731
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:35.803
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's part of an error detection </v>

732
00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:37.844
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's say you walk into your house </v>

733
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:40.160
<v Speaker 5>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>

734
00:43:40.161 --> 00:43:42.890
<v Speaker 5>that really bugs me at why does it bug </v>
<v Speaker 5>you?</v>

735
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.460
<v Speaker 5>Well it's because your anomaly detection</v>
<v Speaker 5>system is saying,</v>

736
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:48.410
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something out of kilter here.</v>

737
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.220
<v Speaker 5>This territory is not property mapped or</v>
<v Speaker 5>not property groomed.</v>

738
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.450
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause you can map,</v>

739
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:54.523
<v Speaker 5>you can make your map accurate by </v>
<v Speaker 5>changing the map or changing the </v>

740
00:43:56.751 --> 00:43:57.584
<v Speaker 5>territory either way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes the thing to do is change </v>

741
00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:01.094
<v Speaker 5>the territory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't remap your bedroom when it's </v>

742
00:44:03.681 --> 00:44:04.514
<v Speaker 5>messy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you clean it up so that it matches the </v>

743
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:07.304
<v Speaker 5>map.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so lots of times you walk into your </v>

744
00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:10.610
<v Speaker 5>house and something bugs you and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

745
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.920
<v Speaker 5>that's an anomaly detection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you might say,</v>

746
00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:13.754
<v Speaker 5>it really bugs me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well or you'll say it really bugs me </v>

747
00:44:16.671 --> 00:44:18.140
<v Speaker 5>when my mother does that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

748
00:44:18.141 --> 00:44:18.690
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

749
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:19.523
<v Speaker 5>you go investigate that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And see where you get and that'll take </v>

750
00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:25.460
<v Speaker 5>you right down to the depths to find out</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly why that's happening.</v>

751
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.810
<v Speaker 5>And it might be depths in her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it might be depths in newer,</v>

752
00:44:28.811 --> 00:44:30.440
<v Speaker 5>it might be depths in both of you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

753
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 5>and it's just</v>

754
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:36.210
<v Speaker 1>a bloody nightmare to get to the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that because first of all,</v>

755
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.060
<v Speaker 1>people will block you at every level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

756
00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they'll do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about it.</v>

757
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you'll do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>

758
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 1>And then if you chase them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you that you're,</v>

759
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something associated with the scum of </v>

760
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:51.870
<v Speaker 1>the earth and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you won't leave them alone.</v>

761
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:52.943
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll get angry and then they'll </v>

762
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:58.530
<v Speaker 1>burst into tears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you can still pursue it,</v>

763
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.140
<v Speaker 1>then you can have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no one,</v>

764
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:06.350
<v Speaker 1>hardly anyone ever gets to that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just have to be brutal to,</v>

765
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:10.740
<v Speaker 1>to peck your way through those defenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way you're going to do it is if</v>

766
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:11.574
<v Speaker 1>you're more afraid of that stupid thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing than you are of the terrible </v>

767
00:45:16.321 --> 00:45:18.570
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to have to fix it.</v>

768
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.350
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think you can be that scared</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you know what's at the bottom.</v>

769
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 1>You think that is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

770
00:45:26.131 --> 00:45:28.380
<v Speaker 1>if you know what not good means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that new think,</v>

771
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:29.223
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can have a fight for a couple of </v>

772
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.200
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

773
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.510
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing compared to where this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading,</v>

774
00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or where it to where it's from.</v>

775
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.610
<v Speaker 1>But people will rarely do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see when you have your,</v>

776
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.860
<v Speaker 1>you establish your intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>

777
00:45:40.861 --> 00:45:41.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a critical element of forging a </v>

778
00:45:45.001 --> 00:45:45.834
<v Speaker 1>longterm union because there will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about you and your partner that </v>

779
00:45:51.421 --> 00:45:52.254
<v Speaker 1>bug each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are places where your maps do </v>

780
00:45:54.931 --> 00:45:55.764
<v Speaker 1>not coincide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that's for cultural and </v>

781
00:45:58.381 --> 00:45:59.214
<v Speaker 1>familial differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes it's because one or both </v>

782
00:46:02.461 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 1>of you is deviating seriously from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper script.</v>

783
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.300
<v Speaker 1>And those are hellacious fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

784
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:10.134
<v Speaker 1>And those are the sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen when someone gets really upset </v>

785
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:13.374
<v Speaker 1>about nothing.</v>

786
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:16.530
<v Speaker 1>You think that's not about nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

787
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.000
<v Speaker 1>it's like the nothing is is one hair on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a camel or something like that.</v>

788
00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:21.834
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't have the damn camel </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the hair and even if it's one </v>

789
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:28.560
<v Speaker 1>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a camel around so,</v>

790
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.540
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

791
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.740
<v Speaker 1>what bugs you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's that anomaly detector saying</v>

792
00:46:34.741 --> 00:46:35.574
<v Speaker 1>something isn't right now you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the things that could be not </v>

793
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:40.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be the external world,</v>

794
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:44.430
<v Speaker 1>it could be someone else and their value</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and their behavior.</v>

795
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.593
<v Speaker 1>It could be your value structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and when the thing that comes </v>

796
00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:49.494
<v Speaker 1>up that bugs you hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know which of those it is and </v>

797
00:46:52.381 --> 00:46:56.130
<v Speaker 1>one of your tendencies and is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be to say it's the outside world or that</v>

798
00:46:56.131 --> 00:47:00.450
<v Speaker 1>other person because the last place you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to look as inside and that,</v>

799
00:47:00.451 --> 00:47:01.284
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reason that I find </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly find university campuses </v>

800
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:05.363
<v Speaker 1>intolerable because the default theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>when something isn't right is that it's </v>

801
00:47:10.111 --> 00:47:11.670
<v Speaker 1>someone else's fault.</v>

802
00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.713
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is pathological beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief because the step from someone </v>

803
00:47:16.021 --> 00:47:19.860
<v Speaker 1>else's fault too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be punished for that is it's</v>

804
00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:21.630
<v Speaker 1>trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insignificant.</v>

805
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.093
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the default position might be it's your </v>

806
00:47:25.081 --> 00:47:30.081
<v Speaker 1>God damn fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find where you went wrong and fix it.</v>

807
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

808
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.350
<v Speaker 1>how can I be at fault?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

809
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.470
<v Speaker 1>think about it for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll figure it out.</v>

810
00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a very useful technique.</v>

811
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're fighting with someone that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

812
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you hit an impasse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

813
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:44.080
<v Speaker 1>You can't get anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're misunderstanding each other,</v>

814
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your tempers are flaring and you </v>

815
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:48.280
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it lasts for a week.</v>

816
00:47:48.281 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go sit on your bed and you think,</v>

817
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:53.284
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably did something stupid in the </v>

818
00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:58.510
<v Speaker 1>last like three years that set me up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this somehow.</v>

819
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:00.183
<v Speaker 1>And if you just allow yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine your memory will take you to </v>

820
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:05.614
<v Speaker 1>some bloody idiotic thing that you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might seem to be only tenuously </v>

821
00:48:09.491 --> 00:48:13.120
<v Speaker 1>related to the current circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's the best you can offer.</v>

822
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're only 5% at fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you go tell the person while I</v>

823
00:48:17.801 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 1>was thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me to that I set this up</v>

824
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're all shorted out because</v>

825
00:48:24.971 --> 00:48:28.510
<v Speaker 1>you know you've admitted fault and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be allows them to admit fault.</v>

826
00:48:28.511 --> 00:48:33.340
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to drive the spike home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can often have a dialogue,</v>

827
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:34.413
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get the dialogue until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to see yourself as a </v>

828
00:48:38.831 --> 00:48:39.950
<v Speaker 1>contributor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

829
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And the alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a terrible alternative,</v>

830
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:44.830
<v Speaker 1>is that you win the argument with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>

831
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that because all of that </v>

832
00:48:49.661 --> 00:48:53.980
<v Speaker 1>will do is make the person who's better </v>
<v Speaker 1>at formulating the arguments,</v>

833
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.100
<v Speaker 1>the tyrant and the person who's worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slave.</v>

834
00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And then you got to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

835
00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:00.910
<v Speaker 1>is this slave what you want as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner?</v>

836
00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:05.040
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the answer's yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could easily be because Japan,</v>

837
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:05.883
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could've just as easily picked the but </v>

838
00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.040
<v Speaker 1>over the boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

839
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:12.220
<v Speaker 1>so there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>

840
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.113
<v Speaker 1>the thing that bugs you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think about that as a moral </v>

841
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:15.784
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you go to work and </v>

842
00:49:18.761 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 1>something bugs you and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

843
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I can just ignore that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

844
00:49:22.631 --> 00:49:27.631
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure your whole damn brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>is telling you there's a hole there,</v>

845
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:29.043
<v Speaker 1>there's a hole in the fabric of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>and something terrible is going to come </v>

846
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 1>out of it unless you do something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

847
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.441
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

848
00:49:35.441 --> 00:49:36.274
<v Speaker 1>I'll ignore that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all that happens is the whole grows </v>

849
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:41.320
<v Speaker 1>and the monsters inside of it get bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get weaker.</v>

850
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.860
<v Speaker 1>And so eventually what happens is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole gets really big.</v>

851
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.440
<v Speaker 1>You get really small and something comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and eats you,</v>

852
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.633
<v Speaker 1>so you get fired or you get royally </v>
<v Speaker 1>screwed over at work or something like </v>

853
00:49:51.971 --> 00:49:52.150
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

854
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.983
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe someone sets up a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're implicating something you </v>

855
00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:00.280
<v Speaker 1>didn't even do and then you get fired </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know it,</v>

856
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.233
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to end there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all because you didn't pay </v>

857
00:50:03.941 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 1>attention to that thing that was bugging</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

858
00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.270
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was,</v>

859
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.313
<v Speaker 1>you were supposed to say to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily annoying coworker to </v>

860
00:50:12.311 --> 00:50:15.100
<v Speaker 1>leave you the hell alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when it,</v>

861
00:50:15.101 --> 00:50:19.000
<v Speaker 1>when it was still possible to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even cause I politely,</v>

862
00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:20.943
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you understand that your brain is </v>

863
00:50:23.051 --> 00:50:23.884
<v Speaker 1>an early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an early warning system and the things </v>

864
00:50:26.141 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 1>that bug you are markers for holes</v>

865
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.903
<v Speaker 5>in Mba,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it's a hell of a lot easier to </v>

866
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:32.120
<v Speaker 5>attend to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

867
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 5>one more thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I first watched this film,</v>

868
00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 5>or the first dozen times I watched it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

869
00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:39.884
<v Speaker 5>I was struck by the concordance between </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jimminy cricket and the figure of </v>

870
00:50:42.681 --> 00:50:43.514
<v Speaker 5>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's weird because obviously </v>

871
00:50:45.171 --> 00:50:49.790
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio to some degree is that is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>infant save you,</v>

872
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.620
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then you have the cricket,</v>

873
00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:55.340
<v Speaker 5>his initials are JC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he serves as the conscience,</v>

874
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a moral guy.</v>

875
00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.470
<v Speaker 5>So they're kind of inter twined in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very weird way.</v>

876
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.210
<v Speaker 5>And when I was thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cricket as the Voice of value,</v>

877
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought it kind of thought about it as</v>

878
00:51:07.251 --> 00:51:11.690
<v Speaker 5>an omniscient voice has a divine voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's not how the film portrays it.</v>

879
00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.080
<v Speaker 5>What happens is it's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens is,</v>

880
00:51:15.081 --> 00:51:18.140
<v Speaker 5>is that Pinocchio develops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his conscience develops.</v>

881
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:20.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a dialogue between </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

882
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:21.224
<v Speaker 5>So the conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the conscious starts by just spouting </v>

883
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:27.890
<v Speaker 5>rules and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your conscience does this to you all the</v>

884
00:51:27.891 --> 00:51:28.724
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you watch what's going on in your </v>

885
00:51:30.291 --> 00:51:32.540
<v Speaker 5>head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll see that it continually</v>

886
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.460
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

887
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:38.210
<v Speaker 5>assaults you with doubts and questions </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the validity of your Ba.</v>

888
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:39.830
<v Speaker 5>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you notice,</v>

889
00:51:39.831 --> 00:51:40.664
<v Speaker 5>and I dealt with this with people a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the criticisms are sort of </v>

890
00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:44.930
<v Speaker 5>generic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

891
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:45.764
<v Speaker 5>it's like a chattering critic and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can ignore a lot of it once you learn </v>

892
00:51:48.951 --> 00:51:51.680
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you know like the criticism,</v>

893
00:51:51.681 --> 00:51:54.450
<v Speaker 5>you're no good that's useless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so low,</v>

894
00:51:54.451 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 5>low resolution,</v>

895
00:51:57.090 --> 00:52:01.500
<v Speaker 5>you just can't do anything with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the film indicates,</v>

896
00:52:01.501 --> 00:52:02.334
<v Speaker 5>and this is a very sophisticated ideas </v>
<v Speaker 5>that as you start making moral </v>

897
00:52:04.981 --> 00:52:05.814
<v Speaker 5>judgments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first judgments your make your mate </v>

898
00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:10.680
<v Speaker 5>are going to be low resolution and </v>
<v Speaker 5>generic.</v>

899
00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:11.813
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be cliched.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as you attempt to hone yourself and </v>

900
00:52:15.541 --> 00:52:18.390
<v Speaker 5>maybe you start fixing the errors in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

901
00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:19.643
<v Speaker 5>in your mode of being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then your ability to detect errors gets </v>

902
00:52:22.621 --> 00:52:23.454
<v Speaker 5>better and better and finer and finer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so at some point you get to the </v>

903
00:52:26.371 --> 00:52:27.204
<v Speaker 5>point where you're shipshape enough so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're going to detect little </v>

904
00:52:30.121 --> 00:52:32.580
<v Speaker 5>deviations and jump on those suckers </v>
<v Speaker 5>right away.</v>

905
00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:37.350
<v Speaker 5>And you won't even no one leave a notice</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you just fixed the problem.</v>

906
00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:40.620
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you read any Dallas writings like the</v>

907
00:52:40.621 --> 00:52:42.150
<v Speaker 5>Dao de chain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once,</v>

908
00:52:42.151 --> 00:52:44.430
<v Speaker 5>you know what I just told you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>read the Tao Te Ching,</v>

909
00:52:44.431 --> 00:52:46.710
<v Speaker 5>it'll make perfect sense because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dow,</v>

910
00:52:46.711 --> 00:52:48.840
<v Speaker 5>which is the pathway between chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 5>order,</v>

911
00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:51.300
<v Speaker 5>the Dow is what you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>follow.</v>

912
00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:52.403
<v Speaker 5>And the Dow is exactly what allows you </v>
<v Speaker 5>to avoid conflict without anybody even </v>

913
00:52:56.821 --> 00:52:58.080
<v Speaker 5>notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

914
00:52:58.081 --> 00:52:58.914
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see the thing pop out when there's </v>

915
00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:01.944
<v Speaker 5>nothing to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can just smooth it over maybe even </v>

916
00:53:03.811 --> 00:53:07.950
<v Speaker 5>gently and no one even notices that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>did anything so</v>

917
00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.200
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's something to aim for.</v>

918
00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.570
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's definitely something game for it.</v>

919
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.990
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

920
00:53:15.991 --> 00:53:17.500
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen in my own life,</v>

921
00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:21.550
<v Speaker 5>the best path to that is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the best path.</v>

922
00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.950
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

923
00:53:23.951 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 5>part of what you might be thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that as you're willing</v>

924
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 1>to face the things that bug you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when you intervene,</v>

925
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:30.780
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

926
00:53:30.781 --> 00:53:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

927
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll even make the situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

928
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.890
<v Speaker 1>But one of the consequences of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will learn something.</v>

929
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.620
<v Speaker 1>And so the more you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

930
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:44.850
<v Speaker 1>the more you're informed and the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>you turn on your capacity to,</v>

931
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.261
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

932
00:53:46.261 --> 00:53:47.094
<v Speaker 1>Creatively confront.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sharper you get and the better you </v>

933
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:51.450
<v Speaker 1>get at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

934
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

935
00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:55.194
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a pretty wobbly </v>

936
00:53:57.091 --> 00:53:59.760
<v Speaker 1>system because what the hell do you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about fixing things?</v>

937
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
<v Speaker 1>But if you practice it a thousand times </v>
<v Speaker 1>or 10,000 times or 100,000 times,</v>

938
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:07.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get very good at it.</v>

939
00:54:07.651 --> 00:54:08.484
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what this film </v>
<v Speaker 1>portrays is there's this dialog between </v>

940
00:54:11.851 --> 00:54:12.684
<v Speaker 1>the generic conscience and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe think about that as the superego </v>

941
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.840
<v Speaker 1>or something akin to the 10 commandments</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

942
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:19.883
<v Speaker 1>General principles of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a dialogue between the </v>

943
00:54:22.651 --> 00:54:23.484
<v Speaker 1>individual and these general principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>of value so that the value principles </v>

944
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:31.020
<v Speaker 1>are updated and the individual gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharper and sharper.</v>

945
00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:33.570
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of that.</v>

946
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.660
<v Speaker 1>So there's the scene in the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament.</v>

947
00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:39.300
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happens quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently in the New Testament,</v>

948
00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.580
<v Speaker 1>and this is eventually why Christ gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucified,</v>

949
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.360
<v Speaker 1>is that he does moral things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>forbidden.</v>

950
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.360
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

951
00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:52.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of episodes where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sabbath Day when you're not supposed</v>

952
00:54:52.171 --> 00:54:53.004
<v Speaker 1>to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And someone comes into the synagogue or </v>

953
00:54:55.651 --> 00:54:59.160
<v Speaker 1>the temple and their hand is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>withered up and he fixes their hand.</v>

954
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:03.030
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody was pretty freaked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out about that whole fixing thing.</v>

955
00:55:03.031 --> 00:55:07.080
<v Speaker 1>But they also accused him of breaking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>divine rule.</v>

956
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:12.030
<v Speaker 1>And his answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the sabbath made for man or a man for</v>

957
00:55:12.031 --> 00:55:12.864
<v Speaker 1>the Sabbath?</v>

958
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:14.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very,</v>

959
00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:15.534
<v Speaker 1>you got to understand that that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably revolutionary answer </v>

960
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.433
<v Speaker 1>because the prevailing morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's always the prevailing morality </v>

961
00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:26.901
<v Speaker 1>was follow the damn rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his action and response was not when</v>

962
00:55:27.781 --> 00:55:30.180
<v Speaker 1>they don't serve the purpose for which </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were intended.</v>

963
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 1>And so there's another explicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement of that in,</v>

964
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.860
<v Speaker 1>in the New Testament is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

965
00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:40.230
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

966
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:45.450
<v Speaker 1>by the time this story emerges in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental story,</v>

967
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:49.620
<v Speaker 1>the Pharisees and the scribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could roughly think about that as</v>

968
00:55:49.621 --> 00:55:52.110
<v Speaker 1>the priests and the lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that powerful,</v>

969
00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:56.400
<v Speaker 1>powerful clique are already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they already want to get rid of this guy</v>

970
00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:57.773
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to trap him into </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying something that's outright </v>

971
00:56:01.021 --> 00:56:03.480
<v Speaker 1>heretical so they can lock them up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill them.</v>

972
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And so the lawyers are always coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>around them,</v>

973
00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:07.013
<v Speaker 1>pestering him with complex ethical ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hope that it will trip up and </v>

974
00:56:09.991 --> 00:56:10.824
<v Speaker 1>make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things they ask him </v>

975
00:56:12.931 --> 00:56:15.390
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of the 10 commandments is the most</v>

976
00:56:15.391 --> 00:56:16.770
<v Speaker 1>important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

977
00:56:16.771 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:21.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a hierarchy of principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

979
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:22.410
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

980
00:56:22.411 --> 00:56:23.800
<v Speaker 1>no matter what he says he's,</v>

981
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.890
<v Speaker 5>he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if you say,</v>

982
00:56:26.891 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 5>what is the most important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you say the others are less important.</v>

983
00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:32.590
<v Speaker 5>And so you can get hung out to dry on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your argument.</v>

984
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.210
<v Speaker 5>But that isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

985
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.500
<v Speaker 5>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

986
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:37.503
<v Speaker 5>love thy neighbor as thyself and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>says all of the commandments are </v>

987
00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:42.483
<v Speaker 5>emanations of that single principle just</v>
<v Speaker 5>bypasses the question completely </v>

988
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:47.680
<v Speaker 5>brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's brilliant.</v>

989
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.753
<v Speaker 5>It's a paradigm shift in mood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course that makes the people who </v>

990
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:53.344
<v Speaker 5>are pursuing him even more angry because</v>
<v Speaker 5>he made them into fools and showed them </v>

991
00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 5>how advanced his ability to debate was </v>
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>

992
00:56:59.471 --> 00:57:00.304
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there's one other scene that </v>

993
00:57:01.961 --> 00:57:02.920
<v Speaker 5>comes to mind where,</v>

994
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:06.660
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's in this,</v>

995
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:07.523
<v Speaker 5>in this situation where he's being </v>
<v Speaker 5>accused of undermining tradition and </v>

996
00:57:11.101 --> 00:57:11.934
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's asked what his relationship is to </v>

997
00:57:13.771 --> 00:57:14.604
<v Speaker 5>the tradition and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't come here to break the </v>

998
00:57:16.351 --> 00:57:19.350
<v Speaker 5>traditional rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I came here as their fulfillment.</v>

999
00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.900
<v Speaker 5>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's those sorts of things.</v>

1000
00:57:21.901 --> 00:57:25.010
<v Speaker 5>You see those in these mythological </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories and you think it's,</v>

1001
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.333
<v Speaker 5>I do not buy for a second that that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>invented in any normative sense of the </v>

1002
00:57:31.051 --> 00:57:31.884
<v Speaker 5>word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No statements are so sophisticated that </v>

1003
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:36.210
<v Speaker 5>there that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's unbelievable.</v>

1004
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:38.460
<v Speaker 5>They are so sophisticated now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1005
00:57:38.461 --> 00:57:39.294
<v Speaker 5>I see them emerging as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 5>a very lengthy development of </v>

1006
00:57:42.481 --> 00:57:45.300
<v Speaker 5>mythological imagination and knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

1007
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:49.420
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't understand.</v>

1008
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:50.254
<v Speaker 5>I cannot understand for a moment how </v>
<v Speaker 5>that could have possibly been thought </v>

1009
00:57:52.841 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So at least not by a single individual.</v>

1010
00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:57.483
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did the idea there too is that </v>

1011
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:01.023
<v Speaker 5>passing through the narrow streets of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>rule system is one of the ways to </v>

1012
00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.140
<v Speaker 5>emerging on the other side of the rule </v>
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

1013
00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.690
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1014
00:58:10.691 --> 00:58:14.290
<v Speaker 5>and that's all with regards to proper </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships with the great father.</v>

1015
00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:18.810
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other thing too is that if you allow</v>

1016
00:58:18.811 --> 00:58:21.630
<v Speaker 5>yourself to be passed through that </v>
<v Speaker 5>disciplinary process,</v>

1017
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.720
<v Speaker 5>you also have firsthand experience of </v>
<v Speaker 5>its errors,</v>

1018
00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.970
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you want to fix the system,</v>

1019
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.550
<v Speaker 5>unless you subject yourself to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>system,</v>

1020
00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:32.250
<v Speaker 5>how in the world are you ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>know what it did wrong?</v>

1021
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.713
<v Speaker 5>You can't just stand from the outside as</v>
<v Speaker 5>an observer without having been passed </v>

1022
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:39.300
<v Speaker 5>through it at every level and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1023
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:41.070
<v Speaker 5>this is how it needs to be fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1024
00:58:41.071 --> 00:58:45.810
<v Speaker 5>what the hell do you know about it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no direct personal experience so</v>

1025
00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:48.240
<v Speaker 5>you don't necessarily even have a right </v>
<v Speaker 5>to comment.</v>

1026
00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.560
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things human suggested </v>
<v Speaker 5>should,</v>

1027
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a boggling idea,</v>

1028
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:25.940
<v Speaker 1>he thought you were always dreaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>awake or asleep,</v>

1029
00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:30.090
<v Speaker 1>but the dreams just went on continually </v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe not 100% of the time,</v>

1030
00:59:30.091 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 1>but you were passing through dreams </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually.</v>

1031
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And what was happening when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>awake was that the,</v>

1032
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:41.120
<v Speaker 1>the sensory pressure of the real world </v>
<v Speaker 1>was such that it just obliterate it.</v>

1033
00:59:41.121 --> 00:59:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Your knowledge of the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you went to sleep,</v>

1034
00:59:43.701 --> 00:59:44.534
<v Speaker 1>what happened was you shut off all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory input roughly speaking and then </v>

1035
00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:51.020
<v Speaker 1>the sensitivity of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you say?</v>

1036
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:52.483
<v Speaker 1>Signal to noise ratio changes so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the background activity of your </v>

1037
00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.220
<v Speaker 1>underlying neural structures can start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to manifest itself and you can detect it</v>

1038
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.233
<v Speaker 1>all that that might be the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a reference to that </v>

1039
01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas night progresses,</v>

1040
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.273
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket is that it gets so sensitive to </v>

1041
01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1042
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:17.600
<v Speaker 1>it's getting more and more sensitive as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a detection device.</v>

1043
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>And so at some point it stops time</v>
<v Speaker 1>after all enough.</v>

1044
01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:41.923
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty interesting because now</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden this bug is the master </v>

1045
01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can bring time itself to a halt.</v>

1046
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.163
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're in a completely different </v>

1047
01:00:49.221 --> 01:00:51.200
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in the real world,</v>

1048
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:52.034
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it was obviously also with </v>

1049
01:00:53.991 --> 01:00:54.824
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's that movie where you go </v>

1050
01:00:55.941 --> 01:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>through levels of dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inception.</v>

1051
01:00:58.911 --> 01:00:59.744
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know the Pinocchio Stories are </v>

1052
01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1053
01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:02.973
<v Speaker 1>all obviously a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we go down a level to a dream </v>

1054
01:01:06.951 --> 01:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>within a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're in right now.</v>

1055
01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:18.663
<v Speaker 1>Watch out,</v>

1056
01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:29.973
<v Speaker 3>let's go.</v>

1057
01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what the hell do you know?</v>

1058
01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.133
<v Speaker 1>Really a star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot Star comes down and turns into a </v>

1059
01:01:47.381 --> 01:01:48.640
<v Speaker 1>ferry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1060
01:01:48.641 --> 01:01:50.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one has any problem with that.</v>

1061
01:01:50.351 --> 01:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean the crickets a little freaked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1062
01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:54.880
<v Speaker 1>but everybody else seems to think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfectly reasonable low currents.</v>

1063
01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:59.881
<v Speaker 1>Which really begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the world can you understand that</v>

1064
01:02:00.671 --> 01:02:03.550
<v Speaker 1>you understand that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's not understandable.</v>

1065
01:02:03.551 --> 01:02:04.384
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from a conscious or rational </v>

1066
01:02:06.611 --> 01:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1067
01:02:08.321 --> 01:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's happening.</v>

1068
01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>We notice that there's a real absence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>femininity so far in,</v>

1069
01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:15.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the story.</v>

1070
01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of implicit in the comfort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the home,</v>

1071
01:02:17.831 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing explicit it now</v>

1072
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:23.850
<v Speaker 5>you can think of Japan as the beneficial</v>
<v Speaker 5>element of culture.</v>

1073
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:26.760
<v Speaker 5>And so here's the way of conceptualizing</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1074
01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 5>If the beneficial aspect of culture is </v>
<v Speaker 5>put into place,</v>

1075
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.140
<v Speaker 5>the beneficial elements of nature is </v>
<v Speaker 5>called forth.</v>

1076
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:36.600
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1077
01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:37.434
<v Speaker 5>I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have a neurologically </v>

1078
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:43.140
<v Speaker 5>damaged infant and that infant grows up </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a chaotic environment,</v>

1079
01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:43.974
<v Speaker 5>the probability that that neurological </v>
<v Speaker 5>damage will result in severe behavioral </v>

1080
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.073
<v Speaker 5>and social impairments is quite high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you take an individual like that </v>

1081
01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:55.410
<v Speaker 5>and you raise them in a stable </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment,</v>

1082
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:58.260
<v Speaker 5>then they can often stabilize their </v>
<v Speaker 5>nervous systems.</v>

1083
01:02:58.530 --> 01:02:59.363
<v Speaker 5>And so you can see that there's a dance </v>
<v Speaker 5>between nature and culture as a child </v>

1084
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:05.220
<v Speaker 5>develops and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1085
01:03:05.221 --> 01:03:10.221
<v Speaker 5>if you set the culture up properly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then the child's nature has the capacity</v>

1086
01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:13.410
<v Speaker 5>to manifest itself in the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>beneficial manner possible.</v>

1087
01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:16.980
<v Speaker 5>Now it would be partly the facilitation </v>
<v Speaker 5>of individual development.</v>

1088
01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:17.843
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the child is a variant of a </v>

1089
01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:23.130
<v Speaker 5>human being and you want to apply or </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultural structure to it,</v>

1090
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:25.660
<v Speaker 5>to the child so that it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 5>socialized and,</v>

1091
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:26.543
<v Speaker 5>and disciplined and able to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time you want it to </v>

1092
01:03:29.341 --> 01:03:32.670
<v Speaker 5>manifest its particularities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you've got to get the balance right.</v>

1093
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:35.910
<v Speaker 5>Well Japan or made the wish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the right wish.</v>

1094
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:36.893
<v Speaker 5>So nature comes to the rescue and in its</v>
<v Speaker 5>most benevolent forum and it's </v>

1095
01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:43.350
<v Speaker 5>attractive and seductive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is almost like,</v>

1096
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:44.783
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Buddhist farther setting up all the </v>

1097
01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:48.360
<v Speaker 5>dancing girls in the forest because </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1098
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:52.680
<v Speaker 5>this figure is part of what entices </v>
<v Speaker 5>people into life,</v>

1099
01:03:52.681 --> 01:03:56.280
<v Speaker 5>but certainly entices babies into life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1100
01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:00.210
<v Speaker 5>the love that a mother provides is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>seduction into life.</v>

1101
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:05.630
<v Speaker 5>And no wonder because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you need to be seduced into living.</v>

1102
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.640
<v Speaker 5>It's too hard otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1103
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:11.640
<v Speaker 5>and if babies don't have that primary </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship with their mother,</v>

1104
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.250
<v Speaker 5>they just fold up and die,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fed,</v>

1105
01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:16.490
<v Speaker 5>warm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bathed,</v>

1106
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:19.200
<v Speaker 5>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to have that relationship.</v>

1107
01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:27.603
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

1108
01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:32.130
<v Speaker 5>So right away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1109
01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:32.964
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a hint to give them so much </v>

1110
01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:35.034
<v Speaker 5>happiness to others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a hint of the sexual element </v>

1111
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:41.820
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so this particular ferry was modeled</v>

1112
01:04:41.821 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 5>on a screen queen of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1113
01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:48.390
<v Speaker 5>a woman who was famous for her beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1114
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.313
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a knob here to something which </v>

1115
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:51.414
<v Speaker 5>is that there are multiple elements of </v>
<v Speaker 5>being that have nothing to do with </v>

1116
01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:54.804
<v Speaker 5>rationality that are necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are necessary components of the </v>

1117
01:04:59.221 --> 01:05:01.530
<v Speaker 5>nature that entices you into life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1118
01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:04.560
<v Speaker 5>and one of those primary sources of </v>
<v Speaker 5>energy obviously,</v>

1119
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.590
<v Speaker 5>and delight and motivation and all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those things,</v>

1120
01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:08.603
<v Speaker 5>his sexuality and his Freud pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it permeates all levels of human </v>

1121
01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:14.580
<v Speaker 5>endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1122
01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:17.470
<v Speaker 5>we have some trouble with that because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1123
01:05:17.471 --> 01:05:18.304
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexuality is such a powerful force that </v>

1124
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 5>wherever you introduce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a divine force.</v>

1125
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:25.690
<v Speaker 5>It produces rifts in the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>

1126
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:26.883
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hand sold a continual debate about </v>

1127
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:32.400
<v Speaker 5>sexual harassment and so forth in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>workplace.</v>

1128
01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:33.243
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have men and women in the same </v>

1129
01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:39.451
<v Speaker 5>places all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's the normative day</v>

1130
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.790
<v Speaker 5>to day cultural things that are supposed</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be occurring,</v>

1131
01:05:42.791 --> 01:05:45.700
<v Speaker 5>narrow in goal directed and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>consistent,</v>

1132
01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eruption of sexuality into that well and</v>

1133
01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:50.830
<v Speaker 5>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that should just be stopped.</v>

1134
01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:51.664
<v Speaker 5>It's like be careful what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you really want to stop it while you </v>

1135
01:05:55.931 --> 01:05:56.531
<v Speaker 5>think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1136
01:05:56.531 --> 01:05:58.240
<v Speaker 5>it gets out of hand and rudy fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1137
01:05:58.241 --> 01:06:01.060
<v Speaker 5>yeah it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But two attempts to suppress it.</v>

1138
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.140
<v Speaker 5>So you know you're stuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1139
01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:05.103
<v Speaker 5>it's an unalterable element of life's </v>
<v Speaker 5>complexity and it's also something that </v>

1140
01:06:09.461 --> 01:06:10.294
<v Speaker 5>pulls you forward into life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can imagine the level of tyranny </v>

1141
01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:18.220
<v Speaker 5>that would be necessary to eradicate all</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexual interactions from the workplace.</v>

1142
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.620
<v Speaker 5>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone would wear a uniform.</v>

1143
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.440
<v Speaker 5>Everyone would have their haircut </v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly the same.</v>

1144
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.020
<v Speaker 5>No one would ever wear makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1145
01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:26.873
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be rendered as neutral as </v>

1146
01:06:29.171 --> 01:06:34.171
<v Speaker 5>possible and even not wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that would be the start of doing it.</v>

1147
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Come through</v>
<v Speaker 2>little puppet made a pie.</v>

1148
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.040
<v Speaker 5>See Young would regard that little blue </v>
<v Speaker 5>fairy as an anima finger.</v>

1149
01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.350
<v Speaker 5>An animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anima means soul.</v>

1150
01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.630
<v Speaker 5>And so there's an idea here that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1151
01:07:11.631 --> 01:07:12.464
<v Speaker 5>the masculine great fathers sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>constructed the structure that's an oak </v>

1152
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:16.414
<v Speaker 5>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that would be the nuts and bolts of </v>

1153
01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:22.100
<v Speaker 5>the individual as a cultural construct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the sort of divine and enticing</v>

1154
01:07:22.101 --> 01:07:25.580
<v Speaker 5>feminine spirit breathes life into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1155
01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:27.013
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are situations where that causal </v>

1156
01:07:29.151 --> 01:07:33.410
<v Speaker 5>sequence could be reversed depending on </v>
<v Speaker 5>what was being exemplified or amplify.</v>

1157
01:07:33.411 --> 01:07:34.244
<v Speaker 5>But that's what's happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he wakes up and he becomes self </v>

1158
01:07:36.991 --> 01:07:39.130
<v Speaker 5>conscious per pretty much immediately.</v>

1159
01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I've given you a nice host tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You her wished for real,</v>

1160
01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 2>no Cahokia to make two pillows wish come</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

1161
01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.513
<v Speaker 2>It would be entirely up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prove yourself truthful and unselfish </v>

1162
01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.220
<v Speaker 2>and someday you will be over your gone.</v>

1163
01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:11.813
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a variety of extraordinarily </v>

1164
01:08:13.741 --> 01:08:16.310
<v Speaker 5>complex things going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

1165
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:17.623
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that you'll hear </v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly bandied about in a quasi </v>

1166
01:08:20.481 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 5>scientific community is the role of </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature and nurture.</v>

1167
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:27.550
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we could say architecturally for,</v>

1168
01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 5>for our purposes at the moment in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>film,</v>

1169
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:31.603
<v Speaker 5>nurture is being represented by Japan </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he's constructing things in </v>

1170
01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:37.130
<v Speaker 5>nature by the ferry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can say,</v>

1171
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:37.964
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nature nurture the role of biology </v>

1172
01:08:41.181 --> 01:08:43.060
<v Speaker 5>versus culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1173
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.903
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an interesting ediology we'll say </v>

1174
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:48.223
<v Speaker 5>because it makes a proposition and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>proposition is that's the only two </v>

1175
01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 5>causal elements that are operating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1176
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:55.220
<v Speaker 5>Nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>culture,</v>

1177
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.120
<v Speaker 5>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>father,</v>

1178
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:59.270
<v Speaker 5>let's say roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you ask yourself,</v>

1179
01:08:59.271 --> 01:09:00.104
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the hell's the individual in this </v>

1180
01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:04.820
<v Speaker 5>equation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is nowhere at all because</v>

1181
01:09:04.821 --> 01:09:09.380
<v Speaker 5>there's no causal role for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual in a scientific psychology.</v>

1182
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:10.940
<v Speaker 5>It's either nature or nurture.</v>

1183
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:13.610
<v Speaker 5>Now that the film,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weirdly enough,</v>

1184
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:17.720
<v Speaker 5>has a theory that's I would say is more </v>
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated than that.</v>

1185
01:09:17.721 --> 01:09:18.554
<v Speaker 5>It says nature's necessary culture is </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessary and it would be best if they </v>

1186
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:25.010
<v Speaker 5>were optimized.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you get a head start,</v>

1187
01:09:25.011 --> 01:09:27.350
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if your father actually loves you and so</v>

1188
01:09:27.351 --> 01:09:28.184
<v Speaker 5>does your mother fair enough?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that isn't sufficient in and of </v>

1189
01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:33.620
<v Speaker 5>itself to produce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1190
01:09:33.621 --> 01:09:36.470
<v Speaker 5>an individual who inhabits the </v>
<v Speaker 5>transcendent zone.</v>

1191
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:39.050
<v Speaker 5>There's actually choices that have to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>made.</v>

1192
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:40.423
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say our entire culture is </v>

1193
01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:44.930
<v Speaker 5>predicated on the idea that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually make choices.</v>

1194
01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:45.980
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>

1195
01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:50.150
<v Speaker 5>our culture is predicated on the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 5>individual responsibility and choice.</v>

1196
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:51.223
<v Speaker 5>So we recognize that in our legal system</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we recognize it in our individual </v>

1197
01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:55.604
<v Speaker 5>interactions because you always treat </v>
<v Speaker 5>people around you as if they could have </v>

1198
01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:00.800
<v Speaker 5>chosen something different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1199
01:10:00.801 --> 01:10:03.230
<v Speaker 5>unless they can make a really strong </v>
<v Speaker 5>case that they couldn't.</v>

1200
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:04.311
<v Speaker 5>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1201
01:10:04.311 --> 01:10:05.144
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1202
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:08.230
<v Speaker 5>then you're not responsible for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1203
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:09.103
<v Speaker 5>I was in a court case at one point and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the person who was on trial had been </v>

1204
01:10:14.571 --> 01:10:19.400
<v Speaker 5>forced to help kill someone with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rock after she'd been stripped naked and</v>

1205
01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.293
<v Speaker 5>threatened with death and rape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was a credible threat because </v>

1206
01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 5>she'd already watched the people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>were threatening her,</v>

1207
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.273
<v Speaker 5>beat someone 95% to death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so she dropped a rock on the guide </v>

1208
01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.510
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then there's a rule in,</v>

1209
01:10:36.511 --> 01:10:37.790
<v Speaker 5>in law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>

1210
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.840
<v Speaker 5>no matter what duress you're subject to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get to do that.</v>

1211
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.900
<v Speaker 5>But this was such an ex she got there </v>
<v Speaker 5>accidentally.</v>

1212
01:10:44.901 --> 01:10:45.734
<v Speaker 5>She just blundered into the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was a single mother and also very </v>

1213
01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:51.190
<v Speaker 5>worried that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if she got killed,</v>

1214
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:55.130
<v Speaker 5>you know who the hell was going to take </v>
<v Speaker 5>care of her kid and well and so forth.</v>

1215
01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:59.150
<v Speaker 5>But you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the court eventually found in her favor.</v>

1216
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.550
<v Speaker 5>And the reason for that was that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>court,</v>

1217
01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:02.483
<v Speaker 5>that was the first time in English </v>
<v Speaker 5>common law history that that had ever </v>

1218
01:11:04.401 --> 01:11:05.234
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the court decided that under those </v>

1219
01:11:06.741 --> 01:11:11.330
<v Speaker 5>circumstances she wasn't acting as an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she had no will,</v>

1220
01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.313
<v Speaker 5>like the circumstance was so compelling </v>
<v Speaker 5>that she did what you would expect </v>

1221
01:11:15.901 --> 01:11:18.570
<v Speaker 5>someone to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the law is also by the way,</v>

1222
01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:22.170
<v Speaker 5>optimized for the average individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not for the hero.</v>

1223
01:11:22.171 --> 01:11:25.050
<v Speaker 5>The law does not demand of you that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>act like a hero.</v>

1224
01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.430
<v Speaker 5>And thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I know.</v>

1225
01:11:28.431 --> 01:11:29.550
<v Speaker 5>So if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1226
01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:30.384
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't help it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you believe that you don't </v>

1227
01:11:31.711 --> 01:11:33.900
<v Speaker 5>judge them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if they can't make that case,</v>

1228
01:11:33.901 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 5>your automatic presupposition is you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could have done something differently.</v>

1229
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:39.120
<v Speaker 5>And you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1230
01:11:39.121 --> 01:11:42.390
<v Speaker 5>to the degree that you're an admirer of </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature versus nurture,</v>

1231
01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.253
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>culture versus nature or biology versus </v>

1232
01:11:45.871 --> 01:11:46.704
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why in the world do you believe that </v>

1233
01:11:48.751 --> 01:11:51.690
<v Speaker 5>people have any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any avenue of choice,</v>

1234
01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.110
<v Speaker 5>but you do you act that out in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>beliefs all the time.</v>

1235
01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:00.880
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like more human options,</v>

1236
01:12:02.621 --> 01:12:05.370
<v Speaker 4>like the results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't just like,</v>

1237
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:07.210
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's no,</v>

1238
01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:10.271
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1239
01:12:10.271 --> 01:12:13.630
<v Speaker 5>the problem with that viewpoint is it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally deterministic.</v>

1240
01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1241
01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:17.080
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the reality isn't deterministic.</v>

1242
01:12:17.081 --> 01:12:19.630
<v Speaker 5>It's probabilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you can't,</v>

1243
01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:22.300
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that quantum mechanics</v>

1244
01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:26.980
<v Speaker 5>makes quite evident is that you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 5>draw on airinc cause and effect chains.</v>

1245
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1246
01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:30.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I know,</v>

1247
01:12:30.501 --> 01:12:31.760
<v Speaker 5>I know it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it is,</v>

1248
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:32.803
<v Speaker 5>but we also exist at the microscale and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm also not saying that what the movie </v>

1249
01:12:36.681 --> 01:12:37.514
<v Speaker 5>is putting forth is true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just telling you what it's putting </v>

1250
01:12:40.221 --> 01:12:41.054
<v Speaker 5>forth.</v>

1251
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:46.450
<v Speaker 4>The movements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still</v>

1252
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:49.770
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll,</v>

1253
01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:52.910
<v Speaker 5>well this seems non random to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1254
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:54.420
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1255
01:12:54.421 --> 01:12:55.320
<v Speaker 5>we know what I mean.</v>

1256
01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.240
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's more like,</v>

1257
01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:01.940
<v Speaker 4>because I haven't started this </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation,</v>

1258
01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:03.740
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't have done that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1259
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.490
<v Speaker 4>it's a result of link.</v>

1260
01:13:06.190 --> 01:13:07.023
<v Speaker 5>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1261
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:07.761
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1262
01:13:07.761 --> 01:13:10.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not making a case for the,</v>

1263
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm not making a case for the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>validity of this viewpoint.</v>

1264
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.670
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or at least if I am,</v>

1265
01:13:16.671 --> 01:13:17.504
<v Speaker 5>I'm not expecting you to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying is that there's a </v>

1266
01:13:20.181 --> 01:13:21.014
<v Speaker 5>tension between this viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is an archetypal and mythological </v>

1267
01:13:23.871 --> 01:13:27.680
<v Speaker 5>viewpoint and the scientific viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1268
01:13:27.681 --> 01:13:31.370
<v Speaker 5>the way that a person would object to </v>
<v Speaker 5>this viewpoint is by saying,</v>

1269
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:35.750
<v Speaker 5>hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's deterministic causality at work.</v>

1270
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:39.830
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say in favor of this perspective</v>

1271
01:13:39.831 --> 01:13:42.590
<v Speaker 5>is we don't act that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1272
01:13:42.591 --> 01:13:45.170
<v Speaker 5>maybe we're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we do not act that way.</v>

1273
01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.180
<v Speaker 5>We shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>

1274
01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

1275
01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.550
<v Speaker 4>because it's an attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I like it wouldn't work,</v>

1276
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:55.320
<v Speaker 5>but then I wouldn't object if it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it wouldn't work.</v>

1277
01:13:55.321 --> 01:13:56.154
<v Speaker 5>That actually indicates that it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that goes back to this sort of </v>

1278
01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:00.690
<v Speaker 5>debate between Darwin and Newton.</v>

1279
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:01.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is wrong.</v>

1280
01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:06.930
<v Speaker 4>Not objectively wrong in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets not a good way to</v>

1281
01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.850
<v Speaker 5>sure you can say it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pragmatically you couldn't say that.</v>

1282
01:14:10.851 --> 01:14:11.684
<v Speaker 5>And that could be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could make a case that we act as if </v>

1283
01:14:14.351 --> 01:14:17.830
<v Speaker 5>we have free will because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>simplest solution to the problem.</v>

1284
01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.093
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could.</v>

1285
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:22.330
<v Speaker 5>And you know it's a perfectly reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 5>argument.</v>

1286
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 5>Just say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe it but,</v>

1287
01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:26.470
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as,</v>

1288
01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:28.270
<v Speaker 5>as a coherent argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1289
01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.133
<v Speaker 5>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's partly why there is such tension </v>

1290
01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 5>between scientific and mythological </v>
<v Speaker 5>views of the world.</v>

1291
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:36.880
<v Speaker 5>This is a huge part of the tension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1292
01:14:36.881 --> 01:14:39.430
<v Speaker 5>part of it is evolution versus </v>
<v Speaker 5>creationism.</v>

1293
01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:42.550
<v Speaker 5>It's like who cares about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a stupid argument.</v>

1294
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:46.360
<v Speaker 5>But this one is much more difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1295
01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:49.390
<v Speaker 5>that's determinism versus choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's part of it.</v>

1296
01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 5>And there's much to be said on both </v>
<v Speaker 5>sides.</v>

1297
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:53.734
<v Speaker 5>And of course are deterministic models </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the world are extraordinarily </v>

1298
01:14:55.961 --> 01:14:58.270
<v Speaker 5>powerful and we use them all the time.</v>

1299
01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 5>So we also act out our belief in those </v>
<v Speaker 5>models.</v>

1300
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:01.960
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1301
01:15:01.961 --> 01:15:05.290
<v Speaker 5>so back to Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now he's got his own voice.</v>

1302
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.670
<v Speaker 5>So that means,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1303
01:15:06.671 --> 01:15:07.504
<v Speaker 5>partly what that means is that by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time you launch your child into the </v>

1304
01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:13.030
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they should have their own voice.</v>

1305
01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.280
<v Speaker 5>You actually see that developing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>

1306
01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.173
<v Speaker 5>You see that really developing when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're about to because that's when </v>

1307
01:15:18.971 --> 01:15:23.410
<v Speaker 5>they learn to say no and like 50% of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what a two year old will say to you is,</v>

1308
01:15:23.411 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to fool my son cause he would say</v>

1309
01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:27.124
<v Speaker 5>no to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'd say no to things like 10 things in </v>

1310
01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:30.304
<v Speaker 5>a row.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I'd ask him if he wanted some </v>

1311
01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:34.690
<v Speaker 5>chocolate ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the first thing he would say is no.</v>

1312
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.920
<v Speaker 5>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1313
01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.810
<v Speaker 5>startle a bit and think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

1314
01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.300
<v Speaker 5>I actually do want some chocolate ice </v>
<v Speaker 5>cream.</v>

1315
01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.433
<v Speaker 5>So but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we know people called the terrible </v>

1316
01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:44.914
<v Speaker 5>twos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the terrible twos because that is when </v>

1317
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:46.834
<v Speaker 5>the child discovers it's voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it learns how to push back and then so </v>

1318
01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:53.110
<v Speaker 5>it's dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it's oppositional,</v>

1319
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:57.580
<v Speaker 5>then it starts to become cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know when you want the child to be a</v>

1320
01:15:57.581 --> 01:16:02.020
<v Speaker 5>nice balance between opposition land </v>
<v Speaker 5>cooperative roughly by the time they hit</v>

1321
01:16:02.021 --> 01:16:04.900
<v Speaker 5>three and for sure by the time they hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>four,</v>

1322
01:16:04.901 --> 01:16:07.180
<v Speaker 5>because if they don't do it by the time </v>
<v Speaker 5>they hit four,</v>

1323
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:11.320
<v Speaker 5>it's like the crucial developmental </v>
<v Speaker 5>period in many ways his past.</v>

1324
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.633
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you're too stupid to learn how to </v>

1325
01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:16.080
<v Speaker 5>interact with your kid and you know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1326
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:18.130
<v Speaker 5>it basically boils down to the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1327
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.920
<v Speaker 5>So now he has his voice and he has some </v>
<v Speaker 5>limited autonomy.</v>

1328
01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:22.683
<v Speaker 5>And the first thing that blue fairy </v>
<v Speaker 5>tells him is that he has a moral </v>

1329
01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:25.504
<v Speaker 5>adventure in front of him and that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to involve following some rules </v>

1330
01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:31.750
<v Speaker 5>and they're pretty prosaic and </v>
<v Speaker 5>stereotypical rules.</v>

1331
01:16:31.751 --> 01:16:33.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like a lecture from your,</v>

1332
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:36.370
<v Speaker 5>maybe not so favorite act or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

1333
01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You was hard to choose between right and</v>

1334
01:16:44.761 --> 01:16:45.594
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how do I know how I know your </v>

1335
01:16:49.741 --> 01:16:54.741
<v Speaker 2>conscience with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>options?</v>

1336
01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Just that still small voice but people </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't question.</v>

1337
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:01.173
<v Speaker 5>So He's kind of a loud mouth at this </v>
<v Speaker 5>point and he holds himself up a little </v>

1338
01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 5>podium to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1339
01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>speech or fight from.</v>

1340
01:17:07.521 --> 01:17:11.480
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things you'll see us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his voice is quite patronizing and phony</v>

1341
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:13.340
<v Speaker 5>and it's also very hard to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

1342
01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:17.720
<v Speaker 5>Like the next five things he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have no life in them.</v>

1343
01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:18.554
<v Speaker 5>They're boring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's because they're basically </v>

1344
01:17:20.121 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 5>debt rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're necessary,</v>

1345
01:17:21.981 --> 01:17:22.814
<v Speaker 5>but they've got no spirit in them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's also got this pointing thing </v>

1346
01:17:25.611 --> 01:17:26.361
<v Speaker 5>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1347
01:17:26.361 --> 01:17:27.194
<v Speaker 5>so he's like a hectoring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>superego type of creature and he's too </v>

1348
01:17:30.681 --> 01:17:32.630
<v Speaker 5>dumb to stay out of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1349
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:34.520
<v Speaker 5>He leaps into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1350
01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:36.013
<v Speaker 5>without even thinking really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's a good commentary on your </v>

1351
01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 5>conscience because that damn thing can </v>
<v Speaker 5>drive you crazy.</v>

1352
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:42.703
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though it's necessary and partly </v>

1353
01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:48.200
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also destructive and not completely</v>

1354
01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:49.011
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1355
01:17:49.011 --> 01:17:50.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that makes it very difficult to know how</v>

1356
01:17:50.931 --> 01:17:51.764
<v Speaker 5>to relate to it.</v>

1357
01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Just the problem with the world today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh hello.</v>

1358
01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to be conscious</v>
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>

1359
01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:15.420
<v Speaker 2>How does your name Oh credits you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any quick neil,</v>

1360
01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Mr</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

1361
01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries not high.</v>

1362
01:18:24.811 --> 01:18:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Keep her</v>
<v Speaker 2>counselor</v>

1363
01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.330
<v Speaker 2>and guide it on the street and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So jimminy cricket,</v>

1364
01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.430
<v Speaker 2>but don't we get a badge or something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

1365
01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't.</v>

1366
01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.310
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So again,</v>

1367
01:18:57.311 --> 01:18:59.620
<v Speaker 5>a variety of very complex things happens</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1368
01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:00.940
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1369
01:19:00.941 --> 01:19:01.774
<v Speaker 5>but conscience undergoes a </v>
<v Speaker 5>transformation at the same time as the </v>

1370
01:19:04.241 --> 01:19:06.850
<v Speaker 5>boy does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I think the way of thinking about</v>

1371
01:19:06.851 --> 01:19:09.220
<v Speaker 5>that is that it's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1372
01:19:09.221 --> 01:19:12.880
<v Speaker 5>obviously human beings are predisposed </v>
<v Speaker 5>to learn language,</v>

1373
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.863
<v Speaker 5>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that infants do when </v>

1374
01:19:16.601 --> 01:19:17.434
<v Speaker 5>they're in their crib,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll hear them badly and they're </v>

1375
01:19:19.810 --> 01:19:21.820
<v Speaker 5>playing with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're playing with sounds,</v>

1376
01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.990
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but an infant babbles every human phony.</v>

1377
01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:31.540
<v Speaker 5>So there's four different phonemes </v>
<v Speaker 5>speech elements in different languages.</v>

1378
01:19:31.541 --> 01:19:32.374
<v Speaker 5>You know what one interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different saves between many Asian </v>

1379
01:19:36.791 --> 01:19:37.624
<v Speaker 5>languages in English.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no distinction between the r </v>

1380
01:19:40.031 --> 01:19:40.864
<v Speaker 5>sound or end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The old found in many Asian languages </v>

1381
01:19:43.361 --> 01:19:46.450
<v Speaker 5>and so often Asian people can't even </v>
<v Speaker 5>hear that difference.</v>

1382
01:19:46.451 --> 01:19:48.430
<v Speaker 5>And they certainly can't say it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1383
01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.473
<v Speaker 5>there's lots of sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that English speakers have a hard </v>

1384
01:19:51.401 --> 01:19:56.290
<v Speaker 5>time with many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many sounds in Asian languages,</v>

1385
01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.880
<v Speaker 5>lots of sounds in German.</v>

1386
01:19:58.300 --> 01:19:59.530
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1387
01:19:59.531 --> 01:20:02.830
<v Speaker 5>there was throat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>throat sounds that are kind of guttural.</v>

1388
01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 5>And then there's click languages and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1389
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:06.730
<v Speaker 5>there's all sorts of things that not </v>
<v Speaker 5>only can you,</v>

1390
01:20:06.731 --> 01:20:09.720
<v Speaker 5>not by the time you're an adult and </v>
<v Speaker 5>trained in one language,</v>

1391
01:20:09.721 --> 01:20:10.554
<v Speaker 5>but you can't even hear them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the child is sitting there battling </v>

1392
01:20:13.381 --> 01:20:16.200
<v Speaker 5>in every single phony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is amazing.</v>

1393
01:20:16.201 --> 01:20:20.100
<v Speaker 5>It's as if it knows the units of every </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible language.</v>

1394
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:21.083
<v Speaker 5>And then what happens is it loses the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ability to admit phonemes that are of </v>

1395
01:20:24.871 --> 01:20:27.840
<v Speaker 5>that language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so not what you'd expect,</v>

1396
01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:29.610
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd expect that it doesn't know a damn</v>

1397
01:20:29.611 --> 01:20:30.444
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it learns the particular full </v>

1398
01:20:31.831 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 5>names,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not that it knows every phoneme and then</v>

1399
01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:36.660
<v Speaker 5>loses the ability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's very peculiar.</v>

1400
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:37.793
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you could say in some sense that the </v>

1401
01:20:39.841 --> 01:20:40.674
<v Speaker 5>child has a low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>broad adaptations to possible languages </v>

1402
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.430
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

1403
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:47.263
<v Speaker 5>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well the same thing comes with regards </v>

1404
01:20:48.601 --> 01:20:53.310
<v Speaker 5>to conscious is the child has the </v>
<v Speaker 5>inbuilt mechanism for conscience.</v>

1405
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.473
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it could be developed in a very </v>

1406
01:20:56.011 --> 01:20:58.210
<v Speaker 5>large number of specific ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1407
01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:02.400
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they fit within a universe of potential,</v>

1408
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.640
<v Speaker 5>what would you call playable moral </v>
<v Speaker 5>games.</v>

1409
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.280
<v Speaker 5>So it's not unbounded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not infinite but,</v>

1410
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.170
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

1411
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:11.004
<v Speaker 5>it's large.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then so the child comes equipped </v>

1412
01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:16.050
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then what happens is that it's an,</v>

1413
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:16.913
<v Speaker 5>as it's inculturated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the conscience starts to pick up the </v>

1414
01:21:19.591 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 5>specific rules that underlie that </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultures,</v>

1415
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:23.143
<v Speaker 5>motive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>social interaction and that sort of the </v>

1416
01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:28.890
<v Speaker 5>generic corn chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's what it is at this point.</v>

1417
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.090
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been well developed.</v>

1418
01:21:30.091 --> 01:21:33.090
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's got this sort of rich </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>

1419
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.760
<v Speaker 5>It's not fully developed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ignores that itself.</v>

1420
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:38.070
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's still wants the damn </v>
<v Speaker 5>gold badge.</v>

1421
01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.113
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot better than it was when it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was just a tramp that had been </v>

1422
01:21:41.401 --> 01:21:42.690
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1423
01:21:42.691 --> 01:21:45.300
<v Speaker 5>Cause now it's specifically allied with </v>
<v Speaker 5>an individual.</v>

1424
01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:46.613
<v Speaker 5>And so that's interesting too because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the movie posits that the conscience </v>

1425
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:54.480
<v Speaker 5>requires the individual to develop just </v>
<v Speaker 5>as the individual requires.</v>

1426
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:56.610
<v Speaker 5>The conscience to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very cool,</v>

1427
01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.473
<v Speaker 5>very sophisticated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so now they're both sent out </v>

1428
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:01.223
<v Speaker 5>fundamentally to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the conscience is a little wiser </v>

1429
01:22:04.471 --> 01:22:06.360
<v Speaker 5>because in some sense it's been </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

1430
01:22:06.361 --> 01:22:07.194
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that was partly why it was a tramp </v>

1431
01:22:08.211 --> 01:22:10.290
<v Speaker 5>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it also,</v>

1432
01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:11.124
<v Speaker 5>the interesting thing too is that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have full control over the </v>

1433
01:22:14.191 --> 01:22:16.680
<v Speaker 5>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1434
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:18.570
<v Speaker 5>and that's a strange thing too because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

1435
01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 5>it's also not what you would expect from</v>
<v Speaker 5>a purely deterministic system.</v>

1436
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:23.333
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a deterministic system you think would </v>

1437
01:22:24.751 --> 01:22:26.940
<v Speaker 5>be bound by the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1438
01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:31.290
<v Speaker 5>maybe we are in a very complex way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but certainly not in any simple way.</v>

1439
01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.390
<v Speaker 5>That's rule two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two behavior.</v>

1440
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:36.450
<v Speaker 5>You know the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't have to follow them.</v>

1441
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.960
<v Speaker 5>We all</v>
<v Speaker 5>always let your conscience,</v>

1442
01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:00.360
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost forgot about you.</v>

1443
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.823
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hello.</v>

1444
01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you and I better have a little to </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart talk.</v>

1445
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Want to be a real boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1446
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:14.880
<v Speaker 2>you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1447
01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you see the world is full of him page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1448
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:25.750
<v Speaker 2>they're in the wrong things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but seek right at the time.</v>

1449
01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:26.770
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1450
01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:27.813
<v Speaker 2>even though the right things may seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong sometimes and sometimes the wrong </v>

1451
01:23:31.961 --> 01:23:32.794
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe right at the wrong time or </v>

1452
01:23:36.150 --> 01:23:41.150
<v Speaker 2>vice advisor</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a boy and I'm going to help.</v>

1453
01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.250
<v Speaker 1>So there's a nice little philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>conundrum there.</v>

1454
01:23:50.251 --> 01:23:51.084
<v Speaker 1>It's quite sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even the conscience can say state </v>

1455
01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.160
<v Speaker 1>explicitly the rules of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1456
01:23:58.161 --> 01:23:58.994
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much of it is implicit now he's kind </v>

1457
01:24:00.261 --> 01:24:03.920
<v Speaker 1>of narcissistic at this point and thinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows a lot more than he does know.</v>

1458
01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:07.220
<v Speaker 1>When he tries to articulate the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finds that he doesn't know them.</v>

1459
01:24:07.221 --> 01:24:08.054
<v Speaker 1>And even if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing to which they're being </v>

1460
01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:12.860
<v Speaker 1>articulated cannot follow matt an </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated level.</v>

1461
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:14.031
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1462
01:24:14.031 --> 01:24:14.864
<v Speaker 1>and what that really means is people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this with your two year olds all the </v>

1463
01:24:17.181 --> 01:24:19.550
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They explain the rules to them.</v>

1464
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:20.623
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's virtually pointless because a two </v>

1465
01:24:22.581 --> 01:24:24.410
<v Speaker 1>year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

1466
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:29.600
<v Speaker 1>they aren't governed by rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adults aren't governed by rules.</v>

1467
01:24:29.601 --> 01:24:30.434
<v Speaker 1>Why in the world would you ever expect </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the two year old to be guided by </v>

1468
01:24:32.781 --> 01:24:35.300
<v Speaker 1>rules and they certainly can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate them.</v>

1469
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:36.081
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1470
01:24:36.081 --> 01:24:36.914
<v Speaker 1>if you're careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things that you can </v>

1471
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:42.920
<v Speaker 1>articulate for a two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but explaining complex moral concepts to</v>

1472
01:24:42.921 --> 01:24:46.220
<v Speaker 1>them is that's just not how they learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to behave.</v>

1473
01:24:46.221 --> 01:24:47.054
<v Speaker 1>They learn how to behave by bugging you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and seeing what </v>

1474
01:24:50.091 --> 01:24:51.380
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not only that,</v>

1475
01:24:51.381 --> 01:24:53.870
<v Speaker 1>they come for comfort and they laugh </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>

1476
01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:58.250
<v Speaker 1>they're charting the interactions </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly and extracting all rules.</v>

1477
01:24:58.700 --> 01:24:59.533
<v Speaker 1>They're learning it through experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what happens here </v>

1478
01:25:01.461 --> 01:25:02.300
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1479
01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:03.433
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conclusion for the conscience and </v>

1480
01:25:05.001 --> 01:25:07.100
<v Speaker 1>the puppet as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to learn through experience.</v>

1481
01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It's something that has to be acted out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not explained in an articulated way.</v>

1482
01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:12.123
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1483
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1484
01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.060
<v Speaker 2>we'll skip the little song.</v>

1485
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it's the next morning.</v>

1486
01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:03.693
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1487
01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:04.601
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1488
01:26:04.601 --> 01:26:05.434
<v Speaker 5>you can see by his behavior that he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>being raised well because he's very </v>

1489
01:26:08.891 --> 01:26:11.140
<v Speaker 5>enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hence the hopping around,</v>

1490
01:26:11.141 --> 01:26:13.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's not powering,</v>

1491
01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could also say,</v>

1492
01:26:14.441 --> 01:26:15.274
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got the temperament for it and </v>

1493
01:26:15.911 --> 01:26:18.040
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not cowering,</v>

1494
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:20.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>afraid of the world and Japan,</v>

1495
01:26:20.921 --> 01:26:22.840
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't going to walk him to school,</v>

1496
01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.651
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>old Japan.</v>

1497
01:26:23.651 --> 01:26:24.484
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is courageous enough we could say and </v>

1498
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:28.880
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also confident enough in Pinocchio's</v>

1499
01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:32.680
<v Speaker 5>capacity at this point to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1500
01:26:32.710 --> 01:26:37.180
<v Speaker 5>you know you're going to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's not like he's naive and figures</v>

1501
01:26:37.181 --> 01:26:39.370
<v Speaker 5>that there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's no danger.</v>

1502
01:26:39.371 --> 01:26:40.990
<v Speaker 5>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not it at all.</v>

1503
01:26:41.050 --> 01:26:41.883
<v Speaker 5>It's that he feels that the child is </v>
<v Speaker 5>developed enough so that the next </v>

1504
01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:49.741
<v Speaker 5>logical step is to allow him some </v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom of choice in the actual world.</v>

1505
01:26:50.141 --> 01:26:50.974
<v Speaker 5>So that's what he proceeds to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now there's sign that he's a good </v>

1506
01:26:53.531 --> 01:26:54.400
<v Speaker 5>father.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not,</v>

1507
01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:55.953
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio isn't cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need a whole family that won't let </v>

1508
01:26:58.361 --> 01:26:59.194
<v Speaker 5>him go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's encouraging him to move out into </v>

1509
01:27:01.361 --> 01:27:02.194
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>

1510
01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:13.610
<v Speaker 2>One</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher,</v>

1511
01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:24.860
<v Speaker 2>ow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1512
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:38.630
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't forget to give them a book.</v>

1513
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Come</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1514
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Listen</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] school,</v>

1515
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm no institution would be stupid.</v>

1516
01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:23.530
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well Stromboli so the battle arrest,</v>

1517
01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:28.560
<v Speaker 5>so this farkes is well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cynical and shallow at the same time and</v>

1518
01:28:29.321 --> 01:28:32.980
<v Speaker 5>all he ever does is lie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So every single word is a lie.</v>

1519
01:28:32.981 --> 01:28:35.290
<v Speaker 5>And you can tell that in the falsity of </v>
<v Speaker 5>his voice.</v>

1520
01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:37.680
<v Speaker 5>And so I was back in it.</v>

1521
01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I could give you the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tied sleeves on you.</v>

1522
01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:48.870
<v Speaker 2>We nearly put one over on that old </v>
<v Speaker 2>gypsy.</v>

1523
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:49.743
<v Speaker 2>That time</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not want to be with a fortune </v>

1524
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:14.550
<v Speaker 2>to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

1525
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:16.360
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1526
01:29:16.361 --> 01:29:17.194
<v Speaker 1>So because of long practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two are more adept deadline line </v>

1527
01:29:20.501 --> 01:29:23.260
<v Speaker 1>and Pinocchio is at detecting false </v>
<v Speaker 1>hood.</v>

1528
01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

1529
01:29:25.811 --> 01:29:28.600
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still naive and that's not the same</v>

1530
01:29:28.601 --> 01:29:30.940
<v Speaker 1>as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing,</v>

1531
01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:33.070
<v Speaker 1>he's not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's neither.</v>

1532
01:29:33.370 --> 01:29:35.770
<v Speaker 1>He's just naive and people often </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

1533
01:29:35.771 --> 01:29:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Now evd for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine doing that.</v>

1534
01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:41.560
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make you good at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just makes you naive.</v>

1535
01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:44.940
<v Speaker 1>And so it's definitely one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1536
01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.860
<v Speaker 1>direct threats in the world when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet goes out.</v>

1537
01:29:47.861 --> 01:29:51.460
<v Speaker 1>He actually doesn't encounter like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Avatar of tire map.</v>

1538
01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not a natural force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a crocodile.</v>

1539
01:29:53.891 --> 01:29:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not danger lurking somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1540
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the natural world.</v>

1541
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:58.383
<v Speaker 1>It's the corrupt social world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about this as his </v>

1542
01:30:00.821 --> 01:30:01.654
<v Speaker 1>encounter with seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although these guys are like low rent </v>

1543
01:30:03.671 --> 01:30:05.320
<v Speaker 1>versions of Seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1544
01:30:05.321 --> 01:30:07.210
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're petty evil.</v>

1545
01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Speak on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cons,</v>

1546
01:30:16.330 --> 01:30:18.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Sleep,</v>

1547
01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.880
<v Speaker 2>oh my name is molly's job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

1548
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:47.270
<v Speaker 2>No one else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any cops.</v>

1549
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1550
01:30:55.580 --> 01:31:00.100
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1551
01:31:00.101 --> 01:31:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1552
01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:05.810
<v Speaker 1>So he's off to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gone.</v>

1553
01:31:05.811 --> 01:31:06.860
<v Speaker 1>His book soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1554
01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:09.360
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's heading straight towards the,</v>

1555
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:10.363
<v Speaker 1>the conventional path to knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enculturation safe and something trips </v>

1556
01:31:14.141 --> 01:31:16.130
<v Speaker 1>them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we know how that works.</v>

1557
01:31:16.131 --> 01:31:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And so what trips you up is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1558
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:20.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos can manifest itself as many </v>

1559
01:31:21.651 --> 01:31:24.850
<v Speaker 1>forums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it manifests itself here as is,</v>

1560
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.903
<v Speaker 1>is like low level of malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've got plans for him that he </v>

1561
01:31:29.721 --> 01:31:31.910
<v Speaker 1>knows nothing about and all the plans </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1562
01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:34.730
<v Speaker 1>is exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could think about that as one</v>

1563
01:31:34.731 --> 01:31:38.660
<v Speaker 1>of the canonical existential problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people face in the world.</v>

1564
01:31:38.661 --> 01:31:39.494
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is Pinocchio faces a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of canonical existential </v>

1565
01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:46.340
<v Speaker 1>challenges and they're not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

1566
01:31:46.341 --> 01:31:48.710
<v Speaker 1>He's no match for these characters even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though they're like,</v>

1567
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty rich.</v>

1568
01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.040
<v Speaker 1>It as far as thugs go.</v>

1569
01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:57.133
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1570
01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:05.710
<v Speaker 5>I see</v>
<v Speaker 5>a man of letters,</v>

1571
01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:23.700
<v Speaker 5>that</v>
<v Speaker 5>personality,</v>

1572
01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:37.420
<v Speaker 5>this party is more relevant now than it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was when it was first,</v>

1573
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:41.170
<v Speaker 5>when it was first produced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1574
01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:42.893
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people were obsessed with fame at this </v>

1575
01:32:44.621 --> 01:32:45.454
<v Speaker 5>point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it has nothing like it is today </v>

1576
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:51.160
<v Speaker 5>where we have people who are famous </v>
<v Speaker 5>merely for being famous.</v>

1577
01:32:51.161 --> 01:32:51.994
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason that they're famous </v>

1578
01:32:53.171 --> 01:32:54.004
<v Speaker 5>is because they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're like anti stars indicate in a </v>

1579
01:32:57.911 --> 01:33:01.780
<v Speaker 5>sense what they indicate to people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is partly why they're popular,</v>

1580
01:33:01.781 --> 01:33:05.620
<v Speaker 5>is that you can get to the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy of power and influence without</v>

1581
01:33:05.621 --> 01:33:06.454
<v Speaker 5>having anything that distinguishes you </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatsoever except maybe some random </v>

1582
01:33:09.521 --> 01:33:11.640
<v Speaker 5>attractive feature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1583
01:33:11.641 --> 01:33:12.474
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's precisely what's being talked </v>

1584
01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:14.974
<v Speaker 5>about here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it took me a long time to figure </v>

1585
01:33:17.021 --> 01:33:20.470
<v Speaker 5>out why in the world was this film so </v>
<v Speaker 5>critical of actors?</v>

1586
01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:21.363
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was produced by Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're engaged in this </v>

1587
01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:25.930
<v Speaker 5>dramatic game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what's wrong with actor,</v>

1588
01:33:25.931 --> 01:33:30.931
<v Speaker 5>but it's not actor in the actor Sam's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's persona in the psychological sense.</v>

1589
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:32.493
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to be the real thing or you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to be something who appears to be </v>

1590
01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:38.500
<v Speaker 5>the real thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot easier.</v>

1591
01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.513
<v Speaker 5>And that way you could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can attain all the advantages of </v>

1592
01:33:42.311 --> 01:33:43.144
<v Speaker 5>status and power without having to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>done anything that actually contributes </v>

1593
01:33:46.931 --> 01:33:50.140
<v Speaker 5>to the system in which that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>status and power is actually possible.</v>

1594
01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.930
<v Speaker 5>So basically what you're doing is you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>Europe,</v>

1595
01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:57.730
<v Speaker 5>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>simulacrum of of competence.</v>

1596
01:33:57.910 --> 01:34:00.070
<v Speaker 5>And you know the fox here like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>already.</v>

1597
01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:02.770
<v Speaker 5>He's cynical about school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when he holds a book,</v>

1598
01:34:02.771 --> 01:34:03.604
<v Speaker 5>he holds it upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has no idea what he's being cynical </v>

1599
01:34:05.381 --> 01:34:06.214
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you might think of this as the </v>

1600
01:34:07.991 --> 01:34:09.170
<v Speaker 5>first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's what?</v>

1601
01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:11.350
<v Speaker 5>It's not necessarily bow first </v>
<v Speaker 5>temptation,</v>

1602
01:34:11.351 --> 01:34:14.950
<v Speaker 5>but it's at first temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the temptation of persona.</v>

1603
01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:18.640
<v Speaker 5>Are you going to be really who you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>or you're going to be an actor?</v>

1604
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:19.803
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio obviously picks actor and no </v>

1605
01:34:21.551 --> 01:34:22.900
<v Speaker 5>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1606
01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:23.920
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1607
01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.753
<v Speaker 5>it's a convincing possibility and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be associated with youngs idea of </v>

1608
01:34:28.631 --> 01:34:29.464
<v Speaker 5>development of the persona.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the persona is also a necessary </v>

1609
01:34:32.141 --> 01:34:32.974
<v Speaker 5>thing to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you could also think about this as a </v>

1610
01:34:36.401 --> 01:34:40.750
<v Speaker 5>developmental phase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to learn how to act in public.</v>

1611
01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:45.730
<v Speaker 5>And so if you learn to well how to act </v>
<v Speaker 5>in public,</v>

1612
01:34:45.731 --> 01:34:48.190
<v Speaker 5>well then there's nothing left of you </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's a catastrophe.</v>

1613
01:34:48.191 --> 01:34:50.700
<v Speaker 5>But if you don't learn at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's equally it.</v>

1614
01:34:50.701 --> 01:34:51.910
<v Speaker 5>Catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1615
01:34:51.911 --> 01:34:52.930
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

1616
01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.580
<v Speaker 5>he's suckered in by these guys.</v>

1617
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:03.630
<v Speaker 2>I can see your name in lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lights,</v>

1618
01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.820
<v Speaker 2>six feet high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Name</v>

1619
01:35:07.410 --> 01:35:10.830
<v Speaker 2>no po P.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

1620
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:19.030
<v Speaker 2>William wasting precious come</v>
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

1621
01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horrible thing.</v>

1622
01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:46.763
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the conscience basically tells him </v>

1623
01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.470
<v Speaker 5>it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see this little look where he is.</v>

1624
01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:58.453
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1625
01:35:58.570 --> 01:36:00.280
<v Speaker 5>that thing in the background there.</v>

1626
01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't know if I can eat</v>

1627
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:08.280
<v Speaker 5>and explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll try to explain it.</v>

1628
01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:11.910
<v Speaker 5>One of the holiest Hindus symbols is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the Yoni Lingham.</v>

1629
01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:14.850
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>combination,</v>

1630
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.560
<v Speaker 5>masculine and feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a container and a phallic</v>

1631
01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:22.223
<v Speaker 5>cylinder and it's often in gold and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>often the thing that's at the center of </v>

1632
01:36:26.041 --> 01:36:26.874
<v Speaker 5>a temple and it's a car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a symbol for the original </v>

1633
01:36:29.911 --> 01:36:30.744
<v Speaker 5>juxtaposition of masculine and feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The creative juxtaposition of masculine </v>

1634
01:36:34.381 --> 01:36:35.820
<v Speaker 5>and feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1635
01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:38.130
<v Speaker 5>So it's also a symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a taoist symbol.</v>

1636
01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:41.130
<v Speaker 5>It's also very similar to the Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 5>star,</v>

1637
01:36:41.131 --> 01:36:44.880
<v Speaker 5>which is a female triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a male triangle put together.</v>

1638
01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.050
<v Speaker 5>And so it's a combination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1639
01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:47.933
<v Speaker 5>it's a symbol of the unity out of which </v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable things spring Hanse it'd be </v>

1640
01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:56.580
<v Speaker 5>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well the cricket is speaking from that.</v>

1641
01:36:57.330 --> 01:36:58.163
<v Speaker 5>And so you could also say that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conscience in some sense is the voice </v>

1642
01:37:01.351 --> 01:37:02.184
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the voice of the combination of </v>

1643
01:37:04.621 --> 01:37:07.830
<v Speaker 5>masculine and feminine from him from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>mythological perspective.</v>

1644
01:37:07.831 --> 01:37:10.170
<v Speaker 5>And it's trying to speak natural wisdom </v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

1645
01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:11.333
<v Speaker 5>or maybe it's trying to speak wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the optimal combination of </v>

1646
01:37:14.251 --> 01:37:15.084
<v Speaker 5>natural and cultural wisdom and trying </v>
<v Speaker 5>to convince Pinocchio that this isn't a </v>

1647
01:37:18.841 --> 01:37:20.940
<v Speaker 5>good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he doesn't listen.</v>

1648
01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.240
<v Speaker 5>So then he gets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he meets this Italian,</v>

1649
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:25.343
<v Speaker 5>a scam artist fundamentally who in </v>
<v Speaker 5>slaves him well pretending that he's </v>

1650
01:37:30.331 --> 01:37:32.250
<v Speaker 5>doing a good thing and you could see </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1651
01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.050
<v Speaker 5>The cricket is</v>

1652
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:38.660
<v Speaker 2>not very happy about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where is that?</v>

1653
01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1654
01:37:39.710 --> 01:37:41.330
<v Speaker 5>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's Very</v>

1655
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:43.663
<v Speaker 5>Unhappy About Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was d two or into cheap attention </v>

1656
01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:49.070
<v Speaker 5>getting okay.</v>

1657
01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see there the emergence of the </v>

1658
01:38:23.371 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 1>tyrannosaur farther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

1659
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:28.940
<v Speaker 1>in that explosion of Rage is Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not acting his puppet part.</v>

1660
01:38:28.941 --> 01:38:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And so there's instant rage on the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tyrant now when he finds out that</v>

1661
01:38:33.111 --> 01:38:37.580
<v Speaker 1>the crowd is happy about his now a slave</v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

1662
01:38:37.581 --> 01:38:40.370
<v Speaker 1>a fool of himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's also funny and that that can</v>

1663
01:38:40.371 --> 01:38:42.230
<v Speaker 1>garner attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's all,</v>

1664
01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:43.650
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1665
01:38:44.150 --> 01:38:46.070
<v Speaker 1>put away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1666
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:47.203
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly possible for children to </v>

1667
01:38:49.011 --> 01:38:51.530
<v Speaker 1>be caused by celebrities by acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>

1668
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Like if you've been around badly behaved</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

1669
01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.510
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional added,</v>

1670
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:59.120
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what they do there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1671
01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:00.313
<v Speaker 1>they absorb all the attention in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room and they do that by acting in a </v>

1672
01:39:03.261 --> 01:39:07.100
<v Speaker 1>suboptimal way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a terrible thing to see happen.</v>

1673
01:39:07.101 --> 01:39:08.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what's being played </v>
<v Speaker 1>out here.</v>

1674
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:10.243
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their parents think they're giving them </v>

1675
01:39:11.391 --> 01:39:13.220
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not there.</v>

1676
01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:16.460
<v Speaker 1>They're quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1677
01:39:16.461 --> 01:39:18.710
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Pinocchio does his Little Act</v>

1678
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:22.790
<v Speaker 1>and shows that he's capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous action.</v>

1679
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 1>He makes a fool of himself again at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end and</v>

1680
01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.233
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

1681
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this scene,</v>

1682
01:39:32.571 --> 01:39:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Japan goes out to look for Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he hasn't come home.</v>

1683
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.833
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then now we're back after the </v>

1684
01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:40.453
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

1685
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.800
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1686
01:40:04.110 --> 01:40:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I would push you in the public's eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your face.</v>

1687
01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:12.590
<v Speaker 3>She would be on everybody's down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1689
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:26.810
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1690
01:40:26.811 --> 01:40:31.811
<v Speaker 3>you go to her no heel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1691
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.923
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go home at the old </v>

1692
01:40:41.050 --> 01:40:44.300
<v Speaker 3>mother</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mary called beat.</v>

1693
01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.193
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you obviously know what's going to </v>

1694
01:40:49.051 --> 01:40:49.884
<v Speaker 1>happen next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's now become a prisoner of this </v>

1695
01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>thing that's exploiting</v>

1696
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:58.420
<v Speaker 5>him and it threatens him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then of course he's kidnapped.</v>

1697
01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:01.420
<v Speaker 5>So the cricket goes off to look for,</v>

1698
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:19.190
<v Speaker 2>what was that show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you worry,</v>

1699
01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I'll have you out of here in no time at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1700
01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just as easy</v>

1701
01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:35.710
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

1702
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:39.120
<v Speaker 5>animosity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1703
01:41:39.121 --> 01:41:43.200
<v Speaker 5>So neither the conscience nor Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 5>can make it out of here.</v>

1704
01:41:44.850 --> 01:41:47.820
<v Speaker 5>And so they're both trapped because this</v>
<v Speaker 5>is actually a very sneaky,</v>

1705
01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:52.090
<v Speaker 5>difficult position to be it all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

1706
01:41:55.150 --> 01:41:55.983
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

1707
01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.640
<v Speaker 2>I tell her the truth.</v>

1708
01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.033
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an idea about creative people </v>

1709
01:42:19.321 --> 01:42:24.000
<v Speaker 5>that they have a muse and the muse is </v>
<v Speaker 5>often a feminine figure.</v>

1710
01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:26.490
<v Speaker 5>And there's a variety of reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1711
01:42:26.491 --> 01:42:28.170
<v Speaker 5>But some of the were played out in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>

1712
01:42:28.171 --> 01:42:30.390
<v Speaker 5>But the idea to some degree is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>

1713
01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:33.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're out in no man's land in chaos,</v>

1714
01:42:33.871 --> 01:42:34.704
<v Speaker 5>maybe you've broken a social rule that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the possibility that you can </v>

1715
01:42:37.801 --> 01:42:41.610
<v Speaker 5>garner something positive from it if </v>
<v Speaker 5>your attitude is proper.</v>

1716
01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:42.953
<v Speaker 5>And that's part of what's happening here</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that he encounters the positive </v>

1717
01:42:45.661 --> 01:42:48.210
<v Speaker 5>element of deviation deviating from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>path.</v>

1718
01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:51.750
<v Speaker 5>But there's also something a little more</v>
<v Speaker 5>subtle,</v>

1719
01:42:51.751 --> 01:42:56.751
<v Speaker 5>which is the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 5>your nature is robust enough to tolerate</v>

1720
01:42:57.811 --> 01:43:00.960
<v Speaker 5>a certain amount of deviation from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>proper course.</v>

1721
01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:05.580
<v Speaker 5>You can tolerate like oscillations back </v>
<v Speaker 5>and forth into too much order.</v>

1722
01:43:05.581 --> 01:43:08.130
<v Speaker 5>It too much chaos without it completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>undermining you.</v>

1723
01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:09.293
<v Speaker 5>But then the movie also makes a point is</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that works best if you're not </v>

1724
01:43:12.961 --> 01:43:13.794
<v Speaker 5>falsifying your own experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course this is the part of the </v>

1725
01:43:15.571 --> 01:43:16.404
<v Speaker 5>movie that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Everybody Who Watches Pinocchio </v>

1726
01:43:18.091 --> 01:43:20.520
<v Speaker 5>always remembers is that when he tells a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lie,</v>

1727
01:43:20.521 --> 01:43:22.620
<v Speaker 5>his nose growth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1728
01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:26.100
<v Speaker 5>Making him making the lie obvious to </v>
<v Speaker 5>others fundamentally.</v>

1729
01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:27.180
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1730
01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:29.430
<v Speaker 5>the simple moral from the stories don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>lie.</v>

1731
01:43:29.431 --> 01:43:30.264
<v Speaker 5>And of course that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a primary part of the </v>

1732
01:43:33.991 --> 01:43:38.640
<v Speaker 5>developmental sequence in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of the problem with the lie is that</v>

1733
01:43:38.850 --> 01:43:43.850
<v Speaker 5>it prevents you from repairing your own </v>
<v Speaker 5>structure because you deny the existence</v>

1734
01:43:43.861 --> 01:43:44.694
<v Speaker 5>of the error.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what do you do then is accumulate </v>

1735
01:43:46.261 --> 01:43:47.094
<v Speaker 5>errors as you move through time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you do that long enough then all </v>

1736
01:43:49.891 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 5>you are is there and then you're really </v>
<v Speaker 5>in</v>

1737
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.843
<v Speaker 1>trouble because part of your conscience </v>
<v Speaker 1>is speaking from the error ridden </v>

1738
01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:01.700
<v Speaker 1>domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the more you pathologize your own</v>

1739
01:44:01.701 --> 01:44:04.880
<v Speaker 1>internal structure or say your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the broader community,</v>

1740
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:07.840
<v Speaker 1>the less it is possible for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize it.</v>

1741
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:08.683
<v Speaker 1>To rely on that in build voice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience because it gets pathologized </v>

1742
01:44:13.131 --> 01:44:13.964
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine that as the </v>

1743
01:44:16.221 --> 01:44:20.060
<v Speaker 1>development of a positive feedback loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you tell yourself lies,</v>

1744
01:44:20.061 --> 01:44:20.894
<v Speaker 1>the more ben your perceptions become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and the more unstable the self </v>

1745
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:30.140
<v Speaker 1>guiding mechanism so to speak inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you becomes.</v>

1746
01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:35.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's the corruption of the self is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the corruption of the state.</v>

1747
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.903
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you hypothesize </v>

1748
01:44:41.451 --> 01:44:44.240
<v Speaker 1>where's the people are almost always </v>
<v Speaker 1>bugged by,</v>

1749
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:49.250
<v Speaker 1>by things that are also partly that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected in some important way.</v>

1750
01:44:49.251 --> 01:44:50.084
<v Speaker 1>To the social community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he suggested was </v>

1751
01:44:52.731 --> 01:44:55.910
<v Speaker 1>that if you really fix your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

1752
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:57.643
<v Speaker 1>you know the problems that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced themselves to you within your </v>

1753
01:44:59.661 --> 01:45:00.494
<v Speaker 1>own personal space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took them on is your problems to </v>

1754
01:45:02.271 --> 01:45:03.104
<v Speaker 1>fix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would also be simultaneously </v>

1755
01:45:05.091 --> 01:45:09.290
<v Speaker 1>retooling the social structure in so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you were able to do that.</v>

1756
01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no only fixing you,</v>

1757
01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:12.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1758
01:45:12.131 --> 01:45:15.770
<v Speaker 1>you change the social structure around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just by fixing yourself.</v>

1759
01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And so what that also means is that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree that you failed to respond to</v>

1760
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:23.360
<v Speaker 1>your own knowledge of error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what makes it so cool.</v>

1761
01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:24.393
<v Speaker 1>It isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this process is isn't someone else </v>

1762
01:45:26.271 --> 01:45:27.104
<v Speaker 1>telling you that you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you telling yourself that you're </v>

1763
01:45:30.861 --> 01:45:33.050
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't,</v>

1764
01:45:33.051 --> 01:45:36.650
<v Speaker 1>failure to abide by the rules because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules,</v>

1765
01:45:36.651 --> 01:45:39.200
<v Speaker 1>while the conscience is the arbiter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules,</v>

1766
01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:42.290
<v Speaker 1>they're unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary but unstable.</v>

1767
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:43.840
<v Speaker 1>But you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1768
01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:44.983
<v Speaker 1>the moral battle that you're obliged to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass through is it is a product of your </v>

1769
01:45:48.321 --> 01:45:49.154
<v Speaker 1>own construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's as if you're playing a game </v>

1770
01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:53.900
<v Speaker 1>and then where you make up the rules and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then cheating,</v>

1771
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:55.250
<v Speaker 1>not useful.</v>

1772
01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:04.580
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1773
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:10.300
<v Speaker 3>it's writing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

1774
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:16.270
<v Speaker 1>So now he's given up</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to nature.</v>

1775
01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:26.220
<v Speaker 3>I tell her the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

1776
01:46:31.810 --> 01:46:36.810
<v Speaker 3>oh</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1777
01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:42.220
<v Speaker 3>This</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nokia,</v>

1778
01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:47.640
<v Speaker 3>why didn't you go to school?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead Tom.</v>

1779
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1780
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:02.830
<v Speaker 5>The other thing that's happening here </v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously is that he,</v>

1781
01:47:02.831 --> 01:47:03.664
<v Speaker 5>as he lies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he becomes less human and more would </v>

1782
01:47:05.821 --> 01:47:07.640
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1783
01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:10.000
<v Speaker 5>hence the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1784
01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:12.710
<v Speaker 5>the nose growing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

1785
01:47:12.711 --> 01:47:13.544
<v Speaker 5>he learns that that's a bad idea and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ferry gives them a hand and he escapes </v>

1786
01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:21.050
<v Speaker 5>out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hypothetically having learned something.</v>

1787
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:26.103
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1788
01:47:26.690 --> 01:47:27.523
<v Speaker 5>now I want you to follow this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you remember at the beginning of the </v>

1789
01:47:30.201 --> 01:47:31.250
<v Speaker 5>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio,</v>

1790
01:47:31.251 --> 01:47:32.061
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his smile,</v>

1791
01:47:32.061 --> 01:47:34.700
<v Speaker 5>you saw that negative male figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>glaring out of it.</v>

1792
01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.780
<v Speaker 5>And then we saw the same negative fee </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure male figure in the,</v>

1793
01:47:38.781 --> 01:47:39.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1794
01:47:39.711 --> 01:47:43.160
<v Speaker 5>in the Gypsy who the kidnapping gypsy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they're harsh,</v>

1795
01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:44.720
<v Speaker 5>tyrannical male.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1796
01:47:44.721 --> 01:47:45.554
<v Speaker 5>So what you're doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then of course there's the Fox and </v>

1797
01:47:47.331 --> 01:47:50.090
<v Speaker 5>the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're seeing different incarnations are</v>

1798
01:47:50.091 --> 01:47:52.130
<v Speaker 5>avatars of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the negative.</v>

1799
01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:54.500
<v Speaker 5>Great fodder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1800
01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:55.100
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

1801
01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:57.500
<v Speaker 5>I would say some contamination by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>adversary,</v>

1802
01:47:57.501 --> 01:47:59.120
<v Speaker 5>but we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll just stick with the negative.</v>

1803
01:47:59.121 --> 01:48:00.290
<v Speaker 5>Great farther.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right now,</v>

1804
01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:04.130
<v Speaker 5>what happens here is the actual </v>
<v Speaker 5>archetype reveals itself.</v>

1805
01:48:04.131 --> 01:48:05.960
<v Speaker 5>So you could think of this as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1806
01:48:05.961 --> 01:48:06.794
<v Speaker 5>it's a daunting is inferno model.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio is coming into contact with </v>

1807
01:48:10.521 --> 01:48:12.350
<v Speaker 5>things that are more and more serious.</v>

1808
01:48:12.650 --> 01:48:13.483
<v Speaker 5>And what you see here is the petty petty</v>
<v Speaker 5>evil guys bragging about how remarkable </v>

1809
01:48:18.321 --> 01:48:19.154
<v Speaker 5>they are to the coachman coachman's that</v>
<v Speaker 5>typical archetipal a representation of </v>

1810
01:48:23.841 --> 01:48:26.570
<v Speaker 5>Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the coachman is someone who takes you</v>

1811
01:48:26.571 --> 01:48:27.920
<v Speaker 5>where you don't want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1812
01:48:27.921 --> 01:48:29.630
<v Speaker 5>it's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's,</v>

1813
01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:33.650
<v Speaker 5>it's your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your placement within the confines of an</v>

1814
01:48:33.651 --> 01:48:34.484
<v Speaker 5>autonomous force.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what you see here is they encounter </v>

1815
01:48:37.431 --> 01:48:41.870
<v Speaker 5>the coachman and the coachman doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>reveal who he is except in one place.</v>

1816
01:48:41.871 --> 01:48:42.704
<v Speaker 5>And what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's all of a sudden he transforms </v>

1817
01:48:45.201 --> 01:48:47.540
<v Speaker 5>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a mere character in the movie.</v>

1818
01:48:47.541 --> 01:48:49.430
<v Speaker 5>So to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the archetype itself.</v>

1819
01:48:49.431 --> 01:48:52.220
<v Speaker 5>It reveals itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the gates slam back shop.</v>

1820
01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:53.413
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting is that that revelation is </v>

1821
01:48:55.611 --> 01:48:56.444
<v Speaker 5>sufficient even to terrify the thugs </v>
<v Speaker 5>because in some sense they have no idea </v>

1822
01:49:00.561 --> 01:49:01.880
<v Speaker 5>what they're messing with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1823
01:49:01.881 --> 01:49:02.714
<v Speaker 5>and they're very art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're very narcissistic and </v>

1824
01:49:04.131 --> 01:49:04.964
<v Speaker 5>egotistical and they think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get away with what they're </v>

1825
01:49:07.221 --> 01:49:10.190
<v Speaker 5>doing forever and you know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>really not so bad anyways.</v>

1826
01:49:10.191 --> 01:49:13.100
<v Speaker 5>And that the people they're praying on </v>
<v Speaker 5>it deserve it because they're stupid and</v>

1827
01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:15.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're full of rationalizations,</v>

1828
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:16.303
<v Speaker 5>but they get a glimpse of what it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's animating them and it terrifies </v>

1829
01:49:19.761 --> 01:49:20.594
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1830
01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:59.900
<v Speaker 2>This job's too</v>
<v Speaker 2>coach man.</v>

1831
01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:13.760
<v Speaker 2>What's your brother's name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you like to make some money?</v>

1832
01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:24.840
<v Speaker 2>And who do we ask to it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1833
01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:32.230
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll know the disability.</v>

1834
01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:09.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1835
01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:16.980
<v Speaker 2>no</v>
<v Speaker 2>crossing.</v>

1836
01:51:33.650 --> 01:51:35.510
<v Speaker 5>You always meet the Devil at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>crossroads,</v>

1837
01:51:35.511 --> 01:51:37.250
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause every blues singer notes.</v>

1838
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:38.263
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the crossroads is a binary </v>

1839
01:51:41.151 --> 01:51:42.410
<v Speaker 5>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1840
01:51:42.411 --> 01:51:44.030
<v Speaker 5>And there's the right road in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>road.</v>

1841
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:46.400
<v Speaker 5>So the devil always be two at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>crossroads.</v>

1842
01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:47.773
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's where the coachman meets the </v>

1843
01:51:48.411 --> 01:51:50.180
<v Speaker 5>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a decision point.</v>

1844
01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:51.980
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1845
01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:56.660
<v Speaker 5>So something up is something is up that </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't good.</v>

1846
01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:02.510
<v Speaker 5>So Pinocchio is going back to school and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then he gets stopped again.</v>

1847
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the snake</v>

1848
01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:28.190
<v Speaker 2>to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1849
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:34.860
<v Speaker 2>no sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing can stop me now I will.</v>

1850
01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1851
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:20.020
<v Speaker 6>Victim.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the next temptation.</v>

1852
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:22.970
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the victim Motif is a deep one.</v>

1853
01:53:22.971 --> 01:53:23.804
<v Speaker 5>So basically what the Fox tells the boy </v>
<v Speaker 5>now is that there's a bunch of things </v>

1854
01:53:26.991 --> 01:53:28.790
<v Speaker 5>wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well obviously right?</v>

1855
01:53:28.791 --> 01:53:30.590
<v Speaker 5>Because there's a bunch of things wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>with everyone,</v>

1856
01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:32.053
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so he can make a perfectly </v>

1857
01:53:33.471 --> 01:53:34.304
<v Speaker 5>reasonable claim of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he convinces the boy that the </v>

1858
01:53:37.491 --> 01:53:38.324
<v Speaker 5>fact that there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 5>him justifies his deviation from what </v>

1859
01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:43.360
<v Speaker 5>he's supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

1860
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:45.440
<v Speaker 5>that's a classical eatable trick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1861
01:53:45.441 --> 01:53:46.274
<v Speaker 5>if you want to keep your kids at home </v>
<v Speaker 5>and make sure that they never leave and </v>

1862
01:53:48.411 --> 01:53:49.244
<v Speaker 5>render them completely useless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you want to do is watch them toy </v>

1863
01:53:52.461 --> 01:53:55.970
<v Speaker 5>with their own vulnerability and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>encourage that,</v>

1864
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:57.310
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if the kid,</v>

1865
01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:00.440
<v Speaker 5>you ever use this being ill as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an excuse,</v>

1866
01:54:00.441 --> 01:54:01.274
<v Speaker 5>which every kid will absolutely do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if they have to go do </v>

1867
01:54:03.891 --> 01:54:05.870
<v Speaker 5>something they don't want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like go to school,</v>

1868
01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.240
<v Speaker 5>you just give in every time they do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1869
01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:09.373
<v Speaker 5>Or if you really want to do a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you do is you reward them every </v>

1870
01:54:11.931 --> 01:54:15.530
<v Speaker 5>time they do that and you punish them </v>
<v Speaker 5>every time they do the opposite.</v>

1871
01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:16.753
<v Speaker 5>And if you do that 150,000 times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you'll have someone who will be </v>

1872
01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:23.570
<v Speaker 5>absolutely incapable of standing on </v>
<v Speaker 5>their own two feet.</v>

1873
01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:26.750
<v Speaker 5>And that's very helpful for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that's the sort of person you want to</v>

1874
01:54:26.751 --> 01:54:27.584
<v Speaker 5>have around that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>usually you're usually inclined to do </v>

1875
01:54:29.691 --> 01:54:31.310
<v Speaker 5>that if you don't have a life of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>own,</v>

1876
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:32.923
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can't even tolerate the </v>

1877
01:54:34.011 --> 01:54:34.844
<v Speaker 5>possibility of ever being alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you cripple your child so they can't </v>

1878
01:54:37.821 --> 01:54:38.654
<v Speaker 5>leave.</v>

1879
01:54:39.150 --> 01:54:39.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1880
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:42.380
<v Speaker 5>So that's essentially what's being </v>
<v Speaker 5>offered to Pinocchio now.</v>

1881
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:44.060
<v Speaker 5>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Fox says,</v>

1882
01:54:44.061 --> 01:54:45.740
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're way too stressed.</v>

1883
01:54:45.741 --> 01:54:48.530
<v Speaker 5>Everything's too terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you need is a vacation.</v>

1884
01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:50.880
<v Speaker 5>So what we're going to do is replace </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1885
01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:52.510
<v Speaker 5>the duty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak to them.</v>

1886
01:54:52.730 --> 01:54:53.563
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the movement forward towards the proper </v>

1887
01:54:54.801 --> 01:54:58.460
<v Speaker 5>goal with nothing but fun and games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>

1888
01:54:58.670 --> 01:55:01.790
<v Speaker 5>you could say it's a future discounting </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the extreme,</v>

1889
01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.310
<v Speaker 5>forget about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Life is hard.</v>

1890
01:55:04.311 --> 01:55:05.144
<v Speaker 5>Concentrate on the present,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do the easy fun things and you deserve </v>

1891
01:55:07.971 --> 01:55:09.860
<v Speaker 5>it anyways because you're in such rough </v>
<v Speaker 5>shape,</v>

1892
01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:12.740
<v Speaker 5>you can see that that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>compelling temptation.</v>

1893
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:13.603
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a child who is quite ill for a </v>

1894
01:55:15.711 --> 01:55:19.590
<v Speaker 5>long time and one of the things we </v>
<v Speaker 5>really struggled with was if you have,</v>

1895
01:55:19.610 --> 01:55:20.443
<v Speaker 5>you're with someone who's really ill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the hell do you know when to excuse </v>

1896
01:55:23.631 --> 01:55:26.240
<v Speaker 5>them from their obligations?</v>

1897
01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:28.220
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I could never,</v>

1898
01:55:28.370 --> 01:55:30.710
<v Speaker 5>we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had the negotiate this all the time.</v>

1899
01:55:30.711 --> 01:55:31.544
<v Speaker 5>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

1900
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:33.830
<v Speaker 5>my one child was very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very tired in the morning,</v>

1901
01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:34.693
<v Speaker 5>terribly tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a secondary consequence of this </v>

1902
01:55:37.221 --> 01:55:39.020
<v Speaker 5>particular illness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1903
01:55:39.021 --> 01:55:39.854
<v Speaker 5>we were trying to negotiate that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you have to go what you have </v>

1904
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:44.880
<v Speaker 5>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you absolutely can't.</v>

1905
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When can't you?</v>

1906
01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:47.993
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1907
01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:50.760
<v Speaker 5>can you do it if you can crawl out the </v>
<v Speaker 5>door?</v>

1908
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:53.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever see my left foot?</v>

1909
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.280
<v Speaker 5>It's an amazing movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's based on a true story.</v>

1910
01:55:56.281 --> 01:55:57.114
<v Speaker 5>It's about this kid who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he had cerebral palsy but he </v>

1911
01:55:59.941 --> 01:56:03.510
<v Speaker 5>couldn't really do anything with his </v>
<v Speaker 5>body except with his left foot.</v>

1912
01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:08.220
<v Speaker 5>He could drag himself around with his </v>
<v Speaker 5>left foot and he learned to write and he</v>

1913
01:56:08.221 --> 01:56:10.170
<v Speaker 5>learned to draw and he learned how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicate.</v>

1914
01:56:10.170 --> 01:56:12.600
<v Speaker 5>And you went to school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as far to just wouldn't help him.</v>

1915
01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.790
<v Speaker 5>He dragged himself up and down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stairs.</v>

1916
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:17.250
<v Speaker 5>Like he had to do everything with his </v>
<v Speaker 5>left foot.</v>

1917
01:56:17.610 --> 01:56:18.630
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he managed,</v>

1918
01:56:18.631 --> 01:56:21.240
<v Speaker 5>he managed to live that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1919
01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.500
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

1920
01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.393
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I've ever met anyone in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the modern world who would be tough </v>

1921
01:56:27.901 --> 01:56:30.690
<v Speaker 5>enough to do what his father did because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1922
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:31.620
<v Speaker 5>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1923
01:56:31.710 --> 01:56:34.470
<v Speaker 5>have some compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1924
01:56:34.471 --> 01:56:37.470
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well compassion is a double edge sword,</v>

1925
01:56:37.710 --> 01:56:38.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the basic rule,</v>

1926
01:56:38.941 --> 01:56:39.774
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you what the rule is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is a rule that's often used in </v>

1927
01:56:41.641 --> 01:56:44.730
<v Speaker 5>nursing homes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never do anything for anyone they can do</v>

1928
01:56:44.731 --> 01:56:47.100
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you think,</v>

1929
01:56:47.101 --> 01:56:47.934
<v Speaker 5>well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's harsh man part because you have </v>

1930
01:56:50.371 --> 01:56:54.390
<v Speaker 5>to find out what they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's also respect for their autonomy</v>

1931
01:56:54.391 --> 01:56:57.420
<v Speaker 5>and encouragement to continue developing</v>
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

1932
01:57:00.890 --> 01:57:02.600
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that isn't what happens here.</v>

1933
01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:04.873
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things I told my child was </v>

1934
01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:09.710
<v Speaker 5>never use your illness as an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even once.</v>

1935
01:57:09.711 --> 01:57:11.870
<v Speaker 5>Because as soon as you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even once,</v>

1936
01:57:12.110 --> 01:57:12.943
<v Speaker 5>you won't be able to tell the difference</v>
<v Speaker 5>between being sick and wanting to be </v>

1937
01:57:14.871 --> 01:57:15.704
<v Speaker 5>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you're sick like that and you </v>

1938
01:57:17.121 --> 01:57:18.650
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>50 things is wrong with you,</v>

1939
01:57:19.070 --> 01:57:23.030
<v Speaker 5>it's already hard enough to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 5>what you can do and what you can't do,</v>

1940
01:57:23.031 --> 01:57:23.864
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you drop a little bit of poison into </v>

1941
01:57:25.071 --> 01:57:28.850
<v Speaker 5>that brew and like it's just toxic mess </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

1942
01:57:31.150 --> 01:57:35.590
<v Speaker 5>We must diagnosis cases once we got the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

1943
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:42.430
<v Speaker 5>So basically what happens here is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>by over attending to Pinocchio's,</v>

1944
01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:47.800
<v Speaker 5>let's say neurotic doubts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the parent figure produces,</v>

1945
01:57:48.650 --> 01:57:49.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like hop,</v>

1946
01:57:49.711 --> 01:57:51.080
<v Speaker 5>hop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hypochondriasis,</v>

1947
01:57:51.210 --> 01:57:52.043
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because partly what parents kids are </v>

1948
01:57:52.941 --> 01:57:54.650
<v Speaker 5>doing is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like this,</v>

1949
01:57:54.710 --> 01:57:57.110
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My throat hurts a bit.</v>

1950
01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:58.970
<v Speaker 5>Does that mean I don't have to go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>school?</v>

1951
01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:00.373
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure you don't have to go to school </v>

1952
01:58:01.911 --> 01:58:04.130
<v Speaker 5>and there's probably eight other things </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong with you.</v>

1953
01:58:04.131 --> 01:58:04.964
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then let's spend a bunch of time </v>

1954
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:07.183
<v Speaker 5>looking for them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we can have a hug and a cuddle </v>

1955
01:58:08.631 --> 01:58:11.090
<v Speaker 5>while we're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't have to watch my stupid soap</v>

1956
01:58:11.091 --> 01:58:13.880
<v Speaker 5>operas and you could stay home from </v>
<v Speaker 5>school and keep me company.</v>

1957
01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.250
<v Speaker 5>It's a little conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1958
01:58:16.251 --> 01:58:19.970
<v Speaker 5>So the child learns to do that and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>bloody will exploit that like mad.</v>

1959
01:58:20.210 --> 01:58:21.043
<v Speaker 5>And the parent can justify doing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the feeling that they're being </v>

1960
01:58:24.051 --> 01:58:26.840
<v Speaker 5>compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a nasty,</v>

1961
01:58:26.841 --> 01:58:27.674
<v Speaker 5>nasty little game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's partly why it's laid out </v>

1962
01:58:29.751 --> 01:58:30.860
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

1963
01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.810
<v Speaker 5>he convinced his Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sick,</v>

1964
01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:39.640
<v Speaker 5>making him sick in the process and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>telling him he needs a vacation.</v>

1965
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.600
<v Speaker 5>So off they go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Vacation time.</v>

1966
01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:52.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1967
01:59:06.230 --> 01:59:07.063
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this nasty little character we're </v>

1968
01:59:08.091 --> 01:59:09.410
<v Speaker 5>going to beat now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meet now.</v>

1969
01:59:09.411 --> 01:59:10.244
<v Speaker 5>His name is lamp wake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's a reference to </v>

1970
01:59:11.871 --> 01:59:12.704
<v Speaker 5>Lucifer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the same category of word and he's </v>

1971
01:59:15.051 --> 01:59:15.884
<v Speaker 5>a prematurely cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>delinquent type of kid and he's got a </v>

1972
01:59:18.591 --> 01:59:21.980
<v Speaker 5>very superior and arrogant attitude </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause he goes everything cause nothing's</v>

1973
01:59:21.981 --> 01:59:25.160
<v Speaker 5>worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's the adversary.</v>

1974
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:27.740
<v Speaker 5>He's Pinocchio's shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1975
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:29.400
<v Speaker 5>that's one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>written.</v>

1976
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:30.263
<v Speaker 5>So Pinocchio meets a Chateau,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which of course every teenager meets </v>

1977
01:59:32.841 --> 01:59:35.570
<v Speaker 5>when they're a teenager because that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>who you meet when you're a teenager,</v>

1978
01:59:35.571 --> 01:59:36.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1979
01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:37.093
<v Speaker 5>it's that part of the developing ego </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's challenging the structure of the </v>

1980
01:59:41.541 --> 01:59:44.270
<v Speaker 5>community and often doing that by </v>
<v Speaker 5>breaking rules.</v>

1981
01:59:44.271 --> 01:59:47.030
<v Speaker 5>And so that's what people always talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>about as pure pressure.</v>

1982
01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:48.373
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you going to try this bad thing or </v>

1983
01:59:49.411 --> 01:59:51.260
<v Speaker 5>are you going to try that bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1984
01:59:51.261 --> 01:59:54.440
<v Speaker 5>kids have to experiment with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's part of the deal.</v>

1985
01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:56.660
<v Speaker 5>It's part of the developmental </v>
<v Speaker 5>progression.</v>

1986
01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:58.310
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the question is well,</v>

1987
01:59:58.311 --> 01:59:59.144
<v Speaker 5>why not behave badly and break all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rules and be on disciplined and you </v>

1988
02:00:02.090 --> 02:00:02.923
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take every advantage it's at your </v>

1989
02:00:04.071 --> 02:00:06.560
<v Speaker 5>fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a perfectly reasonable question.</v>

1990
02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Let me say it's a swell job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No school,</v>

1991
02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:28.420
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody says,</v>

1992
02:00:28.421 --> 02:00:33.421
<v Speaker 3>oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh</v>

1993
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:36.950
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the place.</v>

1994
02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:40.613
<v Speaker 5>The other thing that's interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 5>lamp wait cause he completely </v>

1995
02:00:42.931 --> 02:00:44.480
<v Speaker 5>narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I don't give,</v>

1996
02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:47.340
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't even exist for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so he's basically,</v>

1997
02:00:47.341 --> 02:00:48.174
<v Speaker 5>he's got tremendously well developed </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychopathic traits and he's also </v>

1998
02:00:50.911 --> 02:00:53.730
<v Speaker 5>delusional because he thinks this is all</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be free.</v>

1999
02:00:54.330 --> 02:00:59.330
<v Speaker 5>So they go off the route of the main </v>
<v Speaker 5>culture out to an isolated place.</v>

2000
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.960
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's like,</v>

2001
02:01:00.961 --> 02:01:03.930
<v Speaker 5>I would say that we're there going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told you that [inaudible] was a suburb</v>

2002
02:01:03.931 --> 02:01:06.180
<v Speaker 5>of the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's where they're headed.</v>

2003
02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:11.840
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're also in a mall,</v>

2004
02:01:37.330 --> 02:01:38.163
<v Speaker 5>not an easy thing</v>

2005
02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:39.133
<v Speaker 2>to escape.</v>

2006
02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:03.053
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that's quite striking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about horror movies is that they're </v>

2007
02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:06.084
<v Speaker 5>often,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they often feature clouds and they're </v>

2008
02:02:07.981 --> 02:02:10.620
<v Speaker 5>often said at amusement parks and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>might say,</v>

2009
02:02:10.621 --> 02:02:10.980
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2010
02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:14.190
<v Speaker 5>what the hell is the connection between </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Amusement Park and horror?</v>

2011
02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:15.413
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've ever been to </v>

2012
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.580
<v Speaker 5>amusement park,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you have,</v>

2013
02:02:17.610 --> 02:02:19.680
<v Speaker 5>you can see the connection pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 5>right away.</v>

2014
02:02:20.010 --> 02:02:21.000
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2015
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:23.970
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's mindless entertainment,</v>

2016
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:24.833
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now it's not like there's anything </v>

2017
02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:27.833
<v Speaker 5>particularly</v>
<v Speaker 5>intrinsically terrible about mindless </v>

2018
02:02:31.921 --> 02:02:33.660
<v Speaker 5>entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's this,</v>

2019
02:02:33.690 --> 02:02:34.523
<v Speaker 5>there's a dark side to amusement parks </v>
<v Speaker 5>and carney life and the gambling that </v>

2020
02:02:38.221 --> 02:02:39.930
<v Speaker 5>goes on there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's low level.</v>

2021
02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:40.853
<v Speaker 5>It's a low level place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a low class place roughly speaking </v>

2022
02:02:44.011 --> 02:02:49.011
<v Speaker 5>and it's because it's associated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's associated with this idea of fun in</v>

2023
02:02:49.771 --> 02:02:52.740
<v Speaker 5>the moment with no care for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's its dark side.</v>

2024
02:02:52.770 --> 02:02:53.603
<v Speaker 5>That's the part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it's tinted with horror and that's </v>

2025
02:02:56.701 --> 02:02:59.220
<v Speaker 5>what happens here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These kids have abandoned culture.</v>

2026
02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:00.213
<v Speaker 5>They don't care about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're cynical about it and no doubt </v>

2027
02:03:02.461 --> 02:03:07.230
<v Speaker 5>they have their reasons and they move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They not only are they cynical about it,</v>

2028
02:03:07.231 --> 02:03:10.320
<v Speaker 5>but they even hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's being too tyrannical for them</v>

2029
02:03:10.710 --> 02:03:11.543
<v Speaker 5>or maybe they just don't want to bear </v>
<v Speaker 5>the responsibility of having to live up </v>

2030
02:03:15.091 --> 02:03:16.980
<v Speaker 5>to its demands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In any case,</v>

2031
02:03:16.981 --> 02:03:18.930
<v Speaker 5>they moved from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2032
02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:22.650
<v Speaker 5>ceasing to identify with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to wanting to pull it down completely.</v>

2033
02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:25.470
<v Speaker 5>And they do that partly by engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 5>mindless entertainment.</v>

2034
02:03:25.471 --> 02:03:27.480
<v Speaker 5>But there's more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is,</v>

2035
02:03:27.570 --> 02:03:30.300
<v Speaker 5>this is where the Nazi mob thing starts </v>
<v Speaker 5>to happen.</v>

2036
02:03:53.530 --> 02:03:57.430
<v Speaker 2>So you can't find your car chase in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mall.</v>

2037
02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:07.000
<v Speaker 5>Now you see that center symbol that's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Mandela niche.</v>

2038
02:04:07.050 --> 02:04:11.110
<v Speaker 5>It's very commonly portrayed in </v>
<v Speaker 5>cathedrals and the Mandela is the symbol</v>

2039
02:04:11.111 --> 02:04:11.944
<v Speaker 5>of the self from a union perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And why that is is ridiculously </v>

2040
02:04:15.821 --> 02:04:16.654
<v Speaker 5>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's the best way that I could </v>

2041
02:04:18.641 --> 02:04:19.474
<v Speaker 5>describe it as like there's this </v>
<v Speaker 5>Buddhist idea that a lotus flower grows </v>

2042
02:04:22.721 --> 02:04:26.980
<v Speaker 5>up from the depths through the water and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then lays itself open on top.</v>

2043
02:04:27.070 --> 02:04:28.810
<v Speaker 5>And then the Buddha emerges in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle.</v>

2044
02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:32.740
<v Speaker 5>And that's what a Mandela is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that flower process.</v>

2045
02:04:32.741 --> 02:04:36.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like emerging being manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>something perfect.</v>

2046
02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 5>And that's that thing represents.</v>

2047
02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:39.473
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2048
02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:44.640
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2049
02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:05.513
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you start to see what's going </v>

2050
02:05:07.151 --> 02:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like as I,</v>

2051
02:05:08.321 --> 02:05:09.154
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned it at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like remember what was happening in </v>

2052
02:05:11.111 --> 02:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Europe at the time that this movie was </v>
<v Speaker 1>being made.</v>

2053
02:05:13.481 --> 02:05:14.314
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the dark forces of fascism were </v>

2054
02:05:16.181 --> 02:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>really starting to gather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2055
02:05:18.131 --> 02:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>in the movie is an unconscious dram of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts.</v>

2056
02:05:21.131 --> 02:05:21.964
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting is that there's a tight </v>

2057
02:05:23.741 --> 02:05:28.741
<v Speaker 1>connection between the abandonment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual moral responsibility.</v>

2058
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:30.303
<v Speaker 1>The turning to deceit and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degeneration of society into something </v>

2059
02:05:34.180 --> 02:05:36.820
<v Speaker 1>that's pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short term pleasure on the one hand that</v>

2060
02:05:36.850 --> 02:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>absolute slavery and brutality on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

2061
02:05:39.850 --> 02:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>And so you have this faceless figures </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving in the background,</v>

2062
02:05:43.330 --> 02:05:44.163
<v Speaker 1>locking the doors to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all a conspiracy in some sense </v>

2063
02:05:47.950 --> 02:05:52.950
<v Speaker 1>to conspiracy by the coachman in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to entrap the unwary</v>

2064
02:06:04.530 --> 02:06:09.530
<v Speaker 3>awesome themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2065
02:06:21.730 --> 02:06:22.563
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio is become separated from his </v>

2066
02:06:24.191 --> 02:06:25.024
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that happens to lots of </v>

2067
02:06:26.141 --> 02:06:28.330
<v Speaker 1>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their teenage years.</v>

2068
02:06:28.630 --> 02:06:30.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they experiment with all sorts of things</v>

2069
02:06:30.551 --> 02:06:31.384
<v Speaker 1>they know they shouldn't be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a particularly pleasant life </v>

2070
02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>and they lose the thread that guides </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2071
02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:36.783
<v Speaker 1>Now there's some necessity in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense they're wandering </v>

2072
02:06:39.581 --> 02:06:42.010
<v Speaker 1>through places that they need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explore,</v>

2073
02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:45.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's also very dangerous because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can leave you permanently damaged,</v>

2074
02:06:48.170 --> 02:06:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fall out and never get back on.</v>

2075
02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.653
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Pinocchio is in there and he's like </v>

2076
02:07:07.331 --> 02:07:11.130
<v Speaker 1>playing pool and smoking and drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and acting like a narcissist.</v>

2077
02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:14.770
<v Speaker 1>And this guy knows some cool tricks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're Pinocchio.</v>

2078
02:07:14.980 --> 02:07:17.680
<v Speaker 1>He takes a little swig of his cigar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2079
02:07:17.681 --> 02:07:22.681
<v Speaker 1>it makes him sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2080
02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:27.240
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2081
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:28.830
<v Speaker 1>that's deceit right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2082
02:07:28.831 --> 02:07:31.770
<v Speaker 1>He's willing to falsify the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his actual experience,</v>

2083
02:07:31.771 --> 02:07:36.400
<v Speaker 1>even at a deep physiological level in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to impress this character</v>

2084
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.151
<v Speaker 5>who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2085
02:07:37.151 --> 02:07:40.480
<v Speaker 5>was the last person in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 5>anyone sends a postcard to impress.</v>

2086
02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now he can't end.</v>

2087
02:07:47.261 --> 02:07:48.094
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2088
02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:52.243
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2089
02:07:52.730 --> 02:07:54.290
<v Speaker 5>That's also very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2090
02:07:54.291 --> 02:07:55.124
<v Speaker 5>you see the sideways eight ball and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a symbol of infinity and it's </v>

2091
02:07:58.131 --> 02:07:59.420
<v Speaker 5>starting to wander.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2092
02:07:59.421 --> 02:08:00.254
<v Speaker 5>partly what the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>partly what the images are suggesting </v>

2093
02:08:03.471 --> 02:08:04.071
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

2094
02:08:04.071 --> 02:08:04.904
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio's aim is very unsteady because</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's pathologized himself and he's also </v>

2095
02:08:10.130 --> 02:08:10.963
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's facing an infinite number of </v>

2096
02:08:12.171 --> 02:08:14.750
<v Speaker 5>problems and can't aim straight to fix </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2097
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:21.183
<v Speaker 5>Losing your grip.</v>

2098
02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:28.293
<v Speaker 5>I also think that's pretty funny from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the perspective of teenage experience </v>

2099
02:08:30.731 --> 02:08:31.564
<v Speaker 5>because it's often the case that just </v>
<v Speaker 5>when some idiot teenager is out to </v>

2100
02:08:34.361 --> 02:08:36.750
<v Speaker 5>impress someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he or she shouldn't depressed,</v>

2101
02:08:36.751 --> 02:08:37.584
<v Speaker 5>that their conscience will pipe up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll do something absolutely moronic </v>

2102
02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:41.493
<v Speaker 5>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes them into a fool in front of the </v>

2103
02:08:42.911 --> 02:08:43.744
<v Speaker 5>people they're trying to impress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's exactly what's happening </v>

2104
02:08:46.271 --> 02:08:47.110
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2105
02:08:47.111 --> 02:08:51.340
<v Speaker 5>and its partly because the person is </v>
<v Speaker 5>torn apart inside and can't act with any</v>

2106
02:08:51.341 --> 02:08:52.360
<v Speaker 5>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2107
02:08:52.361 --> 02:08:54.960
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cricket end,</v>

2108
02:08:54.961 --> 02:08:55.794
<v Speaker 5>this lamp put character have it out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio decides that he's going to go </v>

2109
02:09:00.581 --> 02:09:05.050
<v Speaker 5>with Lamp Wick and so Pinocchio storms </v>
<v Speaker 5>or the cricket storms out</v>

2110
02:09:05.690 --> 02:09:08.750
<v Speaker 2>and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going home.</v>

2111
02:09:34.250 --> 02:09:36.070
<v Speaker 2>He's come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on</v>

2112
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:44.770
<v Speaker 2>and watch your neigh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2113
02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Yo go</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegan ice.</v>

2114
02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:51.103
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So basically what you see is that the </v>

2115
02:09:52.341 --> 02:09:53.174
<v Speaker 5>pathway that's been laid out so far </v>
<v Speaker 5>including this neurotic induced </v>

2116
02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:57.493
<v Speaker 5>antisocial trip to pleasure island </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically culminates in a form of </v>

2117
02:10:00.711 --> 02:10:04.010
<v Speaker 5>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's more to it than that because</v>

2118
02:10:04.011 --> 02:10:06.050
<v Speaker 5>it's voiceless slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2119
02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:08.870
<v Speaker 5>These kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're now jack houses.</v>

2120
02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:13.220
<v Speaker 5>They're not fit to be slaves until they </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't speak properly anymore.</v>

2121
02:10:13.221 --> 02:10:16.490
<v Speaker 5>All they can do is break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they've severed their connection with</v>

2122
02:10:16.491 --> 02:10:17.324
<v Speaker 5>their capacity for genuine speech to </v>
<v Speaker 5>such a degree that everything that is </v>

2123
02:10:22.011 --> 02:10:22.844
<v Speaker 5>associated with a logo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's say with the ability to think </v>

2124
02:10:25.071 --> 02:10:27.290
<v Speaker 5>things through and communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all gone.</v>

2125
02:10:27.650 --> 02:10:30.230
<v Speaker 5>You're empty and brain and that's at </v>
<v Speaker 5>that point,</v>

2126
02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.730
<v Speaker 5>they're fit for slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2127
02:10:32.110 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not only that he can't speak is,</v>

2128
02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:37.580
<v Speaker 5>is fit when you can no longer safe zone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2129
02:10:37.610 --> 02:10:38.300
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2130
02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:39.510
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

2131
02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:42.650
<v Speaker 5>So that means that all of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual identity is gone as well.</v>

2132
02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:43.543
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing individual left at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just brute animal existence and </v>

2133
02:10:47.691 --> 02:10:49.040
<v Speaker 5>that's fit for slavery.</v>

2134
02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine,</v>

2135
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:54.780
<v Speaker 2>next</v>
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>

2136
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Allen</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Paul.</v>

2137
02:11:00.250 --> 02:11:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2138
02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:14.700
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So last notes are good</v>

2139
02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:25.240
<v Speaker 2>conch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2140
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:36.070
<v Speaker 2>You'd think something was done</v>
<v Speaker 2>or as you get to be a real board,</v>

2141
02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:53.580
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

2142
02:11:56.490 --> 02:11:56.830
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2143
02:11:56.830 --> 02:11:57.663
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2144
02:12:01.490 --> 02:12:02.323
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2145
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:10.450
<v Speaker 2>allow me</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

2146
02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:54.673
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2147
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:56.910
<v Speaker 5>so the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

2148
02:12:56.911 --> 02:13:00.480
<v Speaker 5>that's the destruction of painful self </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness.</v>

2149
02:13:05.170 --> 02:13:05.531
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>

2150
02:13:05.531 --> 02:13:10.270
<v Speaker 5>So the cricket knows what's going on and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes to Rescue Pinocchio.</v>

2151
02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:15.720
<v Speaker 5>And then the only way out from this </v>
<v Speaker 5>place is to dive into chaos.</v>

2152
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:19.630
<v Speaker 5>So that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They jump off the cliff,</v>

2153
02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:22.330
<v Speaker 5>very dangerous to get from somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible to somewhere,</v>

2154
02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:26.170
<v Speaker 5>absolutely unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they do that and they go home,</v>

2155
02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:29.860
<v Speaker 5>they wash up at home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's where we are now.</v>

2156
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:33.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't go home again.</v>

2157
02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:50.670
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so dad's not home.</v>

2158
02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:54.150
<v Speaker 5>It's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so now they have no idea what to do.</v>

2159
02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:57.053
<v Speaker 2>Going</v>

2160
02:14:00.630 --> 02:14:01.463
<v Speaker 5>now you'll see a weird intermingling of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say pagan and Christian </v>

2161
02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:05.393
<v Speaker 5>Christian symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the star now sends a dove and the </v>

2162
02:14:07.471 --> 02:14:09.620
<v Speaker 5>dove is a symbol of the holy ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2163
02:14:09.621 --> 02:14:12.840
<v Speaker 5>And hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Holy Ghost,</v>

2164
02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:14.910
<v Speaker 5>there's three members of the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 5>Trinity,</v>

2165
02:14:14.911 --> 02:14:17.040
<v Speaker 5>the father,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the son,</v>

2166
02:14:17.041 --> 02:14:17.874
<v Speaker 5>and the Holy Ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what the hell is a holy </v>

2167
02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:20.311
<v Speaker 5>ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2168
02:14:20.311 --> 02:14:23.040
<v Speaker 5>that's quite the weird idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what it is,</v>

2169
02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:24.533
<v Speaker 5>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it's a representation of the idea </v>

2170
02:14:26.670 --> 02:14:27.503
<v Speaker 5>that you have an image of the divine </v>
<v Speaker 5>within you and that it's something that </v>

2171
02:14:30.931 --> 02:14:35.800
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's something capable of communicating.</v>

2172
02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:37.293
<v Speaker 5>And so it's a natural force in part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is also why it's associated with </v>

2173
02:14:40.961 --> 02:14:44.590
<v Speaker 5>the blue fairy and this and this star.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2174
02:14:46.630 --> 02:14:49.600
<v Speaker 5>well that's the best I can do at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>moment with that.</v>

2175
02:14:49.601 --> 02:14:50.434
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it gives the cricket a message from </v>

2176
02:14:52.181 --> 02:14:53.320
<v Speaker 5>beyond so to speak.</v>

2177
02:14:57.060 --> 02:15:01.970
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a message pop</v>

2178
02:15:03.710 --> 02:15:05.280
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says here,</v>

2179
02:15:05.281 --> 02:15:07.540
<v Speaker 2>he um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went looking for you and uh,</v>

2180
02:15:07.570 --> 02:15:09.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was one of them.</v>

2181
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:15.210
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you noticed that,</v>

2182
02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:18.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio without Japan it was lost,</v>

2183
02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:19.943
<v Speaker 5>but you pedo without Pinocchio gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>degenerates into chaos and it's </v>

2184
02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:27.930
<v Speaker 5>swallowed by a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the two are necessary for one another</v>

2185
02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:28.973
<v Speaker 5>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People swallow this part of the plot </v>

2186
02:15:30.031 --> 02:15:30.864
<v Speaker 5>without any problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the cricket now tells the puppet </v>

2187
02:15:34.111 --> 02:15:34.944
<v Speaker 5>that in order to become real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has to go to the bottom of the ocean </v>

2188
02:15:37.021 --> 02:15:37.854
<v Speaker 5>and rescue his father from a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so another part that makes </v>

2189
02:15:40.951 --> 02:15:42.540
<v Speaker 5>absolutely no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

2190
02:15:42.541 --> 02:15:45.120
<v Speaker 5>that's what they proceed to do back into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2191
02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:48.060
<v Speaker 5>the cricket warns him about how </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous this is,</v>

2192
02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:49.253
<v Speaker 5>but decides to go along anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So down they plunge into the ocean and </v>

2193
02:15:53.131 --> 02:15:57.570
<v Speaker 5>they have some kind of cute adventures </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they get the fish to tell them where</v>

2194
02:15:57.571 --> 02:15:58.404
<v Speaker 5>they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the Fisher so scared that they just </v>

2195
02:16:01.171 --> 02:16:06.171
<v Speaker 5>run away when they hear monster name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so notice that you know,</v>

2196
02:16:06.570 --> 02:16:11.570
<v Speaker 5>he's in the depths already and he has to</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the darkest place in the depths in</v>

2197
02:16:12.451 --> 02:16:17.451
<v Speaker 5>order to find where his father is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2198
02:16:36.251 --> 02:16:37.084
<v Speaker 5>Now Japan goes in there and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>starving to death in the belly of a </v>

2199
02:16:40.061 --> 02:16:41.680
<v Speaker 5>whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not enough food,</v>

2200
02:16:41.681 --> 02:16:43.750
<v Speaker 5>there's not enough nourishment for him </v>
<v Speaker 5>to survive.</v>

2201
02:16:43.751 --> 02:16:47.140
<v Speaker 5>And he can't see any way that on his own</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can get out.</v>

2202
02:16:47.410 --> 02:16:49.180
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's actually given up.</v>

2203
02:16:52.710 --> 02:16:54.780
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's fishing because he thinks,</v>

2204
02:16:54.781 --> 02:16:55.620
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2205
02:16:55.650 --> 02:16:56.483
<v Speaker 5>we might as well have some beat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whale wakes up and it catches a </v>

2206
02:16:59.881 --> 02:17:00.714
<v Speaker 5>bunch of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also catches what you might </v>

2207
02:17:03.931 --> 02:17:08.931
<v Speaker 5>describe as king of the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now see that's Pinocchio.</v>

2208
02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:12.053
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>

2209
02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:14.613
<v Speaker 5>so this is where the movie gets varied.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really have very difficult time </v>

2210
02:17:18.571 --> 02:17:21.750
<v Speaker 5>understanding how this symbolism got in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2211
02:17:21.751 --> 02:17:25.560
<v Speaker 5>But this whole part of the movie is </v>
<v Speaker 5>packed with fish symbolism.</v>

2212
02:17:26.010 --> 02:17:28.320
<v Speaker 5>And although you may know or you may </v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

2213
02:17:28.321 --> 02:17:29.154
<v Speaker 5>but the fish was a symbol for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>early Christianity and Christ is </v>

2214
02:17:31.621 --> 02:17:32.454
<v Speaker 5>assimilated to the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of fish symbolism in </v>

2215
02:17:34.261 --> 02:17:37.140
<v Speaker 5>the new testament and there's all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 5>of reasons for that,</v>

2216
02:17:37.230 --> 02:17:39.290
<v Speaker 5>a number of which are truly </v>
<v Speaker 5>incomprehensible.</v>

2217
02:17:39.300 --> 02:17:41.160
<v Speaker 5>Some of the raster logical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because</v>

2218
02:17:43.450 --> 02:17:48.450
<v Speaker 5>I won't even go into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So imagine this way,</v>

2219
02:17:48.611 --> 02:17:49.720
<v Speaker 5>you're somewhere starving</v>

2220
02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:53.320
<v Speaker 5>and you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got two choices.</v>

2221
02:17:53.321 --> 02:17:54.154
<v Speaker 5>You can either figure out how to live so</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're not going to be starving </v>

2222
02:17:56.531 --> 02:18:00.010
<v Speaker 5>anymore or you can catch some fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2223
02:18:00.011 --> 02:18:03.370
<v Speaker 5>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can feed yourself momentarily or you</v>

2224
02:18:03.371 --> 02:18:07.570
<v Speaker 5>can feed yourself for the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

2225
02:18:07.690 --> 02:18:09.400
<v Speaker 5>and people are making that choice all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>

2226
02:18:09.401 --> 02:18:10.270
<v Speaker 5>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2227
02:18:10.271 --> 02:18:12.550
<v Speaker 5>if you're a good fisherman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you catch a fish.</v>

2228
02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:14.340
<v Speaker 5>But if you're a really good fit from </v>
<v Speaker 5>fishermen,</v>

2229
02:18:14.350 --> 02:18:17.650
<v Speaker 5>you catch something from the depths that</v>
<v Speaker 5>feeds you all the time.</v>

2230
02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:19.660
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's what's happening here.</v>

2231
02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:23.530
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh he thought there was any relationship</v>

2232
02:18:23.531 --> 02:18:26.670
<v Speaker 5>with the Fisher and the Fisher king </v>
<v Speaker 5>cause you know yes,</v>

2233
02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:28.120
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2234
02:18:28.121 --> 02:18:29.290
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2235
02:18:29.291 --> 02:18:30.430
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2236
02:18:30.431 --> 02:18:31.480
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so now Japan,</v>

2237
02:18:31.481 --> 02:18:34.930
<v Speaker 5>I was fishing like mad and he's happy </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he's catching fish now.</v>

2238
02:18:35.590 --> 02:18:38.410
<v Speaker 5>It's very cool what happens here because</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>

2239
02:18:38.411 --> 02:18:38.861
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>couches,</v>

2240
02:18:38.861 --> 02:18:39.610
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of fish.</v>

2241
02:18:39.610 --> 02:18:41.770
<v Speaker 5>Hypothetically he's looking for </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio.</v>

2242
02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:42.813
<v Speaker 5>But he says the unbusy catching fish </v>
<v Speaker 5>that when he catches Pinocchio he </v>

2243
02:18:45.071 --> 02:18:48.490
<v Speaker 5>doesn't even notice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he kind of wakes up to the fact</v>

2244
02:18:48.491 --> 02:18:49.324
<v Speaker 5>that he's caught Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is really what he's trying to </v>

2245
02:18:50.831 --> 02:18:52.810
<v Speaker 5>catch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when he turns around to hug him,</v>

2246
02:18:52.811 --> 02:18:53.644
<v Speaker 5>he grabs a fish and he kisses the fish </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then notices that it's not </v>

2247
02:18:56.531 --> 02:18:57.364
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the filmmakers are very careful to </v>

2248
02:18:59.471 --> 02:19:02.740
<v Speaker 5>insist upon the fact that you peddle </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes,</v>

2249
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:03.903
<v Speaker 5>he's blinded by short term </v>
<v Speaker 5>considerations and cannot see when he's </v>

2250
02:19:07.271 --> 02:19:08.950
<v Speaker 5>caught the thing that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable.</v>

2251
02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:11.140
<v Speaker 5>And we see why Pinocchio is the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable.</v>

2252
02:19:11.141 --> 02:19:13.500
<v Speaker 5>So this is actually the redemption of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan.</v>

2253
02:19:13.501 --> 02:19:14.201
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to some degree,</v>

2254
02:19:14.201 --> 02:19:19.090
<v Speaker 5>he needs Pinocchio's youth and vision to</v>
<v Speaker 5>rescue himself from sterile,</v>

2255
02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:21.490
<v Speaker 5>sterile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and static existence.</v>

2256
02:19:21.610 --> 02:19:23.490
<v Speaker 5>And that would be associated say with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2257
02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:25.390
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the construction of us,</v>

2258
02:19:25.630 --> 02:19:28.430
<v Speaker 5>a sterile totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like North Korea,</v>

2259
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:32.360
<v Speaker 5>where I think I told you last week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wise leader has told all the Koreans</v>

2260
02:19:32.361 --> 02:19:33.194
<v Speaker 5>that they better get used to sucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>routes like they did 20 years ago </v>

2261
02:19:35.451 --> 02:19:38.540
<v Speaker 5>because there ain't gonna be any food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And not only that,</v>

2262
02:19:38.541 --> 02:19:43.400
<v Speaker 5>they get to donate to pounds of rice a </v>
<v Speaker 5>month each to the state warehouses,</v>

2263
02:19:43.430 --> 02:19:46.610
<v Speaker 5>which in principle are supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>the places that distribute the food.</v>

2264
02:19:46.850 --> 02:19:47.683
<v Speaker 5>So the idea that a static enough state </v>
<v Speaker 5>can become sterile and baron is exactly </v>

2265
02:19:52.251 --> 02:19:53.110
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2266
02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:54.043
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2267
02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:12.093
<v Speaker 5>here's a mythological motif there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>many hero stories when the hero heroes </v>

2268
02:20:15.311 --> 02:20:18.310
<v Speaker 5>out to find the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when he finally finds it,</v>

2269
02:20:18.370 --> 02:20:19.203
<v Speaker 5>it's like he's out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But by that time it's generally too </v>

2270
02:20:21.641 --> 02:20:22.660
<v Speaker 5>late.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2271
02:20:22.661 --> 02:20:23.494
<v Speaker 5>So what it means to some degrees that no</v>
<v Speaker 5>matter how awful the thing that you're </v>

2272
02:20:26.981 --> 02:20:27.814
<v Speaker 5>looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no matter how awful you think the thing </v>

2273
02:20:30.251 --> 02:20:33.190
<v Speaker 5>that you're looking for is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's more awful than you think.</v>

2274
02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:35.650
<v Speaker 5>Even prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Pinocchio,</v>

2275
02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:39.490
<v Speaker 5>he's out of their conscience too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're both gone.</v>

2276
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:27.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2277
02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:28.943
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Japan will basically tells Pinocchio </v>

2278
02:22:31.631 --> 02:22:33.750
<v Speaker 5>that there's no damn way they're getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of this whale.</v>

2279
02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:36.390
<v Speaker 5>And so Pinocchio has a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>brainstorm.</v>

2280
02:22:37.350 --> 02:22:38.183
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you pay to also finds out that he's </v>

2281
02:22:39.511 --> 02:22:42.150
<v Speaker 5>half turned into a donkey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which isn't all that pleasant.</v>

2282
02:22:42.151 --> 02:22:42.990
<v Speaker 5>He gets forgiven,</v>

2283
02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:44.553
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2284
02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:45.500
<v Speaker 5>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2285
02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:47.890
<v Speaker 5>says he's built a raft that they can get</v>
<v Speaker 5>out with,</v>

2286
02:22:47.891 --> 02:22:50.380
<v Speaker 5>but everything comes in and nothing goes</v>
<v Speaker 5>out in Pinocchio.</v>

2287
02:22:50.381 --> 02:22:53.590
<v Speaker 5>Decides that he could make the whale </v>
<v Speaker 5>sneeze and he does that.</v>

2288
02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:56.440
<v Speaker 5>So we'll start here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got this brainstorm of an idea.</v>

2289
02:22:58.090 --> 02:22:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2290
02:22:58.510 --> 02:23:00.030
<v Speaker 5>Master of fire idea.</v>

2291
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:03.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all offices</v>

2292
02:23:05.430 --> 02:23:08.790
<v Speaker 2>working comes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2293
02:23:09.330 --> 02:23:13.440
<v Speaker 2>it's all British prenup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

2294
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:15.280
<v Speaker 2>We cooked some of the fish.</v>

2295
02:23:17.090 --> 02:23:19.850
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's a paradigm shift for Japan.</v>

2296
02:23:19.851 --> 02:23:20.684
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fire is there to cook the fish for </v>

2297
02:23:22.251 --> 02:23:23.084
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's there to escape from the damn </v>

2298
02:23:24.471 --> 02:23:25.580
<v Speaker 5>whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2299
02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:28.310
<v Speaker 5>the other thing that happens here is </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio sacrifices.</v>

2300
02:23:28.311 --> 02:23:30.500
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of things that you pedal thinks </v>
<v Speaker 5>are useful.</v>

2301
02:23:30.590 --> 02:23:32.150
<v Speaker 5>Japan will thinks he's going to be in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whale.</v>

2302
02:23:32.350 --> 02:23:33.183
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2303
02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:36.680
<v Speaker 5>So now Pinocchio breaks up all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>furniture and builds a fire out of it.</v>

2304
02:23:36.681 --> 02:23:37.580
<v Speaker 5>And so he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2305
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:38.630
<v Speaker 5>when part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2306
02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:40.033
<v Speaker 5>an explicit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>remind her that part of the reason that </v>

2307
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:44.840
<v Speaker 5>the way people got out of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2308
02:23:44.841 --> 02:23:47.630
<v Speaker 5>the terrible chaotic force of nature was</v>
<v Speaker 5>to master fire.</v>

2309
02:23:47.631 --> 02:23:50.440
<v Speaker 5>It's a technological,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a technological solution.</v>

2310
02:23:50.530 --> 02:23:55.530
<v Speaker 2>These are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the chair.</v>

2311
02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2312
02:24:21.570 --> 02:24:22.403
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's an idea there too that the </v>

2313
02:24:23.441 --> 02:24:26.530
<v Speaker 5>human use of technology is likely to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make the environment,</v>

2314
02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:27.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>react terribly.</v>

2315
02:24:27.881 --> 02:24:30.580
<v Speaker 5>And we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're guilty about that all the time.</v>

2316
02:24:30.581 --> 02:24:32.860
<v Speaker 5>It's part of what underlies our </v>
<v Speaker 5>environmental guilt.</v>

2317
02:24:32.861 --> 02:24:33.694
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're using technology against nature </v>

2318
02:24:35.321 --> 02:24:36.154
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we always feel that there's going to be </v>

2319
02:24:37.331 --> 02:24:39.160
<v Speaker 5>a kickback,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd done something wrong,</v>

2320
02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:41.200
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be a kickback.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2321
02:24:41.201 --> 02:24:43.120
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like it's completely unfounded.</v>

2322
02:24:43.690 --> 02:24:45.550
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now the way home,</v>

2323
02:24:45.551 --> 02:24:47.140
<v Speaker 5>there's something bursty very </v>
<v Speaker 5>surprising,</v>

2324
02:24:47.170 --> 02:24:50.110
<v Speaker 5>which is that it transforms into a fire </v>
<v Speaker 5>breathing dragon.</v>

2325
02:25:04.750 --> 02:25:05.583
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2326
02:25:08.130 --> 02:25:10.230
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then there's a great band</v>

2327
02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:15.250
<v Speaker 5>demand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whale just won't quit.</v>

2328
02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:19.510
<v Speaker 5>Need breaks their boat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Altarpieces Pinocchio rescues his father</v>

2329
02:25:19.511 --> 02:25:24.511
<v Speaker 5>there</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the is all smashed to pieces.</v>

2330
02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:26.750
<v Speaker 5>We'll pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2331
02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2332
02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:36.990
<v Speaker 5>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh says save yourself right now.</v>

2333
02:25:36.991 --> 02:25:39.960
<v Speaker 5>He's out of the damn whale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why bother with the old mat?</v>

2334
02:25:40.830 --> 02:25:42.000
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2335
02:25:42.001 --> 02:25:43.800
<v Speaker 5>and because part of that question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2336
02:25:43.801 --> 02:25:46.230
<v Speaker 5>what's the relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual and the culture?</v>

2337
02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:49.140
<v Speaker 5>What responsibility do you have to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>culture?</v>

2338
02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:51.570
<v Speaker 5>It's drowning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not much use.</v>

2339
02:25:51.571 --> 02:25:52.404
<v Speaker 5>It's old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2340
02:25:52.430 --> 02:25:53.850
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it produced you.</v>

2341
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:56.760
<v Speaker 5>It's worn out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's dangerous to rescue it.</v>

2342
02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:58.380
<v Speaker 5>Why bother?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2343
02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:03.560
<v Speaker 5>Pinocchio decides to rescue his father.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Pinocchio is basically peer destroyed</v>

2344
02:26:51.471 --> 02:26:56.471
<v Speaker 5>by the clash between no hell they should</v>
<v Speaker 5>chaos and insufficient culture.</v>

2345
02:26:57.890 --> 02:27:00.590
<v Speaker 5>And so as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>

2346
02:27:00.591 --> 02:27:01.424
<v Speaker 5>it was alive.</v>

2347
02:27:24.390 --> 02:27:25.223
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2348
02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:32.613
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he sacrificed himself to save his </v>

2349
02:27:35.141 --> 02:27:36.140
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you have,</v>

2350
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:39.400
<v Speaker 5>you have to remember what he sacrificed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a jackass,</v>

2351
02:27:39.401 --> 02:27:40.234
<v Speaker 5>puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And maybe that is what's supposed to be </v>

2352
02:27:43.121 --> 02:27:45.310
<v Speaker 5>sacrificed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to save your culture,</v>

2353
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:47.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get rid of the jackass.</v>

2354
02:27:47.591 --> 02:27:49.100
<v Speaker 5>Puppet is the really adopt the part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2355
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:52.360
<v Speaker 5>we want to have live anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People identify with that.</v>

2356
02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:52.991
<v Speaker 5>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2357
02:27:52.991 --> 02:27:54.790
<v Speaker 5>that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I think.</v>

2358
02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:56.590
<v Speaker 5>That's who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2359
02:27:56.591 --> 02:27:59.470
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you find yourself breaking,</v>

2360
02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:02.860
<v Speaker 5>you might presuppose that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly the case.</v>

2361
02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Unselfish Aye.</v>

2362
02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:30.693
<v Speaker 5>Harmony is restored.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see that father and son Canal </v>

2363
02:29:40.691 --> 02:29:41.710
<v Speaker 5>dance together.</v>

2364
02:29:45.030 --> 02:29:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2365
02:29:58.970 --> 02:30:02.120
<v Speaker 5>And the car insurance is like finally </v>
<v Speaker 5>transformed at this point.</v>

2366
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:10.770
<v Speaker 3>She was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2367
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:18.540
<v Speaker 5>And now it's like a gold flower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called Mandela.</v>

2368
02:30:18.541 --> 02:30:20.340
<v Speaker 5>It's the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all those things.</v>

2369
02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:24.300
<v Speaker 5>And you see you can communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this star.</v>

2370
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:31.063
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2371
02:31:09.630 --> 02:31:12.390
<v Speaker 5>So all of that wrapped up in the Little </v>
<v Speaker 5>Kid's movie,</v>

2372
02:31:14.590 --> 02:31:15.610
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can think about it.</v>

2373
02:31:15.611 --> 02:31:17.800
<v Speaker 5>There's the work of the collective </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagination.</v>

2374
02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:20.250
<v Speaker 5>And I mean that literally in some sense</v>

2375
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:23.820
<v Speaker 1>because a huge number of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative worked on this,</v>

2376
02:31:24.330 --> 02:31:25.163
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's constant compromises as to </v>

2377
02:31:26.821 --> 02:31:29.430
<v Speaker 1>plot and as to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2378
02:31:29.431 --> 02:31:30.264
<v Speaker 1>the images that are going to be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like there's a tremendous amount of </v>

2379
02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:36.540
<v Speaker 1>attention and same amount of attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on every single sale.</v>

2380
02:31:36.541 --> 02:31:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things were hand painted.</v>

2381
02:31:39.210 --> 02:31:40.043
<v Speaker 1>So the amount of work that goes into </v>
<v Speaker 1>each frame is it's hours and hours and </v>

2382
02:31:44.700 --> 02:31:45.533
<v Speaker 1>hours of work and do each frame 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>frames a second cause Disney did it at </v>

2383
02:31:47.941 --> 02:31:49.860
<v Speaker 1>60 frames a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2384
02:31:49.861 --> 02:31:51.960
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's completely,</v>

2385
02:31:52.350 --> 02:31:53.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to remember when you watch </v>

2386
02:31:54.361 --> 02:31:57.540
<v Speaker 1>something like this that every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of it was created,</v>

2387
02:31:57.630 --> 02:31:58.191
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2388
02:31:58.191 --> 02:31:59.024
<v Speaker 1>and by people who had to agree by genius</v>
<v Speaker 1>level people who had to agree on what </v>

2389
02:32:02.761 --> 02:32:05.790
<v Speaker 1>they were doing and so they'd feel their</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2390
02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:07.500
<v Speaker 1>what seems right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2391
02:32:07.610 --> 02:32:08.850
<v Speaker 1>and the group would agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2392
02:32:08.851 --> 02:32:09.684
<v Speaker 1>that's the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or someone would insist upon having had </v>

2393
02:32:11.601 --> 02:32:15.000
<v Speaker 1>done this particular way and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative would emerge from that.</v>

2394
02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:17.190
<v Speaker 1>And someone had an intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably Disney,</v>

2395
02:32:17.191 --> 02:32:18.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2396
02:32:18.091 --> 02:32:18.924
<v Speaker 1>the Pinocchio Story had enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a bit transposed from the </v>

2397
02:32:22.081 --> 02:32:23.700
<v Speaker 1>colone story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original story.</v>

2398
02:32:23.850 --> 02:32:26.020
<v Speaker 1>But then it had enough depth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2399
02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:29.400
<v Speaker 1>to hang a story on it and to be worthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that much attention.</v>

2400
02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:31.353
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2401
02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:37.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think I like the developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>path that it traces.</v>

2402
02:32:39.740 --> 02:32:40.573
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as accurately summarized in that </v>

2403
02:32:41.851 --> 02:32:43.830
<v Speaker 1>movie as I'd ever seen it summarized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2404
02:32:43.831 --> 02:32:44.664
<v Speaker 1>the movie is not without its flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it kind of slips into </v>

2405
02:32:47.730 --> 02:32:49.320
<v Speaker 1>moralizing from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2406
02:32:49.321 --> 02:32:50.610
<v Speaker 1>from time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>

2407
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's been done better.</v>

2408
02:32:57.430 --> 02:32:58.263
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2409
02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to complain about it too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

2410
02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:02.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2411
02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:04.173
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well one of the questions that we posed </v>

2412
02:33:06.281 --> 02:33:10.120
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the course was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2413
02:33:10.121 --> 02:33:13.420
<v Speaker 1>why do people do terrible things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does societies degenerate?</v>

2414
02:33:13.421 --> 02:33:15.310
<v Speaker 1>In answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

2415
02:33:15.311 --> 02:33:16.144
<v Speaker 1>is because people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they people decide to not attend to </v>

2416
02:33:21.131 --> 02:33:23.290
<v Speaker 1>their knowledge of their own errors</v>

2417
02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:27.440
<v Speaker 1>or errors in the situation they find </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

2418
02:33:27.441 --> 02:33:28.274
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't attend to their knowledge of </v>

2419
02:33:29.811 --> 02:33:33.290
<v Speaker 1>holes in being that might be a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable way of putting it.</v>

2420
02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:34.573
<v Speaker 1>And because they refuse to attend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they allow the structure to get rotten </v>

2421
02:33:38.180 --> 02:33:39.013
<v Speaker 1>and they allow themselves to get weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more rotten the structure and </v>

2422
02:33:41.511 --> 02:33:45.030
<v Speaker 1>the weaker the people that compose it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more rapidly it degenerates,</v>

2423
02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:45.913
<v Speaker 1>the further rottenness and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly or everything descends into </v>

2424
02:33:50.271 --> 02:33:54.980
<v Speaker 1>something that's absolutely horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell for all intensive purposes.</v>

2425
02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:59.060
<v Speaker 1>And so the alternative to that out as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell,</v>

2426
02:33:59.061 --> 02:34:02.150
<v Speaker 1>isn't so much specifically political as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is psychological.</v>

2427
02:34:02.151 --> 02:34:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Although I think at this level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

2428
02:34:03.981 --> 02:34:06.470
<v Speaker 1>those two things merge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2429
02:34:06.650 --> 02:34:11.030
<v Speaker 1>you work on correcting the errors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are accessible to you in your own life,</v>

2430
02:34:11.031 --> 02:34:11.864
<v Speaker 1>that you can correct and that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to correct and simultaneously you </v>

2431
02:34:15.291 --> 02:34:18.700
<v Speaker 1>have the best chance of raw find your </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and keeping,</v>

2432
02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:20.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrors of tyranny and an unbridled </v>

2433
02:34:22.781 --> 02:34:24.730
<v Speaker 1>nature at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2434
02:34:24.731 --> 02:34:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and I would also say that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental human story.</v>

2435
02:34:27.371 --> 02:34:32.371
<v Speaker 1>We've been working on that story for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire evolutionary history.</v>

2436
02:34:33.550 --> 02:34:34.383
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the one we've based our </v>

2437
02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:38.680
<v Speaker 1>survival law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2438
02:34:38.681 --> 02:34:40.990
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not wrong.</v>

2439
02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:49.320
<v Speaker 1>That's it guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice talking to you.</v>
