1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took my first degree in political </v>

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>science and I was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation for social conflict primarily</v>

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>and at the time I took my degree and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose it's probably similar now,</v>

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>all the explanations for social conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>where economic,</v>

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.613
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are basically fighting over </v>

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.790
<v Speaker 1>resources of one form or another and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that just struck me as wrong.</v>

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>It's too simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and it also doesn't explain why people </v>
<v Speaker 1>value certain resources.</v>

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not self evident that a resource </v>
<v Speaker 1>has value.</v>

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>It depends very much on the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>context and it is also didn't seem to me</v>

11
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>to take into account the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between belief and the individual.</v>

12
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.593
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a purely economic explanation of </v>

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>plus then it's also predicated on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially economic view of man.</v>

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't deep enough to really explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue.</v>

15
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at that time too,</v>

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>it was in the early eighties when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really started to think about this.</v>

17
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of the second peak of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cold War and,</v>

18
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>and people were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very worried about nuclear destruction,</v>

19
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.033
<v Speaker 1>it was a constant background concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of what I was curious about </v>

21
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:12.894
<v Speaker 1>was wha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how belief could be important enough so </v>

22
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.184
<v Speaker 1>that people would be willing to put life</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself at risk to have produced this </v>

23
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.514
<v Speaker 1>insane standoff with these tens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of nuclear weapons and then </v>

24
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.343
<v Speaker 1>there was something beyond that too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can explain some of that </v>

25
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>with just with territoriality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was more.</v>

26
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.333
<v Speaker 1>There was an element of gratuitous </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence that characterize situations </v>

27
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 1>like those in Nazi Germany and also in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this Dell,</v>

28
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>in the camps and in lots of other places</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

29
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:46.734
<v Speaker 1>But those were the two that really stood</v>
<v Speaker 1>out for me that I felt couldn't be </v>

30
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.484
<v Speaker 1>explained by law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not by a resource theory or </v>

31
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>even really by theory that had anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with territoriality.</v>

32
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.803
<v Speaker 1>There was some other element that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>more metaphysical that wasn't being </v>

33
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>attended to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just couldn't account for those sorts</v>

34
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:07.194
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could even make a rational account </v>

36
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:11.544
<v Speaker 1>for that in under many circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to make them as miserable as </v>

37
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:15.714
<v Speaker 1>possible while you're killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also to do it in a manner </v>

38
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>that's counterproductive with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own ends,</v>

39
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>because that clearly happened in Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

40
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.703
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no straightforward rational </v>

41
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>explanation for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started reading more and more about</v>

42
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something about especially the</v>

43
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:35.664
<v Speaker 1>archetypes of the collective unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reading that in relationship to the </v>

44
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:38.844
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago that I felt that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was something there that really bore </v>

45
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.510
<v Speaker 1>further investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.453
<v Speaker 1>and soldier knits and for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he concentrated a lot on the </v>

47
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:50.544
<v Speaker 1>relationship between individual deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly lying to put it simply and </v>

48
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>the pathologies of the state makes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear case for that.</v>

49
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.013
<v Speaker 1>And I'd always sort of interpreted </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's idea of repression as a form of </v>

50
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.584
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't think his account of </v>

51
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>repression is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is correct,</v>

52
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interestingly wrong at least,</v>

53
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>or it's approximately right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

54
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a weird connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>between this idea of the lie as the root</v>

55
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.163
<v Speaker 1>of pathology in totalitarian states and </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal religious ideas of that were </v>

56
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>associated with the idea of good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

57
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>And so that started to attract my </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

58
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I was probably about 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 1982,</v>

59
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:43.834
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 20 and I was also reading </v>

60
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche at that time and I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that he wrote that the of his</v>

61
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>major works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole collected works,</v>

62
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:52.534
<v Speaker 1>which hadn't been published yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I read them in chronological order </v>

63
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>and that was extremely interesting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me as well.</v>

64
00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.253
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very interesting intellectual </v>

65
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:05.371
<v Speaker 1>relationship between Nietzsche and young</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Solzhenitsyn in the soldier nets and</v>

66
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:06.664
<v Speaker 1>connection is more through Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky a new or a niche and we're </v>

67
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.763
<v Speaker 1>investigating very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar ideas at exactly the same </v>

68
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.943
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

69
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.053
<v Speaker 1>So there's these weird parallelisms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and although people don't </v>

70
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:20.224
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what well young was extremely </v>

71
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>influenced by nature just as much as by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>

72
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

73
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a publication,</v>

74
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:29.734
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's notes on his seminar on thus </v>

75
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:34.414
<v Speaker 1>spake Sarah Oostra and it's like 2,600</v>
<v Speaker 1>pages long and it only covers the first </v>

76
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>third of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thus spake Zarathustra.</v>

77
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>So the young was very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

78
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found this source of ideas,</v>

79
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.113
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose was grounded in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense in 19th century romanticism that </v>

80
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.931
<v Speaker 1>seemed to really get at the root of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question as far as I was concerned.</v>

81
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>So because there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something that isn't just,</v>

82
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not just rational behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives people towards war.</v>

83
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>There's an irrational element of it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't explain without.</v>

84
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can explain it at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>without recourse to religious language.</v>

85
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>It's the only language that's deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to get at it properly.</v>

86
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.803
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

87
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.863
<v Speaker 1>I started reading all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't understand the archetypes </v>

88
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:23.824
<v Speaker 1>of the collective unconscious at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I read it again and then I read it </v>

89
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 1>again and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I started to understand what,</v>

90
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>what he was talking about a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

91
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that these,</v>

92
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.973
<v Speaker 1>that there were patterns of action and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception in a sensor or cognitive </v>

93
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:40.834
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of looking at it </v>

94
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lie at the bottom of our thoughts.</v>

95
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:46.894
<v Speaker 1>They structure the way that we look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and they have deep </v>

96
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep evolutionary basis,</v>

97
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.043
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

98
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>they have the quality in a sense of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that really,</v>

99
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>that really frightened me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea,</v>

100
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing he said,</v>

101
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>which I really love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

102
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't have ideas,</v>

103
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>ideas have people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

104
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:09.944
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really interesting way of </v>

105
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Richard Dawkins idea of meme.</v>

106
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkens,</v>

107
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.053
<v Speaker 1>darkens is someone who is almost to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where he could read you because </v>

108
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>this idea of memes and the archetypes </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very,</v>

109
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.224
<v Speaker 1>very close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the meme is a trivial concept </v>

110
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:26.834
<v Speaker 1>compared to the archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an archetype is like a metal meme in </v>

111
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's deep.</v>

112
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.090
<v Speaker 1>It's so ancient that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tangled up in our biology.</v>

113
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.583
<v Speaker 1>So darkens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he's an evolutionary </v>

114
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.203
<v Speaker 1>thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is still like a post enlightenment </v>

115
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:47.954
<v Speaker 1>rationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually can't be a post </v>

116
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment rationalist at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary thinker.</v>

117
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too concerned with rationality.</v>

118
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Rationality is new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardly even matters.</v>

119
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

120
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:08.491
<v Speaker 1>so I was obsessed with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of destruction.</v>

121
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:10.874
<v Speaker 1>And the will to destroy fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its expression and totalitarianism </v>

122
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 1>and then its relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of ideas in general.</v>

123
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:20.204
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why found niches so useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Nietzsche predicted that the </v>

124
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.570
<v Speaker 1>20th century would be award in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense between while certainly a war that</v>

125
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:29.834
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

126
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 1>that would involve communist ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

127
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 1>he predicted that about 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>

128
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:38.790
<v Speaker 1>something like that in will to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

129
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll pay for that conflict with a </v>

130
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.214
<v Speaker 1>couple of tens of millions of lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite the prognostication like </v>

131
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 1>30 years before the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also talked about nihilism</v>

132
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 1>and both of those as a reaction to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse of Christianity.</v>

133
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 1>And that struck me as highly plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

134
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.980
<v Speaker 1>so nature was also extremely useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

135
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.063
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about young is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>young spend his whole career trying to </v>

136
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.223
<v Speaker 1>answer niches question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Nietzsche said basically that the </v>

137
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>conflict between enlightenment thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and religious thinking,</v>

138
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Christian thinking in particular was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to wipe Christian thinking out,</v>

139
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.783
<v Speaker 1>or at least people's ability to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the metaphysical assumptions that </v>

140
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:28.934
<v Speaker 1>underlied Christianity and that the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper response to that would be </v>

141
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 1>nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which he was very much concerned with or</v>

142
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.393
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so Nisha was trying to develop a </v>

143
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:44.624
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of what might constitute a </v>
<v Speaker 1>third path and that's expressed to some </v>

144
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:51.404
<v Speaker 1>degree in thus spake Sarah booster with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the superman or the </v>

145
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:55.160
<v Speaker 1>overmanned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

146
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 2>that idea really never got developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

147
00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:59.304
<v Speaker 2>you believe that the development of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea was part of what drove Nietzsche </v>

148
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

149
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.260
<v Speaker 2>he thought that he developed a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia.</v>

150
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.153
<v Speaker 2>Inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that inflation was the invasion </v>

151
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 2>of the conscious ego with archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>

152
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 2>And so it's almost like when the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero dies,</v>

153
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.403
<v Speaker 2>a new hero is born and that new hero in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense was born within niches </v>

154
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:27.894
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those are experiences that are </v>

155
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 2>powerful enough in some sense to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotic element to them.</v>

156
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.503
<v Speaker 2>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nisha died before he developed those </v>

157
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:38.724
<v Speaker 2>ideas very far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then young spent his entire career </v>

158
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 2>in some sense trying to understand here </v>
<v Speaker 2>on mythology,</v>

159
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:45.984
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally</v>

160
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.973
<v Speaker 3>through a lot of people who insist that </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion or otherwise supernatural </v>

161
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.710
<v Speaker 3>belief systems are mythologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are relics from the past.</v>

162
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

163
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.493
<v Speaker 3>from another era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're either naive faulty </v>

164
00:09:58.001 --> 00:09:58.834
<v Speaker 3>descriptions of actual material reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way that we think of science </v>

165
00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:04.150
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they're.</v>

166
00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 3>They were kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crowd control tools,</v>

167
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Straw man arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>

168
00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them is just Marxist,</v>

169
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like water power structures there </v>

170
00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:18.620
<v Speaker 2>for while they're there to serve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposes of the elite.</v>

171
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

172
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.750
<v Speaker 2>that's one of their purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That mono mania,</v>

173
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.603
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

174
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.190
<v Speaker 2>that insane desire for singular causes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

175
00:10:28.191 --> 00:10:30.020
<v Speaker 2>that's also the expression of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetype.</v>

176
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.690
<v Speaker 2>It's monotheism inaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

177
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you see these people who,</v>

178
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.520
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who claim to be atheistic,</v>

179
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.880
<v Speaker 2>they just invented new God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuko did that with power for.</v>

180
00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:43.520
<v Speaker 2>I did that with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know if you're smart too,</v>

181
00:10:43.521 --> 00:10:47.300
<v Speaker 2>you can take a major motivational drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>or system.</v>

182
00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:50.180
<v Speaker 2>They're not really drives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really personalities.</v>

183
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.103
<v Speaker 2>You can take a major motivational </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality like power sex and you can </v>

184
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:58.100
<v Speaker 2>explain everything on its basis because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is.</v>

185
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Every human action is motivated by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>major motivational systems,</v>

186
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:04.670
<v Speaker 2>some ad mixture of them.</v>

187
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.773
<v Speaker 2>And then if you're smart enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can always figure out a way that </v>

188
00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:11.960
<v Speaker 2>some complex phenomena is related </v>
<v Speaker 2>causely to some simpler motivation.</v>

189
00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:14.810
<v Speaker 2>But it's intellectual masturbation as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I'm concerned.</v>

190
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:17.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not the attempt to explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

191
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:18.194
<v Speaker 2>it's the attempt to reduce everything to</v>
<v Speaker 2>one simple principle that you can be </v>

192
00:11:22.941 --> 00:11:24.950
<v Speaker 2>master of now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>

193
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:28.130
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was religion for crowd control?</v>

194
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an empty theory.</v>

195
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Well what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is what a multigenerational,</v>

196
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.540
<v Speaker 2>a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

197
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:39.374
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a conspiracy that stretches as far </v>

198
00:11:41.151 --> 00:11:45.110
<v Speaker 2>back into the past as we could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right back to where people were tribal.</v>

199
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.930
<v Speaker 2>And maybe farther back than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

200
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.540
<v Speaker 2>that's not an explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

201
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.060
<v Speaker 2>the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the a supernatural.</v>

202
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.670
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

203
00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.163
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people who think they think </v>

204
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 2>scientifically but they don't because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not very good at it.</v>

205
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 2>And then there are people who think </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientifically at a genius level,</v>

206
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.201
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

207
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 2>there are people who think they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>religiously but don't.</v>

208
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:11.944
<v Speaker 2>And then there are people who think </v>
<v Speaker 2>religiously at a genius level and you </v>

209
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:19.411
<v Speaker 2>can't assume that you can use the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational explanation at every single</v>

210
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:23.200
<v Speaker 2>level of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

211
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 2>there are elements of religious belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are superstitious,</v>

212
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:26.990
<v Speaker 2>although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:12:26.991 --> 00:12:27.824
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a slight of hand too </v>

214
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 2>because if you want to argue that </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious religion is only superstition,</v>

215
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.833
<v Speaker 2>you collect up all the superstitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you define them as religious and then </v>

216
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 2>you define religion as a collection of </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstitions.</v>

217
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:41.780
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

218
00:12:41.781 --> 00:12:42.614
<v Speaker 2>it's not very careful articulation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole class of phenomena that are </v>

219
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:49.950
<v Speaker 2>attempting to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

220
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are attempting to explain.</v>

221
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.440
<v Speaker 2>And there's also a big difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between explaining and explaining away.</v>

222
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Dennis likes to explain away things</v>

223
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 2>like consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.430
<v Speaker 2>and you can't explain away consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you can.</v>

225
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.660
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how you structure your </v>
<v Speaker 2>initial presumptions about the world,</v>

226
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the logos that we were talking about </v>

227
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:16.060
<v Speaker 2>earlier that's associated with let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

228
00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 2>articulated truth and the communication </v>
<v Speaker 2>of articulated truth,</v>

229
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 2>that's basically the prime function of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

230
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.933
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Judeo Christian story is predicated </v>

231
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:32.680
<v Speaker 2>on the idea that that is a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>element of being.</v>

232
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:34.923
<v Speaker 2>Now you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can structure your world with </v>

233
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 2>different presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could say,</v>

234
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:40.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is an EPA phenomena of the</v>

235
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:42.640
<v Speaker 2>material world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

236
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:43.743
<v Speaker 2>you can make a perfectly coherent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>useful set of tools out of those </v>

237
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:48.664
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that set of tools does not cover </v>

238
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.264
<v Speaker 2>everything that you need and it's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>more viable as an explanation than the </v>

239
00:13:56.891 --> 00:14:00.430
<v Speaker 2>explanation that no consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow fundamental to being.</v>

240
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.320
<v Speaker 2>And of course being is different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>material reality.</v>

241
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.753
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these things aren't grappled with </v>

242
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:09.724
<v Speaker 2>properly by positivistic scientists who </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no real training in philosophy and </v>

243
00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 2>who knew nothing at all about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

244
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.310
<v Speaker 2>their religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Christianity that Darkens,</v>

245
00:14:22.311 --> 00:14:26.720
<v Speaker 2>criticizes is the Christianity that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart 13 year old boy objects too.</v>

246
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

247
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.610
<v Speaker 2>how can you reconcile genesis with </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary history?</v>

248
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:32.511
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

249
00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:36.860
<v Speaker 2>that's really not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a straw man argument.</v>

250
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.353
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly.</v>

251
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.640
<v Speaker 2>You better sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sit,</v>

252
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.190
<v Speaker 2>lay down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lay down.</v>

253
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.423
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I've learned </v>
<v Speaker 2>about argumentation is that if you're </v>

254
00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 2>trying to distinguish between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>validity of two</v>

255
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:52.933
<v Speaker 2>different worldviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to make the strongest possible </v>

256
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:02.060
<v Speaker 2>case for both worldviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not trying to be right.</v>

257
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:03.643
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to figure something out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the easiest way to be right is to </v>

258
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:06.854
<v Speaker 2>make your opponent into an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there is no doubt that empirical </v>

259
00:15:14.131 --> 00:15:18.300
<v Speaker 2>science has kicked the slats out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

260
00:15:18.301 --> 00:15:19.134
<v Speaker 2>People think about religion because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't easy for people to understand </v>

261
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.424
<v Speaker 2>that there could be different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that different systems of thought might </v>

262
00:15:30.331 --> 00:15:31.164
<v Speaker 2>have different purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be a philosopher of thought </v>

263
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.040
<v Speaker 2>to think about that even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it was.</v>

264
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that became obvious at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>until after Nisha</v>

265
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.753
<v Speaker 4>not all</v>

266
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.840
<v Speaker 2>belief system served the same masters so</v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak,</v>

267
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.333
<v Speaker 4>and so</v>

268
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.000
<v Speaker 2>you can't assume that every system of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought is doing the same thing</v>

269
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.013
<v Speaker 4>and then</v>

270
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.673
<v Speaker 2>you can't assume also that there's only </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way to formulate your basic </v>

271
00:16:07.871 --> 00:16:11.350
<v Speaker 2>assumptions about the nature of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

272
00:16:11.351 --> 00:16:12.184
<v Speaker 2>heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't discover the relationship </v>

273
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:14.824
<v Speaker 2>between the system of thought that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>derived say for a mutual and young and </v>

274
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:19.803
<v Speaker 2>some other people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read and heidegger until much after I </v>

275
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:24.484
<v Speaker 2>had written maps of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but heidegger's study of being is </v>

276
00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:29.944
<v Speaker 2>predicated on the idea that being is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental reality and that is not </v>

277
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.260
<v Speaker 2>objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not material reality.</v>

278
00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:37.240
<v Speaker 2>It's lived experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

279
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.540
<v Speaker 2>Lived experience is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

280
00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:43.930
<v Speaker 2>that's a presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you start with that presupposition.</v>

281
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Then you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

282
00:16:44.891 --> 00:16:47.020
<v Speaker 2>what are the basic elements of lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality?</v>

283
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.453
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or at least what seems to have happened </v>

284
00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:51.544
<v Speaker 2>is that high heidegger identified the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same basic elements of lived reality </v>

285
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.600
<v Speaker 2>that I identified in maps of meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one was</v>

286
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.950
<v Speaker 2>the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is constructed by humans,</v>

287
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.873
<v Speaker 2>which I think is basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an elaborate a dominance hierarchy and </v>

288
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:09.494
<v Speaker 2>it's permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is where the issue about what </v>

289
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 2>constitutes reality becomes very </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical.</v>

290
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Dominance hierarchies are 300 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

291
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.793
<v Speaker 2>They're older than trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think that's what one </v>

292
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 2>definition of what's real is what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>persistent across time,</v>

293
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.943
<v Speaker 2>then it's almost impossible to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything more real about life than a </v>

294
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to your point about lobsters,</v>

295
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I think absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

296
00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 2>It's the same bloody circuitry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonergic circuitry.</v>

297
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:40.874
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's another circuit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobsters used that we don't have that's </v>

298
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:46.610
<v Speaker 2>based on Oct octa mean I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right word,</v>

299
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.713
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of the way that maneuver </v>
<v Speaker 2>within dominance hierarchies is the way </v>

300
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:53.350
<v Speaker 2>we maneuver within dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

301
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.383
<v Speaker 2>If you're an evolutionary thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just push that away and </v>

302
00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.793
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you can think about them as a </v>

303
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:06.060
<v Speaker 2>social construct there also for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural phenomena.</v>

304
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the dominance hierarchy is actually a</v>

305
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:12.510
<v Speaker 2>major part of the environment to which </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have adapted.</v>

306
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the dominance hierarchy,</v>

307
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:16.254
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll say the social world for the sake </v>

308
00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:18.444
<v Speaker 2>of argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the natural world and there's </v>

309
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.593
<v Speaker 2>the experiencing subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While those are high degrees categories </v>

310
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:28.911
<v Speaker 2>of being as well and in in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>what what religious thinking seems to do</v>

311
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:32.214
<v Speaker 2>is to continually pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those three things as interacting </v>

312
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:40.431
<v Speaker 2>causally at the base of being so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not a material reality.</v>

313
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.793
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things about being that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't attribute simply to material </v>

314
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We may eventually be able to do that,</v>

315
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:51.054
<v Speaker 2>but by that time our notion of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes material will be much </v>

316
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

317
00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:56.394
<v Speaker 2>so we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't deal with subjectivity within </v>

318
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:00.810
<v Speaker 2>the confines of our materialists </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories,</v>

319
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.733
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's partly because those theories are </v>

320
00:19:03.031 --> 00:19:08.031
<v Speaker 2>predicated on the elimination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjectivity as an aide priority move,</v>

321
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

322
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.450
<v Speaker 2>The whole point of objective science is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to remove subjectivity.</v>

323
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then it gets removed and while you're</v>

324
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Speaker 2>surprised about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

325
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:17.431
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

326
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you can't be surprised about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remove it right at the beginning.</v>

327
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Now that works for certain purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works very well,</v>

328
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.840
<v Speaker 2>but it has consequences and some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those consequences,</v>

329
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:28.674
<v Speaker 2>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are serious enough to produce two forms </v>

330
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:34.404
<v Speaker 2>of social and mental illness and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those would be the succumbing to the </v>

331
00:19:40.591 --> 00:19:41.424
<v Speaker 2>temptations of authoritarianism and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other would be succumbing to the </v>

332
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:45.354
<v Speaker 2>temptations of nihilism because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're logical consequences of the of </v>

333
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:56.910
<v Speaker 2>the definition of subjective is no </v>
<v Speaker 2>unreal.</v>

334
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.640
<v Speaker 2>So now then you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

335
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.610
<v Speaker 2>how do you determine whether or not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory is true?</v>

336
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Then you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

337
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:07.110
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

338
00:20:07.111 --> 00:20:09.120
<v Speaker 2>then you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

339
00:20:09.121 --> 00:20:09.954
<v Speaker 2>because I think you can take a Newtonian</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective on that or a Darwinian </v>

340
00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:16.410
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't do both at the same time.</v>

341
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so nature said truth serves life.</v>

342
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some sense that's a Darwinian idea.</v>

343
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's true enough so that if you acted</v>

344
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.083
<v Speaker 2>out or hold it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that increases your chances of survival </v>

345
00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:35.310
<v Speaker 2>and reproduction over long spans of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

346
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

347
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.223
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea if our detailed </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about the material world is </v>

348
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:43.884
<v Speaker 2>going to be the type of knowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows us to survive and reproduce over </v>

349
00:20:46.861 --> 00:20:47.694
<v Speaker 2>a long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not been tested from a Darwinian </v>

350
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 2>perspective at all and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

351
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 2>of course the materialist perspective is</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

352
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Look what we've built with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've built hydrogen bombs,</v>

353
00:20:58.961 --> 00:20:59.794
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you might object to that by </v>

354
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:02.501
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

355
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:03.334
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

356
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.593
<v Speaker 2>we've built hydrogen bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the only reason we could build the </v>

357
00:21:08.881 --> 00:21:12.470
<v Speaker 2>more we're willing to was because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>left things out of the equation,</v>

358
00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.810
<v Speaker 2>but what things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

359
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.423
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it really a good idea to build </v>

360
00:21:17.661 --> 00:21:19.790
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen bombs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example.</v>

361
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I can give you another example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

362
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I read a book a while back that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>written by a kgb officer who claim to be</v>

363
00:21:28.491 --> 00:21:33.410
<v Speaker 2>exposing the inner workings of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet scientific community with regards</v>

364
00:21:33.411 --> 00:21:34.244
<v Speaker 2>to a biologic warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people in the institute that he </v>

365
00:21:39.801 --> 00:21:43.880
<v Speaker 2>described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to cross ebola was smallpox</v>

366
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.160
<v Speaker 2>because smallpox is extremely infectious</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Ebola is extremely deadly.</v>

367
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:54.270
<v Speaker 2>So like that's a valid scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>enterprise.</v>

368
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you think,</v>

369
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.933
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that interesting that that's a </v>

370
00:21:58.081 --> 00:22:02.010
<v Speaker 2>valid scientific enterprise because </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's insane.</v>

371
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.780
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

372
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.440
<v Speaker 2>if it's so obvious that that's insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a valid scientific enterprise,</v>

373
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:08.603
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

374
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.933
<v Speaker 2>there's some disconnect there between </v>
<v Speaker 2>two different views of what constitute </v>

375
00:22:14.121 --> 00:22:14.954
<v Speaker 2>at least appropriate behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know that this is why the </v>

376
00:22:18.531 --> 00:22:20.870
<v Speaker 2>definitions of truth start to become so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

377
00:22:20.871 --> 00:22:22.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like is truth as expressed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>

378
00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.630
<v Speaker 2>is it truth as it serves Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposes?</v>

379
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Is it truth as defined by the axioms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>material of a materialist philosophy,</v>

380
00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.653
<v Speaker 2>which by the way aren't even true </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore because if you go down far </v>

381
00:22:35.601 --> 00:22:36.434
<v Speaker 2>enough into material reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we know you hit a realm that's so </v>

382
00:22:39.381 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 2>bizarre that we can't even comprehend it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it which has ended.</v>

383
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.550
<v Speaker 2>There's implications of that bizarreness</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can't comprehend.</v>

384
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:47.863
<v Speaker 2>So I would say we will develop a </v>
<v Speaker 2>materialist philosophy of consciousness </v>

385
00:22:50.841 --> 00:22:51.674
<v Speaker 2>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it won't be using the same material </v>

386
00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:55.540
<v Speaker 2>that we use now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

387
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.923
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

388
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:03.380
<v Speaker 3>so if I understand correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about there's the,</v>

389
00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:06.883
<v Speaker 3>let's say the industrialized north in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a society that relies on scientific </v>

390
00:23:10.551 --> 00:23:11.384
<v Speaker 3>analysis to to make it make it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to establish the fundamental bases on </v>

391
00:23:17.361 --> 00:23:20.150
<v Speaker 3>which does the rest of the society is </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated.</v>

392
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are certain assumptions about what</v>

393
00:23:22.671 --> 00:23:26.480
<v Speaker 3>is real versus what is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is what is actually out there.</v>

394
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.250
<v Speaker 3>If there's a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjects,</v>

395
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.083
<v Speaker 2>but even there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an implicit assumption that's </v>

396
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:37.360
<v Speaker 2>what's out there in objective space is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's real.</v>

397
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:38.411
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

398
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:42.940
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with that is that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>an assumption about reality.</v>

399
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Now it's obviously a powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumption,</v>

400
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.930
<v Speaker 2>but here's another way of looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian problem as far as I can tell.</v>

401
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:51.764
<v Speaker 2>So part of the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinians insist that random mutation </v>

402
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 2>is the source of</v>

403
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.560
<v Speaker 2>continual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not progress.</v>

404
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.483
<v Speaker 2>Continual survival is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying environment changes and it </v>

405
00:24:10.591 --> 00:24:13.350
<v Speaker 2>changes unpredictably by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

406
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.080
<v Speaker 2>by its essential nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unpredictable.</v>

407
00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's unpredictable,</v>

408
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.420
<v Speaker 2>only random transformation can keep up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

409
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.493
<v Speaker 2>A lot of random transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully the randomness of the </v>

410
00:24:26.251 --> 00:24:30.900
<v Speaker 2>environmental change will be matched by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the randomness of the genetic change.</v>

411
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:32.243
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what that means in part is that the </v>

412
00:24:35.791 --> 00:24:37.710
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

413
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:41.770
<v Speaker 2>is finally incomprehensible because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't predict it.</v>

414
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.383
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means that a limited creature </v>

415
00:24:46.321 --> 00:24:51.321
<v Speaker 2>that's established itself by Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>means can't have access to the truth.</v>

416
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.453
<v Speaker 2>They can only have access to sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and sufficient truth is the truth </v>

417
00:24:57.001 --> 00:24:58.770
<v Speaker 2>that allows you to survive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduce,</v>

418
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.760
<v Speaker 2>and from a Darwinian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't any truth past that.</v>

419
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.553
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think Dawkins is a Darwinian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a Newtonian because he </v>

420
00:25:08.971 --> 00:25:09.804
<v Speaker 2>believes that there is truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Darwinians don't believe that the </v>

421
00:25:12.571 --> 00:25:13.404
<v Speaker 2>Darwinians say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's enough truth to keep you alive </v>

422
00:25:18.511 --> 00:25:21.000
<v Speaker 2>and have you survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's all.</v>

423
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.280
<v Speaker 2>And eventually all that's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

424
00:25:23.281 --> 00:25:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>99 point five percent of all species are</v>

425
00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:29.070
<v Speaker 2>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an amazing point.</v>

426
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.023
<v Speaker 2>If I understand it correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American pragmatists figured this </v>

427
00:25:32.071 --> 00:25:33.450
<v Speaker 2>out at the late 18 hundreds.</v>

428
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That this reminds me of pregnant.</v>

429
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.310
<v Speaker 3>His philosophy specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I have a soft spot for.</v>

430
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.453
<v Speaker 3>It speaks to me directly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm thinking about other people who </v>

431
00:25:41.491 --> 00:25:44.530
<v Speaker 3>will do I know what the university or </v>
<v Speaker 3>just in my life if they hear this,</v>

432
00:25:44.531 --> 00:25:45.364
<v Speaker 3>they would just say what like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's as if we're living in two </v>

433
00:25:48.671 --> 00:25:50.050
<v Speaker 3>different worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>

434
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.760
<v Speaker 3>we are in the sense that we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've internalized the,</v>

435
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.510
<v Speaker 3>the evolutionary mindset for a large </v>
<v Speaker 3>part and parcel of,</v>

436
00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:02.080
<v Speaker 3>of how we understand reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time we pulled onto this</v>

437
00:26:02.081 --> 00:26:06.640
<v Speaker 3>notion of truth as beyond our subjective</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience out there,</v>

438
00:26:06.641 --> 00:26:09.540
<v Speaker 3>and we're actually directly when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct these experiments.</v>

439
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:10.720
<v Speaker 3>This is just true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

440
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all part of the problem too,</v>

441
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.950
<v Speaker 2>is that because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

442
00:26:14.951 --> 00:26:17.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sciences,</v>

443
00:26:17.081 --> 00:26:20.920
<v Speaker 2>reductionistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you measure something extremely</v>

444
00:26:20.921 --> 00:26:21.754
<v Speaker 2>accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole bunch of other things </v>

445
00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:23.864
<v Speaker 2>that you're not measuring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your assumption is that the </v>

446
00:26:26.411 --> 00:26:27.244
<v Speaker 2>knowledge gained by that precision isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>undone by the dismissal of everything </v>

447
00:26:34.571 --> 00:26:35.890
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

448
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.383
<v Speaker 2>is that a valid claim?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what your preconditions </v>

449
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 2>are for determining validity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like automobiles,</v>

450
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.070
<v Speaker 2>automobiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get you from point a to point b,</v>

451
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:54.181
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

452
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 2>that's their fundamental purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they were designed to do.</v>

453
00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.501
<v Speaker 2>But I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

454
00:26:58.501 --> 00:26:59.334
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that their fundamental </v>

455
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.300
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not purpose,</v>

456
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 2>is the complete transformation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities,</v>

457
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.350
<v Speaker 2>the demolition of the rural communities </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the destruction of that noosphere.</v>

458
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

459
00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 2>we left something out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

460
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.940
<v Speaker 2>you left something out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you gain,</v>

461
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:22.933
<v Speaker 2>you gain precision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you pay for it with a loss of </v>

462
00:27:26.751 --> 00:27:29.270
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the other problem,</v>

463
00:27:29.271 --> 00:27:34.220
<v Speaker 2>which is the pragmatic problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is truth for what</v>

464
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult for me to say see that </v>

465
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.413
<v Speaker 2>it's dangerous as far as I'm concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>to considered truth independent of its </v>

466
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.400
<v Speaker 2>effect on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think if a truth drives you insane,</v>

467
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.153
<v Speaker 2>it's not a truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong with it and </v>

468
00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.140
<v Speaker 2>that's like a definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

469
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.610
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a definition that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>grounded in Darwinian thinking.</v>

470
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:14.090
<v Speaker 2>And I think what I think about religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a very dark Darwinian.</v>

471
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.893
<v Speaker 2>I think religion is an evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's evolved knowledge and it's </v>

472
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:25.560
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about action and the world is </v>
<v Speaker 2>made out of action.</v>

473
00:28:25.561 --> 00:28:29.580
<v Speaker 2>So especially the human world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't say,</v>

474
00:28:29.581 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 2>well that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's wrong.</v>

475
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something you can easily reduce</v>

476
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.170
<v Speaker 2>to causal relationships between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental building blocks of matter.</v>

477
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 2>But not only is it real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone acts like it's real.</v>

478
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 2>And then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

479
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what people say about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think about,</v>

480
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:49.254
<v Speaker 2>what's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care about how they act because that </v>

481
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:52.884
<v Speaker 2>actually shows what they really believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and whatever their rational mind is </v>

482
00:28:56.431 --> 00:28:58.020
<v Speaker 2>computing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

483
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.270
<v Speaker 2>chattering about on the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

484
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.690
<v Speaker 2>who cares about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just possessed by ideas.</v>

485
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may,</v>

486
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:07.290
<v Speaker 2>they might be defenders of the ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

487
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean they believe them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.180
<v Speaker 2>depending on how you define belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

489
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>

490
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.843
<v Speaker 3>this is getting to the crux of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it will be good luck with the </v>

491
00:29:19.521 --> 00:29:22.670
<v Speaker 3>rest of the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're talking here about truth,</v>

492
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:23.743
<v Speaker 3>not a reinterpretation of truth from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>objectivist positivist scientific </v>

493
00:29:28.191 --> 00:29:29.024
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we've inherited from the </v>

494
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:30.920
<v Speaker 3>rationalist area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying,</v>

495
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.680
<v Speaker 3>what's a return to the original </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptions of truth,</v>

496
00:29:33.681 --> 00:29:34.514
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Along with the American pragmatists and </v>

497
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:41.080
<v Speaker 3>in light of a Darwinian insight into </v>
<v Speaker 3>what life is the about the pragmatists.</v>

498
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.083
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as Darwin published the origin </v>

499
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:45.874
<v Speaker 2>of species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they recognize that the theory of </v>

500
00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Speaker 2>evolution was pragmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got it.</v>

501
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were very excited about it.</v>

502
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.313
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they got excited about it because </v>

503
00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>the Darwinian claim is things are always</v>
<v Speaker 2>true enough and that's it.</v>

504
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't in some sense even because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you lack knowledge,</v>

505
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.390
<v Speaker 2>it's because you couldn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

506
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.793
<v Speaker 2>even hypothetically without running a </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation as complicated as the world </v>

507
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:13.924
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even then it wouldn't turn out the </v>

508
00:30:15.941 --> 00:30:16.774
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>

509
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Deleon view of reality in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

510
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:21.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

511
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.440
<v Speaker 3>any explanation of the complexity of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>system is,</v>

512
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.590
<v Speaker 3>is doomed to be simpler than the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

513
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

514
00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:31.194
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

515
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

516
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.480
<v Speaker 2>you could think about it as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

517
00:30:33.481 --> 00:30:36.840
<v Speaker 2>You can think about it as a limitation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the perceiver.</v>

518
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.933
<v Speaker 2>The problem too is that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge you crew about the system </v>

519
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.473
<v Speaker 2>changes the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like trying to predict the stock </v>

520
00:30:45.061 --> 00:30:46.680
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't possible.</v>

521
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.113
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's a really good example </v>

522
00:30:50.611 --> 00:30:51.570
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

523
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.790
<v Speaker 2>tried to predict the stock market </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationally.</v>

524
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.760
<v Speaker 2>See how you do what you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's not real.</v>

525
00:30:56.761 --> 00:30:57.594
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

526
00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.793
<v Speaker 2>well we don't agree about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes real so we can have that </v>

527
00:31:01.831 --> 00:31:02.664
<v Speaker 2>discussion.</v>

528
00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.440
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like what you're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that truth is as much about action as it</v>

529
00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:16.310
<v Speaker 3>is about some sort of material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>measurable objectives.</v>

530
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's more about action more.</v>

531
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

532
00:31:20.351 --> 00:31:25.351
<v Speaker 2>The fundamentals of truth are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are those that guide action and then the</v>

533
00:31:25.451 --> 00:31:28.750
<v Speaker 2>objective science is nested inside that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be.</v>

534
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.130
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around that.</v>

535
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:30.990
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

536
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.850
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think is a really central because</v>

537
00:31:32.851 --> 00:31:33.684
<v Speaker 3>everything in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything in maps of meaning and a lot </v>

538
00:31:36.001 --> 00:31:39.360
<v Speaker 3>of your other work flows from there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different way.</v>

539
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

540
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Priority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

541
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.210
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

542
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we can elaborate that a bit.</v>

543
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.871
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

544
00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:44.641
<v Speaker 2>let.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could do that.</v>

545
00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:45.474
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it from a Darwinian </v>

546
00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:48.150
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

547
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.373
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the single celled animals will </v>

548
00:31:54.031 --> 00:31:54.690
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

549
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.180
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to talk about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

550
00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.210
<v Speaker 2>what we're going to start to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>is animals that have a complex,</v>

551
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.493
<v Speaker 2>a sufficiently complex nervous system to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to respond to the social </v>

552
00:32:06.031 --> 00:32:08.970
<v Speaker 2>environment which would be made out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspecifics often.</v>

553
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.660
<v Speaker 2>So lobsters are a perfectly good place </v>
<v Speaker 2>to start.</v>

554
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like once lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lobster,</v>

555
00:32:17.371 --> 00:32:20.310
<v Speaker 2>and then there's another lobster and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're alone.</v>

556
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Well then they only have to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem of being one lobster,</v>

557
00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.310
<v Speaker 2>but then as soon as you put them </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

558
00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:29.640
<v Speaker 2>they have to solve the problem of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>too lobsters in the same space,</v>

559
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.370
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe there's 100 lobsters in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same space,</v>

560
00:32:32.371 --> 00:32:33.204
<v Speaker 2>so then the question becomes how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize lobster behavior when most of </v>

561
00:32:37.441 --> 00:32:41.930
<v Speaker 2>the environment consists of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobsters behaving and the answer to that</v>

562
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 2>as being you put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a dominance hierarchy,</v>

563
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.733
<v Speaker 2>and then the dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you adapt to the dominance </v>

564
00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:52.214
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy is by noting the patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior that compose it and by first </v>

565
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.033
<v Speaker 2>internalizing those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say modeling them to the degree </v>

566
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:04.574
<v Speaker 2>that that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even more remarkably over huge </v>

567
00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:09.884
<v Speaker 2>expanses of time because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy and it's patterns </v>

568
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.140
<v Speaker 2>are a fundamental element of reality.</v>

569
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.800
<v Speaker 2>You start to adapt biologically to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy,</v>

570
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.143
<v Speaker 2>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now what we've got is we've got an </v>

571
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:26.270
<v Speaker 2>emergent set of of social behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

572
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:30.050
<v Speaker 2>They're not rules because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>real until you observe them or until you</v>

573
00:33:30.051 --> 00:33:32.260
<v Speaker 2>codify them or til you would articulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

574
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.480
<v Speaker 2>What they are is the patterns from which</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules emerge and they're deep patterns,</v>

575
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.780
<v Speaker 2>so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

576
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 2>what are the rules for staying alive in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a dominance hierarchy,</v>

577
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.700
<v Speaker 2>not being torn apart by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspecifics and that's learning quickly</v>

578
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:52.820
<v Speaker 2>who can tear you into pieces and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

579
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.013
<v Speaker 2>and learning how to get away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that can tear you into pieces </v>

580
00:33:56.361 --> 00:33:57.194
<v Speaker 2>quickly and learning how to push the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that can't aside and you'd better </v>

581
00:34:00.441 --> 00:34:01.274
<v Speaker 2>learn that fast and you want to learn it</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the minimum possible amount of </v>

582
00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:08.300
<v Speaker 2>damage because that's another problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>that social creatures have,</v>

583
00:34:08.301 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 2>or at least creatures that are in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant Turkey.</v>

584
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:13.820
<v Speaker 2>It gets even more complicated when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>members of the dominance hierarchy start</v>

585
00:34:13.821 --> 00:34:15.850
<v Speaker 2>to cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But lobsters,</v>

586
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.780
<v Speaker 2>as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know,</v>

587
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:21.740
<v Speaker 2>don't cooperate so but still like their </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior is very,</v>

588
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:25.850
<v Speaker 2>very determined by the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>

589
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what that is,</v>

590
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.663
<v Speaker 2>the patterns that govern a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy are the place from which </v>

591
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:33.973
<v Speaker 2>ethics derive right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they evolved there and they're not </v>

592
00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:40.400
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>

593
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.520
<v Speaker 2>What works in one dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>works in another.</v>

594
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.980
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's your proof for that?</v>

595
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.540
<v Speaker 2>And why would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

596
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:52.541
<v Speaker 2>one of my approvers for that is that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>use the same brain chemical and the same</v>

597
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.453
<v Speaker 2>neurological system roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep track of our position in the </v>

598
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy as lobsters do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 300 million years of continuity.</v>

599
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.233
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's real enough as far as I'm </v>

600
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:10.454
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

601
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.150
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now you've got your lobsters and find</v>

602
00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:14.984
<v Speaker 2>that they organize themselves according </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these rules and the top lobster is </v>

603
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:23.420
<v Speaker 2>confident and makes himself big and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that gets all the chicks.</v>

604
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:24.643
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your success in the dominance </v>

605
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:27.194
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're male also </v>

606
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:29.684
<v Speaker 2>determines the probability of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduction and it may determine that </v>

607
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:33.674
<v Speaker 2>more than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how to maneuver in the dominance </v>

608
00:35:36.771 --> 00:35:37.604
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the prime question that faces </v>

609
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:42.204
<v Speaker 2>creatures that have to live with </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspecifics and the females in some </v>

610
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:46.974
<v Speaker 2>sense use the dominance hierarchy as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed computational device to </v>

611
00:35:51.481 --> 00:35:52.314
<v Speaker 2>determine the worth of the males.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because what the females do is they </v>

612
00:35:55.261 --> 00:35:58.620
<v Speaker 2>sort of hang off to the side and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched the males battle it out and then</v>

613
00:35:58.621 --> 00:35:59.454
<v Speaker 2>they just pick from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they have their own hierarchy and </v>

614
00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it runs by somewhat different rules,</v>

615
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:05.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's very smart.</v>

616
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.623
<v Speaker 2>He'd say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're externalizing the cognitive </v>

617
00:36:08.011 --> 00:36:12.330
<v Speaker 2>problem to the structure itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

618
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.193
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then there's the rules that govern </v>

619
00:36:15.061 --> 00:36:16.710
<v Speaker 2>the dominant Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the simple one,</v>

620
00:36:16.711 --> 00:36:19.080
<v Speaker 2>which is just where they're the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

621
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:19.914
<v Speaker 2>but they're competing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when you get a little farther </v>

622
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

623
00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:27.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe to the point where animals are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting together,</v>

624
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 2>that might be it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or caretaking,</v>

625
00:36:29.851 --> 00:36:30.960
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

626
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 2>we're cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behavior emerges.</v>

627
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:33.803
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

628
00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.460
<v Speaker 2>different rules start to apply because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a wolf pack,</v>

629
00:36:38.461 --> 00:36:42.000
<v Speaker 2>let's say the wall still wants to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top,</v>

630
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.823
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't want to tear everyone two</v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces as he climbs to the top because </v>

631
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.960
<v Speaker 2>if he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he won't be in a pack and then that</v>

632
00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to starve to death.</v>

633
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:57.021
<v Speaker 2>So that really gets complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can defeat someone but you</v>

634
00:36:59.261 --> 00:37:01.570
<v Speaker 2>can't destroy them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

635
00:37:01.571 --> 00:37:02.404
<v Speaker 2>there's another more rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can defeat someone but you can't </v>

636
00:37:05.381 --> 00:37:06.790
<v Speaker 2>destroy them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>

637
00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:10.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a rule that emerges spontaneously</v>

638
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.020
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of social interactions </v>
<v Speaker 2>under biological control.</v>

639
00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.003
<v Speaker 2>And once the rule emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominance hierarchy lasts long </v>

640
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:21.294
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So evolutionary pressure can start to </v>

641
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:23.454
<v Speaker 2>operate to ensure that creatures within </v>
<v Speaker 2>that system build their ability to </v>

642
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:30.114
<v Speaker 2>follow that rule into their nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems because it's the main selection </v>

643
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.720
<v Speaker 2>force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're successful at it.</v>

644
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:42.110
<v Speaker 2>So what seems to be arbitrary and social</v>
<v Speaker 2>can become built in and biological,</v>

645
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:43.494
<v Speaker 2>I think faster than we understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the consequences of being </v>

646
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:49.620
<v Speaker 2>victorious in the dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so high.</v>

647
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.220
<v Speaker 2>So in the wolf hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like</v>

648
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.420
<v Speaker 2>we got hunt together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have disputes about who's</v>

649
00:37:58.421 --> 00:38:01.780
<v Speaker 2>boss will settle the dispute </v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolically,</v>

650
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.800
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

651
00:38:02.801 --> 00:38:04.300
<v Speaker 2>All threaten you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You threatened me.</v>

652
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.070
<v Speaker 2>One of us will blink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guide that blinks,</v>

653
00:38:06.071 --> 00:38:08.320
<v Speaker 2>rolls over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw shows his throat.</v>

654
00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.630
<v Speaker 2>You pretend to rip it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't.</v>

655
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.470
<v Speaker 2>And we accept that as a proxy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>battle.</v>

656
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:18.400
<v Speaker 2>And so you're making the case that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate symbolically.</v>

657
00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:19.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

658
00:38:19.421 --> 00:38:22.150
<v Speaker 2>It's just that it's coded in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

659
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

660
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:28.000
<v Speaker 2>You have to make a real distinction </v>
<v Speaker 2>between patterns of action and rules.</v>

661
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.450
<v Speaker 2>They're not the same thing because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to think that,</v>

662
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:32.763
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see regularities in an animal's </v>

663
00:38:34.361 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rules.</v>

664
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as if it's following rules and from</v>

665
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.680
<v Speaker 2>more anthropomorphizing assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a different.</v>

666
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 2>It's also a different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a level of abstraction above.</v>

667
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.140
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the pattern of behavior.</v>

668
00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.213
<v Speaker 2>Then if you observe the pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and you have the capacity to </v>

669
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:55.084
<v Speaker 2>make symbolic representations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can make the symbolic </v>

670
00:38:57.551 --> 00:39:00.490
<v Speaker 2>representation and those would emerge </v>
<v Speaker 2>first in image,</v>

671
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 2>not in words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>image,</v>

672
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.960
<v Speaker 2>image in stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

673
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:05.943
<v Speaker 2>So that's like the dramatic sub behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's behavior imitating </v>

674
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:10.840
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's drama,</v>

675
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 2>that's like a Piagetian idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

676
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:15.880
<v Speaker 2>that you can use your body as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representational structure.</v>

677
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what human beings can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what imitation is.</v>

678
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

679
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:22.623
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got the wolves and it's sort </v>

680
00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:26.020
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is great so far,</v>

681
00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:30.840
<v Speaker 2>but it sounds like the argument is </v>
<v Speaker 2>building from lobsters to um,</v>

682
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.480
<v Speaker 2>and this is how I'm interpreting from </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobsters to a strong argument for</v>

683
00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.230
<v Speaker 2>essentially why Union archetypes </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

684
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

685
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Well this is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

686
00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.693
<v Speaker 2>But I think what's also important is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>help you help viewers understand how we </v>

687
00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:53.350
<v Speaker 2>get from lobsters and dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies to no problem.</v>

688
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.221
<v Speaker 2>Truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

689
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:59.221
<v Speaker 2>So they're not things they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>constituent elements of ray of reality.</v>

690
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.030
<v Speaker 2>That's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

691
00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:01.864
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a constituent element of reality is </v>

692
00:40:04.661 --> 00:40:08.150
<v Speaker 2>in some sense depends on the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

693
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:12.070
<v Speaker 2>it's longevity is sufficient to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than merely a thing.</v>

694
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Things are kind of temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

695
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:16.300
<v Speaker 2>protons aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

696
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.850
<v Speaker 2>things are temporary dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>

697
00:40:18.851 --> 00:40:21.550
<v Speaker 2>those are not temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are eternal.</v>

698
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 2>They're eternal as far as we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

699
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:25.683
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

700
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 2>so you got the wolf and then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

701
00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:29.314
<v Speaker 2>what kind of wolf gets to the top and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think the toughest wolf that </v>

702
00:40:34.301 --> 00:40:36.530
<v Speaker 2>sort of like the caveman theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

703
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:39.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's unlikely that it's the toughest</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf.</v>

704
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a wolf that's well adapted across </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple dimensions,</v>

705
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.933
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolf that successful in the </v>

706
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:52.981
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy you could think of </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the archetipal wolf right now.</v>

707
00:40:53.111 --> 00:40:55.270
<v Speaker 2>What kind of Wolf is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

708
00:40:55.271 --> 00:40:57.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about wolves to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

709
00:40:57.161 --> 00:40:57.994
<v Speaker 2>but I do know some things about dogs </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean a dog is cooperative as well as </v>

710
00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:03.814
<v Speaker 2>competitive and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty sophisticated at picking up </v>

711
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.850
<v Speaker 2>the cues that indicate the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social relationships.</v>

712
00:41:09.851 --> 00:41:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Like it can do that in human society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dog doesn't know the rules,</v>

713
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.860
<v Speaker 2>but the dog has the morality of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant system already built into it.</v>

714
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a predicate of its,</v>

715
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:22.480
<v Speaker 2>of its biological existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

716
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:27.040
<v Speaker 2>So we'll switch to chimps because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can actually talk a little bit more.</v>

717
00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:29.363
<v Speaker 2>So with a little bit more concrete </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about which chimps when says </v>

718
00:41:32.431 --> 00:41:33.264
<v Speaker 2>lot from de wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which chimp stays on top because </v>

719
00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 2>mailchimp's make a pretty vicious </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

720
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:42.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's almost always a male on top.</v>

721
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:45.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not so clear with Bonobos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Benobos,</v>

722
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.600
<v Speaker 2>I never know how to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

723
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:53.090
<v Speaker 2>But the chimp that stays on top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal chimps can rule for a while,</v>

724
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:54.463
<v Speaker 2>but because they're brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not very good at making </v>

725
00:41:55.941 --> 00:41:56.774
<v Speaker 2>coalitions and even if your brutal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong to guys that are half as brutal </v>

726
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:01.454
<v Speaker 2>as you and three quarters is strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll take you down and that's what the </v>

727
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:06.020
<v Speaker 2>chimps do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might say,</v>

728
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:06.854
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to be optimally situated for </v>

729
00:42:10.491 --> 00:42:11.324
<v Speaker 2>maximum reach reproductive potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only do you want to climb the </v>

730
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:15.224
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to climb it without being hurt </v>

731
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:19.340
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to blow the straps out of</v>

732
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 2>your group and you want to stay there as</v>
<v Speaker 2>long as possible.</v>

733
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a niche.</v>

734
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a niche.</v>

735
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:30.350
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated because the niche </v>
<v Speaker 2>involves success in climbing and then it</v>

736
00:42:30.351 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 2>involves success in maintaining and </v>
<v Speaker 2>upper most position.</v>

737
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and that for chimps that requires not</v>

738
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:38.984
<v Speaker 2>only the capacity to be aggressive but </v>
<v Speaker 2>also the capacity to be cooperative and </v>

739
00:42:43.371 --> 00:42:44.204
<v Speaker 2>empathic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things to all discovered </v>

740
00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:50.930
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the chimp who stays on top first</v>

741
00:42:50.931 --> 00:42:51.764
<v Speaker 2>of all can make coalitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot of reciprocal grooming </v>

742
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:54.590
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's,</v>

743
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 2>he can make friends even though he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

744
00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's tough,</v>

745
00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:59.143
<v Speaker 2>but he also pays a lot of attention to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the females and the infants in the </v>

746
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:02.870
<v Speaker 2>troop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

747
00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:03.973
<v Speaker 2>so whatever constitutes sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say from a chimp perspective is a </v>

748
00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 2>lot more complex than mere power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

749
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 2>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's chimps.</v>

750
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:12.494
<v Speaker 2>Now we're chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you already got the origin of human </v>

751
00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Speaker 2>ethics to some degree in that it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the top,</v>

752
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.690
<v Speaker 2>but don't be too much of a print when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're there,</v>

753
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:21.410
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

754
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

755
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to let you have to rule well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making allowances for those,</v>

756
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:30.643
<v Speaker 2>for making and make allowances for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that those you ruled over have </v>

757
00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:35.504
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's an interesting thing because </v>

758
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:40.340
<v Speaker 2>now what you've done is if you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced the,</v>

759
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.263
<v Speaker 2>not the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that even a defeated other </v>

760
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.260
<v Speaker 2>is a valuable part of the group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

761
00:43:48.261 --> 00:43:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Now that that's starting to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>morality,</v>

762
00:43:50.181 --> 00:43:52.430
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to get fairly deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's kind of like,</v>

763
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outcasts still has value.</v>

764
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.233
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you come to human beings and you </v>

765
00:43:58.431 --> 00:43:58.971
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

766
00:43:58.971 --> 00:44:03.020
<v Speaker 2>well what's what makes a human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful in the dominance hierarchy?</v>

767
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:03.711
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

768
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:06.740
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing the chimps have and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right,</v>

769
00:44:06.741 --> 00:44:09.980
<v Speaker 2>except that human beings have one other </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

770
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:14.540
<v Speaker 2>At least they can make new dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies.</v>

771
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what creativity is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

772
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.070
<v Speaker 2>So you invent a new something and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can erect a dominance hierarchy rounded.</v>

773
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.750
<v Speaker 2>So if you can't climb the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy that's already here,</v>

774
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.681
<v Speaker 2>you can just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

775
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:27.980
<v Speaker 2>here's a new thing and we'll make it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little dominance hierarchy over there.</v>

776
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.963
<v Speaker 2>So now you've got the addition of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to transform the dominance </v>

777
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:33.624
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy as another thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing to dominance hierarchy </v>

778
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:37.890
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

779
00:44:37.891 --> 00:44:38.724
<v Speaker 2>so I believe that what's come out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the idea that this is such a </v>

780
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:45.234
<v Speaker 2>great idea so that the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant Turkey is the right place to </v>

781
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:50.004
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the top of all potential sets of </v>

782
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:56.310
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies is a better place </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

783
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.863
<v Speaker 2>and I think were selected to be the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the set of potential dominance </v>

784
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:05.340
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means in some sense,</v>

785
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:06.174
<v Speaker 2>if you're at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not at the top of ad dominant </v>

786
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're at the top of,</v>

787
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now imagine this.</v>

788
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:15.300
<v Speaker 2>So now imagine a landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

789
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.133
<v Speaker 2>Far as you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a plane and there's pyramids all </v>

790
00:45:18.991 --> 00:45:20.580
<v Speaker 2>over it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of different sizes,</v>

791
00:45:20.581 --> 00:45:21.414
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're flying above it and use zoom </v>

792
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:24.654
<v Speaker 2>into a pyramid and you see all people </v>
<v Speaker 2>packed inside trying to climb to the </v>

793
00:45:27.271 --> 00:45:28.104
<v Speaker 2>top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's pyramids everywhere where </v>

794
00:45:29.311 --> 00:45:32.880
<v Speaker 2>people are doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're flying along the top.</v>

795
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's as far as I can tell.</v>

796
00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:39.120
<v Speaker 2>That's the Egyptian God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horus.</v>

797
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Horus isn't in the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's above the pyramid.</v>

798
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:44.663
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's the eye because horace is the </v>

799
00:45:46.771 --> 00:45:47.604
<v Speaker 2>eye and so horace stands for attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this idea that the </v>

800
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian start to play with that one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important,</v>

801
00:45:55.141 --> 00:45:58.560
<v Speaker 2>God's Osiris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like God of the pyramid.</v>

802
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.740
<v Speaker 2>He stands for security and stability and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the past.</v>

803
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 2>But he can be wiped out by various </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

804
00:46:05.341 --> 00:46:07.260
<v Speaker 2>So he's not permanent enough in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

805
00:46:07.261 --> 00:46:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Or he lacks something.</v>

806
00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Father Architect essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

807
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Osiris is the father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great father.</v>

808
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:15.150
<v Speaker 2>It's half of the archetype because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

809
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.910
<v Speaker 2>He started the positive element of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great father.</v>

810
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:19.830
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not the negative element,</v>

811
00:46:19.831 --> 00:46:20.664
<v Speaker 2>although he makes himself susceptible to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the negative element by being willfully </v>

812
00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:25.450
<v Speaker 2>blind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

813
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 2>So his son is horace and horace is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eye of Horus pays attention.</v>

814
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.350
<v Speaker 2>So the Egyptians are starting to get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that,</v>

815
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 2>well you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh cyrus.</v>

816
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.510
<v Speaker 2>That means you're the embodiment of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>

817
00:46:36.511 --> 00:46:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also should be horus,</v>

818
00:46:38.581 --> 00:46:39.414
<v Speaker 2>which is the thing that pays attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the dominance hierarchy as it's </v>

819
00:46:42.121 --> 00:46:46.080
<v Speaker 2>currently structured may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>restructured.</v>

820
00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 2>And then so you don't want to just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted to this dominance hierarchy.</v>

821
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:53.220
<v Speaker 2>You want to be adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it transforms it structure,</v>

822
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.450
<v Speaker 2>that's no problem for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're not stuck in it,</v>

823
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.060
<v Speaker 2>you're in it and not in it at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

824
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's the big contribution of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian thought.</v>

825
00:47:02.491 --> 00:47:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant.</v>

826
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Just a slight tangent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about there,</v>

827
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.370
<v Speaker 2>just to make that distinction clear for </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

828
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.190
<v Speaker 2>When the Egyptians are experimenting </v>
<v Speaker 2>with these ideas,</v>

829
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.120
<v Speaker 2>are you saying that they're doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciously or this is a,</v>

830
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

831
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.813
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of natural happens </v>

832
00:47:28.351 --> 00:47:30.610
<v Speaker 2>automatically level representation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

833
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Well think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

834
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:33.183
<v Speaker 2>so imagine that one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>characterize whether or not you can </v>

835
00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:36.514
<v Speaker 2>climb the dominant Turkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good you are at watching people who </v>

836
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>can climb the dominant Turkey and </v>
<v Speaker 2>imitating them.</v>

837
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means that part of it's going to</v>

838
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:45.460
<v Speaker 2>be built in your biology because you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been at,</v>

839
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominance hierarchy has been working</v>

840
00:47:47.411 --> 00:47:48.244
<v Speaker 2>on you for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have the capability of being the </v>

841
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:52.234
<v Speaker 2>thing that can climb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then let's say you get an edge by </v>

842
00:47:54.311 --> 00:47:58.510
<v Speaker 2>watching someone who's successfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>climbing because they're like adapted to</v>

843
00:47:58.511 --> 00:48:01.420
<v Speaker 2>the current circumstances precisely and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can imitate them.</v>

844
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the question is,</v>

845
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.113
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

846
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:05.893
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to imitate them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it means is you can model their </v>

847
00:48:08.031 --> 00:48:10.520
<v Speaker 2>behavior with your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

848
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:13.580
<v Speaker 2>so that's a form of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a form of representation.</v>

849
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you've got it.</v>

850
00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.573
<v Speaker 2>Now we're all watching each other and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>find those people who can climb up </v>

851
00:48:20.001 --> 00:48:21.470
<v Speaker 2>dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey is very interesting.</v>

852
00:48:21.471 --> 00:48:23.810
<v Speaker 2>So we tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we start to tell stories about them,</v>

853
00:48:23.811 --> 00:48:28.010
<v Speaker 2>which is the representation of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>in image and articulation.</v>

854
00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.413
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you tell the story about </v>
<v Speaker 2>some interesting person that you admire </v>

855
00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.430
<v Speaker 2>and then it's a pretty good story so </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people remember it,</v>

856
00:48:37.431 --> 00:48:38.264
<v Speaker 2>but then it sort of gets commingled in </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some other stories about some </v>

857
00:48:40.731 --> 00:48:41.564
<v Speaker 2>interesting people who can climb the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy and then thousands </v>

858
00:48:43.971 --> 00:48:44.804
<v Speaker 2>of you gathering those stories all have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a war over centuries and what you </v>

859
00:48:48.561 --> 00:48:49.394
<v Speaker 2>extract out of it is like the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting person who's the best at </v>

860
00:48:52.071 --> 00:48:52.904
<v Speaker 2>climbing the dominance hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where you start to get the idea </v>

861
00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:59.330
<v Speaker 2>of the savior and so it's a bottom up </v>
<v Speaker 2>process and so.</v>

862
00:48:59.331 --> 00:49:02.660
<v Speaker 2>And then once that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you started to get that,</v>

863
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.320
<v Speaker 2>well then the process can be more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>merely.</v>

864
00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.133
<v Speaker 2>You can start to understand and model in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense what the principles are that </v>

865
00:49:15.621 --> 00:49:20.330
<v Speaker 2>govern success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's universal success,</v>

866
00:49:20.331 --> 00:49:22.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not success in a given hierarchy.</v>

867
00:49:22.431 --> 00:49:25.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like what are the principles that </v>
<v Speaker 2>guarantee universal success?</v>

868
00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.313
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the ultimate question of </v>

869
00:49:28.341 --> 00:49:29.090
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

870
00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:31.400
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the ultimate question of life.</v>

871
00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.700
<v Speaker 2>So what did the Egyptians figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>while they figured out that,</v>

872
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:38.060
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cyrus was a good guy,</v>

873
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you need it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's Kinda blind because he's old,</v>

874
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.113
<v Speaker 2>can be any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's willfully blind to and that makes </v>

875
00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:52.091
<v Speaker 2>them susceptible to the forces that want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to overturn the hierarchy.</v>

876
00:49:52.971 --> 00:49:55.040
<v Speaker 2>But the negative forces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that just want to destroy,</v>

877
00:49:55.041 --> 00:49:57.440
<v Speaker 2>that's his brother Seth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Oh,</v>

878
00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:01.790
<v Speaker 2>cyrus remains willfully blind and he let</v>
<v Speaker 2>seth basically chop them into pieces and</v>

879
00:50:01.791 --> 00:50:03.770
<v Speaker 2>distributed throughout the Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

880
00:50:03.771 --> 00:50:05.930
<v Speaker 2>So things fall apart and seth rule.</v>

881
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:06.763
<v Speaker 2>So the Egyptians had already figured out</v>
<v Speaker 2>in models that the hierarchy can become </v>

882
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:15.080
<v Speaker 2>probably corrupted by power and deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

883
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:15.943
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's no longer functioning as it </v>

884
00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:18.764
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it can continually do that instead </v>

885
00:50:21.331 --> 00:50:23.320
<v Speaker 2>it descends into chaos or that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of.</v>

886
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:24.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

887
00:50:24.261 --> 00:50:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Well it's the demolition of order and </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

888
00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.930
<v Speaker 2>when Isis makes her appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's goddess of chaos.</v>

889
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:30.764
<v Speaker 2>It's like outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis and her husband is so cyrus and </v>

890
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 2>he's all chopped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she goes around Egypt.</v>

891
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:37.483
<v Speaker 2>He's not killed because you can't kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>those cyrus because he's the dominance </v>

892
00:50:39.611 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can disrupt it,</v>

893
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.970
<v Speaker 2>you can break it into pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to come back together.</v>

894
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:48.230
<v Speaker 2>So isis wanders around Egypt trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find his fellas.</v>

895
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.710
<v Speaker 2>So she finally does and she makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself pregnant with it.</v>

896
00:50:51.711 --> 00:50:55.370
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea there is that when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces of society fall into chaos,</v>

897
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:56.720
<v Speaker 2>they're still alive.</v>

898
00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.850
<v Speaker 2>So something new can be born out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

899
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:59.743
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the creative destruction that </v>

900
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:04.000
<v Speaker 2>the economists talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis makes herself pregnant.</v>

901
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:09.030
<v Speaker 2>She gives birth to horace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Horace is Cyrus his son.</v>

902
00:51:09.081 --> 00:51:11.240
<v Speaker 2>But the big difference between him and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Cyrus,</v>

903
00:51:11.241 --> 00:51:14.150
<v Speaker 2>is that he can see he's not willfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind.</v>

904
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.640
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the opposite of willfully blind.</v>

905
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:20.450
<v Speaker 2>He's almost only the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous Egyptian I,</v>

906
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:21.403
<v Speaker 2>he's also a falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Falcons are those things that fly </v>

907
00:51:23.691 --> 00:51:25.430
<v Speaker 2>above and they can really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

908
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:30.140
<v Speaker 2>really see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So horace grows up outside the kingdom.</v>

909
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.013
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

910
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:31.873
<v Speaker 2>Everybody grows up outside the kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the old kingdom has always </v>

911
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:37.850
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and are archaic and willfully </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind,</v>

912
00:51:37.851 --> 00:51:38.684
<v Speaker 2>so you're always alienated from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So alienation is like a permanent </v>

913
00:51:41.151 --> 00:51:41.984
<v Speaker 2>element of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then horace goes and because he can </v>

914
00:51:45.321 --> 00:51:46.154
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sees seth for who he is and then he </v>

915
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:52.241
<v Speaker 2>has a horrible fight with seth and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wins and then he bandaged his seth.</v>

916
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:53.923
<v Speaker 2>Now you can't kill him because he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the fact that dominance </v>

917
00:51:57.141 --> 00:52:00.640
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies can become corrupt is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>eternal facts.</v>

918
00:52:00.641 --> 00:52:03.080
<v Speaker 2>So there is no getting rid of seth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can get rid of them temporarily.</v>

919
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:04.573
<v Speaker 2>So when he gets rid of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he steals his eye back and then you </v>

920
00:52:07.341 --> 00:52:07.851
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

921
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:08.684
<v Speaker 2>well he's got rid of whole seth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's got the kingdom end of </v>

922
00:52:11.331 --> 00:52:12.230
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

923
00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.970
<v Speaker 2>that is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Horace takes his eye.</v>

924
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.373
<v Speaker 2>He goes back down to chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>underworld and finds those cyrus down </v>

925
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:21.320
<v Speaker 2>there who sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

926
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.110
<v Speaker 2>he's a ghost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a shade of his former self,</v>

927
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.333
<v Speaker 2>and horace gives him his eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now cyrus can see with the eyes of </v>

928
00:52:29.931 --> 00:52:30.764
<v Speaker 2>youth and then horace and Noah Cyrus go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to really the kingdom together and </v>

929
00:52:37.461 --> 00:52:40.160
<v Speaker 2>the Pharaoh is Osiris and horus </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

930
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.090
<v Speaker 2>If he's a good feral.</v>

931
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.620
<v Speaker 2>So that means he's wisdom and tradition </v>
<v Speaker 2>and attention and that's,</v>

932
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.080
<v Speaker 2>that's you're starting to get very close</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

933
00:52:48.081 --> 00:52:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Now the Egyptians identified that </v>
<v Speaker 2>horace,</v>

934
00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:53.540
<v Speaker 2>so cyrus thing with the immortal soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

935
00:52:53.541 --> 00:52:54.374
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're right and it's not some trivial </v>

936
00:52:56.961 --> 00:52:58.540
<v Speaker 2>superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

937
00:52:58.550 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 2>it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

938
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:02.750
<v Speaker 2>That is the immortal soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing,</v>

939
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:03.950
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

940
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:07.790
<v Speaker 2>it's the best in each person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

941
00:53:07.791 --> 00:53:08.624
<v Speaker 2>Now you know that those ideas get much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more developed as we get much more </v>

942
00:53:13.551 --> 00:53:17.840
<v Speaker 2>civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the end of the Egyptian periods,</v>

943
00:53:17.841 --> 00:53:20.240
<v Speaker 2>they call this the democratization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus,</v>

944
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:25.010
<v Speaker 2>although only the Pharaoh to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 2>could sort of use the symbolism that was</v>

945
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:25.853
<v Speaker 2>associated with Cyrus Horace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sort of spread down the dominance </v>

946
00:53:28.591 --> 00:53:31.680
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and then for me,</v>

947
00:53:31.681 --> 00:53:34.680
<v Speaker 2>what happens after that is that while it</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to get universalized,</v>

948
00:53:34.681 --> 00:53:35.514
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is not a particularly linear </v>

949
00:53:38.011 --> 00:53:40.330
<v Speaker 2>progression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the sake of simplicity,</v>

950
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:41.850
<v Speaker 2>we can make the case.</v>

951
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.830
<v Speaker 2>The Greeks give every adult male a soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

952
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time Christianity rolls around,</v>

953
00:53:50.131 --> 00:53:50.964
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh huh.</v>

954
00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has a soul.</v>

955
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Even the Weirdos that you'd rather get </v>
<v Speaker 2>rid of.</v>

956
00:53:55.411 --> 00:53:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Even those things that you think of as </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies,</v>

957
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:00.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's in people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

958
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:00.864
<v Speaker 2>now Christianity really starts to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>around with exactly what the hell this </v>

959
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.150
<v Speaker 2>soul is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

960
00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.143
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideas come out in very bizarre ways </v>

961
00:54:09.151 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 2>and like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

962
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:11.663
<v Speaker 2>one of the most bizarre ways is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity makes the assumption that </v>

963
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:15.594
<v Speaker 2>the word of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that pulls order out of chaos at </v>

964
00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:22.380
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So logos is the thing.</v>

965
00:54:22.381 --> 00:54:24.090
<v Speaker 2>That's Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

966
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.350
<v Speaker 2>So many eons later they're the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

967
00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:27.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

968
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.850
<v Speaker 2>what the hell does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

969
00:54:29.851 --> 00:54:34.851
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you embody the immortal </v>
<v Speaker 2>soul pro properly,</v>

970
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:35.993
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that generates order from </v>

971
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:41.920
<v Speaker 2>chaos or sometimes the reverse you make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

972
00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you're the transforming agent that sits </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the middle of order and chaos.</v>

973
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.433
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's the same thing that was there </v>

974
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:49.320
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

975
00:54:49.321 --> 00:54:50.154
<v Speaker 2>that's the beginning of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being not the beginning of the </v>

976
00:54:52.411 --> 00:54:53.860
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the beginning of being.</v>

977
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

978
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:57.263
<v Speaker 2>And the Christians figure out that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>logo's thing is very much associated </v>

979
00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:03.930
<v Speaker 2>with articulated truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulated truth.</v>

980
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:08.170
<v Speaker 2>And so the Christian idea in part is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

981
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.040
<v Speaker 2>this is where Dj had it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think because he was,</v>

982
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was too cynical about cyrus.</v>

983
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:17.574
<v Speaker 2>He was too cynical about Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought all it was was rotten </v>

984
00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.890
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

985
00:55:22.891 --> 00:55:23.724
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he saw how it had become dogmatize and </v>

986
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.850
<v Speaker 2>corrupted across time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't see what was in the center</v>

987
00:55:29.851 --> 00:55:30.684
<v Speaker 2>of it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his superman was sort of a substitute </v>

988
00:55:34.021 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he never fleshed that out.</v>

989
00:55:36.151 --> 00:55:36.984
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but young started to play with the </v>

990
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:38.754
<v Speaker 2>superman idea and with the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher stone and he was studying </v>

991
00:55:42.631 --> 00:55:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Christianity and at one point he thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>he saw,</v>

992
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:46.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the same thing.</v>

993
00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:50.100
<v Speaker 2>They're all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated,</v>

994
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:55.340
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognized was that the core doctrine of</v>

995
00:55:56.041 --> 00:55:56.874
<v Speaker 2>Christianity in some sense is the truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>buttresses you most thoroughly against </v>

996
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:10.640
<v Speaker 2>the vicissitudes of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your salvation,</v>

997
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.710
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spoken truth.</v>

998
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:18.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

999
00:56:18.121 --> 00:56:19.260
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians say,</v>

1000
00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:20.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in Christ,</v>

1001
00:56:20.581 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 2>you're saved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1002
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:25.120
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by belief?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly?</v>

1003
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.630
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ is the son of God,</v>

1004
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.823
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that just because you say </v>

1005
00:56:31.841 --> 00:56:33.880
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean you believe it at all.</v>

1006
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:36.400
<v Speaker 2>It has almost no bearing on what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

1007
00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:37.683
<v Speaker 2>The question is how do you act and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental question that's under all </v>

1008
00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is your speech true?</v>

1009
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you might ask,</v>

1010
00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:48.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is true mean?</v>

1011
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unanswered.</v>

1012
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 2>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's twofold.</v>

1013
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 2>What are you trying to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech?</v>

1014
00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.053
<v Speaker 2>There's two things you can do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is you can manipulate reality so </v>

1015
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:02.194
<v Speaker 2>that it does what you want it to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and that's the sort of speech that </v>

1016
00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:08.260
<v Speaker 2>people use when they're trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they want.</v>

1017
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.060
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that they.</v>

1018
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:13.283
<v Speaker 2>They can't actually know what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just hypothesize what it is that </v>

1019
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:17.344
<v Speaker 2>they want based on some theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they try to manipulate the </v>

1020
00:57:20.591 --> 00:57:21.424
<v Speaker 2>world so that they get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an unsatisfying venture and </v>

1021
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:26.530
<v Speaker 2>often when they do get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not good anyways,</v>

1022
00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:30.010
<v Speaker 2>so and it involves a kind of falsity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

1023
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:31.023
<v Speaker 2>The other way is to try to say what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean and think and perceive as clearly </v>

1024
00:57:37.331 --> 00:57:40.630
<v Speaker 2>as you possibly can always and see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

1025
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story that underlies Christianity,</v>

1026
00:57:44.741 --> 00:57:45.574
<v Speaker 2>and it's not only Christianity but </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity that I'm most familiar </v>

1027
00:57:47.891 --> 00:57:48.724
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the rule is live in accordance </v>

1028
00:57:52.301 --> 00:57:56.500
<v Speaker 2>with the truth and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the sermon on the Mount,</v>

1029
00:57:56.501 --> 00:57:58.630
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ basically says,</v>

1030
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:07.530
<v Speaker 2>set your sights on allegiance to God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like whatever the highest value is,</v>

1031
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:12.541
<v Speaker 2>we'll say and act in a manner that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>concurrent with that.</v>

1032
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:14.103
<v Speaker 2>So that's your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then pay attention to the here and now </v>

1033
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:19.360
<v Speaker 2>your best strategy for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1034
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you might say,</v>

1035
00:58:21.581 --> 00:58:22.391
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prove that.</v>

1036
00:58:22.391 --> 00:58:23.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1037
00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:25.990
<v Speaker 2>that's when the question starts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become existential.</v>

1038
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.921
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1039
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:28.420
<v Speaker 2>you can't prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to try it.</v>

1040
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.060
<v Speaker 2>That's like character guards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leap of faith.</v>

1041
00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:34.690
<v Speaker 2>You cannot tell if this works unless you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1042
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:37.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's a commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it.</v>

1043
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Those two ways of being like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulative way of being.</v>

1044
00:58:40.361 --> 00:58:42.660
<v Speaker 2>That's an adversarial way of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>architecturally.</v>

1045
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:45.700
<v Speaker 2>It's manipulative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got the lie at its core.</v>

1046
00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.760
<v Speaker 2>That's completely different than this </v>
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

1047
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:50.963
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a hypothesis while inside </v>

1048
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.300
<v Speaker 2>apotheosis that you and get a good job </v>
<v Speaker 2>of elaborating.</v>

1049
00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Although you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with young,</v>

1050
00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:58.953
<v Speaker 2>it's not fully articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still saturated and image to a large </v>

1051
00:59:02.351 --> 00:59:03.184
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no wonder it's very complicated to </v>

1052
00:59:04.751 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 2>make this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of thing fully articulated.</v>

1053
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:09.850
<v Speaker 2>You read Solzhenitsyn's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1054
00:59:09.851 --> 00:59:10.684
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did the Soviet Union become the </v>

1055
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:15.670
<v Speaker 2>absolute hell hole that it was sold </v>
<v Speaker 2>units and says,</v>

1056
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:18.370
<v Speaker 2>because everyone lied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1057
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.750
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that interesting?</v>

1058
00:59:19.751 --> 00:59:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't the hypothesis you hear every</v>

1059
00:59:21.831 --> 00:59:22.664
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you think about Freud and you </v>

1060
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:24.711
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1061
00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 2>what's the major cause of mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness?</v>

1062
00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Repression?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1063
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 2>that's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>

1064
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean Freud's played around with it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some degree,</v>

1065
00:59:34.581 --> 00:59:35.414
<v Speaker 2>so it's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more like lying by omission </v>

1066
00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:44.200
<v Speaker 2>actually than lying by omission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1067
00:59:44.201 --> 00:59:46.570
<v Speaker 2>It's still lying young says the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1068
00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:47.261
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1069
00:59:47.261 --> 00:59:48.094
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be interesting if the </v>

1070
00:59:48.641 --> 00:59:52.000
<v Speaker 2>fundamental root of psychopathology was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lie?</v>

1071
00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:55.540
<v Speaker 2>The fundamental root of political </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology is the lie.</v>

1072
00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:56.913
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1073
00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.830
<v Speaker 2>what if that's what's demolishing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

1074
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:01.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

1075
01:00:01.271 --> 01:00:05.100
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think,</v>

1076
01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:07.950
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're nihilistic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they and they become destructive,</v>

1077
01:00:07.951 --> 01:00:08.784
<v Speaker 2>that the universe is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an unfair and arbitrary place and </v>

1078
01:00:11.911 --> 01:00:14.400
<v Speaker 2>it's basically bent on their random </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>

1079
01:00:14.401 --> 01:00:15.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they suffer.</v>

1080
01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.580
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1081
01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:19.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1082
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.480
<v Speaker 2>What do you do under those </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances?</v>

1083
01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:23.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1084
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.103
<v Speaker 2>one potential answer is twist the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you can maybe get what you </v>

1085
01:00:30.511 --> 01:00:33.660
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically want out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other is</v>

1086
01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.600
<v Speaker 2>rely on your perceptions and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity for accurate representation.</v>

1087
01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Communicate that and take your chances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like who's right?</v>

1088
01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the battle between good and evil,</v>

1089
01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:50.790
<v Speaker 2>who's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a continual battle.</v>

1090
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:55.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really important to drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>home this notion of right and truth.</v>

1091
01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:59.100
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about here as in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>action,</v>

1092
01:00:59.130 --> 01:00:59.963
<v Speaker 3>what is the right action?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because action is essentially is almost </v>

1093
01:01:03.151 --> 01:01:03.984
<v Speaker 3>the unit of truth that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That you're hypothesizing based on but </v>

1094
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.010
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for most people,</v>

1095
01:01:11.011 --> 01:01:11.844
<v Speaker 3>I think when they hear the word truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially people in academia or people </v>

1096
01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:18.810
<v Speaker 3>are involved in the sciences in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think of something very different.</v>

1097
01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1098
01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.000
<v Speaker 3>And their truth is representational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1099
01:01:24.001 --> 01:01:25.440
<v Speaker 3>So can you elaborate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

1100
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:26.580
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also.</v>

1101
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:27.533
<v Speaker 2>That's also partly why the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>church historically has been so put off </v>

1102
01:01:32.851 --> 01:01:34.980
<v Speaker 2>by the rational intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1103
01:01:34.981 --> 01:01:36.780
<v Speaker 2>like people like dark and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1104
01:01:36.781 --> 01:01:37.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1105
01:01:37.411 --> 01:01:40.620
<v Speaker 2>They went after Galileo because he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>undermining their superstitions.</v>

1106
01:01:40.621 --> 01:01:41.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1107
01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Partly right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other part was seth,</v>

1108
01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:48.443
<v Speaker 2>like the figure of evil throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>history is always the hyper rational </v>

1109
01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:56.460
<v Speaker 2>intellect and the reason for that is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellect is God's highest angel,</v>

1110
01:01:56.461 --> 01:02:00.660
<v Speaker 2>so that's Lucifer and it falls in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>with its own creations.</v>

1111
01:02:00.661 --> 01:02:03.420
<v Speaker 2>It likes to make totalities out of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>own creation.</v>

1112
01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Once there's a totality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no room for the transcendent.</v>

1113
01:02:06.661 --> 01:02:11.070
<v Speaker 2>There is no god that Satan's error by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way and everything immediately turns</v>

1114
01:02:11.071 --> 01:02:11.904
<v Speaker 2>into hail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you see that was all put together </v>

1115
01:02:14.191 --> 01:02:19.191
<v Speaker 2>particularly well by Milton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milton was a visionary and what felt and</v>

1116
01:02:21.211 --> 01:02:22.044
<v Speaker 2>put together was the images stick sub </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight out of which the totalitarian </v>

1117
01:02:26.611 --> 01:02:27.870
<v Speaker 2>states we're going to grow.</v>

1118
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:30.150
<v Speaker 2>He envisioned it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it was visionary,</v>

1119
01:02:30.151 --> 01:02:30.984
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He saw it as a battle between heavenly </v>

1120
01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:35.100
<v Speaker 2>agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he codified it and he said,</v>

1121
01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:35.934
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1122
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:39.000
<v Speaker 2>here's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the approaching problem.</v>

1123
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That totalitarian intellect,</v>

1124
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly right.</v>

1125
01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.353
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you talk to people who are suffering </v>

1126
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:51.510
<v Speaker 2>existentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always in love with the products</v>

1127
01:02:51.511 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 2>of their intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do not pay attention.</v>

1128
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:54.481
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1129
01:02:54.481 --> 01:02:57.210
<v Speaker 2>I can't see how my life has any meaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and answered.</v>

1130
01:02:57.211 --> 01:03:02.211
<v Speaker 2>That is you're not seeing your thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can easily think yourself into a</v>

1131
01:03:02.581 --> 01:03:06.870
<v Speaker 2>corner where your life has no meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cheap trick I can say,</v>

1132
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 2>who cares about this documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>

1133
01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:11.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to matter in a billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1134
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or in a hundred years or whatever.</v>

1135
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:17.820
<v Speaker 2>I can pick a timeframe within which this</v>
<v Speaker 2>event is irrelevant.</v>

1136
01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:19.163
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you can derive from that fact </v>

1137
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:22.583
<v Speaker 2>that it's irrelevant or you can derive </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that fact that that's a stupid way </v>

1138
01:03:26.281 --> 01:03:30.840
<v Speaker 2>to think so and you can.</v>

1139
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.733
<v Speaker 2>You can derive the conclusion that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a stupid way to think if you haven't </v>

1140
01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:36.564
<v Speaker 2>made thinking you're God so and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of other things that work better </v>

1141
01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:41.634
<v Speaker 2>than thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paying attention is better than </v>

1142
01:03:42.721 --> 01:03:44.820
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much better than thinking.</v>

1143
01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Paying attention allows you to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't agree with you.</v>

1144
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Paying attention allows you to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you don't already know,</v>

1145
01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.580
<v Speaker 2>so you know if it's thinking or </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

1146
01:03:53.581 --> 01:03:54.414
<v Speaker 2>that should be the God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like attention rules thinking </v>

1147
01:03:58.531 --> 01:04:02.670
<v Speaker 2>that's a subordinate phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it likes to pop up on top,</v>

1148
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it likes.</v>

1149
01:04:03.451 --> 01:04:06.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a little tight theories and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>likes to be right.</v>

1150
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:10.860
<v Speaker 2>forget that you're not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1152
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.760
<v Speaker 2>You could say that the image of Christ </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the West's attempt to most accurately</v>

1153
01:04:20.551 --> 01:04:21.384
<v Speaker 2>represent the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the path of being that constitutes </v>

1154
01:04:25.771 --> 01:04:29.760
<v Speaker 2>success across an infinite set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies.</v>

1155
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's essentially.</v>

1156
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:32.783
<v Speaker 2>Or that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's at least one way of looking at </v>

1157
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:35.190
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there are figures,</v>

1158
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.790
<v Speaker 2>hero figures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1159
01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:39.470
<v Speaker 2>because Christ is like a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's sort of a Meta hero,</v>

1160
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the amalgam of many,</v>

1161
01:04:41.581 --> 01:04:42.391
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

1162
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:44.970
<v Speaker 2>many heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the hero is,</v>

1163
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:47.760
<v Speaker 2>has key attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the hero for example,</v>

1164
01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:50.400
<v Speaker 2>is always encountering chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating it.</v>

1165
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the human path.</v>

1166
01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we encountered chaos so often the snake,</v>

1167
01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:56.903
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that also points to it's deep </v>

1168
01:04:57.631 --> 01:05:02.340
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary roots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a anthropologist,</v>

1169
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Lynn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isabelle,</v>

1170
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.930
<v Speaker 2>who wrote a book a while back called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree,</v>

1171
01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:07.764
<v Speaker 2>the serpent and vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I've got that right and she was </v>

1172
01:05:09.931 --> 01:05:10.764
<v Speaker 2>interested in why human beings can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>so well because we can see really well </v>

1173
01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:16.650
<v Speaker 2>the only things that can see better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>us are birds of prey.</v>

1174
01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 2>And she thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why</v>

1175
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>would a primate like us have such good </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision?</v>

1176
01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:21.663
<v Speaker 1>So she went around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She thought she knew also that we were </v>

1177
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>particularly good at detecting the kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of camouflage patterns that characterize</v>

1178
01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:30.184
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the lower half of our </v>

1179
01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>visual field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was kind of curious about that.</v>

1180
01:05:33.881 --> 01:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>And then she thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1181
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we were preyed upon by snakes and </v>

1182
01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:38.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we had to develop good vision </v>

1183
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>because we were preyed upon by snakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 60 million years ago,</v>

1184
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>way back when we weren't even people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about how old snakes are.</v>

1185
01:05:46.421 --> 01:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like 60 million years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1186
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.533
<v Speaker 1>So then she went around the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she correlated the acuity of primate </v>

1187
01:05:53.231 --> 01:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>vision with the prevalence of predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>

1188
01:05:55.590 --> 01:05:58.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like nice correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she thought,</v>

1189
01:05:58.301 --> 01:06:00.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings in snakes coevolved.</v>

1190
01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what gives you vision snakes?</v>

1191
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what it says in Genesis.</v>

1192
01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.570
<v Speaker 1>What else gives you vision?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fruit.</v>

1193
01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:10.210
<v Speaker 1>That's also right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have color vision,</v>

1194
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes you self conscious?</v>

1195
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:14.380
<v Speaker 1>If you're a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

1196
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:16.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's eve.</v>

1197
01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.320
<v Speaker 1>So you know the stories in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pre flood stories,</v>

1198
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.373
<v Speaker 1>they're really old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how old they are and </v>

1199
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:27.603
<v Speaker 1>like they're extremely old and you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>say well and story for well like actual </v>

1200
01:06:33.011 --> 01:06:34.930
<v Speaker 1>story for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how old they are,</v>

1201
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.490
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of behavioral pattern that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could easily be 60 million years old.</v>

1202
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:40.953
<v Speaker 1>It's like the thing that defeats the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake gets the women and you imagine </v>

1203
01:06:45.221 --> 01:06:49.570
<v Speaker 1>that in tree dwelling primates say well </v>
<v Speaker 1>upcoming the snakes.</v>

1204
01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like the first guy who figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to drop a stick on a snake.</v>

1205
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:57.160
<v Speaker 1>He was very popular so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the snake,</v>

1206
01:06:57.161 --> 01:06:57.994
<v Speaker 1>what's happened is that religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what what's happened as far as I can </v>

1207
01:07:02.471 --> 01:07:03.304
<v Speaker 1>tell is that the systems that our brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved to detect basically rapacious </v>

1208
01:07:08.471 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just snakes,</v>

1209
01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:13.840
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be like reptiles with teeth,</v>

1210
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:18.150
<v Speaker 1>predators in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things under the water,</v>

1211
01:07:18.151 --> 01:07:19.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crocodiles.</v>

1212
01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the lurking a normally,</v>

1213
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.043
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing you have to contend with </v>

1214
01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1215
01:07:28.111 --> 01:07:31.560
<v Speaker 1>people say monsters aren't real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like it depends on your timeframe.</v>

1216
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:32.873
<v Speaker 1>If you add up and average all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory monsters across 60 million </v>

1217
01:07:36.061 --> 01:07:37.620
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a monster.</v>

1218
01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1219
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.720
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

1220
01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:40.554
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Amalgam of monster is a </v>

1221
01:07:44.371 --> 01:07:47.670
<v Speaker 1>representation of the class of predatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimuli.</v>

1222
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.650
<v Speaker 1>That might be a way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1223
01:07:49.651 --> 01:07:52.710
<v Speaker 1>So we're very sensitive to that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were prey animals.</v>

1224
01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:53.843
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then our cortex leapt up a level of </v>

1225
01:07:56.431 --> 01:07:57.264
<v Speaker 1>abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then that same system started to </v>

1226
01:07:59.431 --> 01:08:00.264
<v Speaker 1>detect anomaly as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just the predatory thing that </v>

1227
01:08:03.811 --> 01:08:04.644
<v Speaker 1>was outside the dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the abstract thing that was </v>

1228
01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:09.990
<v Speaker 1>outside the system of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing,</v>

1229
01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:10.943
<v Speaker 1>and so that became symbolized by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos monster and we can easily throw </v>

1230
01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>that our enemies.</v>

1231
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:16.851
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1232
01:08:16.851 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 2>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're outside the hierarchy.</v>

1233
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a chaos monster.</v>

1234
01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.980
<v Speaker 2>While yes you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a arbitrary prejudice.</v>

1235
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:27.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like you are absolutely a chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>

1236
01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with chaos monsters?</v>

1237
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.580
<v Speaker 2>One answer is killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other answer is get their gold.</v>

1238
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:36.103
<v Speaker 2>That's a better answer because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>information in chaos and we're </v>

1239
01:08:39.171 --> 01:08:42.200
<v Speaker 2>information scavengers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's our niche.</v>

1240
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like outside what we know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's information.</v>

1241
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.200
<v Speaker 2>You might die retrieving it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't die,</v>

1242
01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.050
<v Speaker 2>you're like a major hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1243
01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.003
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1244
01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:56.123
<v Speaker 3>So is this the sense in which these </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious or philosophical stories and </v>

1245
01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:03.510
<v Speaker 3>images are true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1246
01:09:03.511 --> 01:09:04.344
<v Speaker 3>in the sense that they instruct action </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that in the Darwinian sense is </v>

1247
01:09:10.591 --> 01:09:11.320
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

1248
01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.020
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the only sense in which truth</v>

1249
01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.760
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1250
01:09:15.761 --> 01:09:17.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're a Darwinian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1251
01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:18.063
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the problem with modern </v>

1252
01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:19.654
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1253
01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.350
<v Speaker 2>are you Newtonian or are you Darwinian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Newton.</v>

1254
01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.480
<v Speaker 2>He's wrong by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1255
01:09:25.481 --> 01:09:28.870
<v Speaker 2>We already know that because Newton's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only a subset of Einstein,</v>

1256
01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.733
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and God only knows what the whole </v>

1257
01:09:31.361 --> 01:09:32.194
<v Speaker 2>quantum thing is going to end up being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know how to structure our </v>

1258
01:09:35.411 --> 01:09:37.450
<v Speaker 2>thought in accordance with those </v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions,</v>

1259
01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:39.130
<v Speaker 2>but Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's newton.</v>

1260
01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.160
<v Speaker 2>That's my hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1261
01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:43.683
<v Speaker 2>you might say those who have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then the question is what attitude </v>

1262
01:09:48.881 --> 01:09:52.000
<v Speaker 2>towards religion is truly scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1263
01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:55.480
<v Speaker 2>I think my attitude towards religion is </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely scientific.</v>

1264
01:09:56.290 --> 01:10:01.290
<v Speaker 2>So because it's predicated on Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>really on Darwinian presuppositions,</v>

1265
01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins is a rationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a Darwinian.</v>

1266
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.730
<v Speaker 2>He just thinks he's a Darwinian.</v>

1267
01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:07.831
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we.</v>

1268
01:10:07.831 --> 01:10:08.664
<v Speaker 3>Can we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we explore this a little bit in </v>

1269
01:10:10.051 --> 01:10:10.884
<v Speaker 3>terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of describing how you're </v>

1270
01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:13.900
<v Speaker 3>working with these definitions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>

1271
01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:15.023
<v Speaker 3>When you say that your approach to </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion is a Darwinian one and </v>

1272
01:10:18.451 --> 01:10:20.220
<v Speaker 3>doctrines is unwittingly perhaps</v>

1273
01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:22.450
<v Speaker 2>he's an enlightenment guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1274
01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:23.373
<v Speaker 2>So enlightened lightened is dislike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really thin paint on a mile deep </v>

1275
01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.580
<v Speaker 2>piece of rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>

1276
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:31.833
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I really liked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading young was that young tracks the </v>

1277
01:10:35.351 --> 01:10:37.720
<v Speaker 2>development of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Back Ten thousand years.</v>

1278
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:38.583
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1279
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:40.750
<v Speaker 2>that's a 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>year span of history.</v>

1280
01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:42.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1281
01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:44.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not compared to 300 million years.</v>

1282
01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a really long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1283
01:10:46.991 --> 01:10:47.824
<v Speaker 2>So if we're going to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian underpinnings of the brain or </v>

1284
01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:54.700
<v Speaker 2>of the human organism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's use some time spans.</v>

1285
01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:58.720
<v Speaker 2>So darkens has darwinism painted on </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment,</v>

1286
01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:01.200
<v Speaker 2>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a postseason enlightenment guides,</v>

1287
01:11:01.201 --> 01:11:02.530
<v Speaker 2>like rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

1288
01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:04.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like this is how you make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1289
01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:05.471
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1290
01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:08.290
<v Speaker 2>well we thought that more or less for </v>
<v Speaker 2>400 years.</v>

1291
01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 2>So what did we think for the other like </v>
<v Speaker 2>300 million years?</v>

1292
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:17.700
<v Speaker 1>How did we manage without that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's truth?</v>

1293
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.553
<v Speaker 1>So it's a form of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a partial form of truth and it's a </v>

1294
01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:28.860
<v Speaker 1>powerful partial form of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to say it's truth.</v>

1295
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Well then it depends on what you mean by</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

1296
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:33.960
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1297
01:11:33.961 --> 01:11:35.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's where it gets back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1298
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:37.980
<v Speaker 1>that's where it starts to go back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Darwinian issue,</v>

1299
01:11:37.981 --> 01:11:38.814
<v Speaker 1>which is there's only one way you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>define truth in relationship to finite </v>

1300
01:11:42.811 --> 01:11:44.910
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true enough,</v>

1301
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:46.523
<v Speaker 1>true enough for what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>True enough so that you survive and </v>

1302
01:11:49.051 --> 01:11:51.030
<v Speaker 1>reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1303
01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to go any farther.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

1304
01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:54.780
<v Speaker 1>what's more true than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

1305
01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:57.120
<v Speaker 1>can't ask that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1306
01:11:57.450 --> 01:12:00.780
<v Speaker 1>You've hit the limit and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically Darwin's claim and that's what</v>

1307
01:12:00.781 --> 01:12:02.460
<v Speaker 1>the pragmatist recognized as well.</v>

1308
01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:03.483
<v Speaker 3>So it was another way of really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you just went through can be very </v>

1309
01:12:06.861 --> 01:12:09.940
<v Speaker 3>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so is another way of articulating that.</v>

1310
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:11.103
<v Speaker 3>What's true is what enables you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>successfully achieve a goal and you </v>

1311
01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:16.910
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1312
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:17.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1313
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:19.640
<v Speaker 1>that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's true enough,</v>

1314
01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:21.253
<v Speaker 1>but there's only true enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's like there's varieties of </v>

1315
01:12:24.291 --> 01:12:27.800
<v Speaker 1>true enough so it doesn't turn you into </v>
<v Speaker 1>a relativist.</v>

1316
01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like some things are only true for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing.</v>

1317
01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:31.483
<v Speaker 1>Some things are true for 10 things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things are true for a million </v>

1318
01:12:34.791 --> 01:12:35.660
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1319
01:12:35.661 --> 01:12:37.580
<v Speaker 1>well that's a better truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1320
01:12:37.581 --> 01:12:40.700
<v Speaker 1>in what what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the religious imagination,</v>

1321
01:12:40.701 --> 01:12:41.534
<v Speaker 1>which is the imagination that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with values is always trying </v>

1322
01:12:44.301 --> 01:12:46.340
<v Speaker 1>to determine is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the highest value?</v>

1323
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the religious question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the highest value?</v>

1324
01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Which is what should you serve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1325
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.920
<v Speaker 1>to ensure your viability across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadest domain of time.</v>

1326
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:06.470
<v Speaker 1>While we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what we've done is,</v>

1327
01:13:06.471 --> 01:13:08.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've watched successful people.</v>

1328
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:10.130
<v Speaker 1>What does successful mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1329
01:13:10.131 --> 01:13:10.964
<v Speaker 1>we know what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we can stay within the Darwinian </v>

1330
01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:13.970
<v Speaker 1>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1331
01:13:13.971 --> 01:13:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1332
01:13:14.901 --> 01:13:15.734
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the Darwinian framework is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last word on things because we're </v>

1333
01:13:18.711 --> 01:13:20.510
<v Speaker 1>starting to discover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1334
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:23.240
<v Speaker 1>that there are epigenetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

1335
01:13:23.241 --> 01:13:25.070
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see where that goes.</v>

1336
01:13:25.071 --> 01:13:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It's going to go somewhere very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

1337
01:13:26.631 --> 01:13:27.710
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For,</v>

1338
01:13:27.730 --> 01:13:28.730
<v Speaker 1>for the time being</v>

1339
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 1>were were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were enamored of successful people.</v>

1340
01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's success.</v>

1341
01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:39.570
<v Speaker 1>There's a successful person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a successful person,</v>

1342
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:40.404
<v Speaker 1>be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful person c and what makes them </v>

1343
01:13:42.121 --> 01:13:45.120
<v Speaker 1>the same is that they're successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1344
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:45.954
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is what is successful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then in some sense the variations </v>

1345
01:13:50.671 --> 01:13:55.260
<v Speaker 1>of Harold Mythology are complex answers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that question.</v>

1346
01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:56.341
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1347
01:13:56.341 --> 01:13:57.174
<v Speaker 1>if you're a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're successful while there's a bunch </v>

1348
01:13:58.441 --> 01:14:00.210
<v Speaker 1>of different kinds of heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1349
01:14:00.211 --> 01:14:02.820
<v Speaker 1>so you get all of these heroes together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now have a big fight.</v>

1350
01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Who comes up on top?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1351
01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:06.953
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you one answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's exactly what happens in </v>

1352
01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there's a bunch of heroes,</v>

1353
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.113
<v Speaker 1>their gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're confronted by a </v>

1354
01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:18.520
<v Speaker 1>horrible chaos monster that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave birth to them.</v>

1355
01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:21.970
<v Speaker 1>That's time at and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these gods,</v>

1356
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:26.971
<v Speaker 1>they know that singly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll just plow them to nothing,</v>

1357
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.863
<v Speaker 1>so they're all freaking out about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then at one point a new God gets </v>

1358
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:33.124
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is Martin and he's kind of an </v>

1359
01:14:34.991 --> 01:14:35.824
<v Speaker 1>interest in God because he could speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>magic words and his eyes all the way </v>

1360
01:14:38.651 --> 01:14:39.484
<v Speaker 1>around his head so they send out a god </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then to go after time out </v>

1361
01:14:44.150 --> 01:14:44.983
<v Speaker 1>because she's angry with them for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>making too much racket essentially and </v>

1362
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:48.430
<v Speaker 1>killing her husband.</v>

1363
01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not a very good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're careless.</v>

1364
01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:52.083
<v Speaker 1>They're like two year olds really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they throw out a god now and then to </v>

1365
01:14:56.081 --> 01:14:58.120
<v Speaker 1>go fight time out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she just wants them.</v>

1366
01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:01.070
<v Speaker 1>There's not even any contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

1367
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:04.240
<v Speaker 1>this martyr is born in Negros up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty impressed with him.</v>

1368
01:15:04.241 --> 01:15:05.920
<v Speaker 1>So they asked him one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1369
01:15:05.921 --> 01:15:07.660
<v Speaker 1>how would you like to go out and fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>time at?</v>

1370
01:15:07.661 --> 01:15:10.030
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's not too thrilled about that,</v>

1371
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.620
<v Speaker 1>but he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1372
01:15:11.621 --> 01:15:12.311
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

1373
01:15:12.311 --> 01:15:14.500
<v Speaker 1>But here's the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call a council.</v>

1374
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.870
<v Speaker 1>You put me in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm top God.</v>

1375
01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.720
<v Speaker 1>And that means from here on in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I determined destiny,</v>

1376
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:24.580
<v Speaker 1>so he's the thing that determines the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the future's going to unfold and you</v>

1377
01:15:24.581 --> 01:15:25.870
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not that happy about that,</v>

1378
01:15:25.871 --> 01:15:26.704
<v Speaker 1>but they arranged them into a hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they put them on top and then he </v>

1379
01:15:29.711 --> 01:15:32.200
<v Speaker 1>goes out and he catches tie matt into </v>
<v Speaker 1>net.</v>

1380
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:34.780
<v Speaker 1>So we conceptualize as her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

1381
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:37.900
<v Speaker 1>counselor into pieces makes the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of her.</v>

1382
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:39.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what a human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

1383
01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Pays attention to where the chaos is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encapsulates it,</v>

1384
01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:45.700
<v Speaker 1>cuts it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the world.</v>

1385
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.880
<v Speaker 1>One of his names was actually he who </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes ingenious things out of the combat</v>

1386
01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:54.280
<v Speaker 1>with ty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt was actually like a literal name of</v>

1387
01:15:54.281 --> 01:15:55.114
<v Speaker 1>Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Mesopotamian emperor had to </v>

1388
01:15:57.791 --> 01:15:58.624
<v Speaker 1>imitate Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to the degree that he had </v>

1389
01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:03.010
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason he had sovereignty was he,</v>

1390
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>he was a Martech and then he could be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good martech or a bad mark.</v>

1391
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:11.590
<v Speaker 1>So at the New Year's festival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd take the king outside the city.</v>

1392
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:12.453
<v Speaker 1>So that's out into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd strip him of his kingly clothes </v>

1393
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:16.083
<v Speaker 1>and then they'd make them kneel and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to confess to all the ways that </v>

1394
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.520
<v Speaker 1>year he hadn't been a very good martech.</v>

1395
01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:23.410
<v Speaker 1>They'd actually hit him with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

1396
01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.393
<v Speaker 1>Then he had to confess while I wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good mark this way or that way and you </v>

1397
01:16:27.001 --> 01:16:28.960
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it got all his sins out in the open.</v>

1398
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Then they had a big ceremony with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the statues of the gods.</v>

1399
01:16:33.821 --> 01:16:38.190
<v Speaker 1>They replayed the battle between Marta </v>
<v Speaker 1>can tie a math and then they.</v>

1400
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:40.930
<v Speaker 1>There was some other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to which I won't get into,</v>

1401
01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.093
<v Speaker 1>but then the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they went back inside and the new </v>

1402
01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:48.400
<v Speaker 1>year was renewed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they acted out the the eternal battle</v>

1403
01:16:48.401 --> 01:16:53.401
<v Speaker 1>between attention say and embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>detention and chaos,</v>

1404
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:57.430
<v Speaker 1>and they realized that reverence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the was the,</v>

1405
01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:01.990
<v Speaker 1>was the basis for valid authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>valid authority,</v>

1406
01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:05.920
<v Speaker 1>and the king had a moral obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act in that manner.</v>

1407
01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 1>That's why he got two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became like brilliant.</v>

1408
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1409
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.551
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1410
01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:14.840
<v Speaker 2>are they conscious of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're conscious enough to act it out,</v>

1411
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's as conscious as they were,</v>

1412
01:17:17.991 --> 01:17:18.824
<v Speaker 2>they could use their bodies and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>collective as a representational </v>

1413
01:17:22.731 --> 01:17:25.040
<v Speaker 2>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they couldn't,</v>

1414
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:26.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they could tell stories about </v>

1415
01:17:26.721 --> 01:17:27.554
<v Speaker 2>it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as deriving out what that </v>

1416
01:17:29.991 --> 01:17:34.460
<v Speaker 2>meant philosophically and in a fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulated way,</v>

1417
01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1418
01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:36.463
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't do that,</v>

1419
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.260
<v Speaker 3>which is fascinating for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what that does,</v>

1420
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:41.990
<v Speaker 3>at least in my interpretation of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying,</v>

1421
01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.940
<v Speaker 3>is that religious systems that are often</v>
<v Speaker 3>derided by,</v>

1422
01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:49.550
<v Speaker 3>let's say a mentor post enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinkers for their,</v>

1423
01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.433
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for axioms that are just not true or </v>

1424
01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.290
<v Speaker 3>false about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1425
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:57.380
<v Speaker 3>That's religious superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's clearly wrong.</v>

1426
01:17:57.790 --> 01:18:00.820
<v Speaker 3>It's backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're saying is they were there,</v>

1427
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.173
<v Speaker 3>they were and are very much true in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that they are almost preconscious </v>

1428
01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:12.440
<v Speaker 3>representations of correct action</v>

1429
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.580
<v Speaker 2>and the environment in which correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>action takes place,</v>

1430
01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:17.710
<v Speaker 2>which is fundamentally the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

1431
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't contend with protons and Adams,</v>

1432
01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:28.480
<v Speaker 2>we contend mostly with other people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree we contend with nature,</v>

1433
01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nature is sort of outside our proper</v>

1434
01:18:31.721 --> 01:18:33.000
<v Speaker 2>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1435
01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:33.843
<v Speaker 2>That's partly why that idea infuses </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalism or it's like we've got </v>

1436
01:18:37.210 --> 01:18:39.250
<v Speaker 2>environmental ism is mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1437
01:18:39.251 --> 01:18:42.280
<v Speaker 2>To the core.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like pure mother nature.</v>

1438
01:18:42.281 --> 01:18:43.930
<v Speaker 2>She's a virgin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1439
01:18:43.931 --> 01:18:47.980
<v Speaker 2>And she's being raped by the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>father and the son,</v>

1440
01:18:47.981 --> 01:18:49.540
<v Speaker 2>his evil sons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1441
01:18:49.541 --> 01:18:50.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1442
01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:50.973
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about the good father and his </v>

1443
01:18:52.301 --> 01:18:56.150
<v Speaker 2>good sons and cancer and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1444
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:57.913
<v Speaker 2>well there was this horrible worm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa that used to burrow inside </v>

1445
01:19:00.371 --> 01:19:01.900
<v Speaker 2>people's skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1446
01:19:01.901 --> 01:19:03.950
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was just eradicated day.</v>

1447
01:19:03.951 --> 01:19:07.600
<v Speaker 2>So some doctor took it upon himself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of that worm.</v>

1448
01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.441
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1449
01:19:08.441 --> 01:19:10.150
<v Speaker 2>well that's mother nature to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1450
01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:14.140
<v Speaker 2>So Environmental Islam is an ideology </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it only tells half the story.</v>

1451
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Of course people are patients and </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>

1452
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:17.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mother Nature is beautiful and </v>

1453
01:19:18.581 --> 01:19:19.391
<v Speaker 2>virginal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1454
01:19:19.391 --> 01:19:20.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1455
01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:25.050
<v Speaker 2>but she's also an absolute terror and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you better be thankful for the fact that</v>

1456
01:19:25.661 --> 01:19:30.160
<v Speaker 2>you have a roof over your head and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody isn't an adversarial rapist.</v>

1457
01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.233
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better balance out the story a </v>

1458
01:19:32.291 --> 01:19:33.850
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1459
01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:34.773
<v Speaker 2>the stories tell you how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also tell you what the </v>

1460
01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:40.180
<v Speaker 2>environment is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1461
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:45.990
<v Speaker 2>not environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tell you how to conceptualize.</v>

1462
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:48.970
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They modeled the nature of being.</v>

1463
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.340
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way of thinking about an</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual b,</v>

1464
01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:52.413
<v Speaker 2>and in being is the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you act in relationship to the </v>

1465
01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:56.950
<v Speaker 2>social world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you.</v>

1466
01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that what you're saying?</v>

1467
01:20:01.581 --> 01:20:02.414
<v Speaker 3>Is isn't that different mythologies at </v>
<v Speaker 3>different points in time will tell you </v>

1468
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.373
<v Speaker 3>how to act under particular conditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which that and wish that society </v>

1469
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:12.683
<v Speaker 3>developed?</v>

1470
01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:13.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1471
01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:14.800
<v Speaker 1>It's broader than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's broad.</v>

1472
01:20:14.801 --> 01:20:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It's broad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1473
01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:17.740
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understood once who said,</v>

1474
01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:19.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if these archetypes are true,</v>

1475
01:20:19.901 --> 01:20:22.660
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just tell the architectural</v>
<v Speaker 1>story over and over,</v>

1476
01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.720
<v Speaker 1>why do we need like literature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

1477
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:26.980
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good question.</v>

1478
01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.870
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1479
01:20:28.871 --> 01:20:32.110
<v Speaker 1>for much of human history we just told </v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetypal story over and over.</v>

1480
01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:33.363
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1481
01:20:33.610 --> 01:20:34.443
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is why I think that there's </v>

1482
01:20:37.181 --> 01:20:40.410
<v Speaker 1>three persons in the Christian Trinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's,</v>

1483
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:42.730
<v Speaker 1>there's the Holy Ghost will just forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him for a minute,</v>

1484
01:20:42.731 --> 01:20:45.130
<v Speaker 1>but there's God the father that needs no</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>

1485
01:20:45.131 --> 01:20:45.700
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1486
01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>the benevolent element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolent.</v>

1487
01:20:48.130 --> 01:20:51.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the great father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the sun.</v>

1488
01:20:51.011 --> 01:20:52.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1489
01:20:52.541 --> 01:20:53.374
<v Speaker 1>But the hero is weird because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of logos hero that's been </v>

1490
01:20:57.011 --> 01:20:58.980
<v Speaker 1>there since the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's logos,</v>

1491
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the word.</v>

1492
01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.170
<v Speaker 1>And then there's Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the carpenter,</v>

1493
01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.270
<v Speaker 1>he's this guy that lived in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1494
01:21:04.271 --> 01:21:09.271
<v Speaker 1>some little bitty irrelevant village </v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 years ago and died young.</v>

1495
01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:11.133
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's because the universal isn't </v>

1496
01:21:14.351 --> 01:21:18.050
<v Speaker 1>real until it's been made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particular and what we are.</v>

1497
01:21:18.051 --> 01:21:18.884
<v Speaker 1>Our particular manifestations of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal and the particular and the </v>

1498
01:21:22.001 --> 01:21:25.900
<v Speaker 1>universal are both important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the general pattern is crucial,</v>

1499
01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:28.970
<v Speaker 1>but so are the details.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1500
01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:31.930
<v Speaker 1>so the archetype is a general pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1501
01:21:31.931 --> 01:21:32.764
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your religious task in a sense </v>

1502
01:21:35.411 --> 01:21:40.240
<v Speaker 1>is to figure out how to embody the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype in actual time and space.</v>

1503
01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:41.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's a pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1504
01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:42.723
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have to fill in the details </v>

1505
01:21:44.651 --> 01:21:46.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's not like the details are </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>

1506
01:21:46.841 --> 01:21:47.674
<v Speaker 1>They're really irrelevant details </v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally and temporarily specific in </v>

1507
01:21:50.941 --> 01:21:51.551
<v Speaker 1>some cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1508
01:21:51.551 --> 01:21:52.500
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1509
01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that's why we have Christ in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Christian tradition,</v>

1510
01:21:56.261 --> 01:21:57.820
<v Speaker 3>but we have put in the Buddhist </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition,</v>

1511
01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:58.893
<v Speaker 3>the Hindu tradition has its own plethora</v>
<v Speaker 3>with its own embodiments of universal </v>

1512
01:22:03.371 --> 01:22:05.780
<v Speaker 3>truth versus individual app.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1513
01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:07.053
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the va case you make for the </v>

1514
01:22:09.641 --> 01:22:10.474
<v Speaker 3>power of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say the Christian archetype </v>

1515
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.210
<v Speaker 3>narrative is most familiar to us in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>West,</v>

1516
01:22:13.211 --> 01:22:15.580
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Georgia or otherwise</v>

1517
01:22:16.190 --> 01:22:19.840
<v Speaker 1>or while I also think that Christianity </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the best,</v>

1518
01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.530
<v Speaker 1>the most thoroughly developed philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of evil.</v>

1519
01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:27.820
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's a big advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1520
01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1521
01:22:29.081 --> 01:22:29.914
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you think about religions as </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part variations of hero </v>

1522
01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:35.110
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they are in part,</v>

1523
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.180
<v Speaker 1>then it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a story that can be told a thousand</v>

1524
01:22:40.181 --> 01:22:41.680
<v Speaker 1>times in a thousand ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1525
01:22:41.681 --> 01:22:43.870
<v Speaker 1>that's what a movie is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's an adventure movie,</v>

1526
01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:46.090
<v Speaker 1>it's always a hero myth of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1527
01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:47.253
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones we have now are almost </v>

1528
01:22:48.761 --> 01:22:51.730
<v Speaker 1>purely archetipal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the superhero movies,</v>

1529
01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:53.920
<v Speaker 1>those are architectural right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>core.</v>

1530
01:22:54.490 --> 01:22:55.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny because I know a comic </v>

1531
01:22:56.741 --> 01:22:57.574
<v Speaker 1>book artists or author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he writes Batman and Wolverine and </v>

1532
01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a community that the</v>

1533
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:10.660
<v Speaker 2>comic figure serves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it's Batman and you're writing for</v>

1534
01:23:10.661 --> 01:23:11.494
<v Speaker 2>Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't just get to do anything with </v>

1535
01:23:13.061 --> 01:23:13.894
<v Speaker 2>Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are Batman rules and the whole </v>

1536
01:23:15.821 --> 01:23:18.400
<v Speaker 2>community of Batman fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know the rules.</v>

1537
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.160
<v Speaker 2>And so if you muck about with Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they tell you.</v>

1538
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:25.900
<v Speaker 2>So Batman is actually an archetype </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been generated by the collective.</v>

1539
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they all feel,</v>

1540
01:23:27.971 --> 01:23:29.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not quite right.</v>

1541
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1542
01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:33.550
<v Speaker 2>why do you feel that the story isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite right?</v>

1543
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer to that,</v>

1544
01:23:34.721 --> 01:23:37.390
<v Speaker 2>it's like a platonic answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the story.</v>

1545
01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.310
<v Speaker 2>You just don't know that you know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

1546
01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.740
<v Speaker 2>And so when someone tells you the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

1547
01:23:41.741 --> 01:23:42.371
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1548
01:23:42.371 --> 01:23:45.730
<v Speaker 2>that's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like lock in lock key and lock,</v>

1549
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:48.750
<v Speaker 2>which is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is your argument bend?</v>

1550
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:52.970
<v Speaker 2>We know it's right when we see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so ancient and.</v>

1551
01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1552
01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1553
01:23:57.131 --> 01:23:58.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's.</v>

1554
01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Piaget had this idea of a equilibration </v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1555
01:24:03.251 --> 01:24:05.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a smart idea because piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know this or not,</v>

1556
01:24:05.951 --> 01:24:06.784
<v Speaker 2>but the motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piaget's motivation was to bridge the </v>

1557
01:24:09.551 --> 01:24:10.384
<v Speaker 2>gap between science and religion and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had very intense messianic experiences </v>

1558
01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:14.860
<v Speaker 2>when he was a young man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:24:14.861 --> 01:24:15.694
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no one ever teaches that about </v>

1560
01:24:16.391 --> 01:24:17.224
<v Speaker 2>piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piaget is way more interesting than you </v>

1561
01:24:18.731 --> 01:24:19.564
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The FDA was very interested in the </v>

1562
01:24:20.591 --> 01:24:21.424
<v Speaker 2>origin of morality and he traced the </v>
<v Speaker 2>origin morality back in some sense to </v>

1563
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:30.160
<v Speaker 2>the rules that govern social </v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions.</v>

1564
01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can think.</v>

1565
01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.053
<v Speaker 2>Piaget thought it really got going once </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids were able to play games with each </v>

1566
01:24:38.111 --> 01:24:40.430
<v Speaker 2>other that had a shared goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1567
01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:42.670
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of Piaget's definition </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a gate.</v>

1568
01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:43.913
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperating and competing in </v>

1569
01:24:47.171 --> 01:24:49.660
<v Speaker 2>relationship to a mutually agreed upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>

1570
01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:51.550
<v Speaker 2>So like a monopoly game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1571
01:24:51.551 --> 01:24:53.290
<v Speaker 2>you want to get all the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like why?</v>

1572
01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Because everyone agrees that that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing,</v>

1573
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:58.960
<v Speaker 2>so it's like that's an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>

1574
01:24:58.961 --> 01:25:01.720
<v Speaker 2>We just whipped it up on the fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the top value,</v>

1575
01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:02.913
<v Speaker 2>we'll play it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then we're playing with his kind of </v>

1576
01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:05.470
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1577
01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:09.420
<v Speaker 2>You get all sorts of information about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people doing that and you also know,</v>

1578
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:10.423
<v Speaker 2>clue yourself into the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies in the way that </v>

1579
01:25:14.351 --> 01:25:16.510
<v Speaker 2>they can be constructed even somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrarily.</v>

1580
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:17.763
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what piaget noted was that children </v>

1581
01:25:19.961 --> 01:25:24.961
<v Speaker 2>could play together and they could get </v>
<v Speaker 2>along and they could pursue the goal,</v>

1582
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:28.780
<v Speaker 2>but if you took them out when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>

1583
01:25:28.781 --> 01:25:31.150
<v Speaker 2>out of the context and you ask them what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules were,</v>

1584
01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:32.283
<v Speaker 2>well they didn't know because the rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>were actually the behavioral patterns </v>

1585
01:25:36.011 --> 01:25:37.390
<v Speaker 2>that all the kids had agreed upon.</v>

1586
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:38.890
<v Speaker 2>One way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

1587
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.220
<v Speaker 2>They didn't sit down and codify the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and then act them out.</v>

1588
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.290
<v Speaker 2>They acted out a coherent action </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern,</v>

1589
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:52.960
<v Speaker 2>and then when polled from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't articulate it.</v>

1590
01:25:53.170 --> 01:25:56.350
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't the level at which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge was embodied.</v>

1591
01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1592
01:25:57.810 --> 01:26:00.400
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what happened to us </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the course of history.</v>

1593
01:26:00.401 --> 01:26:05.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like we learned to act before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned the rules for how we acted.</v>

1594
01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.090
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the opposite of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rationalist perspective,</v>

1595
01:26:08.091 --> 01:26:08.924
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nature was the first person to </v>

1596
01:26:10.281 --> 01:26:11.760
<v Speaker 2>really point this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1597
01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.840
<v Speaker 2>he said that a philosophical of </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy is the unconscious confession</v>

1598
01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:17.804
<v Speaker 2>of a philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in here you can think about this in </v>

1599
01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:25.571
<v Speaker 2>terms of of the story of Moses to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Moses realizes the rules,</v>

1600
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:26.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because God gives them to him.</v>

1601
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before Moses gets the rules,</v>

1602
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:35.110
<v Speaker 2>he spends like years in the desert as </v>
<v Speaker 2>judge,</v>

1603
01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:36.973
<v Speaker 2>like all the Israelites who were always </v>
<v Speaker 2>scrapping with each other that get into </v>

1604
01:26:39.321 --> 01:26:40.370
<v Speaker 2>a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come to him and say,</v>

1605
01:26:40.371 --> 01:26:41.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's right here?</v>

1606
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:46.490
<v Speaker 2>And he's doing like all day for years </v>
<v Speaker 2>adjudicating.</v>

1607
01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.100
<v Speaker 2>So his mind is assembling all of these</v>

1608
01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.720
<v Speaker 2>instances of moral conflict and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't recognize patterns.</v>

1609
01:26:58.170 --> 01:26:59.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day it's like it's a blinding flash </v>

1610
01:27:00.421 --> 01:27:01.440
<v Speaker 2>of illumination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1611
01:27:01.441 --> 01:27:02.274
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the rules that we're </v>

1612
01:27:04.291 --> 01:27:05.124
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the translation of the behavioral </v>

1613
01:27:06.631 --> 01:27:07.464
<v Speaker 2>knowledge into abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you know Moses is a composite </v>

1614
01:27:10.321 --> 01:27:11.154
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there are many stories about </v>

1615
01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.530
<v Speaker 2>the original law giver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the original law giver,</v>

1616
01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:21.710
<v Speaker 2>it's the original law observer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're our own wolf pack.</v>

1617
01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.633
<v Speaker 2>We're we're an anthropologist or or </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnologist and wolf pack at the same </v>

1618
01:27:26.221 --> 01:27:27.150
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1619
01:27:27.151 --> 01:27:31.620
<v Speaker 2>here we are doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing while we watch?</v>

1620
01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.290
<v Speaker 2>And we make stories out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what we seem to be doing.</v>

1621
01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.260
<v Speaker 2>What are the stories mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what they seem to mean.</v>

1622
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are.</v>

1623
01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:38.753
<v Speaker 2>Those are those rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're articulated descriptions of </v>

1624
01:27:41.701 --> 01:27:44.250
<v Speaker 2>behavioral patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must be following them.</v>

1625
01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now we're following them because we</v>

1626
01:27:46.501 --> 01:27:47.430
<v Speaker 2>know what the rules are.</v>

1627
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Before we were just acting out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent embodied pattern.</v>

1628
01:27:52.710 --> 01:27:53.491
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1629
01:27:53.491 --> 01:27:56.760
<v Speaker 2>the like the conspiracy theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1630
01:27:56.761 --> 01:27:57.780
<v Speaker 2>the people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1631
01:27:57.781 --> 01:27:58.614
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all about control by the upper </v>

1632
01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:00.474
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they assume that you can just </v>

1633
01:28:02.191 --> 01:28:03.024
<v Speaker 2>generate up some arbitrary rules that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to serve you and then enforce </v>

1634
01:28:05.761 --> 01:28:06.780
<v Speaker 2>them on a community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1635
01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1636
01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:12.350
<v Speaker 2>partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fundamentally no.</v>

1637
01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that,</v>

1638
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:16.350
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not biological thinking.</v>

1639
01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:17.653
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's dawn of the industrial age </v>

1640
01:28:19.411 --> 01:28:22.200
<v Speaker 2>thinking or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or post agricultural thinking.</v>

1641
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Who cares about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1642
01:28:24.251 --> 01:28:25.084
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to when we lived in trees </v>

1643
01:28:26.611 --> 01:28:27.444
<v Speaker 2>will go back 60 million years and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about who we are from that </v>

1644
01:28:31.741 --> 01:28:35.100
<v Speaker 2>perspective and that's just the start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're older than that,</v>

1645
01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:37.830
<v Speaker 2>so it just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too.</v>

1646
01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:43.280
<v Speaker 2>It's way too narrow a view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not informed by biological reality.</v>

1647
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:48.150
<v Speaker 3>When you mentioned the Moses story as </v>
<v Speaker 3>logged giver versus Law Observer,</v>

1648
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:49.583
<v Speaker 3>and then I was thinking of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>biblical story of where God speaks to </v>

1649
01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:53.994
<v Speaker 3>Moses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then my introductions are my inner </v>

1650
01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.160
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1651
01:28:59.161 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 3>all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why do you this ridiculous</v>

1652
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:06.360
<v Speaker 2>sky figure who is a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominance hierarchy?</v>

1653
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:08.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1654
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.430
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay that.</v>

1655
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1656
01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Agency detection module.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1657
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.740
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a stupid way to conceptualize it.</v>

1658
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:20.833
<v Speaker 2>It is not an agency detection module.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not some little gadget that stuck </v>

1659
01:29:24.871 --> 01:29:26.880
<v Speaker 2>to a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really deep.</v>

1660
01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's think about who we are.</v>

1661
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do we live in a dominance?</v>

1662
01:29:31.921 --> 01:29:32.754
<v Speaker 2>Herc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's a permanent element of the </v>

1663
01:29:34.081 --> 01:29:37.170
<v Speaker 2>dominant Turkey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dominance hierarchy.</v>

1664
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.000
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1665
01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:42.810
<v Speaker 2>males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>females and you.</v>

1666
01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:44.363
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to say what's the world </v>

1667
01:29:45.751 --> 01:29:48.510
<v Speaker 2>made out of males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>females,</v>

1668
01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:52.290
<v Speaker 2>and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is the world made out of that?</v>

1669
01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Because no matter where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter when,</v>

1670
01:29:55.410 --> 01:29:59.670
<v Speaker 2>no matter how far back in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are things you can rely on.</v>

1671
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.710
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we have this circuit,</v>

1672
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.940
<v Speaker 2>it's the brain.</v>

1673
01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:03.871
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1674
01:30:03.871 --> 01:30:04.704
<v Speaker 2>what are males like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are females like and what are we </v>

1675
01:30:07.531 --> 01:30:10.170
<v Speaker 2>like and how do we interact?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1676
01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:12.510
<v Speaker 2>so there you get the constituent </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of reality.</v>

1677
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:14.190
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just social,</v>

1678
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.113
<v Speaker 2>but it's complex because the males are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just singular figures like the father </v>

1679
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:20.783
<v Speaker 2>isn't an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The father is the whole patriarchal </v>

1680
01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:25.710
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1681
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:28.560
<v Speaker 2>The individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a representation of that.</v>

1682
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:33.800
<v Speaker 2>So our minds are more evolved to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider masculinity as such rather than</v>

1683
01:30:34.111 --> 01:30:34.944
<v Speaker 2>the male individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would say of Freud's problem </v>

1684
01:30:38.731 --> 01:30:42.030
<v Speaker 2>patients that they confuse their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>fathers with the masculine.</v>

1685
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:44.940
<v Speaker 2>The masculine is like a God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>

1686
01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:45.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a god?</v>

1687
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.591
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1688
01:30:46.591 --> 01:30:49.950
<v Speaker 2>it shapes your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It determines your destiny.</v>

1689
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.650
<v Speaker 2>It determines your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fitness.</v>

1690
01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Is it alive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

1691
01:30:56.670 --> 01:31:00.780
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how you describe alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

1692
01:31:00.781 --> 01:31:03.060
<v Speaker 2>so we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got this system that can recognize</v>

1693
01:31:03.061 --> 01:31:06.870
<v Speaker 2>like the masculine living thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminine living thing,</v>

1694
01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:08.670
<v Speaker 2>the self living thing.</v>

1695
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the underlying priest sobbed</v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions of our nervous system.</v>

1696
01:31:14.371 --> 01:31:16.650
<v Speaker 2>That's the world of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1697
01:31:16.651 --> 01:31:21.210
<v Speaker 2>At some point our cortex inflates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we can use abstraction,</v>

1698
01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.390
<v Speaker 2>but you know that evolution is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative process.</v>

1699
01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:27.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't just build a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call,</v>

1700
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:28.583
<v Speaker 2>you build a new thing on an old thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the new thing still thinks like </v>

1701
01:31:31.891 --> 01:31:34.080
<v Speaker 2>the old thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can do some more things.</v>

1702
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what's happened,</v>

1703
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:37.103
<v Speaker 2>what's happened to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that's amazing to </v>

1704
01:31:39.331 --> 01:31:40.164
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we've taken these basic social </v>

1705
01:31:41.671 --> 01:31:42.504
<v Speaker 2>cognitive categories and we've been able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to map being itself using the same </v>

1706
01:31:47.551 --> 01:31:49.380
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it works.</v>

1707
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:53.400
<v Speaker 2>You've mapped the masculine onto the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy.</v>

1708
01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Umass Mac map the feminine onto nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that works.</v>

1709
01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:01.090
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can,</v>

1710
01:32:01.091 --> 01:32:03.010
<v Speaker 2>you can survive like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think,</v>

1711
01:32:03.011 --> 01:32:04.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a metaphor?</v>

1712
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:05.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1713
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:07.750
<v Speaker 2>it's not a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example,</v>

1714
01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.320
<v Speaker 2>why is mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mother Nature?</v>

1715
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:14.340
<v Speaker 2>What's nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1716
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:19.350
<v Speaker 2>nature is that which selects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's as far as I can tell you Carl.</v>

1717
01:32:19.670 --> 01:32:21.520
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to define nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nature.</v>

1718
01:32:21.521 --> 01:32:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Select women select.</v>

1719
01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what women do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

1720
01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Human women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not like chimps.</v>

1721
01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.353
<v Speaker 2>They're selective maters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as far as men are concerned that </v>

1722
01:32:33.761 --> 01:32:35.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe as far as women are concerned to </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

1723
01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:37.860
<v Speaker 2>our nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a metaphor.</v>

1724
01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:39.683
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that stops you from </v>

1725
01:32:41.821 --> 01:32:43.470
<v Speaker 2>reproducing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1726
01:32:43.710 --> 01:32:45.540
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly why they make you self</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>

1727
01:32:45.541 --> 01:32:46.374
<v Speaker 2>When you rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they're the portal to </v>

1728
01:32:48.631 --> 01:32:50.730
<v Speaker 2>immortality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of looking at it.</v>

1729
01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:54.060
<v Speaker 2>They are nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they represented.</v>

1730
01:32:54.210 --> 01:32:57.330
<v Speaker 2>They are nature in the most direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible way.</v>

1731
01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.630
<v Speaker 2>So like is that a right way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the world?</v>

1732
01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Too difficult to make an alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>case?</v>

1733
01:33:03.901 --> 01:33:05.730
<v Speaker 2>If you think from a Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

1734
01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:06.593
<v Speaker 2>now there's a metaphorical element to it</v>
<v Speaker 2>too because you can also projected on </v>

1735
01:33:09.930 --> 01:33:13.380
<v Speaker 2>that which lies outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy,</v>

1736
01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:14.513
<v Speaker 2>which is also white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women get in trouble with men sometimes </v>

1737
01:33:16.111 --> 01:33:18.840
<v Speaker 2>because men can easily get confused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1738
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.943
<v Speaker 2>It's easy for women to be the chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that doesn't fit in the hierarchy </v>

1739
01:33:22.801 --> 01:33:24.300
<v Speaker 2>and women are always complaining about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1740
01:33:24.301 --> 01:33:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and as they should,</v>

1741
01:33:26.071 --> 01:33:30.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's happened for,</v>

1742
01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:31.043
<v Speaker 2>for better or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we've been able to take that </v>

1743
01:33:32.731 --> 01:33:33.564
<v Speaker 2>initial social cognitive architecture to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build a system of abstraction on top of </v>

1744
01:33:37.591 --> 01:33:42.591
<v Speaker 2>that to use the same basic categories to</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain how to behave and it worked.</v>

1745
01:33:43.170 --> 01:33:46.770
<v Speaker 2>So it's mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mind boggling to me that,</v>

1746
01:33:46.771 --> 01:33:47.604
<v Speaker 2>that works.</v>

1747
01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.500
<v Speaker 3>So are you familiar with the theories of</v>
<v Speaker 3>embodied cognition and like,</v>

1748
01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:56.501
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like George Lake off in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his metaphor theory of thought.</v>

1749
01:33:58.410 --> 01:33:59.243
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're saying is the same </v>

1750
01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:01.581
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1751
01:34:01.581 --> 01:34:02.414
<v Speaker 3>We have these categories that emerged </v>
<v Speaker 3>from our lived experience as humans in </v>

1752
01:34:06.651 --> 01:34:07.990
<v Speaker 3>our human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1753
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:08.781
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1754
01:34:08.781 --> 01:34:09.614
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because these are actually the only </v>

1755
01:34:11.061 --> 01:34:11.894
<v Speaker 3>tools we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we use them in recombination with each </v>

1756
01:34:15.801 --> 01:34:18.590
<v Speaker 3>other with themselves if nif necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>modification,</v>

1757
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:21.920
<v Speaker 3>but we use them as ways of making sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>

1758
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Even our scientific models are </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated on the,</v>

1759
01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.070
<v Speaker 3>the embodied experiences.</v>

1760
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a tough one.</v>

1761
01:34:28.530 --> 01:34:30.830
<v Speaker 2>That's a tougher one because I do think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's.</v>

1762
01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:35.690
<v Speaker 2>The science does have a qualitative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a qualitative difference.</v>

1763
01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.350
<v Speaker 2>It is in some sense stepping outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mythological framework,</v>

1764
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:40.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's because it's this really </v>

1765
01:34:41.961 --> 01:34:43.790
<v Speaker 2>powerful technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1766
01:34:43.791 --> 01:34:44.624
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the nature of our shared </v>

1767
01:34:46.401 --> 01:34:47.920
<v Speaker 2>experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's,</v>

1768
01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:48.793
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not exactly what science is </v>

1769
01:34:49.791 --> 01:34:50.624
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like if we behave in such and </v>

1770
01:34:52.631 --> 01:34:54.590
<v Speaker 2>such a way something will happen.</v>

1771
01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:00.020
<v Speaker 1>We're going to that from a subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

1772
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:04.520
<v Speaker 1>like a personal perspective let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happens if we get 100 people to</v>

1773
01:35:04.521 --> 01:35:05.354
<v Speaker 1>do that and they all observe the outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they all tell a story about it </v>

1774
01:35:09.711 --> 01:35:11.990
<v Speaker 1>and then we take what's common across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories.</v>

1775
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:13.123
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1776
01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:13.963
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1777
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:18.560
<v Speaker 1>well that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get a new way of describing things.</v>

1778
01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>

1779
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Well then you get back into the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what constitutes truth.</v>

1780
01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Is it useful that we also don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because we don't have the timeframe</v>

1781
01:35:33.681 --> 01:35:34.514
<v Speaker 1>across which to analyze it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're staking our survival on the </v>

1782
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:43.510
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that it's useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like there wouldn't be constant</v>

1783
01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:47.570
<v Speaker 1>bouts of apocalyptic thinking if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have our doubts about it.</v>

1784
01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:48.853
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly an anomaly in the </v>

1785
01:35:50.841 --> 01:35:53.300
<v Speaker 1>natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while no one,</v>

1786
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:54.163
<v Speaker 1>no other creature has science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they did perfectly well </v>

1787
01:35:56.331 --> 01:35:58.100
<v Speaker 1>without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe science is fatal.</v>

1788
01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean it could easily be fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1789
01:36:03.471 --> 01:36:03.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1790
01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:08.920
<v Speaker 1>and someone who's a scientist in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of ideological sense would say,</v>

1791
01:36:10.311 --> 01:36:11.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's fatal,</v>

1792
01:36:11.811 --> 01:36:13.190
<v Speaker 1>it was still true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1793
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:15.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you define truth.</v>

1794
01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're willing to say that fatal</v>
<v Speaker 1>is true,</v>

1795
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:23.143
<v Speaker 1>well then go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's a not a good </v>

1796
01:36:24.501 --> 01:36:25.334
<v Speaker 1>definition of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where are our disagreement </v>

1797
01:36:27.411 --> 01:36:28.244
<v Speaker 1>really lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have your definition now I have my </v>

1798
01:36:30.111 --> 01:36:32.870
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my definition is Darwinian.</v>

1799
01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:36.350
<v Speaker 1>So you have to contend with that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a scientist,</v>

1800
01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:37.573
<v Speaker 1>but you might dispute that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's not clear to me how you </v>

1801
01:36:40.101 --> 01:36:41.870
<v Speaker 1>would dispute that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1802
01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Well we've already run through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

1803
01:36:44.871 --> 01:36:46.730
<v Speaker 1>He'd gets tangled up at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1804
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:47.743
<v Speaker 1>and I also think part of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with strictly with the view that only </v>

1805
01:36:52.731 --> 01:36:53.564
<v Speaker 1>what is objective observable is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can have a science without </v>

1806
01:36:57.591 --> 01:37:00.470
<v Speaker 1>that presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say only what is,</v>

1807
01:37:00.650 --> 01:37:04.310
<v Speaker 1>what is objectively true is uniquely </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful and valuable,</v>

1808
01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:05.511
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1809
01:37:05.511 --> 01:37:08.120
<v Speaker 1>it's part of a bunch of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniquely useful.</v>

1810
01:37:08.130 --> 01:37:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Invaluable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's not discounted.</v>

1811
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It's also dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got to keep an eye on it.</v>

1812
01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:14.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big tool.</v>

1813
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's perfectly reasonable thing to do.</v>

1814
01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:19.213
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take the next step and you say only </v>

1815
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:23.000
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then I also think another way.</v>

1816
01:37:23.001 --> 01:37:24.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you claiming only that?</v>

1817
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:26.540
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1818
01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:29.420
<v Speaker 1>it's because I'm pursuing truth and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1819
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sure about that are you.</v>

1820
01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:34.280
<v Speaker 1>You actually think that like you're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1821
01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:35.173
<v Speaker 1>you're sure that you're on this pristine</v>
<v Speaker 1>path and all those other people who </v>

1822
01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:40.214
<v Speaker 1>aren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're diluted or there's something </v>

1823
01:37:41.901 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 1>wrong with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

1824
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:46.280
<v Speaker 1>you're on this pristine path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so sure of that.</v>

1825
01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1826
01:37:48.441 --> 01:37:53.441
<v Speaker 1>If you think that it's like all </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists are devoted to the truth,</v>

1827
01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:55.940
<v Speaker 1>what truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

1828
01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're devoted to the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrating that there's no meaning in</v>

1829
01:38:00.001 --> 01:38:02.970
<v Speaker 2>life so that they don't have to bear any</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral responsibility.</v>

1830
01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:04.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not that,</v>

1831
01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:06.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't think that.</v>

1832
01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:06.721
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1833
01:38:06.721 --> 01:38:07.554
<v Speaker 2>I'm a psychoanalyst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might think that because whenever </v>

1834
01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.300
<v Speaker 2>anybody says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe x,</v>

1835
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:13.223
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1836
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.080
<v Speaker 2>what does it allow you not to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for x.</v>

1837
01:38:19.081 --> 01:38:20.820
<v Speaker 2>What are you against?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1838
01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1839
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a catastrophe that the,</v>

1840
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:28.650
<v Speaker 2>the war between science and religion </v>
<v Speaker 2>blows the,</v>

1841
01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:29.753
<v Speaker 2>our capacity to believe in transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning it demolishes our ability to </v>

1842
01:38:33.271 --> 01:38:35.670
<v Speaker 2>believe in transcendent meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a catastrophe?</v>

1843
01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:36.553
<v Speaker 2>Sort of the Nietzschean viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't know if it's a </v>

1844
01:38:40.201 --> 01:38:42.030
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe because then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1845
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:46.650
<v Speaker 2>well under what conditions would you be </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated to accept that catastrophe?</v>

1846
01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say your life is meaningful,</v>

1847
01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:56.330
<v Speaker 2>but meaning comes at a price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The price is basically moral and part of</v>

1848
01:38:56.701 --> 01:38:59.250
<v Speaker 2>that moral price is truth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

1849
01:39:00.730 --> 01:39:02.710
<v Speaker 2>You have to bear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1850
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:03.341
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1851
01:39:03.341 --> 01:39:06.100
<v Speaker 2>you get meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we've got some work to do.</v>

1852
01:39:06.670 --> 01:39:08.770
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to regard your actions as </v>
<v Speaker 2>trivial.</v>

1853
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:09.783
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to rationalize your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your errors of speech as as casual and </v>

1854
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:16.390
<v Speaker 2>and a forgivable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that.</v>

1855
01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:20.050
<v Speaker 2>You get the whole burden that goes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning or you can say,</v>

1856
01:39:20.051 --> 01:39:21.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's meaningful.</v>

1857
01:39:21.250 --> 01:39:22.083
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dostoevsky figured this out a long time </v>

1858
01:39:23.471 --> 01:39:25.660
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's no god,</v>

1859
01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:28.690
<v Speaker 2>there's no moral values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is permitted.</v>

1860
01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:29.591
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1861
01:39:29.591 --> 01:39:33.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe your whole argument,</v>

1862
01:39:33.970 --> 01:39:34.803
<v Speaker 2>even though you don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that whole argument of which </v>

1863
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:43.090
<v Speaker 2>you're only a part of is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on the desire to demolish the</v>

1864
01:39:43.571 --> 01:39:47.650
<v Speaker 2>necessity for truth and responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you could say no.</v>

1865
01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:48.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1866
01:39:48.610 --> 01:39:49.443
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like science has always been </v>

1867
01:39:51.641 --> 01:39:55.030
<v Speaker 2>put to two purposes that we would regard</v>
<v Speaker 2>as ethical.</v>

1868
01:39:55.330 --> 01:39:57.070
<v Speaker 2>And then you also have to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1869
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:58.743
<v Speaker 2>what allows us to ask the question of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not sciences put the ethical </v>

1870
01:40:01.421 --> 01:40:04.540
<v Speaker 2>purposes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the framework for evaluation?</v>

1871
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:06.820
<v Speaker 2>What's not scientific?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1872
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:07.663
<v Speaker 2>does it exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soldier Nets and said something </v>

1873
01:40:11.111 --> 01:40:11.944
<v Speaker 2>interesting about the Nuremberg judgment</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he thought of that is like a </v>

1874
01:40:14.411 --> 01:40:17.190
<v Speaker 2>pinnacle event in the 20th century and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1875
01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand this because</v>

1876
01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:23.241
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1877
01:40:23.241 --> 01:40:24.074
<v Speaker 2>there was this Cartesian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they cart did </v>

1878
01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:27.013
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically was to try to doubt </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything until he found something he </v>

1879
01:40:28.851 --> 01:40:31.570
<v Speaker 2>couldn't doubt and what he couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the fact that he,</v>

1880
01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:34.130
<v Speaker 2>he thinks now that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a translation.</v>

1881
01:40:34.131 --> 01:40:37.310
<v Speaker 2>So I don't really know if he met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think whatever.</v>

1882
01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.730
<v Speaker 2>He had this process of radical doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1883
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I did that too before I wrote maps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>

1884
01:40:42.951 --> 01:40:44.660
<v Speaker 2>except I didn't know that descartes had </v>
<v Speaker 2>done it.</v>

1885
01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.240
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do,</v>

1886
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:48.290
<v Speaker 2>what do I actually believe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

1887
01:40:48.291 --> 01:40:53.291
<v Speaker 2>what's unassailably true for me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought pain pain's</v>

1888
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.930
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard.</v>

1889
01:40:55.931 --> 01:40:58.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't argue yourself out of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when it happens,</v>

1890
01:40:58.810 --> 01:40:59.650
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

1891
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.830
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjectivity,</v>

1892
01:41:01.831 --> 01:41:03.070
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming,</v>

1893
01:41:03.071 --> 01:41:05.530
<v Speaker 1>so who cares what you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I thought,</v>

1894
01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:10.531
<v Speaker 1>well the infliction of pain is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I thought well,</v>

1895
01:41:10.661 --> 01:41:15.520
<v Speaker 1>if and pain is pain is unpleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got that quality about it,</v>

1896
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:17.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1897
01:41:17.081 --> 01:41:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was good.</v>

1898
01:41:18.431 --> 01:41:19.264
<v Speaker 1>And then there was another process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>argumentation that led me to conclude </v>

1899
01:41:22.211 --> 01:41:23.044
<v Speaker 1>that what constitutes a evil was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infliction of unnecessary pain and for </v>

1900
01:41:29.081 --> 01:41:31.810
<v Speaker 1>me like so not only like if I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

1901
01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to inflict pain in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only damages whoever I'm inflicting,</v>

1902
01:41:35.710 --> 01:41:36.543
<v Speaker 1>it also damages me and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the shootings and the high </v>

1903
01:41:39.941 --> 01:41:40.774
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1904
01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:43.180
<v Speaker 1>why don't they just shoot themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with?</v>

1905
01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Why go to all the trouble?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1906
01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:47.013
<v Speaker 1>try answering that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should read some of the writings of </v>

1907
01:41:49.091 --> 01:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>the columbine killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1908
01:41:50.381 --> 01:41:52.360
<v Speaker 1>They'll make the hair on the back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your neck.</v>

1909
01:41:52.361 --> 01:41:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1910
01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:54.613
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot believe what those kids </v>

1911
01:41:56.201 --> 01:41:56.980
<v Speaker 1>wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1912
01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:01.450
<v Speaker 1>it's uncanny what they were thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly so.</v>

1913
01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're motivated by something.</v>

1914
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:04.720
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1915
01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.690
<v Speaker 1>while it's something say panic from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural perspective,</v>

1916
01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:09.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>

1917
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:10.183
<v Speaker 1>what ended up at the bottom of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>was it's wrong to inflict unnecessary </v>

1918
01:42:15.071 --> 01:42:16.490
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pain even that's,</v>

1919
01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:19.420
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't serve your own purposes.</v>

1920
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Even that's the Nuremberg judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally it's like there are things</v>

1921
01:42:24.161 --> 01:42:25.780
<v Speaker 1>that are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1922
01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:30.000
<v Speaker 1>are you going to accept that or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1923
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:34.600
<v Speaker 1>if you accept that there's a place you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and if you don't accept that there is</v>

1924
01:42:34.601 --> 01:42:35.434
<v Speaker 1>another place you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we already saw what happened when </v>

1925
01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:40.600
<v Speaker 1>people go to that place and so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1926
01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:44.500
<v Speaker 1>well that's irrelevant.</v>

1927
01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay the price for your belief.</v>

1928
01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:52.780
<v Speaker 1>So will other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for you know,</v>

1929
01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:53.643
<v Speaker 1>so that's why soldier and it's was at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least in part an admirer of the </v>

1930
01:42:55.841 --> 01:42:56.674
<v Speaker 1>Nuremberg judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there are things that are </v>

1931
01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:00.293
<v Speaker 1>archetypally evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to his escape from them </v>

1932
01:43:04.121 --> 01:43:04.954
<v Speaker 1>because of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to escape from them </v>

1933
01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.760
<v Speaker 1>because of the particulars of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1934
01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make a strong case that that's</v>

1935
01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.830
<v Speaker 1>victor talk and revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

1936
01:43:18.010 --> 01:43:18.843
<v Speaker 1>But when I wandered through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust literature and the literature </v>

1937
01:43:23.291 --> 01:43:28.291
<v Speaker 1>on the Japanese invasion of China and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the literature on the stalinists camps,</v>

1938
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.410
<v Speaker 1>that was sufficiently convincing for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1939
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:34.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not there.</v>

1940
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:38.650
<v Speaker 1>That's not the right place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a scientific judgment?</v>

1941
01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:43.510
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're judging from your own logic.</v>

1942
01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Interesting that your judgment is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on your existence as a human,</v>

1943
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>a dominance hierarchy,</v>

1944
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:53.173
<v Speaker 3>and that's what makes that judgment of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that this sort of behavior is </v>

1945
01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:57.620
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

1946
01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Because of the biological context almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1947
01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Which sure.</v>

1948
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:03.383
<v Speaker 1>Which is embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that because as an </v>

1949
01:44:07.621 --> 01:44:10.110
<v Speaker 1>individual I'm an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a human,</v>

1950
01:44:10.410 --> 01:44:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an individual at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm this unbelievably old thing.</v>

1951
01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:14.873
<v Speaker 1>I'm like as old as life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really old while there's the me in </v>

1952
01:44:19.081 --> 01:44:21.660
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this thing that was like,</v>

1953
01:44:21.690 --> 01:44:22.523
<v Speaker 1>come around in 1962,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's the deeper reality of this </v>

1954
01:44:26.401 --> 01:44:28.880
<v Speaker 1>thing that I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the.</v>

1955
01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:30.870
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the union itself.</v>

1956
01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:34.890
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has its nature.</v>

1957
01:44:35.490 --> 01:44:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It's the human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what good and evil are human terms.</v>

1958
01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:39.953
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now whether they refer to something </v>

1959
01:44:40.801 --> 01:44:43.290
<v Speaker 1>transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different question.</v>

1960
01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.153
<v Speaker 1>It is not a simple question because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what rural consciousness </v>

1961
01:44:47.101 --> 01:44:47.934
<v Speaker 1>plays in being so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the deepest strata of thought </v>

1962
01:44:53.941 --> 01:44:54.774
<v Speaker 1>that I've encountered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the case that the most real thing </v>

1963
01:44:57.930 --> 01:45:02.310
<v Speaker 1>is the eternal battle between good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil and I'm prone to believe that.</v>

1964
01:45:02.850 --> 01:45:07.100
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

1965
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:09.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated idea to,</v>

1966
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:10.833
<v Speaker 1>to the.</v>

1967
01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.513
<v Speaker 3>My inner list in my brain now is saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's a confusion of facts and </v>

1968
01:45:18.551 --> 01:45:19.410
<v Speaker 3>values,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>

1969
01:45:19.411 --> 01:45:20.244
<v Speaker 3>what I'm what I'm assuming that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would say back and correct me and tell </v>

1970
01:45:24.191 --> 01:45:28.030
<v Speaker 3>me what you would say back even as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a materialist scientist,</v>

1971
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:32.140
<v Speaker 3>you yourself are human participating in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this human drama.</v>

1972
01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.760
<v Speaker 3>You're better than one.</v>

1973
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:35.803
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1974
01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.820
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1975
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Objective reality,</v>

1976
01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:42.920
<v Speaker 1>mythologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1977
01:45:42.921 --> 01:45:45.860
<v Speaker 1>proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>

1978
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:48.740
<v Speaker 1>objective reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another proposition.</v>

1979
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:49.783
<v Speaker 1>That's my proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is way deeper than this </v>

1980
01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:57.950
<v Speaker 1>to its incomparably deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean this is deep.</v>

1981
01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:59.900
<v Speaker 1>It's deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1982
01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:04.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sterile and that's dangerous.</v>

1983
01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:08.000
<v Speaker 1>And then when you forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is embedded in which then you make</v>

1984
01:46:08.001 --> 01:46:09.290
<v Speaker 1>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1985
01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:11.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why not cross Ebola was smallpox.</v>

1986
01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

1987
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Why not do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1988
01:46:17.691 --> 01:46:19.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rationalist would say,</v>

1989
01:46:19.731 --> 01:46:20.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1990
01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm capable of making that judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1991
01:46:23.241 --> 01:46:24.074
<v Speaker 1>well let's really specify that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly do you mean that you're </v>

1992
01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:28.370
<v Speaker 1>capable of making that judgment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because again,</v>

1993
01:46:28.371 --> 01:46:31.250
<v Speaker 1>with Dawkins and his ilk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1994
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:34.700
<v Speaker 1>they make the claim that they can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their cake and eat it too,</v>

1995
01:46:34.730 --> 01:46:37.460
<v Speaker 1>is thinking of all the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating evolved morality,</v>

1996
01:46:37.461 --> 01:46:40.010
<v Speaker 1>which is basically a Judeo Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality in the West.</v>

1997
01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.660
<v Speaker 1>And they can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

1998
01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:44.390
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have to accept any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical presumptions.</v>

1999
01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like says who like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2000
01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you could be right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why would you assume that you are.</v>

2001
01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is niches point.</v>

2002
01:46:54.031 --> 01:46:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the metaphysical presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>are absolutely necessary.</v>

2003
01:46:58.100 --> 01:46:58.730
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2004
01:46:58.730 --> 01:46:59.563
<v Speaker 3>the question that is asked by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>millennia old individuals or cultures </v>

2005
01:47:05.421 --> 01:47:10.421
<v Speaker 3>that gave birth to them or reinterpreted</v>
<v Speaker 3>as as preconscious symbology.</v>

2006
01:47:11.690 --> 01:47:12.410
<v Speaker 3>You see what I'm saying?</v>

2007
01:47:12.410 --> 01:47:12.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2008
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:13.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>

2009
01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:15.430
<v Speaker 1>You have to specify that,</v>

2010
01:47:15.490 --> 01:47:17.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because then Dawkins might say,</v>

2011
01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:20.430
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I'll try not to pick on,</v>

2012
01:47:21.250 --> 01:47:26.250
<v Speaker 3>but then the materialist positivist </v>
<v Speaker 3>restrooms might say I'm okay,</v>

2013
01:47:27.701 --> 01:47:31.420
<v Speaker 3>but what does it mean to accept that </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythology or to accept the metaphysics?</v>

2014
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:34.570
<v Speaker 3>Does it mean that I have to believe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this omnipresent,</v>

2015
01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:36.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2016
01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:39.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sadistic God who,</v>

2017
01:47:39.181 --> 01:47:42.700
<v Speaker 3>who pits nations against each other and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and orders you to,</v>

2018
01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:43.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2019
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:48.010
<v Speaker 3>to murder your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your neighboring tribe or rather is</v>

2020
01:47:48.011 --> 01:47:48.844
<v Speaker 3>it necessary to accept that metal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those metaphysical to metaphysical </v>

2021
01:47:52.061 --> 01:47:53.890
<v Speaker 3>background with the substrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>

2022
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:57.060
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as understood now in,</v>

2023
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.903
<v Speaker 3>as I'm Persian symbolic imagery from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture that had no other means of </v>

2024
01:48:02.351 --> 01:48:06.130
<v Speaker 3>articulating it so that [inaudible] then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might say,</v>

2025
01:48:06.131 --> 01:48:06.521
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

2026
01:48:06.521 --> 01:48:07.354
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2027
01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:10.300
<v Speaker 3>I can accept that it had some value in </v>
<v Speaker 3>its time and place.</v>

2028
01:48:10.301 --> 01:48:11.470
<v Speaker 3>But so</v>

2029
01:48:11.710 --> 01:48:12.700
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>

2030
01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.180
<v Speaker 1>That's where I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the problem would start for</v>

2031
01:48:15.181 --> 01:48:17.520
<v Speaker 1>me still that time and place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2032
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:20.960
<v Speaker 1>you get this idea too that like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary psychologists do this.</v>

2033
01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our evolutionary,</v>

2034
01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.470
<v Speaker 1>where we evolved was the African Savanna</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2035
01:48:27.471 --> 01:48:29.810
<v Speaker 1>our moral systems are adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like why,</v>

2036
01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:30.921
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2037
01:48:30.921 --> 01:48:31.754
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not in the oceans 300 million years </v>

2038
01:48:33.951 --> 01:48:34.960
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2039
01:48:34.961 --> 01:48:35.794
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that the preferential place from </v>

2040
01:48:38.991 --> 01:48:41.840
<v Speaker 1>which our values are derived?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of it's just nothing.</v>

2041
01:48:42.130 --> 01:48:43.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

2042
01:48:43.431 --> 01:48:45.380
<v Speaker 1>That makes no sense to me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2043
01:48:45.381 --> 01:48:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you could say that's where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated from chimps.</v>

2044
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.951
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2045
01:48:48.951 --> 01:48:50.540
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not that different from chimps.</v>

2046
01:48:50.541 --> 01:48:52.790
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the chimps?</v>

2047
01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:54.830
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot to share,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot in common with us.</v>

2048
01:48:54.831 --> 01:48:57.020
<v Speaker 1>They didn't go through the SAVANNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2049
01:48:57.050 --> 01:49:01.280
<v Speaker 1>so the idea that these values say are </v>
<v Speaker 1>shallow.</v>

2050
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:02.143
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you put it in an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis and you go back to the African </v>

2051
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Savannah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's something.</v>

2052
01:49:06.501 --> 01:49:06.861
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2053
01:49:06.861 --> 01:49:07.694
<v Speaker 1>a few million years anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me that's still icing on the </v>

2054
01:49:10.881 --> 01:49:12.530
<v Speaker 1>cake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not deep enough.</v>

2055
01:49:12.531 --> 01:49:15.110
<v Speaker 1>This is way deeper now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The metaphysics.</v>

2056
01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's talk about the metaphysics.</v>

2057
01:49:17.570 --> 01:49:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's idea of God?</v>

2058
01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:19.843
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's got an old man with a </v>

2059
01:49:22.071 --> 01:49:24.620
<v Speaker 1>beard and he lives in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2060
01:49:24.621 --> 01:49:26.930
<v Speaker 1>well let's take that argument apart a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

2061
01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:27.891
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2062
01:49:27.891 --> 01:49:28.724
<v Speaker 1>the ancient Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't like you to say the name of </v>

2063
01:49:30.291 --> 01:49:31.370
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2064
01:49:31.610 --> 01:49:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Because they didn't want you to confuse </v>
<v Speaker 1>the representation with the phenomena,</v>

2065
01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:38.720
<v Speaker 1>so whatever was real for them was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something beyond words.</v>

2066
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:39.703
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing obtains with the Dow is </v>

2067
01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:46.310
<v Speaker 1>the same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2068
01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't make a image because</v>

2069
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 2>you confuse the damn image with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2070
01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:50.493
<v Speaker 2>What's the thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that which is beyond the imaging </v>

2071
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:56.650
<v Speaker 2>does that which beyond is beyond imaging</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist obviously.</v>

2072
01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:59.020
<v Speaker 2>What's its nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2073
01:49:59.021 --> 01:50:02.200
<v Speaker 2>that's a different question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in the Old Testament,</v>

2074
01:50:02.230 --> 01:50:04.960
<v Speaker 2>it's nature is arbitrary and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2075
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:07.390
<v Speaker 2>the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get swatted down.</v>

2076
01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:08.493
<v Speaker 2>But if you look carefully at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure of the Old Testament and </v>

2077
01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:14.470
<v Speaker 2>northrop Frye did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fries argument was basically this,</v>

2078
01:50:14.471 --> 01:50:15.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the really old stories.</v>

2079
01:50:15.881 --> 01:50:16.714
<v Speaker 2>Forget about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>History starts basically with Abraham </v>

2080
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:23.800
<v Speaker 2>was the old testament about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israelites climb up to dominance.</v>

2081
01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:24.783
<v Speaker 2>They get corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they forget about the widows and the </v>

2082
01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:27.190
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

2083
01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:29.410
<v Speaker 2>a prophet comes up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better look out.</v>

2084
01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:31.660
<v Speaker 2>You're off the path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ignore him.</v>

2085
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:34.960
<v Speaker 2>WHAP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in chaos for a long time.</v>

2086
01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:36.373
<v Speaker 2>They get all humble and they build </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves up again and when they get </v>

2087
01:50:39.161 --> 01:50:41.050
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get all corrupt and a prophet comes</v>

2088
01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:42.940
<v Speaker 2>along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better look out.</v>

2089
01:50:42.970 --> 01:50:43.803
<v Speaker 2>You're off the path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not paying attention to the </v>

2090
01:50:45.401 --> 01:50:48.130
<v Speaker 2>widows and the children and all hell's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna break loose,</v>

2091
01:50:48.131 --> 01:50:50.290
<v Speaker 2>like bang down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go six times,</v>

2092
01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:53.380
<v Speaker 2>six times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

2093
01:50:55.370 --> 01:50:59.930
<v Speaker 2>is that arbitrary or is that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right idea to derive from history?</v>

2094
01:50:59.931 --> 01:51:03.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like power corrupts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you make your kingdom,</v>

2095
01:51:03.291 --> 01:51:06.140
<v Speaker 2>you make your empire and it's serving </v>
<v Speaker 2>its proper purpose,</v>

2096
01:51:06.141 --> 01:51:09.290
<v Speaker 2>but you let it get corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are going to fall apart.</v>

2097
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:10.663
<v Speaker 2>So I can give you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what caused the flooding in </v>

2098
01:51:14.571 --> 01:51:19.571
<v Speaker 2>New Orleans hurricane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2099
01:51:21.690 --> 01:51:22.680
<v Speaker 2>no corruption.</v>

2100
01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:25.810
<v Speaker 2>If the dikes would've been built </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

2101
01:51:25.811 --> 01:51:28.090
<v Speaker 2>as everyone knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should have been built.</v>

2102
01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:29.163
<v Speaker 2>If all those millions of dollars had </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone into the pockets of corrupt </v>

2103
01:51:31.541 --> 01:51:32.374
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wouldn't have been any flood in </v>

2104
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They build the dikes for the worst storm</v>

2105
01:51:37.961 --> 01:51:40.930
<v Speaker 2>in 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years in New Orleans.</v>

2106
01:51:40.931 --> 01:51:43.090
<v Speaker 2>They built them for the worst storm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 years.</v>

2107
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knew that was insufficient,</v>

2108
01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:47.170
<v Speaker 2>so why didn't they do something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

2109
01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get corrupt enough,</v>

2110
01:51:49.690 --> 01:51:52.840
<v Speaker 2>God will send a flood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's an old story.</v>

2111
01:51:52.841 --> 01:51:54.790
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right.</v>

2112
01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:56.140
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2113
01:51:56.141 --> 01:51:57.490
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is God?</v>

2114
01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Where all I would say that the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israelites never made.</v>

2115
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:06.670
<v Speaker 2>They never said who god was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just said,</v>

2116
01:52:06.671 --> 01:52:08.020
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell out for him.</v>

2117
01:52:08.770 --> 01:52:10.600
<v Speaker 2>You deviate from the path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2118
01:52:10.601 --> 01:52:13.840
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get flattened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people who wrote that book,</v>

2119
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:17.410
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was assembled loosely as a book,</v>

2120
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:19.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of books.</v>

2121
01:52:19.121 --> 01:52:19.954
<v Speaker 2>That's what Bible means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was edited and assembled across vast </v>

2122
01:52:22.871 --> 01:52:23.704
<v Speaker 2>stretches of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea what process led people </v>

2123
01:52:25.901 --> 01:52:26.734
<v Speaker 2>to assemble it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that they felt that that made </v>

2124
01:52:28.901 --> 01:52:29.950
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2125
01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:32.740
<v Speaker 2>So they were guided by their intake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>internal intuition of meaning.</v>

2126
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it produced a document with a narrative.</v>

2127
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Now the narrative is difficult in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to discern,</v>

2128
01:52:41.741 --> 01:52:43.750
<v Speaker 2>given all the detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2129
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:46.700
<v Speaker 2>so I would say give our ancestors</v>

2130
01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:48.530
<v Speaker 1>a break for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

2131
01:52:48.531 --> 01:52:53.531
<v Speaker 1>You want absolute perfect coherence when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to be so inclusive.</v>

2132
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Like it's very hard to be coherent when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to be inclusive.</v>

2133
01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Those two things battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2134
01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.910
<v Speaker 1>have a little respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

2135
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:07.520
<v Speaker 1>that's how it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people weren't stupid.</v>

2136
01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:12.200
<v Speaker 1>They were seriously not stupid and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought was not stupid.</v>

2137
01:53:12.201 --> 01:53:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Now we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can look at it another ways.</v>

2138
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Why is God in the sky?</v>

2139
01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:17.253
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2140
01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't see it in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the fastest way to see infinity?</v>

2141
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll look up at the night sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2142
01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:29.050
<v Speaker 1>why is God up there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you look at the night sky,</v>

2143
01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:32.860
<v Speaker 1>that's how you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that wrong?</v>

2144
01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad,</v>

2145
01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:35.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2146
01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:38.590
<v Speaker 1>well where's the infinite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's really the question.</v>

2147
01:53:39.490 --> 01:53:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Well it seems to be up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2148
01:53:41.711 --> 01:53:43.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2149
01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you make your sacrifices.</v>

2150
01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:47.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do people do that?</v>

2151
01:53:47.441 --> 01:53:48.520
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's primitive.</v>

2152
01:53:48.670 --> 01:53:49.503
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2153
01:53:50.170 --> 01:53:51.003
<v Speaker 1>the invention of the sacrifice was </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the single greatest stroke of </v>

2154
01:53:54.431 --> 01:53:56.440
<v Speaker 1>genius that mankind ever</v>

2155
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:59.383
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was,</v>

2156
01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:02.840
<v Speaker 1>was given or produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the sacrifice?</v>

2157
01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:04.033
<v Speaker 1>You give up something of value now so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that things might be better in the </v>

2158
01:54:07.371 --> 01:54:09.140
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the human discovery.</v>

2159
01:54:09.141 --> 01:54:12.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the human discovery of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody makes sacrifices.</v>

2160
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:15.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to university instead of</v>

2161
01:54:15.621 --> 01:54:18.350
<v Speaker 1>partying and snorting cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2162
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:20.780
<v Speaker 1>because that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2163
01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:21.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if I organize my behavior </v>

2164
01:54:22.821 --> 01:54:24.650
<v Speaker 1>properly and I make the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices,</v>

2165
01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:25.513
<v Speaker 1>God will smile on me in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least the probability seems </v>

2166
01:54:27.981 --> 01:54:29.180
<v Speaker 1>enhanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2167
01:54:29.181 --> 01:54:31.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we don't use the same terminology.</v>

2168
01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:35.330
<v Speaker 1>What we use the same terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't burn rabbits,</v>

2169
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:36.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

2170
01:54:36.981 --> 01:54:37.814
<v Speaker 1>we're not agriculturalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the people who are playing with the </v>

2171
01:54:41.121 --> 01:54:41.954
<v Speaker 1>idea of sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were acting out the discovery </v>

2172
01:54:44.631 --> 01:54:47.540
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can give up something now try to get</v>

2173
01:54:47.541 --> 01:54:50.120
<v Speaker 1>a bone from a dog and tell them you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to give him two boats.</v>

2174
01:54:50.170 --> 01:54:52.670
<v Speaker 1>So like he doesn't give a damn about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bone.</v>

2175
01:54:52.671 --> 01:54:53.504
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we regard the civilized person as </v>

2176
01:54:57.081 --> 01:54:59.900
<v Speaker 1>the person who's capable of deferring </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>

2177
01:55:00.170 --> 01:55:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Deferring gratification is a sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it please God?</v>

2178
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:04.783
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone thinks so or they wouldn't do </v>

2179
01:55:05.931 --> 01:55:08.060
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the burden,</v>

2180
01:55:08.061 --> 01:55:09.530
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

2181
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's in heaven,</v>

2182
01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:15.320
<v Speaker 1>how else is it going to figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of your sacrifice?</v>

2183
01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:16.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

2184
01:55:16.371 --> 01:55:17.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's primitive.</v>

2185
01:55:17.241 --> 01:55:19.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure.</v>

2186
01:55:19.450 --> 01:55:21.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like they got to sacrifice idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2187
01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.300
<v Speaker 1>They go out to all part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2188
01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they're acting it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's concretized.</v>

2189
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:29.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like a drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make it primitive?</v>

2190
01:55:29.710 --> 01:55:30.543
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2191
01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:33.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not primitive.</v>

2192
01:55:33.481 --> 01:55:34.314
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculously sophisticated because </v>

2193
01:55:38.241 --> 01:55:39.074
<v Speaker 1>the mode in the old testament is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the right sacrifices and you will </v>

2194
01:55:41.851 --> 01:55:42.980
<v Speaker 1>thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

2195
01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:46.080
<v Speaker 1>do we believe that it's the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized behavior.</v>

2196
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:49.260
<v Speaker 1>You've don't get a complex civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>without presupposition.</v>

2197
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I think we've actually done quite well.</v>

2198
01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:54.333
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2199
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:55.383
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to keep to a linear track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another problem with this kind of </v>

2200
01:55:58.451 --> 01:55:59.284
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can call that the process </v>

2201
01:56:02.621 --> 01:56:05.750
<v Speaker 1>of coming to terms with this material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a circumambulation,</v>

2202
01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:10.640
<v Speaker 1>a continual wandering around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a center know,</v>

2203
01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:14.770
<v Speaker 1>and you sort of specify the center by </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost by inference,</v>

2204
01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.480
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2205
01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:18.603
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that make us very</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to read because everything </v>

2206
01:56:20.981 --> 01:56:23.320
<v Speaker 1>that he says is dependent on all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things he said.</v>

2207
01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:26.500
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the problems I ran into </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was reading maps of meaning to.</v>

2208
01:56:26.501 --> 01:56:27.334
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a presupposition at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom that you have to accept in </v>

2209
01:56:32.081 --> 01:56:32.914
<v Speaker 1>order to follow the logic and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition is there are alternative </v>

2210
01:56:36.731 --> 01:56:37.564
<v Speaker 1>ways of laying out your initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions about the nature of </v>

2211
01:56:40.541 --> 01:56:42.010
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2212
01:56:42.011 --> 01:56:42.844
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should I accept that while I can't </v>

2213
01:56:44.471 --> 01:56:45.304
<v Speaker 1>show you why until you accept it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can't walk you through the </v>

2214
01:56:46.901 --> 01:56:48.370
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a paradigm problem.</v>

2215
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2216
01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:51.603
<v Speaker 1>So the way I did that in maps of meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that it was kind of like a small </v>

2217
01:56:54.521 --> 01:56:55.354
<v Speaker 1>circle to begin with and then a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>circle and then a bigger circle and you </v>

2218
01:56:58.061 --> 01:56:58.894
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could get all the elements </v>

2219
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:01.263
<v Speaker 1>described in a simple way and then make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a little more complex than a little </v>

2220
01:57:03.881 --> 01:57:04.714
<v Speaker 1>more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seemed to work to some degree </v>

2221
01:57:08.471 --> 01:57:09.304
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

2222
01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:11.590
<v Speaker 3>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not the music of panic,</v>

2223
01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:15.840
<v Speaker 3>but there's something so compelling </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it I think largely in part because</v>

2224
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:21.470
<v Speaker 3>that basic precept position is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulated well or even accepted in the</v>

2225
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:25.470
<v Speaker 3>sorts of science or social science that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we learned in university.</v>

2226
01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Well that's partly why it's so shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social science in particular,</v>

2227
01:57:29.121 --> 01:57:30.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2228
01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:31.613
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This like I should be careful about </v>

2229
01:57:34.101 --> 01:57:34.934
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot from animal </v>

2230
01:57:35.691 --> 01:57:38.660
<v Speaker 1>experimentalists a lot and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists,</v>

2231
01:57:38.690 --> 01:57:42.380
<v Speaker 1>but mostly the ones working on animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They learn things.</v>

2232
01:57:42.381 --> 01:57:44.750
<v Speaker 1>And part of that was a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviorism,</v>

2233
01:57:44.751 --> 01:57:45.321
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2234
01:57:45.321 --> 01:57:49.730
<v Speaker 1>a very reductionistic method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Useful,</v>

2235
01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:51.080
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2236
01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:51.973
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I dismissed the capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>of science to produce useful </v>

2237
01:57:55.581 --> 01:57:56.810
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2238
01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:59.180
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also terrified of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2239
01:57:59.181 --> 01:58:02.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's no reason to be so </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic about scientific truth.</v>

2240
01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:04.440
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that,</v>

2241
01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:09.740
<v Speaker 1>that I've noticed about the rash and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lists the empiricists,</v>

2242
01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:12.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of often the same corner,</v>

2243
01:58:13.250 --> 01:58:14.083
<v Speaker 1>is that they always make the assumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if we transcend our historical </v>

2244
01:58:19.011 --> 01:58:24.011
<v Speaker 1>religions will no longer be religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what we will be as rational.</v>

2245
01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:25.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2246
01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:25.581
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2247
01:58:25.581 --> 01:58:26.414
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're completely out of your cotton </v>

2248
01:58:27.201 --> 01:58:28.550
<v Speaker 1>picking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think that.</v>

2249
01:58:28.551 --> 01:58:29.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2250
01:58:29.781 --> 01:58:33.380
<v Speaker 1>how do you account for the emergence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>new age philosophy?</v>

2251
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:37.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you want incoherent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take a wander through that desert.</v>

2252
01:58:37.281 --> 01:58:40.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like you blow out these </v>
<v Speaker 1>historically this,</v>

2253
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:44.320
<v Speaker 1>these carefully constructed historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>frameworks.</v>

2254
01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:49.000
<v Speaker 1>What you get is like rampant and insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>protestantism.</v>

2255
01:58:49.330 --> 01:58:50.163
<v Speaker 1>The idea that people will magically </v>
<v Speaker 1>become like Newton because we blown out </v>

2256
01:58:55.721 --> 01:58:59.560
<v Speaker 1>the substructure road morality like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so.</v>

2257
01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:04.740
<v Speaker 1>That's so absurd that that's the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that I think is motivated.</v>

2258
01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:06.093
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a reason to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because who the hell would believe </v>

2259
01:59:08.621 --> 01:59:11.560
<v Speaker 1>that it's just you don't know anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about people.</v>

2260
01:59:11.561 --> 01:59:16.561
<v Speaker 1>If you believe that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to think scientifically.</v>

2261
01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:20.200
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a way of thinking too.</v>

2262
01:59:20.201 --> 01:59:24.220
<v Speaker 1>You can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can reduce religion to,</v>

2263
01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:28.150
<v Speaker 1>to sort of Darwinian principles and sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of destroy it that way,</v>

2264
01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can expand your notion of </v>

2265
01:59:31.151 --> 01:59:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Darwinism.</v>

2266
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:36.010
<v Speaker 1>So that actually encompasses the genuine</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena of religion.</v>

2267
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is way more interesting,</v>

2268
01:59:38.831 --> 01:59:41.320
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is it's also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2269
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:44.800
<v Speaker 1>The reason that people won't read young </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

2270
01:59:44.801 --> 01:59:46.660
<v Speaker 1>He's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

2271
01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:47.553
<v Speaker 1>he is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying to reveal so well </v>

2272
01:59:51.611 --> 01:59:55.240
<v Speaker 1>because it means no one thinks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he thought,</v>

2273
01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:57.060
<v Speaker 1>nobody thinks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

2274
01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:00.340
<v Speaker 1>his grasp of the development of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretched over,</v>

2275
02:00:00.341 --> 02:00:01.660
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

2276
02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:02.430
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2277
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:05.560
<v Speaker 1>it puts the enlightenment thinkers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shame,</v>

2278
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:07.420
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

2279
02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:08.313
<v Speaker 1>if you start grappling seriously with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that ideas have people instead </v>

2280
02:00:11.591 --> 02:00:15.640
<v Speaker 1>of people having ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that forces you to reevaluate the entire</v>

2281
02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>nature of your being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does.</v>

2282
02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:21.490
<v Speaker 1>The other thing he asked is which ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>have you and where are they?</v>

2283
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:22.743
<v Speaker 1>Where are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are they suggesting that you go </v>

2284
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:27.550
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the Greek God idea,</v>

2285
02:00:27.551 --> 02:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're play things of the gods like,</v>

2286
02:00:29.951 --> 02:00:31.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't darken already.</v>

2287
02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:32.313
<v Speaker 1>Darkens already knows about memes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are like metal memes and so let's </v>

2288
02:00:36.551 --> 02:00:40.150
<v Speaker 1>not be too in cautious about who's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control here.</v>

2289
02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2290
02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:42.783
<v Speaker 1>well you've developed a nihilistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy that's predicated on </v>

2291
02:00:45.281 --> 02:00:46.450
<v Speaker 1>rationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

2292
02:00:46.810 --> 02:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's behind that?</v>

2293
02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Precisely you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he had,</v>

2294
02:00:51.971 --> 02:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

2295
02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Thousand other people wouldn't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same way if it was you,</v>

2296
02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.460
<v Speaker 1>you're just in its grip and what's it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the.</v>

2297
02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>It's up for the betterment of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2298
02:01:07.090 --> 02:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2299
02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:12.640
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't bet my life on it when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote about Alchemy,</v>

2300
02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:16.780
<v Speaker 1>which his writings on alchemy are </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly opaque,</v>

2301
02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:18.790
<v Speaker 1>but I can give you a bit of an insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>into them.</v>

2302
02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>You can understand young's readings on </v>
<v Speaker 1>copy.</v>

2303
02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:23.643
<v Speaker 1>If you start from the presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the matter that alchemists were </v>

2304
02:01:26.501 --> 02:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>studying wasn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was information.</v>

2305
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:30.783
<v Speaker 1>Now you know the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter and information is very complex </v>

2306
02:01:33.401 --> 02:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>and some people think the substrate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things is information and matt matter is</v>

2307
02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of an emergent property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2308
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2309
02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're studying information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't study it objectively precisely</v>

2310
02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>because as you study the information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get informed that changes you.</v>

2311
02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.450
<v Speaker 1>And so the problem with studying this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing is that you can't study it</v>

2312
02:01:59.451 --> 02:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>without being changed because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not changed by studying it,</v>

2313
02:02:03.170 --> 02:02:04.003
<v Speaker 1>you're not studying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not your no anthropologist who's </v>

2314
02:02:06.951 --> 02:02:07.784
<v Speaker 1>outside of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be because if you're outside </v>

2315
02:02:09.741 --> 02:02:10.574
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand it because if you </v>

2316
02:02:11.901 --> 02:02:14.930
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not the same person anymore.</v>

2317
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:16.183
<v Speaker 1>So you can't keep it at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also partly why humans is </v>

2318
02:02:20.331 --> 02:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2319
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>there's this I read and I don't remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

2320
02:02:25.371 --> 02:02:26.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a crucifix,</v>

2321
02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:31.970
<v Speaker 1>has Latin letters on the top of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Inri.</v>

2322
02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:36.050
<v Speaker 1>It means it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the representation of Jesus Christ,</v>

2323
02:02:36.051 --> 02:02:36.884
<v Speaker 1>King of the Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically that was put on his </v>

2324
02:02:38.841 --> 02:02:39.674
<v Speaker 1>cross.</v>

2325
02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:40.693
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an occult interpretation of </v>

2326
02:02:42.891 --> 02:02:44.210
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also Latin,</v>

2327
02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:45.073
<v Speaker 1>which I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means all nature is renewed by </v>

2328
02:02:47.691 --> 02:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

2329
02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the crucifixion then is assimilated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a forest fire.</v>

2330
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Everything burns down before there's new</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

2331
02:02:56.930 --> 02:03:00.650
<v Speaker 1>If you study religion properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will demolish your personality,</v>

2332
02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:02.293
<v Speaker 1>your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality that's you is like the </v>

2333
02:03:05.061 --> 02:03:07.400
<v Speaker 1>dead branches on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a pine tree.</v>

2334
02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:09.620
<v Speaker 1>So like you might be clinging to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think,</v>

2335
02:03:09.621 --> 02:03:11.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all these dead branches.</v>

2336
02:03:11.061 --> 02:03:11.894
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2337
02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:14.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first of all,</v>

2338
02:03:14.751 --> 02:03:15.584
<v Speaker 1>you should let go of the and second you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should let them burn off and then you </v>

2339
02:03:18.231 --> 02:03:18.741
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2340
02:03:18.741 --> 02:03:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to burn off because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>

2341
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.891
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2342
02:03:21.891 --> 02:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2343
02:03:23.130 --> 02:03:25.640
<v Speaker 1>it's the false you that you're clinging </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2344
02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't mean you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>burned up in the flames.</v>

2345
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:30.403
<v Speaker 1>So to study this material properly is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be burned up in the flames and there's </v>

2346
02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:37.970
<v Speaker 1>no escaping that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not in it.</v>

2347
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:39.740
<v Speaker 1>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that doesn't happen,</v>

2348
02:03:40.130 --> 02:03:44.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things I realized when I</v>

2349
02:03:44.511 --> 02:03:49.220
<v Speaker 1>started studying this was that virtually</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I said was a lie.</v>

2350
02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I would say 99 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by lie I mean it was manipulative.</v>

2351
02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:57.283
<v Speaker 1>It was unclear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was vague and that was all often </v>

2352
02:03:59.271 --> 02:04:04.271
<v Speaker 1>motivated or it was a false attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gain dominance status,</v>

2353
02:04:04.671 --> 02:04:06.950
<v Speaker 1>which is typical of someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals like,</v>

2354
02:04:07.130 --> 02:04:08.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got these ideas,</v>

2355
02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:12.500
<v Speaker 1>I've taken them from places and now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can use them as say,</v>

2356
02:04:12.501 --> 02:04:13.460
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon,</v>

2357
02:04:13.461 --> 02:04:14.294
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what people do when they're </v>

2358
02:04:15.621 --> 02:04:18.890
<v Speaker 1>trying to win an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it's like that's all lies.</v>

2359
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.581
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2360
02:04:19.581 --> 02:04:22.160
<v Speaker 1>that's rough when it's 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you say,</v>

2361
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:23.323
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you realize is how much </v>

2362
02:04:24.591 --> 02:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>you aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not neat.</v>

2363
02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:28.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2364
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:33.380
<v Speaker 1>you have your experience as your claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reality and it's often pretty thin.</v>

2365
02:04:34.130 --> 02:04:34.963
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the development of authentic speech </v>

2366
02:04:37.951 --> 02:04:40.530
<v Speaker 1>is worth the price that you have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

2367
02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:41.933
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just can't stay detached from </v>

2368
02:04:44.851 --> 02:04:47.370
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the phenomenon to study.</v>

2369
02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:51.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like the basis of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the basis of being so,</v>

2370
02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:52.860
<v Speaker 1>so on that note,</v>

2371
02:04:53.250 --> 02:04:54.410
<v Speaker 3>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2372
02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:56.150
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2373
02:04:56.151 --> 02:05:00.380
<v Speaker 3>an expression of your experience really </v>
<v Speaker 3>delving in depth into the material.</v>

2374
02:05:01.610 --> 02:05:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Whereas there are other researchers </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at this from a,</v>

2375
02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.110
<v Speaker 3>from a different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying it's more or less valid,</v>

2376
02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:08.470
<v Speaker 3>it's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2377
02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:13.100
<v Speaker 3>and they're looking at this from a why </v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily why or how does religion</v>

2378
02:05:13.101 --> 02:05:13.934
<v Speaker 3>come about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where did these ideas come from and why </v>

2379
02:05:15.171 --> 02:05:18.590
<v Speaker 3>are they important so much as once </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there,</v>

2380
02:05:18.650 --> 02:05:22.940
<v Speaker 3>why do they perpetuate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are they successful?</v>

2381
02:05:22.941 --> 02:05:27.941
<v Speaker 3>Why do religions exists when they seem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's seems to be so much that or</v>

2382
02:05:28.461 --> 02:05:30.700
<v Speaker 3>rationalist would find objectionable or </v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

2383
02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:31.753
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2384
02:05:31.770 --> 02:05:34.790
<v Speaker 1>So then that begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose silly?</v>

2385
02:05:35.630 --> 02:05:37.790
<v Speaker 1>The rationalist assumes that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2386
02:05:38.090 --> 02:05:39.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2387
02:05:39.590 --> 02:05:42.680
<v Speaker 1>let's have some evidence while we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>fly to the moon.</v>

2388
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one form of evidence.</v>

2389
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:48.860
<v Speaker 1>How long has this been working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred years.</v>

2390
02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say rate rated for a million years</v>

2391
02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:54.613
<v Speaker 1>and see what happens right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you can object to that </v>

2392
02:05:57.141 --> 02:05:57.861
<v Speaker 1>because you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2393
02:05:57.861 --> 02:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>who knows where the future will lead and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on,</v>

2394
02:05:59.691 --> 02:06:01.710
<v Speaker 1>but my point is is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2395
02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:02.653
<v Speaker 1>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what you assume to be true </v>

2396
02:06:08.410 --> 02:06:09.243
<v Speaker 1>structures your argument and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume something to be true because you </v>

2397
02:06:12.701 --> 02:06:16.180
<v Speaker 1>don't have infinite knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you make that initial choice.</v>

2398
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:17.343
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it might be because you're a true </v>

2399
02:06:20.771 --> 02:06:22.540
<v Speaker 1>truth seeker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2400
02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I would be careful about making that </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim.</v>

2401
02:06:25.210 --> 02:06:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're probably not.</v>

2402
02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:30.040
<v Speaker 1>So then who are you</v>

2403
02:06:30.210 --> 02:06:31.860
<v Speaker 3>innovated by something that we're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of that</v>

2404
02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:34.470
<v Speaker 1>is that there's no probably about that.</v>

2405
02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

2406
02:06:37.401 --> 02:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>you might be motivated by terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're not aware of,</v>

2407
02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>like truly terrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2408
02:06:43.311 --> 02:06:44.144
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he said about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow which was for him that was sort </v>

2409
02:06:47.481 --> 02:06:48.314
<v Speaker 1>of all those parts of you that weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>very developed and are mad about it </v>

2410
02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:52.590
<v Speaker 1>because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2411
02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:57.680
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill them and all those sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of storehouse of lies and deception that</v>

2412
02:06:57.681 --> 02:06:58.514
<v Speaker 1>you've managed and all the things you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>left on done and the motivations for </v>

2413
02:07:01.971 --> 02:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>doing all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's the shadow said,</v>

2414
02:07:04.461 --> 02:07:09.100
<v Speaker 1>well the shadow is rooted in hell and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2415
02:07:09.110 --> 02:07:10.550
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a nice metaphor.</v>

2416
02:07:10.551 --> 02:07:12.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure it's a metaphor.</v>

2417
02:07:13.890 --> 02:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2418
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

2419
02:07:18.110 --> 02:07:18.943
<v Speaker 1>I can elaborate on that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you walk down bloor street and you </v>

2420
02:07:26.901 --> 02:07:27.734
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see people in hell with no </v>

2421
02:07:29.451 --> 02:07:30.284
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're not only the people who </v>

2422
02:07:32.421 --> 02:07:37.090
<v Speaker 1>are completely lost the homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the homeless that you cannot look at</v>

2423
02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:38.643
<v Speaker 1>and the reason you can't look at them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they find your act of mirroring </v>

2424
02:07:42.611 --> 02:07:47.320
<v Speaker 1>their state of existence intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will instantly enrage them and that's</v>

2425
02:07:47.321 --> 02:07:50.200
<v Speaker 1>because they're in chaos there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>

2426
02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:51.273
<v Speaker 1>but they're in a particular suburb of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the underworld and that little suburb </v>

2427
02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 1>that's hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

2428
02:07:56.531 --> 02:07:57.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a more,</v>

2429
02:07:57.340 --> 02:07:58.270
<v Speaker 1>is it eternal?</v>

2430
02:08:00.150 --> 02:08:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Depends what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been around a long time.</v>

2431
02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:05.580
<v Speaker 1>It's been around a long time and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really deep.</v>

2432
02:08:05.940 --> 02:08:07.710
<v Speaker 1>And there's another weird thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>

2433
02:08:07.711 --> 02:08:10.860
<v Speaker 1>which is if you're in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how bad it is,</v>

2434
02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:13.950
<v Speaker 1>there's some stupid thing you can do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it worse.</v>

2435
02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:17.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's bottomless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious.</v>

2436
02:08:17.881 --> 02:08:21.030
<v Speaker 1>What's a metaphor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2437
02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Does Heaven Exist?</v>

2438
02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.633
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people get glimpses of it all </v>

2439
02:08:28.811 --> 02:08:30.310
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>

2440
02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:33.040
<v Speaker 1>those are the times in your life when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning shines through,</v>

2441
02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:37.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a place when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning shines through.</v>

2442
02:08:37.241 --> 02:08:40.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a place like if you conceptualize</v>
<v Speaker 1>things as four dimensional,</v>

2443
02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:46.140
<v Speaker 1>this place shifts with time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're actually sitting in a multitude</v>

2444
02:08:46.481 --> 02:08:47.314
<v Speaker 1>of places here now and then that place </v>
<v Speaker 1>configures itself so that it's as </v>

2445
02:08:52.541 --> 02:08:56.410
<v Speaker 1>perfect as it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a glimpse and then you think,</v>

2446
02:08:56.411 --> 02:08:56.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2447
02:08:56.930 --> 02:08:59.260
<v Speaker 1>What if it could always be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2448
02:08:59.261 --> 02:09:01.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if it could be always like that?</v>

2449
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:03.790
<v Speaker 1>And also you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2450
02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:06.160
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if everybody told the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth?</v>

2451
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:11.470
<v Speaker 1>We know what happens when people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the Gulag archipelago.</v>

2452
02:09:13.050 --> 02:09:16.930
<v Speaker 1>What's the opposite of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2453
02:09:16.931 --> 02:09:17.764
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do know that there's an opposite </v>

2454
02:09:19.511 --> 02:09:20.344
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people are in cautious about their </v>

2455
02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:26.193
<v Speaker 1>discussions of what constitutes real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even notice their own </v>

2456
02:09:29.171 --> 02:09:31.690
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never been to the underworld,</v>

2457
02:09:32.010 --> 02:09:34.780
<v Speaker 1>so like you've been there every time </v>
<v Speaker 1>things have fallen apart in your life.</v>

2458
02:09:34.781 --> 02:09:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I tell people that all the time in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures.</v>

2459
02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Here's what the underworld meets.</v>

2460
02:09:40.510 --> 02:09:42.760
<v Speaker 1>You've been married for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're happily married,</v>

2461
02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:44.980
<v Speaker 1>you come home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife's go on.</v>

2462
02:09:44.981 --> 02:09:49.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a note that says I'm leaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my lover of the last 10 years.</v>

2463
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:51.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2464
02:09:51.251 --> 02:09:52.084
<v Speaker 1>you were somewhere before you walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the house and now you're somewhere </v>

2465
02:09:54.971 --> 02:09:56.770
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you now?</v>

2466
02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:00.300
<v Speaker 1>What year where you go when the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>drops out,</v>

2467
02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:02.400
<v Speaker 1>where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2468
02:10:02.401 --> 02:10:04.950
<v Speaker 1>it's in the underworld like here in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>

2469
02:10:04.951 --> 02:10:09.720
<v Speaker 1>You're in that chaotic state that exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>before order is constructed.</v>

2470
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>You go there all the time</v>

2471
02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:12.073
<v Speaker 3>and the reason people can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't see the connection between their </v>

2472
02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:17.580
<v Speaker 3>experience and these earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2473
02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:18.673
<v Speaker 3>mythological representations is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are being adequate mystic and </v>

2474
02:10:22.311 --> 02:10:23.144
<v Speaker 3>reinterpreting the mythological </v>
<v Speaker 3>representations as if their scientific </v>

2475
02:10:26.571 --> 02:10:29.120
<v Speaker 3>theories as if these people were naive </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>

2476
02:10:29.470 --> 02:10:30.303
<v Speaker 3>really what they were doing is coming up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with images to explain things that they </v>

2477
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.033
<v Speaker 3>otherwise represent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're real in terms of their lived </v>

2478
02:10:36.081 --> 02:10:36.914
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2479
02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2480
02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2481
02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Why would we think they were naive </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist?</v>

2482
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:45.790
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a chimp a naive scientist like?</v>

2483
02:10:45.810 --> 02:10:47.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

2484
02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:49.960
<v Speaker 1>They weren't live scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they were doing.</v>

2485
02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:50.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they were naive </v>

2486
02:10:51.670 --> 02:10:54.100
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't very naive.</v>

2487
02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:57.640
<v Speaker 1>They weren't concerned with material </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

2488
02:10:58.690 --> 02:11:00.940
<v Speaker 1>They were concerned with the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

2489
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:03.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's heidegger's claim,</v>

2490
02:11:03.131 --> 02:11:04.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed that.</v>

2491
02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And I again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this until much later.</v>

2492
02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger believe that philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually lost its way with the Greeks,</v>

2493
02:11:11.770 --> 02:11:14.860
<v Speaker 1>with Plato for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when things became rationalized,</v>

2494
02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:15.933
<v Speaker 1>Nicha thought the same thing in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways because he was very interested in </v>

2495
02:11:18.281 --> 02:11:20.680
<v Speaker 1>the Dionysian right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is more like,</v>

2496
02:11:22.150 --> 02:11:24.940
<v Speaker 1>well that's more like lived experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dionysian,</v>

2497
02:11:24.941 --> 02:11:25.774
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the chemist who goes out and you </v>

2498
02:11:27.791 --> 02:11:28.624
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's a punk rocker in his spare </v>

2499
02:11:31.601 --> 02:11:34.170
<v Speaker 1>time and he goes out in the evening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>listens to a,</v>

2500
02:11:34.190 --> 02:11:35.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thrash metal band in bounds himself </v>

2501
02:11:37.031 --> 02:11:38.020
<v Speaker 1>against other people.</v>

2502
02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:40.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't see any contradiction there.</v>

2503
02:11:40.510 --> 02:11:41.343
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2504
02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:45.070
<v Speaker 1>one's rational and now there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a contradiction,</v>

2505
02:11:45.210 --> 02:11:46.043
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while you find the irrational </v>

2506
02:11:47.171 --> 02:11:49.630
<v Speaker 1>activity enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how do you account for that?</v>

2507
02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:53.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't just keep the world separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2508
02:11:53.111 --> 02:11:53.944
<v Speaker 1>so these are ancestors were </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists and they were </v>

2509
02:11:58.061 --> 02:11:59.550
<v Speaker 1>accounting for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2510
02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:01.060
<v Speaker 1>their landscapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>

2511
02:12:01.061 --> 02:12:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the geography of being straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's an underworld.</v>

2512
02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do you go there?</v>

2513
02:12:05.950 --> 02:12:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2514
02:12:06.430 --> 02:12:08.020
<v Speaker 1>when things fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2515
02:12:08.140 --> 02:12:10.660
<v Speaker 1>that's where you end up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone gets that,</v>

2516
02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:13.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell these stories to retirees and all</v>

2517
02:12:13.271 --> 02:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>sorts of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

2518
02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:17.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place that you go.</v>

2519
02:12:17.601 --> 02:12:19.210
<v Speaker 1>When everything falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2520
02:12:19.211 --> 02:12:20.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>

2521
02:12:20.890 --> 02:12:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2522
02:12:21.911 --> 02:12:22.744
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when you get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody needs to know that </v>

2523
02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:26.133
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories or trying to tell you when </v>

2524
02:12:28.691 --> 02:12:30.430
<v Speaker 1>things fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

2525
02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't think of when things fall apart</v>

2526
02:12:33.191 --> 02:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>as a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's our problem.</v>

2527
02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:37.053
<v Speaker 1>It's a place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people live in del you'd have to </v>

2528
02:12:38.891 --> 02:12:40.630
<v Speaker 1>do is go look on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2529
02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.490
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person's in the underworld.</v>

2530
02:12:42.990 --> 02:12:46.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like adding that person's inhale </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell,</v>

2531
02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:47.130
<v Speaker 1>but you won't look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

2532
02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:47.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what usually happens in a circumstance </v>

2533
02:12:49.241 --> 02:12:50.074
<v Speaker 1>like that is there is so much inhale </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll just walk around them and </v>

2534
02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>you will look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2535
02:12:56.620 --> 02:12:58.780
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2536
02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:01.570
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That expression in English.</v>

2537
02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2538
02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:03.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2539
02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:04.653
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is encoded in the way we think </v>

2540
02:13:06.431 --> 02:13:09.130
<v Speaker 3>there is this inherent locality or </v>
<v Speaker 3>geographies.</v>

2541
02:13:09.170 --> 02:13:09.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2542
02:13:09.801 --> 02:13:11.360
<v Speaker 1>and it is a geography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

2543
02:13:11.370 --> 02:13:12.203
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2544
02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:14.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a slice of space time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2545
02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:17.510
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the street,</v>

2546
02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:19.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2547
02:13:20.630 --> 02:13:23.810
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the being of the street,</v>

2548
02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:27.580
<v Speaker 3>it's everything that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's afforded by the representation of</v>

2549
02:13:27.581 --> 02:13:28.350
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevermind,</v>

2550
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:31.070
<v Speaker 3>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has other meanings beyond what we do,</v>

2551
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:33.080
<v Speaker 3>which is something that we didn't touch </v>
<v Speaker 3>on at all actually,</v>

2552
02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:33.953
<v Speaker 3>which we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is as the complexity management </v>

2553
02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:42.620
<v Speaker 3>theory angle in the sense that how we </v>
<v Speaker 3>compartmentalize reality is not at all a</v>

2554
02:13:42.991 --> 02:13:43.890
<v Speaker 3>given,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2555
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:44.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2556
02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:45.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it on the fly,</v>

2557
02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:48.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do it for pragmatic reasons,</v>

2558
02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in some sense what you do is you </v>

2559
02:13:50.471 --> 02:13:51.304
<v Speaker 1>look for the simplest possible and least</v>
<v Speaker 1>energetic way of conceptualizing the </v>

2560
02:13:55.991 --> 02:13:59.800
<v Speaker 1>current situation so that the next thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do happens.</v>

2561
02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:03.250
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like to think about it in terms of</v>

2562
02:14:03.251 --> 02:14:04.900
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2563
02:14:04.930 --> 02:14:07.750
<v Speaker 1>because I think resolutions are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful idea.</v>

2564
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Most of our representations of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>are extremely low resolution,</v>

2565
02:14:11.950 --> 02:14:14.020
<v Speaker 1>like will rely on a thumbnail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why not?</v>

2566
02:14:14.650 --> 02:14:15.860
<v Speaker 1>What's good enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2567
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>It's pragmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good enough,</v>

2568
02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:18.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make it any more complex than it </v>

2569
02:14:19.661 --> 02:14:20.494
<v Speaker 1>has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you are managing always is </v>

2570
02:14:22.511 --> 02:14:25.310
<v Speaker 1>complexity because the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2571
02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>the representation you use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an image,</v>

2572
02:14:28.151 --> 02:14:28.984
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a low resolution representation of </v>

2573
02:14:31.331 --> 02:14:33.070
<v Speaker 1>the reality behind the image.</v>

2574
02:14:33.250 --> 02:14:35.320
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there,</v>

2575
02:14:35.380 --> 02:14:36.213
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can't see your back so I can't </v>

2576
02:14:38.111 --> 02:14:40.240
<v Speaker 1>see your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see your culture.</v>

2577
02:14:40.241 --> 02:14:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I can't see your education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see the biosphere that you're an</v>

2578
02:14:43.511 --> 02:14:46.570
<v Speaker 1>embedded part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any of your substructures.</v>

2579
02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:50.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're all there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just as real as the thing that I</v>

2580
02:14:50.501 --> 02:14:51.334
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're causally implicated in </v>

2581
02:14:53.351 --> 02:14:56.170
<v Speaker 1>everything that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's complexity.</v>

2582
02:14:56.171 --> 02:14:58.000
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>

2583
02:14:58.001 --> 02:15:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2584
02:15:00.550 --> 02:15:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming that you're what we both </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to allow to be possible here,</v>

2585
02:15:08.230 --> 02:15:09.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're both polite.</v>

2586
02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:11.790
<v Speaker 1>We're doing this little act that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2587
02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:13.330
<v Speaker 1>we both agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've never met,</v>

2588
02:15:13.331 --> 02:15:16.570
<v Speaker 1>but we were going to run this routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to play by the rules.</v>

2589
02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:17.673
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for all I know you could just turn </v>

2590
02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:21.580
<v Speaker 1>left right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2591
02:15:21.581 --> 02:15:25.060
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity is like,</v>

2592
02:15:25.061 --> 02:15:25.960
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

2593
02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:28.450
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a potential too because</v>

2594
02:15:28.451 --> 02:15:29.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2595
02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:33.760
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing is too mundane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boring,</v>

2596
02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:34.653
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2597
02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:35.613
<v Speaker 1>I'm caught in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I hope you turned left a </v>

2598
02:15:37.571 --> 02:15:40.660
<v Speaker 1>little bit because then that's the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life to that,</v>

2599
02:15:40.810 --> 02:15:43.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that refreshing complexity comes back.</v>

2600
02:15:43.751 --> 02:15:45.640
<v Speaker 1>But hopefully not too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2601
02:15:45.890 --> 02:15:46.723
<v Speaker 1>I don't want too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a little bite size piece of it </v>

2602
02:15:49.421 --> 02:15:51.910
<v Speaker 1>that will make me interested in not </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified.</v>

2603
02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:53.373
<v Speaker 1>So that's complexity and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a better way of conceptualizing </v>

2604
02:15:57.011 --> 02:16:00.490
<v Speaker 1>what the terror management guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>after with regards to the fear of death,</v>

2605
02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:02.073
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So partly I don't think they're very </v>

2606
02:16:03.581 --> 02:16:04.414
<v Speaker 1>imaginative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's much many worse things than </v>

2607
02:16:07.301 --> 02:16:11.560
<v Speaker 1>death to be terrified of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like insanity is probably one,</v>

2608
02:16:12.190 --> 02:16:14.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain that's a bad one.</v>

2609
02:16:15.070 --> 02:16:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Longterm pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad one.</v>

2610
02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Well then there's longterm pointless </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

2611
02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:21.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's your longterm pointless </v>

2612
02:16:23.291 --> 02:16:24.760
<v Speaker 1>pain and that of your family.</v>

2613
02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:25.593
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's horrors that exceed death by </v>

2614
02:16:28.181 --> 02:16:32.170
<v Speaker 1>orders of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to make that,</v>

2615
02:16:32.171 --> 02:16:35.470
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental fear I think is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an error.</v>

2616
02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:37.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2617
02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:41.320
<v Speaker 1>what are people more afraid of dying or </v>
<v Speaker 1>having their children die?</v>

2618
02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:43.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2619
02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:49.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly reasonable question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I read Becker,</v>

2620
02:16:50.710 --> 02:16:53.140
<v Speaker 1>really read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I liked Becker's book.</v>

2621
02:16:53.141 --> 02:16:55.990
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he makes a bunch of mistakes for one</v>

2622
02:16:55.991 --> 02:16:57.280
<v Speaker 1>of the things he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2623
02:16:57.281 --> 02:16:58.114
<v Speaker 1>is right in the intro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says it's a book that's trying to </v>

2624
02:17:00.341 --> 02:17:04.240
<v Speaker 1>bring about the psychoanalytic closure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the study of religion.</v>

2625
02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:05.343
<v Speaker 1>So it's Neil Freud in smartly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neil frightened and he wants to explain </v>

2626
02:17:09.431 --> 02:17:12.490
<v Speaker 1>religion pretty much completely within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalytic framework,</v>

2627
02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:15.220
<v Speaker 1>does a great job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the intro he says,</v>

2628
02:17:15.250 --> 02:17:16.083
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might wonder why in a book that's </v>

2629
02:17:17.501 --> 02:17:22.090
<v Speaker 1>devoted to the last word in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic thinking about religion,</v>

2630
02:17:22.091 --> 02:17:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I never mentioned you.</v>

2631
02:17:24.430 --> 02:17:26.260
<v Speaker 1>So then he says a bunch of things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

2632
02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.730
<v Speaker 1>One of them is I could never understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>a single thing he was talking about when</v>

2633
02:17:30.731 --> 02:17:32.620
<v Speaker 1>he wrote all his works on alchemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2634
02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:33.633
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a problem because that's </v>

2635
02:17:35.021 --> 02:17:39.520
<v Speaker 1>where all the information that your book</v>
<v Speaker 1>lacks is all of it.</v>

2636
02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:40.810
<v Speaker 1>You missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2637
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:43.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about the hero myth,</v>

2638
02:17:43.721 --> 02:17:47.320
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a delusion and you know,</v>

2639
02:17:47.321 --> 02:17:48.154
<v Speaker 1>as a hero project and has something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only there to stave off the fear </v>

2640
02:17:51.011 --> 02:17:51.880
<v Speaker 1>of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2641
02:17:51.881 --> 02:17:56.881
<v Speaker 1>well you got a good way into the depths </v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2642
02:17:58.950 --> 02:18:03.950
<v Speaker 1>and way farther than most people get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you missed the next 300 stories.</v>

2643
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:07.780
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's too bad.</v>

2644
02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:09.393
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny because I've also read </v>

2645
02:18:10.781 --> 02:18:13.720
<v Speaker 1>the social psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair bit of it that is associated with</v>

2646
02:18:13.721 --> 02:18:14.554
<v Speaker 1>Tara management and most of the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it is it hasn't moved becker one </v>

2647
02:18:18.010 --> 02:18:18.310
<v Speaker 1>inch.</v>

2648
02:18:18.310 --> 02:18:19.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2649
02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:22.000
<v Speaker 1>that's what Becker said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're proving it.</v>

2650
02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:22.893
<v Speaker 1>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really because the demonstrations </v>

2651
02:18:27.731 --> 02:18:30.370
<v Speaker 1>are amenable to multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations,</v>

2652
02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:34.090
<v Speaker 1>but Becker he covered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a brilliant book,</v>

2653
02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:36.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2654
02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:38.133
<v Speaker 1>so on that note is this argument is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong for people that may not have read </v>

2655
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:44.770
<v Speaker 1>it back or they're not fully aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the terror management theory.</v>

2656
02:18:44.910 --> 02:18:45.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he thinks he thinks of </v>

2657
02:18:46.331 --> 02:18:49.610
<v Speaker 1>everything that we do to contend with </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality as Ann Rousse,</v>

2658
02:18:50.450 --> 02:18:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that's right because I</v>

2659
02:18:54.101 --> 02:18:58.300
<v Speaker 1>don't think that it's necessary to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of death now.</v>

2660
02:18:58.301 --> 02:19:02.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy not to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2661
02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:03.633
<v Speaker 1>it's fate that as far as Becker's </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned is that that's what you're </v>

2662
02:19:07.061 --> 02:19:08.380
<v Speaker 1>going to be terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2663
02:19:08.381 --> 02:19:12.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's right.</v>

2664
02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I think that people don't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of death.</v>

2665
02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:19.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy state to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I want to die.</v>

2666
02:19:19.810 --> 02:19:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Although I can certainly imagine things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are worse than that,</v>

2667
02:19:22.450 --> 02:19:25.060
<v Speaker 1>like no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

2668
02:19:25.061 --> 02:19:28.340
<v Speaker 1>and this is something sold units and </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out in the Gulag archipelago too,</v>

2669
02:19:28.341 --> 02:19:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I think there are ways of living that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are worse than death.</v>

2670
02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:34.100
<v Speaker 1>That's why people commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's their decision.</v>

2671
02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:38.360
<v Speaker 1>So obviously hell is worse than death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2672
02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:42.710
<v Speaker 1>given how I described it earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't death.</v>

2673
02:19:42.711 --> 02:19:44.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complexity.</v>

2674
02:19:44.091 --> 02:19:46.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is that things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond us.</v>

2675
02:19:46.970 --> 02:19:47.803
<v Speaker 1>Because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always exceed what our models tell </v>

2676
02:19:50.421 --> 02:19:55.340
<v Speaker 1>us they're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they always transformed themselves in</v>

2677
02:19:55.341 --> 02:19:58.460
<v Speaker 1>some ungainly ways so that we don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we want.</v>

2678
02:19:59.090 --> 02:20:01.160
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2679
02:20:01.161 --> 02:20:01.994
<v Speaker 1>how do you best deal with complexity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think truth is so </v>

2680
02:20:05.271 --> 02:20:08.900
<v Speaker 1>useful is because generally it reduces </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity,</v>

2681
02:20:09.620 --> 02:20:10.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2682
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.963
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's really useful </v>

2683
02:20:12.531 --> 02:20:13.364
<v Speaker 1>about trying to say things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe to be true is you don't have to </v>

2684
02:20:17.271 --> 02:20:19.880
<v Speaker 1>remember what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2685
02:20:19.881 --> 02:20:20.714
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did I say?</v>

2686
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2687
02:20:21.381 --> 02:20:23.780
<v Speaker 1>but I was trying to explain things </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

2688
02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:24.733
<v Speaker 1>Then you don't have to tear through all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your rationalizations and think about </v>

2689
02:20:28.251 --> 02:20:30.860
<v Speaker 1>what you have to keep track of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>deceptions.</v>

2690
02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:32.270
<v Speaker 1>They grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2691
02:20:32.271 --> 02:20:34.610
<v Speaker 1>they're like hydrus so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

2692
02:20:34.611 --> 02:20:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth simpler.</v>

2693
02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.870
<v Speaker 1>That's one big advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2694
02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:41.060
<v Speaker 1>and people can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2695
02:20:41.061 --> 02:20:44.240
<v Speaker 1>truth isn't always the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2696
02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:47.840
<v Speaker 1>there are some times you get into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that's so awful.</v>

2697
02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:48.973
<v Speaker 1>You've made so many mistakes that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only would it be very difficult for </v>

2698
02:20:54.501 --> 02:20:55.334
<v Speaker 1>truth to rescue you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already worked your character to </v>

2699
02:20:58.161 --> 02:21:00.020
<v Speaker 1>such a degree that you couldn't even use</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2700
02:21:00.050 --> 02:21:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had it,</v>

2701
02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2702
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:02.833
<v Speaker 1>you're off the radar at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nothing short of a miracle would </v>

2703
02:21:04.941 --> 02:21:05.774
<v Speaker 1>save you.</v>

2704
02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:11.400
<v Speaker 3>To what degree do you think that one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lessons that you've extrapolated and</v>

2705
02:21:12.311 --> 02:21:14.950
<v Speaker 3>you put it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it into words,</v>

2706
02:21:14.951 --> 02:21:15.784
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are easily applied across various </v>

2707
02:21:18.791 --> 02:21:19.624
<v Speaker 3>cultures that you may not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily addressed in your </v>

2708
02:21:21.881 --> 02:21:22.714
<v Speaker 3>examination of mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm challenging you a little bit </v>

2709
02:21:24.761 --> 02:21:26.650
<v Speaker 3>here just because it's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>topic.</v>

2710
02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:31.690
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam just doesn't feature at all in the</v>

2711
02:21:31.691 --> 02:21:33.880
<v Speaker 3>work that you've written as I've as I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>read,</v>

2712
02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:34.773
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2713
02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:38.710
<v Speaker 3>it's a hugely important religion on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>global scale.</v>

2714
02:21:38.890 --> 02:21:41.590
<v Speaker 3>And even in countries like Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2715
02:21:42.610 --> 02:21:43.443
<v Speaker 3>and then there's also the question of </v>
<v Speaker 3>with so many people coming with </v>

2716
02:21:46.991 --> 02:21:47.824
<v Speaker 3>different specific mythologies or </v>
<v Speaker 3>embodiments of the universe mythology </v>

2717
02:21:53.241 --> 02:21:55.870
<v Speaker 3>that we're discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the,</v>

2718
02:21:55.871 --> 02:21:56.704
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is sort of a unique episode </v>
<v Speaker 3>in human history in the sense of just </v>

2719
02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:03.400
<v Speaker 3>the scale and the rapidity with which </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are coming into contact with each</v>

2720
02:22:03.401 --> 02:22:04.234
<v Speaker 3>other from very different backgrounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you see as the implications </v>

2721
02:22:07.991 --> 02:22:11.300
<v Speaker 3>of that for good or for bad in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a country like</v>

2722
02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:12.193
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that people are coming </v>

2723
02:22:13.681 --> 02:22:14.514
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

2724
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:15.623
<v Speaker 3>but from those very different cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>places in which maybe there's a </v>

2725
02:22:19.511 --> 02:22:22.570
<v Speaker 3>universal mythology that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that envelops all of them.</v>

2726
02:22:22.571 --> 02:22:23.404
<v Speaker 3>But the values and the particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>embodiments of mythology that people </v>

2727
02:22:27.250 --> 02:22:28.083
<v Speaker 3>have grown up with are often very </v>
<v Speaker 3>different than they and these and these </v>

2728
02:22:30.991 --> 02:22:32.490
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these can clash.</v>

2729
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:35.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a tribal,</v>

2730
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:38.730
<v Speaker 3>tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribal and I don't mean in a,</v>

2731
02:22:38.731 --> 02:22:39.564
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the clash of civilizations sort of </v>

2732
02:22:41.220 --> 02:22:42.660
<v Speaker 3>overblown away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just saying on a,</v>

2733
02:22:42.740 --> 02:22:43.573
<v Speaker 3>on a pragmatic level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are often operating in different </v>

2734
02:22:45.211 --> 02:22:46.320
<v Speaker 3>psychological space.</v>

2735
02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:47.913
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree that the issue there is </v>

2736
02:22:49.071 --> 02:22:52.820
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you can negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right society,</v>

2737
02:22:52.821 --> 02:22:57.230
<v Speaker 1>a multicultural society in many ways is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on negotiation.</v>

2738
02:22:57.280 --> 02:22:59.870
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another sort of axiom.</v>

2739
02:22:59.871 --> 02:23:02.450
<v Speaker 1>It's tyranny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery in negotiation.</v>

2740
02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Those are your options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be a tyrant?</v>

2741
02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a slave,</v>

2742
02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:06.793
<v Speaker 1>that's an option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't want to be either of </v>

2743
02:23:08.241 --> 02:23:09.260
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd negotiate,</v>

2744
02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:10.543
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you negotiate or partly you </v>

2745
02:23:12.711 --> 02:23:13.544
<v Speaker 1>pay attention so you listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now here's another way to think </v>

2746
02:23:17.421 --> 02:23:18.930
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the totality,</v>

2747
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:19.783
<v Speaker 1>your tarion assumes that what he knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>will redeem him to sort of the basis of </v>

2748
02:23:23.511 --> 02:23:25.400
<v Speaker 1>terror management theory in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2749
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:28.220
<v Speaker 1>So what you know protects you and keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>you safe,</v>

2750
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:29.503
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to tighten that up and </v>

2751
02:23:30.951 --> 02:23:31.784
<v Speaker 1>you want to make it rigorous and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want anything to exist outside of </v>

2752
02:23:33.651 --> 02:23:34.360
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2753
02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're so,</v>

2754
02:23:35.900 --> 02:23:38.570
<v Speaker 1>so in some ways you worship the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

2755
02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:42.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another way of thinking about it.</v>

2756
02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:44.960
<v Speaker 1>What you don't know will redeem you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2757
02:23:44.961 --> 02:23:45.650
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2758
02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:49.330
<v Speaker 1>because you already know what you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now then you can ask yourself,</v>

2759
02:23:49.331 --> 02:23:50.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that enough?</v>

2760
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:52.940
<v Speaker 1>And then that the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2761
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:57.890
<v Speaker 1>what's the quality of your life if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of your life is what you want it</v>

2762
02:23:57.891 --> 02:24:02.270
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really then what you know is enough,</v>

2763
02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:03.853
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that your quality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is what you want it to be is very </v>

2764
02:24:06.411 --> 02:24:07.244
<v Speaker 1>low because you're still prone to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of suffering and all sorts of </v>

2765
02:24:10.730 --> 02:24:14.410
<v Speaker 1>ignorance and and you know you can face </v>
<v Speaker 1>that forthrightly.</v>

2766
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:15.343
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in the Soviet Union because </v>

2767
02:24:17.511 --> 02:24:19.550
<v Speaker 1>everybody said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my quality of life is great.</v>

2768
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:23.290
<v Speaker 1>We know everything we need to know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>in reality it was like abysmal,</v>

2769
02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:24.890
<v Speaker 1>murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treacherous,</v>

2770
02:24:24.891 --> 02:24:26.390
<v Speaker 1>deceitful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was horrible,</v>

2771
02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:27.980
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what that meant,</v>

2772
02:24:27.981 --> 02:24:30.800
<v Speaker 1>it was at that in the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you admitted to ward,</v>

2773
02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:34.790
<v Speaker 1>if you admitted to your own suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a trader.</v>

2774
02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:36.193
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>

2775
02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:37.033
<v Speaker 1>That's hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't even let your suffering be </v>

2776
02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:40.604
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2777
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you have to suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't even admit it.</v>

2778
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back to listening,</v>

2779
02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:46.543
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2780
02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:51.650
<v Speaker 1>if you assume that what you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>his redemptive,</v>

2781
02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:55.460
<v Speaker 1>then you can listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can listen because he never know.</v>

2782
02:24:55.461 --> 02:24:58.940
<v Speaker 1>That person might know something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know and maybe that would be a</v>

2783
02:24:58.941 --> 02:24:59.774
<v Speaker 1>useful something you know and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have something to say that they don't </v>

2784
02:25:02.631 --> 02:25:04.340
<v Speaker 1>know that would be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2785
02:25:04.341 --> 02:25:06.620
<v Speaker 1>now there's some presuppositions that go</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with that.</v>

2786
02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:07.453
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to be willing to meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person in the space between </v>

2787
02:25:11.301 --> 02:25:15.350
<v Speaker 1>cultures and you have to know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate in this space between cultures.</v>

2788
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

2789
02:25:17.661 --> 02:25:18.494
<v Speaker 1>if you're a hero of the right form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knew how to operate in this space </v>

2790
02:25:21.621 --> 02:25:24.430
<v Speaker 1>between cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then how do you operate there?</v>

2791
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:25.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we know what makes cultures </v>

2792
02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:33.910
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust what makes trust possible.</v>

2793
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you want natural resources.</v>

2794
02:25:38.350 --> 02:25:40.480
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing more valuable than trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honesty.</v>

2795
02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Why is the world poor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corruption?</v>

2796
02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:46.353
<v Speaker 1>That's why all the poor countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all the poor countries are </v>

2797
02:25:49.121 --> 02:25:49.954
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason they're poor is </v>

2798
02:25:51.051 --> 02:25:52.990
<v Speaker 1>because they're corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2799
02:25:52.991 --> 02:25:53.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

2800
02:25:53.711 --> 02:25:56.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the western countries so uncorrupt?</v>

2801
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:59.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they've got their problems,</v>

2802
02:25:59.021 --> 02:26:02.380
<v Speaker 1>but generally the answer is they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>

2803
02:26:02.770 --> 02:26:04.720
<v Speaker 1>So [inaudible] bay is a good example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2804
02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:06.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when Ebay first emerged,</v>

2805
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:09.580
<v Speaker 1>people thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you send me John,</v>

2806
02:26:09.581 --> 02:26:12.880
<v Speaker 1>could I send you a check that bounces?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the end of Ebay,</v>

2807
02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:15.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these third party,</v>

2808
02:26:16.270 --> 02:26:17.103
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember what they're called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agents set themselves up so that you </v>

2809
02:26:20.561 --> 02:26:21.394
<v Speaker 1>could pay them a fraction of the price </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would get the check and the </v>

2810
02:26:25.421 --> 02:26:28.580
<v Speaker 1>product validate them and ship them off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2811
02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:32.740
<v Speaker 1>they'd take 10 percent or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a particular name for people who</v>

2812
02:26:32.741 --> 02:26:34.570
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a profession.</v>

2813
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:35.463
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was the average rate of </v>

2814
02:26:37.031 --> 02:26:39.400
<v Speaker 1>honesty on Ebay was so high that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was useless.</v>

2815
02:26:39.401 --> 02:26:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like the default was I won't screw </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2816
02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And that was between strangers who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>never met an even more weirdly.</v>

2817
02:26:47.321 --> 02:26:49.570
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to engage in another </v>
<v Speaker 1>transaction.</v>

2818
02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:50.913
<v Speaker 1>So what that meant was that Ebay all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden became insanely valuable </v>

2819
02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:58.090
<v Speaker 1>because people would trade property now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>re reputation markers soon evolved,</v>

2820
02:26:58.660 --> 02:26:59.493
<v Speaker 1>but the d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that in the west the </v>

2821
02:27:01.091 --> 02:27:01.924
<v Speaker 1>default is you won't screw me now if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that I can trust your </v>

2822
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:11.740
<v Speaker 1>persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the default is you will screw me,</v>

2823
02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:12.753
<v Speaker 1>then I'm a barrel of snakes and you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrel of snakes and we will never get </v>

2824
02:27:15.761 --> 02:27:16.430
<v Speaker 1>anywhere</v>

2825
02:27:16.430 --> 02:27:17.500
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is,</v>

2826
02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:18.383
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we talked about the state of the </v>

2827
02:27:19.821 --> 02:27:20.654
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of humanity does not live in the </v>

2828
02:27:23.871 --> 02:27:27.390
<v Speaker 3>west where the default assumption is I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can probably trust this person.</v>

2829
02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:28.573
<v Speaker 3>What are the lessons to learn from what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>From what you're arguing and from and </v>

2830
02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:35.510
<v Speaker 3>from where you've extrapolated from your</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience or these contexts.</v>

2831
02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:36.401
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2832
02:27:36.401 --> 02:27:37.234
<v Speaker 1>I can only speak about that at the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>general level because what to do in any </v>

2833
02:27:42.791 --> 02:27:43.624
<v Speaker 1>particular circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sort of problem I deal with </v>

2834
02:27:45.221 --> 02:27:47.170
<v Speaker 1>in my clinical practice all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2835
02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:50.140
<v Speaker 1>here's this insanely complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>

2836
02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:54.280
<v Speaker 1>It's usually has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness is just the per person is</v>

2837
02:27:54.281 --> 02:27:56.950
<v Speaker 1>caught in something ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

2838
02:27:56.951 --> 02:27:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their aunt is sick at home,</v>

2839
02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:03.100
<v Speaker 1>their husband just lost his job and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an illness.</v>

2840
02:28:03.130 --> 02:28:04.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2841
02:28:04.081 --> 02:28:05.080
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2842
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:06.940
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they mentally ill?</v>

2843
02:28:06.941 --> 02:28:08.770
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just awful.</v>

2844
02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:10.293
<v Speaker 1>So how do you weave your way through an </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful situation while the particulars </v>

2845
02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:14.913
<v Speaker 1>matter a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to do strategic </v>

2846
02:28:17.111 --> 02:28:19.360
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the details,</v>

2847
02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:22.250
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the particular.</v>

2848
02:28:22.251 --> 02:28:25.580
<v Speaker 1>So what's the general case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the general case is</v>

2849
02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:27.093
<v Speaker 6>maybe</v>

2850
02:28:30.850 --> 02:28:31.683
<v Speaker 1>don't falsify your relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>being to the degree that you can manage </v>

2851
02:28:36.791 --> 02:28:37.624
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things that I tell my </v>

2852
02:28:39.491 --> 02:28:40.324
<v Speaker 1>students is</v>

2853
02:28:42.290 --> 02:28:44.780
<v Speaker 1>try solving a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing it,</v>

2854
02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:47.960
<v Speaker 1>not trying to solve a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2855
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:53.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're gonna fix it and you can fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it's a problem and you know,</v>

2856
02:28:53.961 --> 02:28:55.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2857
02:28:55.161 --> 02:28:55.994
<v Speaker 1>So there's like a preconditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say there's a bunch of things </v>

2858
02:28:58.911 --> 02:29:01.650
<v Speaker 1>around you that bug you and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

2859
02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:04.010
<v Speaker 1>those things bug me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2860
02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:07.040
<v Speaker 1>But you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they bug you and you might think,</v>

2861
02:29:07.041 --> 02:29:09.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of those things that bugged me,</v>

2862
02:29:09.351 --> 02:29:12.750
<v Speaker 1>something I could fix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think well On.</v>

2863
02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:14.820
<v Speaker 1>And there's another part which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally,</v>

2864
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:17.840
<v Speaker 1>could I fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would fix it because you can think,</v>

2865
02:29:17.841 --> 02:29:20.660
<v Speaker 1>well I could fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I won't know if you're being honest.</v>

2866
02:29:20.661 --> 02:29:21.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just won't do it.</v>

2867
02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:24.350
<v Speaker 1>But there's often something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would fix.</v>

2868
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Start there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>

2869
02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:30.170
<v Speaker 1>and then try again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to see if there's something else you</v>

2870
02:29:30.171 --> 02:29:31.004
<v Speaker 1>could fix.</v>

2871
02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to beat the lie,</v>

2872
02:29:33.890 --> 02:29:38.890
<v Speaker 1>you know you have to start with what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do and you start locally like right,</v>

2873
02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:41.060
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Locally.</v>

2874
02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:44.840
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell it's the right amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of local because it bugs you.</v>

2875
02:29:45.770 --> 02:29:49.760
<v Speaker 1>You could fix it and you will fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So perfect.</v>

2876
02:29:49.761 --> 02:29:52.340
<v Speaker 1>That's your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly your problem right there.</v>

2877
02:29:52.430 --> 02:29:53.263
<v Speaker 1>Fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then everything shifts a little </v>

2878
02:29:55.071 --> 02:29:56.210
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything around you is just.</v>

2879
02:29:56.450 --> 02:29:59.090
<v Speaker 1>The balance between chaos and order is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little better.</v>

2880
02:29:59.570 --> 02:30:00.403
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the same thing applies to your </v>

2881
02:30:01.131 --> 02:30:02.300
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2882
02:30:03.350 --> 02:30:05.030
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to lie here because otherwise I'm</v>

2883
02:30:05.031 --> 02:30:06.380
<v Speaker 1>going to get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2884
02:30:06.381 --> 02:30:07.214
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that's not the place to </v>

2885
02:30:08.091 --> 02:30:10.940
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the baby that's just foolhardy.</v>

2886
02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:12.313
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I say that you should lie in that </v>

2887
02:30:13.311 --> 02:30:16.400
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say I can't tell because I'm not</v>

2888
02:30:16.401 --> 02:30:18.470
<v Speaker 1>in the situation and the particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

2889
02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:19.610
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what to say.</v>

2890
02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:20.473
<v Speaker 1>That situation might be so awful that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do that isn't </v>

2891
02:30:22.881 --> 02:30:25.370
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about in your own home?</v>

2892
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:28.940
<v Speaker 1>How but in relationship to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2893
02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:29.893
<v Speaker 1>how about you start fixing up the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro lies that you leave lying around </v>

2894
02:30:32.871 --> 02:30:33.704
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's gonna make you tougher and </v>

2895
02:30:35.691 --> 02:30:36.524
<v Speaker 1>more formidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep practicing that for like 15 </v>

2896
02:30:38.931 --> 02:30:40.160
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2897
02:30:40.161 --> 02:30:45.161
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you'll be able to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to address some of the larger problems.</v>

2898
02:30:45.981 --> 02:30:46.814
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll even start to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the larger problems are because </v>

2899
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:51.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem with prematurely trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do too much.</v>

2900
02:30:51.801 --> 02:30:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2901
02:30:52.580 --> 02:30:53.840
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that really the problem?</v>

2902
02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:56.450
<v Speaker 1>And what makes you think you'll make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>better rather than worse?</v>

2903
02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:59.930
<v Speaker 1>It's got to pick the right size problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>

2904
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with little weights and work</v>

2905
02:31:03.171 --> 02:31:06.440
<v Speaker 1>yourself up and that's how you develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence anyways,</v>

2906
02:31:06.441 --> 02:31:07.274
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to figure out how </v>

2907
02:31:08.991 --> 02:31:09.824
<v Speaker 1>to set things straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well start where you can </v>

2908
02:31:13.521 --> 02:31:16.310
<v Speaker 1>set them straight and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's trivial.</v>

2909
02:31:16.311 --> 02:31:18.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think it's trivial.</v>

2910
02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:21.990
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea how important it might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be that you straighten up your,</v>

2911
02:31:22.410 --> 02:31:25.620
<v Speaker 1>your relationship with your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife or your son.</v>

2912
02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.990
<v Speaker 1>You may have no idea what that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead to.</v>

2913
02:31:28.410 --> 02:31:29.243
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think of what Stella and his </v>

2914
02:31:29.821 --> 02:31:31.500
<v Speaker 1>relationship with his father led to.</v>

2915
02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:34.740
<v Speaker 1>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2916
02:31:34.741 --> 02:31:38.010
<v Speaker 1>their salad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed like $60 million people.</v>

2917
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:43.070
<v Speaker 1>His father was a brute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that seemed reasonably important.</v>

2918
02:31:43.111 --> 02:31:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he shouldn't have been a brute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2919
02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:49.260
<v Speaker 1>So you know how horrible things can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do things wrong.</v>

2920
02:31:49.261 --> 02:31:49.711
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2921
02:31:49.711 --> 02:31:51.390
<v Speaker 1>how good can they be if you do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2922
02:31:51.450 --> 02:31:53.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try starting.</v>

2923
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:56.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My experience has been like I'm.</v>

2924
02:31:57.390 --> 02:31:58.223
<v Speaker 1>My experience has been that to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that I'm able to speak carefully </v>

2925
02:32:04.620 --> 02:32:09.180
<v Speaker 1>and I do speak carefully and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really care about the consequences.</v>

2926
02:32:09.450 --> 02:32:12.300
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't matter.</v>

2927
02:32:12.301 --> 02:32:16.350
<v Speaker 1>It's that I'm not speaking to produce a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>

2928
02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:17.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to say what seems to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the case and that for me that's </v>

2929
02:32:22.231 --> 02:32:27.231
<v Speaker 1>been incredibly ridiculously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm practically useful,</v>

2930
02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:28.973
<v Speaker 1>insanely useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's opened doors that I would've </v>

2931
02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:33.780
<v Speaker 1>never dreamed of opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2932
02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:34.653
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my professional life it's produced </v>

2933
02:32:36.151 --> 02:32:36.984
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of opportunities and it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real aid in my private life to it in </v>

2934
02:32:40.381 --> 02:32:43.760
<v Speaker 1>my professional life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I don't make mistakes like</v>

2935
02:32:43.761 --> 02:32:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I am.</v>

2936
02:32:46.860 --> 02:32:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I would never think of myself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally a good person.</v>

2937
02:32:51.270 --> 02:32:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe I'm fundamentally a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

2938
02:32:54.390 --> 02:32:55.710
<v Speaker 1>but because our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2939
02:32:55.711 --> 02:32:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I have dark thoughts and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2940
02:32:58.710 --> 02:33:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite temperamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like</v>

2941
02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:05.860
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2942
02:33:05.870 --> 02:33:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I do what I can to deal with all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't do it perfectly.</v>

2943
02:33:08.871 --> 02:33:13.070
<v Speaker 1>And I slide backwards mostly by </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoidance,</v>

2944
02:33:13.071 --> 02:33:15.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't always stay on top of the things</v>

2945
02:33:15.050 --> 02:33:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I should stay on top of,</v>

2946
02:33:16.050 --> 02:33:16.883
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2947
02:33:18.610 --> 02:33:23.610
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that I've been able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adhere to this mode of being,</v>

2948
02:33:25.330 --> 02:33:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of a single thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened that hasn't been</v>

2949
02:33:31.890 --> 02:33:34.590
<v Speaker 1>like in some ways beyond my </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations.</v>

2950
02:33:35.220 --> 02:33:36.053
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really fun talking to this </v>

2951
02:33:38.130 --> 02:33:38.940
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2952
02:33:38.940 --> 02:33:39.773
<v Speaker 1>because it's fun with the lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I'm talking about the </v>

2953
02:33:42.331 --> 02:33:46.350
<v Speaker 1>mythological material and I can sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort out the stories,</v>

2954
02:33:47.040 --> 02:33:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I can just see lights going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

2955
02:33:48.691 --> 02:33:49.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2956
02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:50.753
<v Speaker 1>you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can tell when someone has </v>

2957
02:33:53.041 --> 02:33:53.874
<v Speaker 1>an insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they opened their eyes a bit </v>

2958
02:33:54.721 --> 02:33:55.554
<v Speaker 1>more detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's it because it's a bit of a </v>

2959
02:33:56.401 --> 02:34:00.120
<v Speaker 1>surprise so you can detect it and it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like light going on.</v>

2960
02:34:00.121 --> 02:34:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2961
02:34:01.141 --> 02:34:01.974
<v Speaker 1>I'll walk someone suit three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say through this Egyptian story and </v>

2962
02:34:04.441 --> 02:34:06.360
<v Speaker 1>audience and they just go pick to click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

2963
02:34:06.361 --> 02:34:07.194
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>

2964
02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:08.820
<v Speaker 1>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun.</v>

2965
02:34:09.330 --> 02:34:10.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2966
02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:11.783
<v Speaker 1>people seem to respond to it positively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've always been completely </v>

2967
02:34:14.971 --> 02:34:16.510
<v Speaker 1>surprised about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2968
02:34:16.530 --> 02:34:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been able to lecture about the</v>

2969
02:34:18.701 --> 02:34:21.180
<v Speaker 1>things that I lecture about without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2970
02:34:21.430 --> 02:34:24.670
<v Speaker 1>running mightily afoul of something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2971
02:34:24.730 --> 02:34:25.563
<v Speaker 1>because my classes are quite different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the standard psychology class or </v>

2972
02:34:31.261 --> 02:34:33.890
<v Speaker 1>the standard university class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very different and.</v>

2973
02:34:34.170 --> 02:34:35.003
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know so far it seems to be </v>

2974
02:34:38.641 --> 02:34:41.310
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So which is a surprise to me.</v>

2975
02:34:43.010 --> 02:34:43.843
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would say to people is </v>

2976
02:34:47.151 --> 02:34:52.151
<v Speaker 1>like select the domain in which you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>act straightened it up first and that'll</v>

2977
02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.490
<v Speaker 1>transform things a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2978
02:34:55.491 --> 02:34:56.420
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll,</v>

2979
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:57.343
<v Speaker 1>you put your house in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can start to put your town in </v>

2980
02:35:00.381 --> 02:35:02.570
<v Speaker 1>order or maybe your street or maybe your</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor.</v>

2981
02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:03.890
<v Speaker 1>God only knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2982
02:35:04.130 --> 02:35:07.640
<v Speaker 1>start where you can start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

2983
02:35:07.641 --> 02:35:09.710
<v Speaker 1>well that's what's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2984
02:35:09.711 --> 02:35:11.870
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing you can wave a placard in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the street about,</v>

2985
02:35:11.871 --> 02:35:14.120
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing that's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>praying in public,</v>

2986
02:35:14.121 --> 02:35:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is more like praying in private fix</v>

2987
02:35:17.571 --> 02:35:20.540
<v Speaker 1>up what you can fix up and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

2988
02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:23.420
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more powerful than that.</v>
