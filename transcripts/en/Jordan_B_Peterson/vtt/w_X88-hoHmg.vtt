1
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.153
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use this picture to represent my </v>

2
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:09.414
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not know anything about this </v>

3
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.991
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a picture of Jonah being thrown out</v>

4
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>of a whale's belly after spending three </v>
<v Speaker 1>days inside.</v>

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>It's an old biblical story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a myth.</v>

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a fairy tale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.743
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that in a derogative </v>

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know for example,</v>

9
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>that somebody gribbins brothers' </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairytales are perhaps 50,000 years old.</v>

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>It'd be traced back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The really,</v>

11
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:41.724
<v Speaker 1>really old and old stories are strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're strange because only been </v>

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>told generation after generation after </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>so you can imagine that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>retooled over such an expansive,</v>

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>expansive time has been reduced to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>just many,</v>

15
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:01.510
<v Speaker 1>many times and nothing in the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

16
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 1>It's all meaningful in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like a a story that's one way of</v>

17
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>thinking about imagine that you took 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

18
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.223
<v Speaker 1>hundred adventure books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you had to extract out the central </v>

19
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>features of an adventure.</v>

20
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>For now it's hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're averaging across the or</v>

21
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instilling them in some manner.</v>

22
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.843
<v Speaker 1>You get up Amanda and denture and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like a myth upon which all </v>

23
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>adventures are based and this story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually one of those stores,</v>

24
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to tell you what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story means,</v>

25
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that this is all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

26
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>because most stories of this sort are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense in exhaustible,</v>

27
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 1>just like great works of art are </v>
<v Speaker 1>inexhaustible there.</v>

28
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>There's more information in them than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can possibly articulate.</v>

29
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound.</v>

30
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.163
<v Speaker 1>That's why you go look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise someone could just </v>

31
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>tell you about paying and that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of that,</v>

32
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

33
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>so Jonah is being stood up by this whale</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course on your face,</v>

34
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>if that's an impossibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

35
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>live inside a whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's impossible.</v>

36
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may remember and likely do that.</v>

37
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>You all know a story about someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>is inside whale.</v>

38
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:28.600
<v Speaker 1>That's Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you go to that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even as an adult,</v>

41
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.973
<v Speaker 1>you watch that movie and Japan goes down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and the whale and doesn't mean </v>

42
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>quote this big cavernous inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really care that that's,</v>

43
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things you don't care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

44
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't care that these are drawings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not real people.</v>

45
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.503
<v Speaker 1>You don't care about that and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care that inside of a whale isn't a </v>

46
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>cavern and you don't care that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio's a puppet for that matter.</v>

47
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>None of that matters to you all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because you're really strange</v>

48
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.470
<v Speaker 1>creatures and you don't even notice when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something out.</v>

49
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of those times when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

50
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>But if someone taps you on the shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

51
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're just watching drawings of a </v>

52
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>puppet operates can really move the </v>
<v Speaker 1>condom asleep and now he's at the bottom</v>

53
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>of the ocean.</v>

54
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.493
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea why he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescue his father and you're just </v>

55
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>sitting there and all you're okay with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

56
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.943
<v Speaker 1>And you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up because I want to finish </v>

57
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>watching the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's interesting.</v>

58
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.573
<v Speaker 1>You see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tells you something about your </v>

59
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.244
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a psychoanalytically minded </v>

60
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>because you're doing something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot account for now,</v>

61
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:44.044
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>it's enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.830
<v Speaker 1>that's deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

64
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>You're really going a long ways with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

65
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>The it is a why is it comprehensive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will be why is it enjoyable?</v>

66
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.213
<v Speaker 1>See just exactly what are you doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and you think that whatever you </v>

67
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>are doing there is so valuable that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>will actually pay to do it.</v>

68
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

69
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:10.234
<v Speaker 1>very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know when you read about let's </v>

70
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:14.614
<v Speaker 1>say the archaic ritual of tribal people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you ask yourself just what are they </v>

71
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>

72
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up to the same thing that you're</v>

73
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.713
<v Speaker 1>up to when you go see a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might also notice that the </v>

74
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:30.634
<v Speaker 1>most expensive artifacts or among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most expensive artifacts that human </v>

75
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.044
<v Speaker 1>beings create our movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been hundreds of millions of </v>

76
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>dollars on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we consider that a good deal.</v>

77
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drives our technology too because the</v>

78
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:50.790
<v Speaker 1>high tech movies like the marvel movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that require so much computer animation,</v>

79
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.390
<v Speaker 1>they actually drive the demand for high </v>
<v Speaker 1>end graphics chips.</v>

80
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.930
<v Speaker 1>So our technological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds forward,</v>

81
00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:58.764
<v Speaker 1>is actually motivated in part by her </v>
<v Speaker 1>desire to represent things fictionally </v>

82
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.960
<v Speaker 1>in evermore spectacular manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So John,</v>

83
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.060
<v Speaker 1>well let me tell you the story of Jonah</v>

84
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.930
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you why I'm going to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

85
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.113
<v Speaker 1>This is from Camille Paglia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a critic of the modern university </v>

86
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.710
<v Speaker 1>and very brilliant woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

87
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>very controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>credibly rapid speaker.</v>

88
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.550
<v Speaker 1>She can think so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just unbelievable.</v>

89
00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:31.740
<v Speaker 1>She's really fun to watch it if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

90
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vicious adversary in an argument.</v>

91
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.953
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one problem in academia </v>

92
00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:40.740
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not ignorant students.</v>

93
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.013
<v Speaker 1>Professors</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's substitute narrow expertise and </v>

94
00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:51.860
<v Speaker 1>theoretical sophistication of foster's </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned for breadth and depth of learning</v>

95
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.813
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History of art and thought our isn't </v>

96
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>interconnected with work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fabricated tradition,</v>

97
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.800
<v Speaker 1>overconcentration on any one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't distortion.</v>

98
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>

99
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.283
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled with this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To understand some of the things that </v>

100
00:06:18.971 --> 00:06:19.804
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to teach you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things that you kind of </v>

101
00:06:24.581 --> 00:06:26.530
<v Speaker 1>have to grasp as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

102
00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:27.364
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have a flash of insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of things that you didn't </v>

103
00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:31.810
<v Speaker 1>know were related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't done that.</v>

104
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.713
<v Speaker 1>That's supposed to happen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy when you link different </v>

105
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.680
<v Speaker 1>disparate patterns of behavior together </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've linked them saying with a</v>

106
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.160
<v Speaker 1>single cause and you get this like cited</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of illumination and possibility</v>

107
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.480
<v Speaker 1>and there are forms of communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>that require the simultaneous Lee,</v>

108
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.910
<v Speaker 1>the simultaneous realization of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>multitude of disparate.</v>

109
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

110
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.210
<v Speaker 1>You can be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

111
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.343
<v Speaker 1>you listen to a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch a movie and then you don't </v>

112
00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:15.010
<v Speaker 1>know what the hell's going on and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>something happens near the end and</v>

113
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:17.613
<v Speaker 1>everything fits together and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you started seeing the thing as </v>

114
00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:22.990
<v Speaker 1>a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the things that we.</v>

115
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.060
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the ways that we interact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world that are mysterious</v>

116
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.850
<v Speaker 1>are like that there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what Pega is referring to is</v>

117
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:34.684
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a psychoanalytic </v>

118
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.860
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say our romantic proposition,</v>

119
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:40.290
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

120
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no idea roughly is that</v>

121
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.873
<v Speaker 1>way out in the periphery of reality or </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things that not only do you </v>

122
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>not know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't even know you don't know,</v>

123
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric completely blind to their existence</v>

124
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.174
<v Speaker 1>and then there's unknown things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some suspicions about him and </v>

125
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:00.304
<v Speaker 1>there's unknown things that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to imagine and act out and </v>

126
00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:06.524
<v Speaker 1>dramatize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so all of that is on the periphery </v>

127
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 1>of our knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of psychoanalytic dictum.</v>

128
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.233
<v Speaker 1>Where do thoughts come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just getting dreams are the </v>

129
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 1>birthplace of thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantasy.</v>

130
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not that surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantasy is the birthplace of ideas.</v>

131
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:25.544
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what you're gonna do in </v>

132
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:27.764
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You enter into a reverie of dream state </v>

133
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.903
<v Speaker 1>and you contemplate multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities and then you start </v>

134
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:36.104
<v Speaker 1>thinking through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use your imagination to search beyond </v>

135
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.543
<v Speaker 1>where you are and the collective human </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to do that is our mysterious </v>

136
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.024
<v Speaker 1>humanistic artistic tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very difficult to justify from </v>

137
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 1>a formal articular point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What good is dance?</v>

138
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you're doing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing?</v>

139
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't care because you like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dance.</v>

140
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do spill into you music.</v>

142
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.553
<v Speaker 1>Music's a human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Universal cultures used music to </v>

143
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

144
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>They use music to catalyze their </v>
<v Speaker 1>identities.</v>

145
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 1>They use music to unite around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No and more archaic societies.</v>

146
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Less differentiate societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say no.</v>

147
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.233
<v Speaker 1>A mask to represents part of the family </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition will have a particular design </v>

148
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.410
<v Speaker 1>and there'll be a particular song </v>
<v Speaker 1>written for it and he'll be a particular</v>

149
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.323
<v Speaker 1>dance about the song and the dance or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the symbolic </v>

150
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 1>representation of a mode of being in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

151
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:47.784
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe the mask is a wolf mask and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we locked out the wolf and there's </v>

152
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:52.860
<v Speaker 1>music that goes along with that and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

153
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:53.694
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing when you're acting </v>

154
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:56.510
<v Speaker 1>out the wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of that is what you're trying.</v>

155
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.560
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to understand both it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an event.</v>

156
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 1>It's imitation in part and you know if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in the natural world and if you</v>

157
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 1>have attended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're preyed upon,</v>

158
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.113
<v Speaker 1>then understanding the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hunting and preying upon is </v>

159
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:10.434
<v Speaker 1>useful and there's also perhaps perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful things to learn from them and so </v>

160
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.640
<v Speaker 1>we play this strange symbolic game with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world like children's pretending.</v>

161
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.593
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we do that to act out and to begin </v>

162
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:30.921
<v Speaker 1>to understand things we don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how it asks us.</v>

163
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.513
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important question in life is </v>

164
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>not</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the world is made of</v>

165
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.010
<v Speaker 1>and in fact I would say that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively new preoccupation of,</v>

166
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.890
<v Speaker 1>of humankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

167
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.060
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really formalize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say that the ancient Greeks</v>

168
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.730
<v Speaker 1>originated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid the groundwork for the emergence of</v>

169
00:11:00.731 --> 00:11:01.900
<v Speaker 1>an empirical science</v>

170
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.140
<v Speaker 3>and then</v>

171
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.750
<v Speaker 1>it emerged more formally with Bacon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Descartes Newton</v>

172
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.660
<v Speaker 1>600 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not very long,</v>

173
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:17.450
<v Speaker 1>like a blink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blink of the eye in human terms</v>

174
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

175
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.050
<v Speaker 1>People were engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can build things and so forth,</v>

176
00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:26.810
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know how it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't scientists.</v>

177
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.950
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really conceptualize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world as an objective place.</v>

178
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.840
<v Speaker 1>We do that automatically because science</v>
<v Speaker 1>seats so far into our</v>

179
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.330
<v Speaker 1>set of presuppositions that doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>us good scientists by the way,</v>

180
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:42.523
<v Speaker 1>but it does make us believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental reality of the world is an </v>

181
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:51.410
<v Speaker 1>objective real and I'm not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dispute that you get early,</v>

182
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>but leaves one set of questions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>answered</v>

183
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.653
<v Speaker 1>probably by its nature because it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to answer the question than </v>

184
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:02.794
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of us.</v>

185
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.993
<v Speaker 1>How should one conduct oneself in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and that's an important thing </v>

186
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:11.014
<v Speaker 1>since you're alive and academically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rather stay alive and while you're </v>

187
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.023
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't want to suffer </v>

188
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.833
<v Speaker 1>anymore than you have to and no more </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidly than you have to and it might </v>

189
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 1>also be good if some of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted actually happen and so you're</v>

190
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:27.364
<v Speaker 1>motivated to know how to act and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are always telling each other how to </v>

191
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're sending each other information all</v>

192
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:36.290
<v Speaker 1>the time about how to actually do that.</v>

193
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.960
<v Speaker 1>What are the expressions on her face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course when we parked the people,</v>

194
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:40.803
<v Speaker 1>we always look at their face and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their face tells you what </v>

195
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.510
<v Speaker 1>they're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

196
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.620
<v Speaker 1>If they're smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to you,</v>

197
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 1>well then you can assume that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something right.</v>

198
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.110
<v Speaker 1>And if they're looking annoyed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed it,</v>

199
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.953
<v Speaker 1>that's a particularly bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you might think you might take a </v>

200
00:12:58.541 --> 00:12:59.374
<v Speaker 1>hit from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you know three or four </v>

201
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 1>people are doing it at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're reflecting,</v>

202
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.490
<v Speaker 1>reflecting some ideal for one another </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

203
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.283
<v Speaker 1>And the more attentive you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to act in </v>

204
00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:17.104
<v Speaker 1>accordance with that ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more like you like who you are </v>

205
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:20.764
<v Speaker 1>to move towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not even know what the ideal is </v>

206
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 1>in an articulate sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

207
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:26.160
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

208
00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:27.930
<v Speaker 1>you could come up with a while.</v>

209
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I get no good person is nice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly and cooperative.</v>

210
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

211
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 1>That's all just cliche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't know your conception might</v>

212
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.273
<v Speaker 1>be very hollow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very likely that it's very hard </v>

213
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.620
<v Speaker 1>even though he may be back in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

214
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:48.170
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a story I'd say historic,</v>

215
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.990
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what would happen,</v>

216
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.053
<v Speaker 1>collected a bunch of stories and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you extracted out of the story from and </v>

217
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.050
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a story about destiny and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's couched in a religious language.</v>

218
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay because most of these </v>

219
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.293
<v Speaker 1>distilled stories are formed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The foundation of religious texts and </v>

220
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.690
<v Speaker 1>religious texts and Agnes and myths and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories are,</v>

221
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.733
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the outer perimeter of our </v>

222
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a,</v>

223
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.153
<v Speaker 1>they have a coherent nature and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>form a foundation and it's on that </v>

224
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>foundation that everything that you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>for granted risks,</v>

225
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>

226
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.483
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a metaphysical idea that </v>

227
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.460
<v Speaker 1>underlies western civilization and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical idea is that the individual</v>

228
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.390
<v Speaker 1>has transcendent worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

229
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea from which the notion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural rights is derived.</v>

230
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.463
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our legal system is predicated on the </v>

231
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:57.611
<v Speaker 1>idea that you have certain natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights that are enshrined in the bill of</v>

232
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:59.090
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

233
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.553
<v Speaker 1>and you're in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have built the bill of rights </v>

234
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 1>was being formulated within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation.</v>

235
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Original legislation that founded the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state is being formulated.</v>

236
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.570
<v Speaker 1>The formulator said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hold these truths to be self evident.</v>

237
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.980
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're axioms of faith.</v>

238
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 1>They're propositions and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>proof for them.</v>

239
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 1>They're their mode of operation in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and so the hypothesis is something</v>

240
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:30.584
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

241
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.300
<v Speaker 1>if I treat you like there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you that has transcendent value,</v>

242
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.960
<v Speaker 1>implicit intrinsic value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might be,</v>

243
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.510
<v Speaker 1>there are stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vocab,</v>

244
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.550
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk about and you do the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

245
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>and then we set up a body of laws that </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize this,</v>

246
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.223
<v Speaker 1>the sovereignty of the individual so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the law itself has to act with </v>

247
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:55.250
<v Speaker 1>respect towards every individual.</v>

248
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Even if that individual has done </v>
<v Speaker 1>something reprehensible,</v>

249
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 1>which is very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>

250
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:06.310
<v Speaker 1>then our society will work better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

251
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 1>perhaps that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for better or worse,</v>

252
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.890
<v Speaker 1>that is what this society is predicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and that's a very,</v>

253
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:16.491
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

254
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:17.151
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

255
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:17.984
<v Speaker 1>very old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an idea that people came to with </v>

256
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 1>great difficulty because it was over </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years that people learn how</v>

257
00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:32.120
<v Speaker 1>to take their little tribal groups which</v>
<v Speaker 1>are always squabbling with one another.</v>

258
00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.413
<v Speaker 1>As human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very violent and tribal groups </v>

259
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:36.944
<v Speaker 1>are by no means civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no noble savage like the </v>

260
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:41.534
<v Speaker 1>Europeans thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You studied tribal groups in the world </v>

261
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The murder,</v>

262
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.870
<v Speaker 1>the death rate by violence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably high,</v>

263
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.513
<v Speaker 1>so</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that unites a tribe within a </v>

264
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.490
<v Speaker 1>tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often kinships,</v>

265
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.363
<v Speaker 1>but then tribes come together to form </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger civilizations and they have to </v>

266
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:58.963
<v Speaker 1>determine some sort of method of </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle that guides them so that they </v>

267
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:03.014
<v Speaker 1>can cooperate and come together without </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying one another and they have to </v>

268
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.033
<v Speaker 1>extract out of principle by which the </v>
<v Speaker 1>society might function and that has to </v>

269
00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:11.684
<v Speaker 1>work and then as societies get bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bigger and bigger and bigger and </v>

270
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:14.954
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to bring more and more of </v>

271
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:19.810
<v Speaker 1>these diverse traditions together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract something from them.</v>

272
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.810
<v Speaker 1>It has power and functional utility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that allows people to unite.</v>

273
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.493
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the stories that talks </v>

274
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:32.054
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a storybook individual </v>

275
00:17:34.821 --> 00:17:39.800
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not heated,</v>

276
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:41.743
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we could say you are a social </v>

277
00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:45.884
<v Speaker 1>creature linked to the core and of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is other people and those </v>

278
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.740
<v Speaker 1>other people want something from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want something from them.</v>

279
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.980
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to play games with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're either going to be good at it,</v>

280
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:01.720
<v Speaker 1>you're going to bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to play games with them</v>

281
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.200
<v Speaker 1>and so the game might have rules where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you sophisticated</v>

282
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.583
<v Speaker 1>and you'd expect that because as </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior more and more approximates an </v>

283
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:13.704
<v Speaker 1>ideal student sets a thing exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then more and more sophisticated than </v>

284
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.003
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the ideal is perhaps more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more complex and physical can </v>

285
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:26.190
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a hint of that stuff.</v>

286
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.063
<v Speaker 1>We can get a hint of this because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>will see if you pay attention to your </v>

287
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 1>own soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your psyche,</v>

288
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:36.603
<v Speaker 1>your unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will see that there are people that </v>

289
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:43.311
<v Speaker 1>you admire and the people that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt for it and that's,</v>

290
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.590
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're 100 percent accurate in your</v>

291
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:47.424
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's not such a bad idea to </v>

292
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:54.210
<v Speaker 1>criticize here first</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressions,</v>

293
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:55.883
<v Speaker 1>but those states exist and so there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason you admire someone and there's a </v>

294
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:02.664
<v Speaker 1>reason you have contempt for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be multiple reasons and that's </v>

295
00:19:05.281 --> 00:19:06.114
<v Speaker 1>a hit to your intrinsic value structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hint about your intrinsic value </v>

296
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't admire someone unless there</v>

297
00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:13.464
<v Speaker 1>was something about them that you value </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps that you would also like to </v>

298
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:21.381
<v Speaker 1>be able to do and you wouldn't despise </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone or have contempt for them if you</v>

299
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:22.554
<v Speaker 1>didn't feel that something they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing was wrong and that it would be </v>

300
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:25.530
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

301
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.363
<v Speaker 1>If you get it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're bringing to bear on the </v>

302
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:29.514
<v Speaker 1>situation and implicit morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to do that because as I </v>

303
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:33.984
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can act without a morality because </v>

304
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.073
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to make things </v>

305
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:47.481
<v Speaker 1>better that otherwise why bother and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acting to make things better than</v>

306
00:19:48.891 --> 00:19:51.240
<v Speaker 1>some things have to be better at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things have to be worse,</v>

307
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:54.390
<v Speaker 1>and that's a value structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have one.</v>

308
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.840
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Jonah</v>

309
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.060
<v Speaker 1>gets a call from God and God tells him </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a city,</v>

310
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Nineveh that's falling into moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>disarray.</v>

311
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

312
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a universal story.</v>

313
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like all cultures are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling into disarray.</v>

314
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.210
<v Speaker 1>It's their nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just entropy does that,</v>

315
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things change.</v>

316
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.053
<v Speaker 1>The world changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The environment changes in the culture </v>

317
00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:29.694
<v Speaker 1>doesn't keep up very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course it has corrupt the </v>

318
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:35.220
<v Speaker 1>elements and so it's an interior eternal</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

319
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.503
<v Speaker 1>The individual is always placed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to a culture that somewhat </v>

320
00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and then the question is well do</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and if the answer is nothing,</v>

321
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 1>well then it'll just get more corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the answer is be corrupt too,</v>

322
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.133
<v Speaker 1>then it will just get more corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the answer has to be to host the </v>

323
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:02.730
<v Speaker 1>corruption because that's the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to start.</v>

324
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.733
<v Speaker 1>Now God threatens to destroy this city </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of its corruption and I don't </v>

325
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:12.214
<v Speaker 1>think you need to presume anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular the metaphysical about that </v>

326
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.013
<v Speaker 1>to understand that it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward that the more corrupt </v>

327
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:24.820
<v Speaker 1>the culture is and the less trust is </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible between individuals,</v>

328
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 1>the less productive with the culture is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be because why do anything?</v>

329
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 1>If some person is going to come and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

330
00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 1>you know it might even be these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different culture is so corrupted.</v>

331
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:39.220
<v Speaker 1>If you aren't good for something and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce resources,</v>

332
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.143
<v Speaker 1>you're actually more likely to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed because you have something of </v>

333
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:44.400
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like there's just,</v>

334
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.080
<v Speaker 1>you're just not going anywhere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

335
00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:46.983
<v Speaker 1>And why would you work if you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any sense that you know you could </v>

336
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:54.070
<v Speaker 1>store up the value of your work for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable time in the future.</v>

337
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.430
<v Speaker 1>So if this society is corrupt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no trust,</v>

338
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.220
<v Speaker 1>it's degenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might live for a while,</v>

339
00:22:00.221 --> 00:22:03.260
<v Speaker 1>but he isn't going to last very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the idea.</v>

340
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Corrupt society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's collapsed.</v>

341
00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Stephanie is open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What corruption means anyways,</v>

342
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Jonah fake snow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bloody way.</v>

343
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to that city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can go to hell as far as I'm </v>

344
00:22:18.111 --> 00:22:18.944
<v Speaker 1>concerned and that's really what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks and why in the world should I do </v>

345
00:22:21.771 --> 00:22:25.040
<v Speaker 1>anything about it anyways?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are good objections.</v>

346
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>

347
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.530
<v Speaker 1>And you'll face this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me in your life,</v>

348
00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.780
<v Speaker 1>you will face this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

349
00:22:32.781 --> 00:22:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you've already do always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>

350
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:35.953
<v Speaker 1>continually in small ways perhaps when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with people who </v>

351
00:22:39.861 --> 00:22:42.680
<v Speaker 1>aren't treating you properly when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting,</v>

352
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.750
<v Speaker 1>and those might be your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be your friends,</v>

353
00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:46.430
<v Speaker 1>they might be people that can work </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

354
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.020
<v Speaker 1>they might be professors,</v>

355
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:55.140
<v Speaker 1>they're playing a crooked game and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like and you know it's crooked.</v>

356
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.930
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you do about,</v>

357
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know your credit,</v>

358
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crooked.</v>

359
00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not so good to play along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

360
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.110
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you know it's crooked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own standard,</v>

361
00:23:06.111 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>devalues it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D degrades you to play a long winter,</v>

362
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.430
<v Speaker 1>you to stand up and oppose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

363
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:16.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>

364
00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.533
<v Speaker 1>You're probably gonna do Jonah did you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to ship and get the hell out </v>

365
00:23:20.661 --> 00:23:24.590
<v Speaker 1>of there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's a logical thing to do,</v>

366
00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:25.424
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this has something to do </v>

367
00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:32.210
<v Speaker 1>with human ethical responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are other old stories,</v>

368
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:38.300
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you one like me were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>son of the king,</v>

369
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.460
<v Speaker 1>the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the son of the king.</v>

370
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 1>He goes and he's pathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent,</v>

371
00:23:46.911 --> 00:23:47.744
<v Speaker 1>and then he shamed by the reappearance </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his old girlfriend and him turning </v>

372
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:52.304
<v Speaker 1>into something vaguely useful and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>opens his eyes and he goes back and he </v>

373
00:23:55.701 --> 00:24:00.230
<v Speaker 1>fights scar and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a scene of hell,</v>

374
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:01.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's fire everywhere.</v>

375
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.700
<v Speaker 1>He fights scar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scar killed.</v>

376
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 1>His father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>casts him into the pit,</v>

377
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.383
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the rain comes and then you </v>

378
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:17.591
<v Speaker 1>know the movie returns to its beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamental Paradise,</v>

379
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Paradise lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise regained.</v>

380
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.063
<v Speaker 1>That's the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and that's the story of human </v>

381
00:24:25.161 --> 00:24:25.994
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're in a place that's </v>

382
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:27.734
<v Speaker 1>working out pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something happens to knock you off your </v>

383
00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:31.424
<v Speaker 1>perch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're down in chaos for a good amount </v>

384
00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:34.154
<v Speaker 1>of time and maybe you never get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you learn something down </v>

385
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:40.100
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you strengthen your character,</v>

386
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:45.190
<v Speaker 1>then you pop up to a new place and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better and better.</v>

387
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.790
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

388
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being overly optimistic about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

389
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:51.980
<v Speaker 1>I know perfectly well that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter</v>

390
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.850
<v Speaker 1>impediments during their life that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>find almost impossible to recover from,</v>

391
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:04.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's the best shot you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

392
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Jordan runs away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God is very happy about that because</v>

393
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:09.584
<v Speaker 1>it's actually Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his destiny is necessary for Jonah to </v>

394
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:17.591
<v Speaker 1>repair the city so God sends a storm</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the waves were high and I think what</v>

395
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:21.554
<v Speaker 1>that means is because the water is often</v>
<v Speaker 1>a symbol for the unconscious and that's </v>

396
00:25:24.801 --> 00:25:25.634
<v Speaker 1>because things learned down there in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and then you could pull up that </v>

397
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.770
<v Speaker 1>are useful monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you can pull up,</v>

398
00:25:30.771 --> 00:25:34.220
<v Speaker 1>their useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fish for the fishing in your own</v>

399
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.113
<v Speaker 1>being for answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do when you try to </v>

400
00:25:36.981 --> 00:25:37.814
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ask yourself the question and maybe </v>

401
00:25:40.961 --> 00:25:42.470
<v Speaker 1>you can answer appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

402
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.513
<v Speaker 1>where did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know what the answer was </v>

403
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.373
<v Speaker 1>before it appeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it just popped into being an </v>

404
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.770
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

405
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.060
<v Speaker 1>So you finish.</v>

406
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.533
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waves come and the bolt's going to </v>

407
00:25:58.581 --> 00:26:00.470
<v Speaker 1>be knocked over it and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

408
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:01.304
<v Speaker 1>I think when know when you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do something mean everyone has </v>

409
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.963
<v Speaker 1>the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe perhaps you would be willing </v>

410
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:11.120
<v Speaker 1>to put up your hands if this experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>is foreign to.</v>

411
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.493
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's part of you telling you you </v>

412
00:26:15.381 --> 00:26:16.214
<v Speaker 1>should do something and it's hard to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it effortful and maybe you're afraid of </v>

413
00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:21.620
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't do it.</v>

414
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:23.420
<v Speaker 1>You just procrastinate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

415
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.360
<v Speaker 1>And so how do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

416
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>

417
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.920
<v Speaker 1>You feel that you're betraying yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your anxiety actually gets worse,</v>

418
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:34.754
<v Speaker 1>not better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you know you can put it off </v>

419
00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:38.420
<v Speaker 1>moment for moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't help because every time</v>

420
00:26:38.421 --> 00:26:40.520
<v Speaker 1>you put it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anxiety just grows a little bit.</v>

421
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.290
<v Speaker 1>You're proud of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a sense that</v>

422
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.740
<v Speaker 1>you're making things more chaotic than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be known.</v>

423
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:49.703
<v Speaker 1>If you do that long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure many of you have not </v>

424
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:52.683
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that long enough at that </v>

425
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:56.760
<v Speaker 1>becomes habitual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things will get so stormy around you.</v>

426
00:26:56.761 --> 00:27:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Then you will fall right into this feed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the chaos,</v>

427
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.990
<v Speaker 1>into the watery chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you'll drown.</v>

428
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a very good idea to run from</v>
<v Speaker 1>your destiny.</v>

429
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.563
<v Speaker 1>Let's say</v>

430
00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might be and you need an </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimate.</v>

431
00:27:14.711 --> 00:27:19.600
<v Speaker 1>You need it because that's what gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>you meaning and you need meaning in your</v>

432
00:27:19.601 --> 00:27:20.434
<v Speaker 1>life because life is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you need something to boxes </v>

433
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.680
<v Speaker 1>yourself against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

434
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:28.873
<v Speaker 1>we make Jonah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah says that's probably my fault </v>

435
00:27:30.731 --> 00:27:31.564
<v Speaker 1>because like I'm running away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>something I'm supposed to do and you </v>

436
00:27:33.311 --> 00:27:36.040
<v Speaker 1>know on gardens very happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you just throw me over.</v>

437
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crew is very happy about that,</v>

438
00:27:39.101 --> 00:27:39.934
<v Speaker 1>but the waves are really starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with Joan is pretty insistent </v>

439
00:27:42.311 --> 00:27:43.144
<v Speaker 1>that he's the cause of the problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe draw free draw lots and Jonah </v>

440
00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.813
<v Speaker 1>is chosen and so they decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse it into the ocean and </v>

441
00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.093
<v Speaker 1>immediately everything's calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a center of chaos because he's </v>

442
00:28:00.851 --> 00:28:03.670
<v Speaker 1>not doing what he's supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

443
00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Well then a whale comes up and swallowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whale for three days.</v>

444
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.183
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

445
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

446
00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.880
<v Speaker 1>that's the way all the dependencies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>drag,</v>

447
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.760
<v Speaker 1>it's that thing that you have to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and conquer,</v>

448
00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 1>get something of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

449
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.640
<v Speaker 1>when you made an error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you</v>

450
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.040
<v Speaker 1>fallen off the path where you deviated </v>
<v Speaker 1>from what you know you should do,</v>

451
00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.730
<v Speaker 1>you produces a state of internal chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and worried and concerned.</v>

452
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.230
<v Speaker 1>You're thrust into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thrust into unknown territory and</v>

453
00:28:48.231 --> 00:28:49.064
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do and that's </v>

454
00:28:51.411 --> 00:28:54.350
<v Speaker 1>often symbolized by have you encountered</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a monster,</v>

455
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.860
<v Speaker 1>like a dragging somebody that lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the water.</v>

456
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:58.843
<v Speaker 1>That's I think the reason for that is as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I've been able to tell is that </v>

457
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.200
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we'd be prey animals for forever</v>

458
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.840
<v Speaker 1>in her battle with carnivorous lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

459
00:29:08.841 --> 00:29:09.674
<v Speaker 1>and alligators and even dinosaurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there were dinosaurs around at </v>

460
00:29:12.741 --> 00:29:13.574
<v Speaker 1>the time of our most distant ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was even a cap at one point that </v>

461
00:29:16.881 --> 00:29:21.881
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was adapted with pierce human skulls,</v>

462
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.413
<v Speaker 1>so it had a head that was exactly shaped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grab you here through the back of </v>

463
00:29:29.001 --> 00:29:29.810
<v Speaker 1>your skull.</v>

464
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.820
<v Speaker 1>So like we've come through some rough </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

465
00:29:31.821 --> 00:29:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a system in our mind.</v>

466
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:37.363
<v Speaker 1>It's a threat Predator detection system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that makes little kids </v>

467
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.570
<v Speaker 1>thinking about monsters in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

468
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Because while there is monsters in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

469
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 1>parents always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

470
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:50.440
<v Speaker 1>there's no monsters in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not true.</v>

471
00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:51.613
<v Speaker 1>Dark is full of monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might not be any in your room </v>

472
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:54.604
<v Speaker 1>right at that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean there aren't </v>

473
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.243
<v Speaker 1>monsters in the dark crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take place like criminals don't get up </v>

474
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:03.620
<v Speaker 1>at six in the morning and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

475
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 1>have breakfast and go rob a bank can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing at night.</v>

476
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.153
<v Speaker 1>People do the things that are fit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the night tonight and lots of predators </v>

477
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:20.131
<v Speaker 1>are nocturnal and you can't see very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well in the dark and kids aren't stupid.</v>

478
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:21.543
<v Speaker 1>They've evolved to stay pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the fire because of the kids </v>

479
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:27.424
<v Speaker 1>that wandered away from the fire kicked </v>
<v Speaker 1>off by hyenas and lions and crocodiles </v>

480
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and whatever else the hell it was out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to eat the unwary.</v>

481
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.480
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

482
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.340
<v Speaker 1>the circuit that we use to defend </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves against predators.</v>

483
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:51.853
<v Speaker 1>As we've evolved cortically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that circuit has come to represent what </v>

484
00:30:55.671 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 1>we don't know in general because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>

485
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.263
<v Speaker 1>a person count don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so evolution is a conservative </v>

486
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.480
<v Speaker 1>forest and we'll use the circuits that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to representing new things.</v>

487
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.713
<v Speaker 1>So the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos is often represented by a </v>

488
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.710
<v Speaker 1>monster swallows you up and pulls you </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

489
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know when you're feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

490
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

491
00:31:19.971 --> 00:31:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling down well,</v>

492
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:27.540
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well down is worse.</v>

493
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.393
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're flat on the ground when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're down or you're in a hole or </v>

494
00:31:30.741 --> 00:31:32.780
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hiding in a hole.</v>

495
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:36.140
<v Speaker 1>You know it's down and you're threatened</v>
<v Speaker 1>by something.</v>

496
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.710
<v Speaker 1>If you're threatened by your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequacy,</v>

497
00:31:39.711 --> 00:31:42.710
<v Speaker 1>that might be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's partly what you imagined as</v>

498
00:31:42.711 --> 00:31:43.544
<v Speaker 1>a monstrous force because you know your </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclivity towards oppressed </v>

499
00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.413
<v Speaker 1>procrastination and your weakness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>character is part and parcel of why you </v>

500
00:31:50.931 --> 00:31:53.210
<v Speaker 1>happened to be in the underworld.</v>

501
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's the underworld of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological underworld.</v>

502
00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.310
<v Speaker 1>That's where you go when things fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

503
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.330
<v Speaker 1>And if you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know that that's what that means,</v>

504
00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.373
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have One of the keys that opens up </v>

505
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:11.960
<v Speaker 1>ancient stories to you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand things you,</v>

506
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.080
<v Speaker 1>your life can be organized going very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

507
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:20.090
<v Speaker 1>And then something comes up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything changes.</v>

508
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:20.953
<v Speaker 1>Some axiom that you were living by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be the existence of a partner </v>

509
00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:28.250
<v Speaker 1>might be a job that maybe your health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of those things</v>

510
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 1>go on and you go somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go somewhere.</v>

511
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a state of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still in the same world,</v>

512
00:32:38.211 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same all anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it is different.</v>

513
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.150
<v Speaker 1>It's all negative and dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do.</v>

514
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.033
<v Speaker 1>You're confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what do you do down there in the </v>

515
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:50.660
<v Speaker 1>underworld when things are falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>

516
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:51.523
<v Speaker 1>especially if hope is it's more possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>case scenario and you realize that you </v>

517
00:32:56.451 --> 00:33:00.170
<v Speaker 1>actually had something to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>device that's really annoying.</v>

518
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 1>You know when something bad happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and then you know you grind yourself</v>

519
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:06.950
<v Speaker 1>into bits trying to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell happened,</v>

520
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:11.951
<v Speaker 1>and then you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you were playing a causal role.</v>

521
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.423
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes you're so depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You assume you're playing a causal role </v>

522
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.783
<v Speaker 1>and you work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy to figure out by any </v>

523
00:33:18.051 --> 00:33:18.884
<v Speaker 1>stretch of the imagination and it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one who chose something terrible is </v>

524
00:33:22.731 --> 00:33:23.564
<v Speaker 1>at fault for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you find that you are off </v>

525
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:30.920
<v Speaker 1>the path somehow and maybe even that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew it and didn't attend to it,</v>

526
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:36.340
<v Speaker 1>and that's why all of this kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then down there in that chaos,</v>

527
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.053
<v Speaker 1>you decide that you're going to do what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to do instead and then </v>

528
00:33:42.411 --> 00:33:45.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe you get to rise up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>renewed.</v>

529
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.633
<v Speaker 1>If you're locking and then you can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix the city and that's what this </v>

530
00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:57.530
<v Speaker 1>story's about and that's why I picked </v>
<v Speaker 1>the image to represent the course.</v>

531
00:33:57.531 --> 00:34:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Because really what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it with the psychoanalysts,</v>

532
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.660
<v Speaker 1>the road due to health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not doing well,</v>

533
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.060
<v Speaker 1>which means that as you act in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

534
00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:08.894
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with your match </v>

535
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 1>between your presuppositions and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>

536
00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.093
<v Speaker 1>habitual and the way the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to you so it's not turning </v>

537
00:34:20.271 --> 00:34:22.520
<v Speaker 1>out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

538
00:34:22.521 --> 00:34:23.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you do about that?</v>

539
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.513
<v Speaker 1>And one answer might be to examine </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself for presuppositions and action </v>

540
00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:30.344
<v Speaker 1>patterns that are not serving you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what they are and what to do </v>

541
00:34:34.251 --> 00:34:35.084
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some of that is maybe you're not </v>

542
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:37.933
<v Speaker 1>moving forward because of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fear is grounded in terrible </v>

543
00:34:40.461 --> 00:34:41.294
<v Speaker 1>experiences that you've had in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's never been able to understand </v>

544
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.833
<v Speaker 1>and maybe one of the ways of gluing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself back together and expanding </v>

545
00:34:48.081 --> 00:34:52.430
<v Speaker 1>your personality so that you could in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact live properly in the world,</v>

546
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:57.490
<v Speaker 1>is to go back to those terrible events </v>
<v Speaker 1>and untied,</v>

547
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.770
<v Speaker 1>straightened them out and understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drop them,</v>

548
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's what psychotherapy is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In large part,</v>

549
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.690
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic behavioral doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

550
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.140
<v Speaker 1>What are you afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you avoiding?</v>

551
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>What are you finding to develop maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>from fear,</v>

552
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe from avoidance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows maybe from discuss.</v>

553
00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.973
<v Speaker 1>How can you get over it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you reclaim those parts of your </v>

554
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.003
<v Speaker 1>self?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent in the first lecture that I was </v>

555
00:35:41.331 --> 00:35:42.164
<v Speaker 1>going to try to provide you with Schema</v>
<v Speaker 1>into which you can place the theorists </v>

556
00:35:48.011 --> 00:35:52.400
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to discuss</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires going down deep.</v>

557
00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.250
<v Speaker 1>To do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your presuppositions,</v>

558
00:35:55.251 --> 00:35:56.084
<v Speaker 1>my presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a psychoanalytic </v>

559
00:35:57.441 --> 00:35:59.120
<v Speaker 1>presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated</v>

560
00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.380
<v Speaker 1>on a poetic tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say rancher tuition.</v>

561
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.130
<v Speaker 1>I learned most of it for breeding young </v>
<v Speaker 1>was Carl Young.</v>

562
00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:09.973
<v Speaker 1>The</v>
<v Speaker 1>help me understand that we're nested </v>

563
00:36:13.451 --> 00:36:17.950
<v Speaker 1>inside a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we don't know everything.</v>

564
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.833
<v Speaker 1>We have to take things as givens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that be taken as given to nested </v>

565
00:36:25.841 --> 00:36:26.674
<v Speaker 1>inside stories and we accept the stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then outside of the stories is the </v>

566
00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:35.220
<v Speaker 1>absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

567
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.420
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stories are tricky,</v>

568
00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if one of the classic stories,</v>

569
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Very Jonah's story I would say is</v>

570
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:48.903
<v Speaker 1>St George and the Dragon Story was </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented in renaissance and your </v>

571
00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.180
<v Speaker 1>immediate</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of ways.</v>

572
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:04.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like the story of St Patrick who </v>
<v Speaker 1>chased the snakes out of Ireland.</v>

573
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.873
<v Speaker 1>Same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the typical say George story is </v>

574
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:16.470
<v Speaker 1>hobbit or Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the second volume of Harry Potter,</v>

575
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I have any of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>

576
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Roger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember there's that snake,</v>

577
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.060
<v Speaker 1>the Bass lisc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this magic castle,</v>

578
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:24.894
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys have no problem with magic </v>

579
00:37:26.221 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 1>castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

580
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Here's an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an orphan.</v>

581
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the magic castle to learn how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more than normal with the models.</v>

582
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.780
<v Speaker 1>He has a muggle family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were not too happy with them.</v>

583
00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:37.614
<v Speaker 1>I'll go family like as representatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>of normal people think they have some </v>

584
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:43.560
<v Speaker 1>blacks now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

585
00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:44.970
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

586
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 1>that's what teenagers often feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both your parents elt is this.</v>

587
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.493
<v Speaker 1>These could really be my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must have some other parents who were </v>

588
00:37:52.311 --> 00:37:56.070
<v Speaker 1>like together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are like magical parents,</v>

589
00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:58.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents that live in the sky,</v>

590
00:37:58.261 --> 00:38:00.810
<v Speaker 1>and of course Harry Potter has earthly </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

591
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mongols nervously I think is the kid.</v>

592
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 1>He's at one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a wonderful piece of work.</v>

593
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will form a spoiled,</v>

594
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:15.060
<v Speaker 1>the old form selfish very far from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

595
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.510
<v Speaker 1>He's a foil for Harry and of course he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciated.</v>

596
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Doted on and Harry is actually punished </v>
<v Speaker 1>for his virtues.</v>

597
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a classic story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him To be punished for your virtues.</v>

598
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.550
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the story central story </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Christianity,</v>

599
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:30.923
<v Speaker 1>the central story in Christianity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about someone who is precisely punished </v>

600
00:38:33.721 --> 00:38:34.554
<v Speaker 1>in the worst possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the highest possible </v>

601
00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:36.784
<v Speaker 1>virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it makes it an architect of </v>

602
00:38:38.031 --> 00:38:41.050
<v Speaker 1>the story because there isn't anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>more unfair than that,</v>

603
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 1>and so it's a limit in a sense.</v>

604
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.480
<v Speaker 1>It can't be worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being punished for being,</v>

605
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unworthy.</v>

606
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

607
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I will at least make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be punished because you have your</v>

608
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:56.350
<v Speaker 1>act together and you're a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real punishment.</v>

609
00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:57.803
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So luckily you find out things magical </v>

610
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.753
<v Speaker 1>like convenient and off he goes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wizarding school and you know that's </v>

611
00:39:06.641 --> 00:39:07.474
<v Speaker 1>actually like taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually like going and studying </v>

612
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.320
<v Speaker 1>the humanities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was when they still were.</v>

613
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:20.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's through the humanities that</v>

614
00:39:20.951 --> 00:39:21.784
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you made contact with the magic of </v>

615
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:24.484
<v Speaker 1>your culture and that makes you more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than merely the child of your parents </v>

616
00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:30.843
<v Speaker 1>because you are more than married the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child of your parents or the child of </v>

617
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:33.814
<v Speaker 1>nature and you're the child of culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and until you understand what that </v>

618
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:39.814
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that you have two sets of </v>

619
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:43.870
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the divide here always has two sets</v>

620
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:44.704
<v Speaker 1>of parents.</v>

621
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:49.420
<v Speaker 1>You can't construe yourself property as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual.</v>

622
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.790
<v Speaker 1>You're not situated properly in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

623
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities are,</v>

624
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:55.024
<v Speaker 1>you can't orient your values property </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will suffer for that because as </v>

625
00:39:59.711 --> 00:40:03.520
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because life is so difficult,</v>

626
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to do something that's truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>work while in order to justify it and so</v>

627
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.590
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what all these stories tell you.</v>

628
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.473
<v Speaker 1>That's story of Jonah is telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have an ethical duty to </v>

629
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:23.320
<v Speaker 1>straighten things up and if you don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

630
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be soaring</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that story's apple everywhere.</v>

631
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Well now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>St George.</v>

632
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to Harry Potter.</v>

633
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:37.150
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes off the magic castle and he's</v>

634
00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:37.984
<v Speaker 1>learning to be a wizard and he's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting character because he's </v>

635
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 1>not really good and we find out what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's because because they have a</v>

636
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:48.350
<v Speaker 1>piece of all the marketing.</v>

637
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

638
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.010
<v Speaker 1>and that's what that means is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be good,</v>

639
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.290
<v Speaker 1>truly good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of just follow the rules.</v>

640
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:00.183
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very clear in the merit order </v>

641
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.043
<v Speaker 1>store and you also have to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand malevolence and in order to </v>

642
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:08.440
<v Speaker 1>understand malevolence so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>withstand it.</v>

643
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.490
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

644
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.720
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're naive.</v>

645
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.013
<v Speaker 1>If you're naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're easy pickings and so that's a </v>

646
00:41:18.251 --> 00:41:19.084
<v Speaker 1>union idea too and the union idea is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of personality development is </v>

647
00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:23.344
<v Speaker 1>to understand your shadow and the shadow</v>
<v Speaker 1>is those things about you you do not </v>

648
00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:33.690
<v Speaker 1>want to admit to and you could learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your shouted by reading history.</v>

649
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.473
<v Speaker 1>You can read about Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been redeveloped the </v>

650
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:44.390
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps in Russia and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can imagine yourself as a garden</v>

651
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:51.440
<v Speaker 1>instead of as a heroic rescue robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate victims,</v>

652
00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 1>which would be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unlikely.</v>

653
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.800
<v Speaker 1>And once you can imagine yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>

654
00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:58.663
<v Speaker 1>which is a terrifying thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you understand something about </v>

655
00:42:03.981 --> 00:42:06.770
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think,</v>

656
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.633
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is also from students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a young but you cannot have proper </v>

657
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:12.314
<v Speaker 1>respect for yourself until you know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a monster because he won't act </v>

658
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.940
<v Speaker 1>carefully enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you think,</v>

659
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nice first night,</v>

660
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:20.660
<v Speaker 1>never do anyone any harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

661
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>

662
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.670
<v Speaker 1>You can be sure of that and the harm </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do.</v>

663
00:42:25.671 --> 00:42:26.504
<v Speaker 1>People can come in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways and so if you regard yourself </v>

664
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:32.750
<v Speaker 1>as harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inoffensive,</v>

665
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:33.973
<v Speaker 1>nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well where do you have any reason to be </v>

666
00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:37.994
<v Speaker 1>fearful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like a teddy bear sitting on the </v>

667
00:42:39.741 --> 00:42:41.900
<v Speaker 1>shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you throw it at someone,</v>

668
00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:44.290
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the one that your life,</v>

669
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.163
<v Speaker 1>because you're a human being and human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings are some vicious creatures and </v>

670
00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:53.690
<v Speaker 1>there's utility and knowing that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the case,</v>

671
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.023
<v Speaker 1>you know when the Harry Potter series </v>
<v Speaker 1>very could stand up against fool to </v>

672
00:42:57.231 --> 00:42:58.064
<v Speaker 1>learn and understand and speak his </v>
<v Speaker 1>language because he was effected by him </v>

673
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.990
<v Speaker 1>to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

674
00:43:02.991 --> 00:43:04.910
<v Speaker 1>very interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

675
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.940
<v Speaker 1>in the second hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I tell you this,</v>

676
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:12.140
<v Speaker 1>and this is where thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long were each of those</v>

677
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.983
<v Speaker 1>500 pages here longing and there was how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of its seven and how many were </v>

678
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.980
<v Speaker 1>sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

679
00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:23.920
<v Speaker 1>how many of you read every Harry Potter </v>
<v Speaker 1>book?</v>

680
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.753
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how many of you read at least </v>

681
00:43:29.601 --> 00:43:32.030
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

682
00:43:32.031 --> 00:43:35.660
<v Speaker 1>How many of you saw the movies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're all in a cult.</v>

683
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.080
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

684
00:43:39.081 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the truth.</v>

685
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 1>It's really the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the second volume,</v>

686
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:46.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a snake that zipping around </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

687
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:47.380
<v Speaker 1>the bass list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

688
00:43:47.381 --> 00:43:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And it lives in the underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

689
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:54.590
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because wherever you are,</v>

690
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.560
<v Speaker 1>you're on thin ice and underneath your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thin ice as chaos.</v>

691
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:58.603
<v Speaker 1>And here we are in this unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized environment and everyone's </v>

692
00:44:02.331 --> 00:44:07.310
<v Speaker 1>getting along perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know the lights,</v>

693
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:10.130
<v Speaker 1>the electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sewage system is working.</v>

694
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.210
<v Speaker 1>No one's hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can be peaceful,</v>

695
00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:15.503
<v Speaker 1>but if any of that fell apart and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could easily fall apart because it's a </v>

696
00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:19.304
<v Speaker 1>bloody miracle it ever works at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the chaos that's just underneath </v>

697
00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:26.840
<v Speaker 1>the surface is going to come up right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

698
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:31.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's useful to know that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you properly grateful.</v>

699
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:32.363
<v Speaker 1>If you really understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you properly grateful for the </v>

700
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 1>bloody miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is that you can be here in peace.</v>

701
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this snake that's underneath the</v>

702
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:47.040
<v Speaker 1>surface and it's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's vague and it's ancient.</v>

703
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It's always been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens if you look at it,</v>

704
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.690
<v Speaker 1>it turns you to stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

705
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:56.040
<v Speaker 1>You're paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

706
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:57.690
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Gorgon,</v>

707
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.290
<v Speaker 1>that's Medusa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman with the head of snakes.</v>

708
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it paralyzes you.</v>

709
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.340
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

710
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.850
<v Speaker 1>you're walking through the jungle and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake appears.</v>

711
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:09.743
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You freeze and no bloody wonder because </v>

712
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.453
<v Speaker 1>you're a prey animal and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do when they see things that are </v>

713
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 1>going to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the snake,</v>

714
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:22.403
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people still die from a snake </v>

715
00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:24.764
<v Speaker 1>bite.</v>

716
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.333
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

717
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.273
<v Speaker 1>our ancestors were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean our ancestors like you </v>

718
00:45:30.491 --> 00:45:31.324
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of millions of years ago when they </v>

719
00:45:32.721 --> 00:45:36.710
<v Speaker 1>were living in trees and were very big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made a nice snack for a snake.</v>

720
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.633
<v Speaker 1>And there's a woman named Lynn Isabelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an anthropologist at Ucla who's </v>

721
00:45:40.911 --> 00:45:41.744
<v Speaker 1>correlated the presence of carnivorous </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes with the acuity of primate </v>

722
00:45:46.731 --> 00:45:47.564
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what she found was that the more </v>

723
00:45:49.341 --> 00:45:51.980
<v Speaker 1>snakes around the pattern of primates </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see.</v>

724
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.133
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're particularly good at picking </v>

725
00:45:56.211 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 1>up patterns like snake camouflage in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord half of our visual quadrant here,</v>

726
00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.530
<v Speaker 1>when people generally don't like snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn to handle them.</v>

727
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.863
<v Speaker 1>No snake fear appears to be a native to </v>
<v Speaker 1>native disease and it tends to increase </v>

728
00:46:09.021 --> 00:46:11.630
<v Speaker 1>as you age rather than decreasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can overcome it.</v>

729
00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:13.693
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter had snakes and one day </v>

730
00:46:15.061 --> 00:46:17.120
<v Speaker 1>versus the spinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a fairly big snake</v>

731
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:21.470
<v Speaker 1>and she hasn't paid attention to it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

732
00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:22.323
<v Speaker 1>So it nailed her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from then on she had had very </v>

733
00:46:26.261 --> 00:46:29.920
<v Speaker 1>difficult time grabbing the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like once</v>

734
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:32.463
<v Speaker 1>shy permanently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She also told me years later she had </v>

735
00:46:35.801 --> 00:46:38.820
<v Speaker 1>nightmares about snakes all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when she had a snake in the room.</v>

736
00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably the smell.</v>

737
00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:47.580
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Harry Potter decides he's going to go</v>

738
00:46:47.951 --> 00:46:48.784
<v Speaker 1>after the Vassilis Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go out there and face the </v>

739
00:46:50.411 --> 00:46:55.411
<v Speaker 1>thing that he's most afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does that way down in the dance.</v>

740
00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:57.003
<v Speaker 1>So it's like Joan up going down into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>depths and he faces the task list kind </v>

741
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:05.170
<v Speaker 1>of bikes and you know that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>

742
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:09.660
<v Speaker 1>because if you go down into the depths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get fit.</v>

743
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a hero story,</v>

744
00:47:12.611 --> 00:47:15.110
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about the hero stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually real.</v>

745
00:47:15.111 --> 00:47:17.860
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you're facing is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

746
00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:18.873
<v Speaker 1>And even though facing it voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be your best bet and is likely </v>

747
00:47:23.111 --> 00:47:23.944
<v Speaker 1>your best bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the central story of </v>

748
00:47:25.151 --> 00:47:25.984
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean you're going to </v>

749
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.500
<v Speaker 1>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing.</v>

750
00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:30.730
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets bitten,</v>

751
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:32.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's going to die.</v>

752
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Now he's rescuing Jimmy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the St George Story.</v>

753
00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:41.510
<v Speaker 1>If you go after a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons like to capture virgin,</v>

754
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.890
<v Speaker 1>God only knows why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's how it goes.</v>

755
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:52.923
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that male humans have done from the </v>

756
00:47:55.991 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time just chase the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators away.</v>

757
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:01.463
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect that the males from God </v>
<v Speaker 1>only knows how long ago who were </v>

758
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:08.374
<v Speaker 1>particularly good at that we're rewarded</v>
<v Speaker 1>with female attention and why the hell </v>

759
00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:18.130
<v Speaker 1>not so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's deeply rooted inside of us,</v>

760
00:48:18.131 --> 00:48:21.820
<v Speaker 1>that idea of facing the unknown and </v>
<v Speaker 1>freeing the woman.</v>

761
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:22.683
<v Speaker 1>So the idea there is that if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a male idea in large part I can </v>

762
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:30.410
<v Speaker 1>talk about central female myth and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll proceed.</v>

763
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:31.803
<v Speaker 1>Idea is that if you're the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who can stand up against the </v>

764
00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:37.534
<v Speaker 1>unknown and the frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're also likely develop into </v>

765
00:48:41.171 --> 00:48:42.004
<v Speaker 1>that sort of person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're also likely to develop into </v>

766
00:48:43.511 --> 00:48:46.210
<v Speaker 1>the sort of person that other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>will find attractive.</v>

767
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.633
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why you don't believe that </v>

768
00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:54.830
<v Speaker 1>the inside the shadow was the anima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a female finger.</v>

769
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:57.870
<v Speaker 1>So his idea was something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

770
00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:01.060
<v Speaker 1>If you look watch movies as long as this</v>
<v Speaker 1>data male guy,</v>

771
00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:02.413
<v Speaker 1>is there a romantic movie you said he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice guy and he's a friend and you </v>

772
00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:05.734
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman tells him everything that she </v>

773
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:10.500
<v Speaker 1>has liked him a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She likes the guy who's like got an edge</v>

774
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:14.010
<v Speaker 1>and who's capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say ma'am,</v>

775
00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:14.903
<v Speaker 1>but at least of aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean she wants him to be </v>

776
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:19.654
<v Speaker 1>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean is that she wants him </v>

777
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:23.950
<v Speaker 1>to be able to be aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be good,</v>

778
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.113
<v Speaker 1>and so he's the romantic target and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the person that's incorporate </v>

779
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:29.043
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's suddenly respectable and perhaps </v>

780
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:35.220
<v Speaker 1>useful and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

781
00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.440
<v Speaker 1>that's a very little storage.</v>

782
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:52.540
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about this for a minute.</v>

783
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I've already offered you a proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an important proposition.</v>

784
00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm offering you this proposition so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can make sense of art and </v>

785
00:50:03.971 --> 00:50:04.804
<v Speaker 1>literature and mythology and religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dance and all those strange </v>

786
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:13.530
<v Speaker 1>ritualistic things that human beings do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems central to us,</v>

787
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:18.590
<v Speaker 1>including included not least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ineradicable tendency.</v>

788
00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I've asked to seek out stories of heroes</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I should finish the Harry Potter.</v>

789
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter goes down there to rescue </v>
<v Speaker 1>Virginia,</v>

790
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a formal name,</v>

791
00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Virginia anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very virgin.</v>

792
00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:48.130
<v Speaker 1>So it gets just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

793
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Jeanette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

794
00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 1>It gets better and the bite is poisonous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there is dying.</v>

795
00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't seem to be so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens?</v>

796
00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys swallowed this.</v>

797
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:02.780
<v Speaker 1>It's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's his name?</v>

798
00:51:02.781 --> 00:51:05.740
<v Speaker 1>The dumbledore character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a bird,</v>

799
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:06.583
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

800
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:09.860
<v Speaker 1>So he's the wise old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the ruler of the castle.</v>

801
00:51:09.861 --> 00:51:13.310
<v Speaker 1>He's the ruler of the magic castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the magic king.</v>

802
00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:18.230
<v Speaker 1>He's like God the father as far as Harry</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potter is concerned.</v>

803
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:20.300
<v Speaker 1>And he has a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of bird is it?</v>

804
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Is a phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

805
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>

806
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:27.350
<v Speaker 1>but phoenix is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's a mortal,</v>

807
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.600
<v Speaker 1>but in a strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

808
00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:33.170
<v Speaker 1>it may have some as I think 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gets older and older and then one</v>

809
00:51:33.171 --> 00:51:38.171
<v Speaker 1>day the burst into flames and turns into</v>
<v Speaker 1>an egg and then you get a new phoenix.</v>

810
00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:43.940
<v Speaker 1>So that was a symbol of transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of transformation.</v>

811
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:49.150
<v Speaker 1>The burden is a spirit or psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's what it means in part,</v>

812
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how when you learn a lesson in </v>

813
00:51:54.261 --> 00:51:56.450
<v Speaker 1>your life that that's not very pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

814
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:59.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not like when you learn something </v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

815
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:01.003
<v Speaker 1>it's the best day of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often the importance of what you </v>

816
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:09.480
<v Speaker 1>learned is often proportionate to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>how wretched it is to learn it.</v>

817
00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn things the hard way.</v>

818
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:16.630
<v Speaker 1>You learn things by getting hit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously if you're doing is working,</v>

819
00:52:16.941 --> 00:52:20.570
<v Speaker 1>you can get what you want and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning in that and that's happy.</v>

820
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:21.583
<v Speaker 1>It's when you're doing something and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit an obstacle and Nydia bloody well </v>

821
00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:28.890
<v Speaker 1>hit it hard and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you recoil and then down into the depths</v>

822
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:32.020
<v Speaker 1>you go and you have to sort your out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize that you're,</v>

823
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular kind of idiots and that </v>

824
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.353
<v Speaker 1>you should probably fix that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really annoying and difficult and you </v>

825
00:52:38.241 --> 00:52:39.074
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're down in the dumps and </v>

826
00:52:40.581 --> 00:52:43.760
<v Speaker 1>anxious for quite a while and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it repaired more or less than,</v>

827
00:52:43.761 --> 00:52:45.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself back together.</v>

828
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:50.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the Phoenix who into flames,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang a new you.</v>

829
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the ability to learn.</v>

830
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are very strange creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

831
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Because we're very malleable compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>most animals.</v>

832
00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:06.020
<v Speaker 1>Like grizzly bear is now in prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears.</v>

833
00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:08.540
<v Speaker 1>A thousand years ago it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

834
00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:11.510
<v Speaker 1>They are the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do the same thing,</v>

835
00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:13.933
<v Speaker 1>there's no transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human beings we have this massive </v>

836
00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:20.720
<v Speaker 1>brain and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain because if he'd have to take</v>

837
00:53:20.721 --> 00:53:25.721
<v Speaker 1>care of human children until they're 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a big burden and so,</v>

838
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pay a big price for it.</v>

839
00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:31.730
<v Speaker 1>It also makes child birth very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

840
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:33.383
<v Speaker 1>and it's costly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to eat a lot because we have a </v>

841
00:53:34.901 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 1>big brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses a lot of energy and so you know,</v>

842
00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:39.903
<v Speaker 1>you pay a price for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the advantage is your plastic you </v>

843
00:53:42.961 --> 00:53:43.794
<v Speaker 1>can learn.</v>

844
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.113
<v Speaker 1>Now learning is a strange thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take a minute of just acquiring </v>

845
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:50.874
<v Speaker 1>more information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could also think of it and this is </v>

846
00:53:54.241 --> 00:53:55.074
<v Speaker 1>more accurate as</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out something that you're doing </v>

847
00:53:58.801 --> 00:53:59.634
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's sort of built into like a </v>

848
00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:03.720
<v Speaker 1>character caring element of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

849
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 1>presumption of your perception or a deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>habit really built into you.</v>

850
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.360
<v Speaker 1>So neuro structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

851
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.113
<v Speaker 1>It's a lie and you have to kill it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't working properly and </v>

852
00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:16.663
<v Speaker 1>the pain that you go through in part </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're suffering because he did </v>

853
00:54:19.021 --> 00:54:22.350
<v Speaker 1>something stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something like you're,</v>

854
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.353
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The neurology can never get this quite </v>

855
00:54:26.851 --> 00:54:27.684
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the pain of the depth of that </v>

856
00:54:29.971 --> 00:54:32.970
<v Speaker 1>structure and that could be a huge chunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

857
00:54:32.971 --> 00:54:33.804
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really have to go through a </v>

858
00:54:35.611 --> 00:54:36.444
<v Speaker 1>massive revision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the person that comes out the </v>

859
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:42.660
<v Speaker 1>other end might be the same at all.</v>

860
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>

861
00:54:43.591 --> 00:54:46.380
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to combat alcoholism,</v>

862
00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.310
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

863
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:49.303
<v Speaker 1>ratchet thing to do because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your friends are alcoholics in your </v>

864
00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:54.804
<v Speaker 1>family drinks too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you know how to do when </v>

865
00:54:57.031 --> 00:54:59.640
<v Speaker 1>you're socializing is to go to the bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and drink too much.</v>

866
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spend like 20 hours a week on it.</v>

867
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.073
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that you're addicted to </v>

868
00:55:06.481 --> 00:55:09.060
<v Speaker 1>the substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's how you live.</v>

869
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:11.310
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to stop being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>

870
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.010
<v Speaker 1>not only do you have to stop drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>

871
00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:14.844
<v Speaker 1>but you have to stop seeing all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk friends and maybe you've had them </v>

872
00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:22.620
<v Speaker 1>for your whole life and you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>continual battles with your drunk family</v>

873
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.470
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do with that 20 hours.</v>

874
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:29.160
<v Speaker 1>It's now like hanging around your neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an albatross.</v>

875
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:30.563
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to live that whole part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the personality die and a new part </v>

876
00:55:35.161 --> 00:55:38.880
<v Speaker 1>has to spring forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the Phoenix is.</v>

877
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix is the capacity of the person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>transport.</v>

878
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And so when Harry gets bit by a snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the threes is him,</v>

879
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.740
<v Speaker 1>he gets seriously injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Phoenix comes in Christ,</v>

880
00:55:52.741 --> 00:55:56.260
<v Speaker 1>some tears in his wound</v>
<v Speaker 1>repair,</v>

881
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.310
<v Speaker 1>some May.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's back to life.</v>

882
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And the strange thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay with all the viewers.</v>

883
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Why would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing about if it's rational,</v>

884
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:17.830
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magic castle that's not rational.</v>

885
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Giant snake underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a little more rational</v>

886
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:27.220
<v Speaker 1>turning you to stone going down there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>face it,</v>

887
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 1>being rejuvenated by a phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

888
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:29.741
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

889
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:33.240
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can watch that little swallow.</v>

890
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:35.800
<v Speaker 1>It will be completely engaged in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the reason for that,</v>

891
00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:39.310
<v Speaker 1>because it's a myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about how people.</v>

892
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:44.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a medicine about how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to conduct yourself in the world,</v>

893
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:49.000
<v Speaker 1>face the things that you're afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would otherwise paralyze you to let</v>

894
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:54.780
<v Speaker 1>the depth of what is insufficient vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will occur,</v>

895
00:56:55.450 --> 00:57:00.450
<v Speaker 1>and then to wait for the rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

896
00:57:03.321 --> 00:57:05.870
<v Speaker 1>so science is about what the world is</v>

897
00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.813
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

898
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:13.680
<v Speaker 1>myth and drama and dream of young </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

899
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:18.610
<v Speaker 1>All of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the aesthetic and artistic and</v>

900
00:57:18.611 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 1>fantastic side that's more about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>things should be.</v>

901
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:24.453
<v Speaker 1>It's more about how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are lessons in how to act and </v>

902
00:57:28.151 --> 00:57:30.970
<v Speaker 1>they're abstract lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are capable of abstraction,</v>

903
00:57:30.971 --> 00:57:32.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

904
00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:33.064
<v Speaker 1>well there's something new and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about you and there's </v>

905
00:57:35.701 --> 00:57:36.534
<v Speaker 1>something new and it's not about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll take all the good things </v>

906
00:57:40.611 --> 00:57:41.444
<v Speaker 1>and make one good thing on that and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take all the bad things and make one </v>

907
00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:44.314
<v Speaker 1>batch of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we sort of understand the </v>

908
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:46.684
<v Speaker 1>difference between good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we get better and better and better </v>

909
00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:52.030
<v Speaker 1>and better at that over the centuries as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we distilled out.</v>

910
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:52.864
<v Speaker 1>And then we have a figure of ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>good and if they of ultimate evil and </v>

911
00:57:55.661 --> 00:57:58.690
<v Speaker 1>that helps us understand what those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are.</v>

912
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.313
<v Speaker 1>Those are the hostile brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very common mythological </v>

913
00:58:03.151 --> 00:58:04.680
<v Speaker 1>motifs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

914
00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:05.514
<v Speaker 1>well they're at war inside you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a universal </v>

915
00:58:10.051 --> 00:58:14.270
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an existential truth.</v>

916
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.843
<v Speaker 1>The domain of ethics and morality is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we in the world and what should we </v>

917
00:58:23.421 --> 00:58:24.440
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the good?</v>

918
00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:25.970
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

919
00:58:25.971 --> 00:58:26.804
<v Speaker 1>this part from the fact that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it because this is what you should </v>

920
00:58:28.941 --> 00:58:29.774
<v Speaker 1>know if you go through university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the bears directly on issues of </v>

921
00:58:33.441 --> 00:58:36.500
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to accomplish something.</v>

922
00:58:36.501 --> 00:58:37.334
<v Speaker 1>Say if you go see a psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you can see what I'm trying to </v>

923
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:40.910
<v Speaker 1>help you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

924
00:58:40.911 --> 00:58:44.660
<v Speaker 1>that's not really what you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do when you go see your therapist is get</v>

925
00:58:44.661 --> 00:58:47.600
<v Speaker 1>your life together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the same thing.</v>

926
00:58:47.601 --> 00:58:48.434
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mostly when I'm acting as a </v>

927
00:58:51.441 --> 00:58:52.274
<v Speaker 1>therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I'm directly treating </v>

928
00:58:53.751 --> 00:58:56.150
<v Speaker 1>mental disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental disorders aren't.</v>

929
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:57.063
<v Speaker 1>They're just not neat little boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like someone has a fully </v>

930
00:59:00.111 --> 00:59:04.400
<v Speaker 1>functioning life but they have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorder and then you bring them</v>

931
00:59:04.401 --> 00:59:05.960
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you treat the anxiety disorder and he go</v>

932
00:59:05.961 --> 00:59:07.490
<v Speaker 1>back to their fully functioning life.</v>

933
00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:08.653
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The disorders tangled out into their </v>

934
00:59:11.361 --> 00:59:11.961
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

935
00:59:11.961 --> 00:59:12.794
<v Speaker 1>if you're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well usually either workplace isn't </v>

936
00:59:15.321 --> 00:59:16.154
<v Speaker 1>going very well and your relationships </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the people around you are damaged </v>

937
00:59:18.201 --> 00:59:19.034
<v Speaker 1>and you know you're connected in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual with all of these things and so </v>

938
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:24.763
<v Speaker 1>when you come to see a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work on putting your life </v>

939
00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:28.454
<v Speaker 1>together in a sustainable manner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that certainly not just removing the </v>

940
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:36.290
<v Speaker 1>mental illness is very rare now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see someone who's depressed</v>

941
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:37.603
<v Speaker 1>whose life is together and they're are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just depressed because something's gone </v>

942
00:59:40.191 --> 00:59:44.540
<v Speaker 1>wrong probably biochemically and so with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like that.</v>

943
00:59:44.541 --> 00:59:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Have you been asked to give them an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ssri?</v>

944
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't give them to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can recommend them.</v>

945
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Recommend they go see a doctor anyways </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's sometimes just does the trick</v>

946
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.640
<v Speaker 1>because you know their life is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>

947
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.590
<v Speaker 1>They just can't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's funny.</v>

948
01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Rare man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually the case that someone comes</v>

949
01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:03.974
<v Speaker 1>and sees you with things that are in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious state of chaos and all of that </v>

950
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:08.264
<v Speaker 1>has to be addressed in some of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological and a lot of it's just </v>

951
01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.910
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's embedded in there in the world.</v>

952
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.673
<v Speaker 1>That's what the behavioral psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral psychology is particularly </v>

953
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.610
<v Speaker 1>concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

954
01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:20.953
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the clinical end is </v>

955
01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>predicated on necessarily predicated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>

956
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:30.140
<v Speaker 1>how is it that we obtain good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

957
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>and what would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my clients first come to see me.</v>

958
01:00:33.201 --> 01:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I often ask them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

959
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>well let's say you look a year ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

960
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>What are we aiming at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would,</v>

961
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>what would your life isn't the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want it to be?</v>

962
01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.573
<v Speaker 1>How would it look if it was the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted it to be these parking that way </v>

963
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>and we ain't get them right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we look for impediments,</v>

964
01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>psychological impediments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>

965
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>avoidance strategies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing,</v>

966
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.430
<v Speaker 1>and we developed strategies and we try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move towards that.</v>

967
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I would say ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand the categories?</v>

968
01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.880
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature.</v>

969
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Now categorization is a tricky thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna run through some complicated</v>

970
01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:25.250
<v Speaker 1>ideas relatively quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

971
01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you think you put things in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>category because they're similar,</v>

972
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:34.670
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is is that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not an answer.</v>

973
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>It's just the restatement of the initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition and second of all,</v>

974
01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.453
<v Speaker 1>you can put things in the same category </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are by no means identical and you </v>

975
01:01:44.331 --> 01:01:46.790
<v Speaker 1>often do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And third,</v>

976
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:51.530
<v Speaker 1>it's things are things that are similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are often also importantly different.</v>

977
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>And so peggy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which element of similarity,</v>

978
01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:57.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say you have a group of </v>

979
01:01:59.091 --> 01:01:59.781
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

980
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:04.781
<v Speaker 1>are they the same will obviously no </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're all the same book,</v>

981
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.543
<v Speaker 1>but the category of books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty strange category because </v>

982
01:02:10.221 --> 01:02:11.054
<v Speaker 1>the content that the book differs </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely well when you could still </v>

983
01:02:12.981 --> 01:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>make a group of books and you pick some </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary element that unites them.</v>

984
01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>And consider that grounds to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

985
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.823
<v Speaker 1>There's other categories and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific categories in scientific </v>

986
01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:26.604
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 actually contain things that are </v>

987
01:02:29.071 --> 01:02:32.350
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar across multiple dimensions.</v>

988
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Protons are like that as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>

989
01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that distinguishes one </v>
<v Speaker 1>proton from another.</v>

990
01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Same with electrons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

991
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>the set of triangles is like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can define it precisely,</v>

992
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>but most of the categories that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings aren't so neat.</v>

993
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>the categories are neat,</v>

994
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.373
<v Speaker 1>like scientific categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to investigate them </v>

995
01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.810
<v Speaker 1>scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

996
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.910
<v Speaker 1>you might do research on a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with anxiety disorders,</v>

997
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.353
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorder category is so </v>

998
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:12.770
<v Speaker 1>heterogeneous that it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to identify the commonalities</v>

999
01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 1>across all the people are in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

1000
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the category isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a scientific category.</v>

1001
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a hybrid category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a practical category.</v>

1002
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example of that.</v>

1003
01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1004
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say it anyways.</v>

1005
01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:50.723
<v Speaker 1>Many of the DSM categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are categories for second </v>

1006
01:03:53.011 --> 01:03:57.330
<v Speaker 1>pathology require.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're part of that category,</v>

1007
01:03:57.331 --> 01:03:58.164
<v Speaker 1>imagine there's seven symptoms that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have read symptoms that you could </v>

1008
01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:03.810
<v Speaker 1>have put you in that category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like social personality,</v>

1009
01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.800
<v Speaker 1>eight symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still kick,</v>

1010
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you hit you bite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're abusive.</v>

1011
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the category categories</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely,</v>

1012
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:13.883
<v Speaker 1>but you can be in the category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have symptoms two through five </v>

1013
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:19.620
<v Speaker 1>and you can be in the category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have symptoms six through eight,</v>

1014
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:22.680
<v Speaker 1>they aren't the same symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're in the same category.</v>

1015
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:23.421
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1016
01:04:23.421 --> 01:04:24.750
<v Speaker 1>how they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can that be?</v>

1017
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a family resemblance category.</v>

1018
01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:28.044
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of the things that we use our </v>

1019
01:04:30.001 --> 01:04:33.900
<v Speaker 1>family resemblance category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a prototype and then if you have</v>

1020
01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:38.870
<v Speaker 1>enough of the features of that prototype</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the prototype has 10 features and if</v>

1021
01:04:38.871 --> 01:04:43.500
<v Speaker 1>you haven't six of those features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to be in that category,</v>

1022
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 1>but it means that the categories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually quite diverse and that's one of</v>

1023
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:48.270
<v Speaker 1>the problems that plagues</v>

1024
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.253
<v Speaker 1>how psychiatry as a science and clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and science really big </v>

1025
01:04:55.441 --> 01:04:56.274
<v Speaker 1>problems because if the categories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>homogenous and it's very difficult to </v>

1026
01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:00.744
<v Speaker 1>draw conclusions about the members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the category and the psychologists and </v>

1027
01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:05.514
<v Speaker 1>the psychiatrists that those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific categories but what they're </v>

1028
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:10.404
<v Speaker 1>not and they can't be hard because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're aimed at the classification of </v>

1029
01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.453
<v Speaker 1>health or ideal versus non health are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not ideal and partly because they play </v>

1030
01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:22.381
<v Speaker 1>multiple roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You category isn't there just to provide</v>

1031
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:24.304
<v Speaker 1>neat demarcations for scientific study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The categories there to give people a </v>

1032
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:30.603
<v Speaker 1>language to talk about certain symptoms </v>
<v Speaker 1>to diagnose because you know when you </v>

1033
01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>come in and you have a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance,</v>

1034
01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>you might want to know what they are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you also know what they aren't.</v>

1035
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.373
<v Speaker 1>It's really a relief often to find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis and then of course the </v>

1036
01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:49.570
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis has certain implications for </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment and for billing and for all of</v>

1037
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:50.404
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the category has to play all those </v>

1038
01:05:51.431 --> 01:05:54.310
<v Speaker 1>roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's multiple types of category</v>

1039
01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:00.460
<v Speaker 1>and the categories that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in relationship to the apology,</v>

1040
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.040
<v Speaker 1>art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific categories,</v>

1041
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:07.270
<v Speaker 1>their categories and vote the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>construed as a place to act,</v>

1042
01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.950
<v Speaker 1>so here's the way to think about it.</v>

1043
01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.080
<v Speaker 1>You're always looking at the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a framework of reference and you</v>

1044
01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:22.081
<v Speaker 1>have to do that because there isn't very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much if you can't see the whole world at</v>

1045
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.073
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact the amount of the world you </v>

1046
01:06:24.491 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 1>actually see is so small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe in the central part of</v>

1047
01:06:28.091 --> 01:06:28.924
<v Speaker 1>your vision is zipping around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing a pretty high resolution </v>

1048
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.540
<v Speaker 1>representation of exactly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at,</v>

1049
01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:37.690
<v Speaker 1>but outside of that center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I look at you,</v>

1050
01:06:37.691 --> 01:06:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I can't see her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see your glasses,</v>

1051
01:06:40.721 --> 01:06:45.250
<v Speaker 1>but barely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even tell whether you're male or</v>

1052
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:49.120
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person passed that.</v>

1053
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't see it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1054
01:06:50.891 --> 01:06:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1055
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:53.943
<v Speaker 1>you don't notice that you're not blind </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your central vision is always </v>

1056
01:06:57.161 --> 01:07:01.300
<v Speaker 1>popping around illuminating that tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>space that you sit down blind.</v>

1057
01:07:01.301 --> 01:07:02.134
<v Speaker 1>It's just mind boggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure some of you have seen the </v>

1058
01:07:04.481 --> 01:07:05.314
<v Speaker 1>invisible gorilla video where a gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes into the video and you don't </v>

1059
01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:11.944
<v Speaker 1>notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is somewhat shocking because you </v>

1060
01:07:13.301 --> 01:07:15.400
<v Speaker 1>would think that you'd notice the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla,</v>

1061
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.473
<v Speaker 1>but what happens is that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't notice something unless it </v>

1062
01:07:19.511 --> 01:07:23.380
<v Speaker 1>interferes with what you're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what are you going to do?</v>

1063
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Notice everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

1064
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:27.143
<v Speaker 1>If you've heard of no one say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you do is you pick something to </v>

1065
01:07:28.871 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Speaker 1>focus on using something that you value </v>
<v Speaker 1>because why else would you focus on it?</v>

1066
01:07:32.861 --> 01:07:33.694
<v Speaker 1>So that means that you're telling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system determines the direction of your </v>

1067
01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:39.610
<v Speaker 1>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bloody well,</v>

1068
01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:42.580
<v Speaker 1>think about that for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a Buddhist idea,</v>

1069
01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:44.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

1070
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:49.210
<v Speaker 1>people live in a kind of illusion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that illusion causes suffering</v>

1071
01:07:49.211 --> 01:07:50.044
<v Speaker 1>and they can transform the way they look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the world and that can release them </v>

1072
01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:52.834
<v Speaker 1>from their suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you do live in an </v>

1073
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:56.200
<v Speaker 1>illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1074
01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's exactly illusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucket.</v>

1075
01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:59.253
<v Speaker 1>You certainly do live within a framework</v>
<v Speaker 1>of perception that's determined by your </v>

1076
01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:04.684
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that is so weird because we never </v>

1077
01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:11.350
<v Speaker 1>think of the world and something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveals itself through our values,</v>

1078
01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:16.740
<v Speaker 1>but of course if a course it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you look at you want you it what</v>

1079
01:08:18.471 --> 01:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>you want and once you pay him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world lays itself out for you.</v>

1080
01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.153
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly how perception works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why this way you're always </v>

1081
01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that's point day that </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in some place in some time and</v>

1082
01:08:31.911 --> 01:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>you're always have some notion about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to have happen next.</v>

1083
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.440
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to go to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

1084
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've got a plan after this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this class,</v>

1085
01:08:41.181 --> 01:08:42.014
<v Speaker 1>you have a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hoping to learn something about </v>

1086
01:08:43.731 --> 01:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>presuming you have a goal with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a grade and that's nested inside your</v>

1087
01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:49.543
<v Speaker 1>desire to get a degree and that's nested</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside your desire to be educated and </v>

1088
01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:54.190
<v Speaker 1>have a career and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1089
01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a successful life.</v>

1090
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:57.343
<v Speaker 1>So attending to me at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you're doing that is because </v>

1091
01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:02.504
<v Speaker 1>all of those values exist within you </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously focusing your attention </v>

1092
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.490
<v Speaker 1>and so you're attending to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked to something else,</v>

1093
01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.390
<v Speaker 1>assuming that all of you with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Computers Open Art,</v>

1094
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:15.890
<v Speaker 1>surfing the web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you might be,</v>

1095
01:09:16.190 --> 01:09:17.023
<v Speaker 1>but assuming that you're focusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're focusing on is directed </v>

1096
01:09:21.981 --> 01:09:22.840
<v Speaker 1>by what you value.</v>

1097
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And some of that can be unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1098
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:28.250
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is unconscious because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1099
01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:31.150
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for you to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of what you pay attention to.</v>

1100
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.353
<v Speaker 1>You know what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to study kind of a boring </v>

1101
01:09:34.851 --> 01:09:36.320
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

1102
01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:38.960
<v Speaker 1>your attention is just like everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1103
01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll vacuum under the bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of doing the paper,</v>

1104
01:09:42.921 --> 01:09:45.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a grip on that thing.</v>

1105
01:09:45.651 --> 01:09:50.020
<v Speaker 1>So your attention has an autonomy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another psychoanalytic idea,</v>

1106
01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you kind of think,</v>

1107
01:09:51.351 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in control.</v>

1108
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:56.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like really ever tried telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself what to do.</v>

1109
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Does the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that work for you?</v>

1110
01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the gym three times a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

1111
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:02.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1112
01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to quit eating sugar for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

1113
01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:10.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like how long does that lasts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty minutes.</v>

1114
01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Three chocolate bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're this,</v>

1115
01:10:15.241 --> 01:10:17.030
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is Freud central insight.</v>

1116
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're an autonomous group </v>
<v Speaker 1>of spiritual agents,</v>

1117
01:10:22.401 --> 01:10:23.234
<v Speaker 1>let's say personalities and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really get along very well and you ego </v>

1118
01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.033
<v Speaker 1>will say is by no means necessarily in </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge and that's a very strange thing </v>

1119
01:10:34.461 --> 01:10:35.294
<v Speaker 1>to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can really realize that by </v>

1120
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:40.010
<v Speaker 1>noticing how little control you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>over your attentional focus.</v>

1121
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got on your pointed a,</v>

1122
01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you're going to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always doing that.</v>

1123
01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.093
<v Speaker 1>We'd have it as structure of value and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes what the point a to point B </v>

1124
01:10:51.231 --> 01:10:52.064
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the structure itself doesn't change </v>

1125
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:54.620
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're looking at the world,</v>

1126
01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.070
<v Speaker 1>what you see is not objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tools,</v>

1127
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:58.963
<v Speaker 1>and they make you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are things that facilitate your </v>

1128
01:11:00.741 --> 01:11:01.574
<v Speaker 1>movement forward and you see obstacles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are things that make you </v>

1129
01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:06.470
<v Speaker 1>unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when you encounter an obstacle,</v>

1130
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.903
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems is as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to where you're going and </v>

1131
01:11:10.101 --> 01:11:10.934
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other problem is if you </v>

1132
01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:16.090
<v Speaker 1>encounter an the frame might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1133
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.943
<v Speaker 1>Because you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be just something that you </v>

1134
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:18.924
<v Speaker 1>could easily might be a fatal flaw in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole plant and so obstacles have </v>

1135
01:11:23.551 --> 01:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>this dual nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get in your way,</v>

1136
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:30.690
<v Speaker 1>but they can also take your planned down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they can reduce anxiety.</v>

1137
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.613
<v Speaker 1>So my point is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a book called visual ecological </v>

1138
01:11:36.181 --> 01:11:38.490
<v Speaker 1>approach to visual perception was great </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

1139
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Alright Gibson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jj Gibson,</v>

1140
01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Urd member correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

1141
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:47.003
<v Speaker 1>although I thought of this while back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized eventually that it wasn't </v>

1142
01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:51.763
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His theory when he believed was that </v>

1143
01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:57.240
<v Speaker 1>when people looked at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have value first,</v>

1144
01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.540
<v Speaker 1>project second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1145
01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:03.150
<v Speaker 1>for Gibson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're standing by a cliff,</v>

1146
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:04.103
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a play off and then think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fact that you might fall and </v>

1147
01:12:07.441 --> 01:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>then feel free to use a falling off </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1148
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.083
<v Speaker 1>And part of the seeing of that part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the act of seeing is being afraid of </v>

1149
01:12:15.451 --> 01:12:16.284
<v Speaker 1>that because your eyes are connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to your emotional system and part </v>

1150
01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:22.030
<v Speaker 1>of what your eyes do is count the </v>
<v Speaker 1>articles,</v>

1151
01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:25.720
<v Speaker 1>but your eyes do all sorts of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like they comparing fractions,</v>

1152
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.340
<v Speaker 1>it prepare you for gripping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be preparing for emotion.</v>

1153
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:31.343
<v Speaker 1>None of that actually requires the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence necessarily the existence of </v>

1154
01:12:35.881 --> 01:12:40.080
<v Speaker 1>your perception of the object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people who are blind sight and if you</v>

1155
01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 1>show them so they think they can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you flash them an angry face,</v>

1156
01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.350
<v Speaker 1>they'll show a skin conductance </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

1157
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the visual pathways </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Amygdala,</v>

1158
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.910
<v Speaker 1>which does face facial emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing and still be active.</v>

1159
01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.520
<v Speaker 1>These are people usually have a stroke </v>
<v Speaker 1>so your eyes are okay,</v>

1160
01:12:56.521 --> 01:12:59.670
<v Speaker 1>but they've destroyed the visual cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1161
01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.250
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perfectly plausible and at least at</v>

1162
01:13:04.251 --> 01:13:06.320
<v Speaker 1>one level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at something,</v>

1163
01:13:06.321 --> 01:13:07.154
<v Speaker 1>you see it's utility first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see a chair and you might say </v>

1164
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:11.803
<v Speaker 1>Cheddar is an object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't say that beanbag chair </v>

1165
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:19.010
<v Speaker 1>and the stump is a chair and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>share much in common except that you can</v>

1166
01:13:19.011 --> 01:13:24.011
<v Speaker 1>sit on it and so you know the chair is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chair is basically conceptualized by</v>

1167
01:13:24.831 --> 01:13:27.500
<v Speaker 1>its functional utility and when you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a chair,</v>

1168
01:13:27.501 --> 01:13:28.334
<v Speaker 1>what you perceive is its function </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility and the chair tells you what to </v>

1169
01:13:31.311 --> 01:13:32.144
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says sit on me and so and there are </v>

1170
01:13:34.281 --> 01:13:35.114
<v Speaker 1>people who have pre frontal damage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they engage in something called </v>

1171
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:41.660
<v Speaker 1>utilization behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're walking down the hallway,</v>

1172
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:43.490
<v Speaker 1>a door open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to walk through it.</v>

1173
01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:46.880
<v Speaker 1>It can not do what the object tells them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1174
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:51.320
<v Speaker 1>That's called utilization behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how the world is laid out.</v>

1175
01:13:52.190 --> 01:13:56.960
<v Speaker 1>And I would say inside that don't mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a predictable world.</v>

1176
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:58.850
<v Speaker 1>You're in the world that you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1177
01:13:58.851 --> 01:13:59.684
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you hit an obstacle or if </v>

1178
01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:03.830
<v Speaker 1>you're outside that domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the unknown.</v>

1179
01:14:03.831 --> 01:14:05.080
<v Speaker 1>You're in unknown territory.</v>

1180
01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:12.780
<v Speaker 1>In the mythological world in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you could conceptualize the world as</v>

1181
01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>a stage for an option</v>

1182
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.870
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1183
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:21.440
<v Speaker 1>this is a shakespearean quote that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sums it up quite nicely.</v>

1184
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:26.660
<v Speaker 1>All the world's a stage and all the men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and women merely players,</v>

1185
01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.693
<v Speaker 1>they have their exits and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrances and one man in his time plays </v>

1186
01:14:30.981 --> 01:14:33.530
<v Speaker 1>many parts and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1187
01:14:33.531 --> 01:14:34.364
<v Speaker 1>is that really true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is only depends </v>

1188
01:14:37.341 --> 01:14:38.174
<v Speaker 1>on what you mean by truth and now really</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the answer because there are </v>

1189
01:14:41.841 --> 01:14:45.170
<v Speaker 1>different ways of defining truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1190
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.193
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't self evident that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>only one way of defining true that's </v>

1191
01:14:53.741 --> 01:14:55.030
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1192
01:14:55.031 --> 01:14:59.310
<v Speaker 1>the truth might be more like a tool and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1193
01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:01.100
<v Speaker 1>we are a tool using creatures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

1194
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:01.953
<v Speaker 1>What we're trying to do with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptions of truth is to work through </v>

1195
01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:05.644
<v Speaker 1>the world successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even science is supporting it </v>

1196
01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:09.873
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be subordinate to our use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world as a tool because if it isn't </v>

1197
01:15:13.841 --> 01:15:16.390
<v Speaker 1>useful tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are we doing with it?</v>

1198
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:17.643
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just generating technology that might </v>

1199
01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:22.390
<v Speaker 1>destroy the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a bad idea,</v>

1200
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:23.683
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1201
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:26.223
<v Speaker 1>so I think that the world has to o is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the fundamental sort of truth </v>

1202
01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:32.350
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's a Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

1203
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:35.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to our notions about the world have</v>

1204
01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:36.664
<v Speaker 1>evolved through a Darwinian process and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's appropriate for us to regard </v>

1205
01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.233
<v Speaker 1>as what is most real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things that reliably ensure are a </v>

1206
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:51.143
<v Speaker 1>continuation of our life and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of our propagation and if </v>

1207
01:15:55.121 --> 01:15:55.954
<v Speaker 1>you're a true Darwinian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a way out of that </v>

1208
01:15:58.541 --> 01:15:59.374
<v Speaker 1>argument and it isn't self evident by </v>
<v Speaker 1>any stretch of the imagination that </v>

1209
01:16:04.571 --> 01:16:09.571
<v Speaker 1>seeing the world as well as objects is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that our brain works.</v>

1210
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:11.163
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the way it works at </v>

1211
01:16:12.011 --> 01:16:17.011
<v Speaker 1>all and I think that that's why we're so</v>
<v Speaker 1>wired for stories,</v>

1212
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:22.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mystery.</v>

1213
01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:23.693
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you won't line up for two hours to </v>

1214
01:16:26.071 --> 01:16:29.880
<v Speaker 1>go see a lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll line up for two hours.</v>

1215
01:16:29.881 --> 01:16:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll even camp overnight if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're mythological imagination has been</v>

1216
01:16:33.301 --> 01:16:34.134
<v Speaker 1>seized for God only knows what reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By Star Wars and you know that's a </v>

1217
01:16:39.151 --> 01:16:39.984
<v Speaker 1>source of mythologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the mythology of the modern person </v>

1218
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.740
<v Speaker 1>and it fills a gap and that's why people</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it</v>

1219
01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:49.893
<v Speaker 1>so that to me speaks of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which our psyches are </v>

1220
01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:55.324
<v Speaker 1>constructed and that's a union idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea of the archetype </v>

1221
01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.613
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to be human is to participate in a </v>

1222
01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:08.041
<v Speaker 1>certain pattern of being and that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of being is acting out socially.</v>

1223
01:17:09.441 --> 01:17:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also part of your structure.</v>

1224
01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Even your perceptual structure as a as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>living organism of your particular type,</v>

1225
01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:25.460
<v Speaker 1>and it wouldn't be the case at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>depart for the hero myth which is go out</v>

1226
01:17:25.461 --> 01:17:30.461
<v Speaker 1>where no one has gone before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Face the terrors of the unknown,</v>

1227
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:36.510
<v Speaker 1>gather something of value and return is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the central story pub.</v>

1228
01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:40.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only central story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

1229
01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:42.243
<v Speaker 1>It's out there in the top three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the dram and if you engage </v>

1230
01:17:46.991 --> 01:17:51.520
<v Speaker 1>yourself in are variations of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1231
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Can you watch it over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're trying to learn how to do</v>

1232
01:17:56.201 --> 01:17:58.710
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you need to do to live.</v>

1233
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:05.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1234
01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:06.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

1235
01:18:06.701 --> 01:18:07.534
<v Speaker 1>here's your Nike.</v>

1236
01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.440
<v Speaker 1>What's common among people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1237
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:15.283
<v Speaker 1>the self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know of our own existence that we </v>

1238
01:18:18.691 --> 01:18:19.524
<v Speaker 1>know have our own limitations and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that he has a certain innate </v>

1239
01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:26.750
<v Speaker 1>terror and fragility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

1240
01:18:26.751 --> 01:18:27.584
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our existence is a problem to us and in </v>

1241
01:18:30.361 --> 01:18:33.270
<v Speaker 1>some sense what we're trying to do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we search for meaning is to search for a</v>

1242
01:18:33.271 --> 01:18:35.790
<v Speaker 1>solution to that problem and that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>

1243
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:39.870
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be molded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1244
01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:40.973
<v Speaker 1>being engaged in something worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be a good medicine for being </v>

1245
01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:45.560
<v Speaker 1>fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1246
01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.010
<v Speaker 1>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm doing this.</v>

1247
01:18:47.011 --> 01:18:47.844
<v Speaker 1>It seems worthwhile and the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a price to be paid for it and </v>

1248
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:53.880
<v Speaker 1>things can be followed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The darn good I'm willing to put up with</v>

1249
01:18:53.881 --> 01:18:56.650
<v Speaker 1>that because what I'm engaged in seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be appropriate.</v>

1250
01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.760
<v Speaker 1>A sufficient significance to justify all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1251
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:04.710
<v Speaker 1>We all become self conscious and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all trying to do something about that.</v>

1252
01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Figure out how we deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a landscape that we inhabit,</v>

1253
01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I would say within which that takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

1254
01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:19.920
<v Speaker 1>the human being self conscious job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too tragic and doomed to be aware of the</v>

1255
01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.620
<v Speaker 1>human being has two elements and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the element that seeks to go.</v>

1256
01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the other element that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeks,</v>

1257
01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:28.403
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

1258
01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.110
<v Speaker 1>revenge and destruction and we have our </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

1259
01:19:33.111 --> 01:19:35.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If something tragic happens,</v>

1260
01:19:35.051 --> 01:19:39.410
<v Speaker 1>students tragic and unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really brings the low probability</v>

1261
01:19:39.411 --> 01:19:43.370
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to become resentful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and want revenge is extraordinarily high</v>

1262
01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder and you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal representation is not as evil</v>

1263
01:19:47.721 --> 01:19:52.721
<v Speaker 1>itself and the archetypal representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of good if you could do is the hero.</v>

1264
01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:54.973
<v Speaker 1>And so those things in habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanent elements of the human psyche </v>

1265
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and then what else is universal to us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1266
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.950
<v Speaker 1>we live in a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say that's deep,</v>

1267
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.853
<v Speaker 1>that's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just human society like we've </v>

1268
01:20:10.371 --> 01:20:11.204
<v Speaker 1>lived in a society forever so you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lobsters don't have the time and they </v>

1269
01:20:16.921 --> 01:20:17.754
<v Speaker 1>used their serotonin system at least in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part to keep track of their dominance </v>

1270
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:21.774
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can use antidepressants on </v>

1271
01:20:23.491 --> 01:20:24.324
<v Speaker 1>lobsters when they get defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel so bad for being </v>

1272
01:20:26.971 --> 01:20:29.910
<v Speaker 1>defeated in a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you just think about that because</v>

1273
01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:32.010
<v Speaker 1>any depressants do the same thing to us.</v>

1274
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:33.623
<v Speaker 1>We're so bloody social that the circuits</v>
<v Speaker 1>that evolved 300 million years ago when </v>

1275
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:46.350
<v Speaker 1>the lobsters in us headed shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestor are still operating at the base</v>

1276
01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:47.630
<v Speaker 1>of your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1277
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:48.563
<v Speaker 1>my status is so important to people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation mean that serotonin system </v>

1278
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:56.020
<v Speaker 1>governs your emotional regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How people respond to you.</v>

1279
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you man.</v>

1280
01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:57.913
<v Speaker 1>That matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're on facebook all the </v>

1281
01:20:59.611 --> 01:21:00.444
<v Speaker 1>time and checking your texts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessing continually about your online </v>

1282
01:21:04.621 --> 01:21:06.740
<v Speaker 1>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as soon as you're doing that,</v>

1283
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contacting people frantically and seeing</v>

1284
01:21:09.571 --> 01:21:12.630
<v Speaker 1>what the updates are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like where are where?</v>

1285
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:15.000
<v Speaker 1>How are you held in the esteem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>others?</v>

1286
01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:16.043
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important and that's because it </v>

1287
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:20.550
<v Speaker 1>determines your emotional regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important.</v>

1288
01:21:20.551 --> 01:21:24.900
<v Speaker 1>So we exist in a society always and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>society as to elements,</v>

1289
01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:28.830
<v Speaker 1>the tyrannical element of the society </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the tyrannical king.</v>

1290
01:21:28.831 --> 01:21:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking a very common.</v>

1291
01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Here's the logical theme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that in the lion king to right?</v>

1292
01:21:33.701 --> 01:21:34.534
<v Speaker 1>If that scar and of course you see it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real world almost continually and </v>

1293
01:21:40.441 --> 01:21:41.274
<v Speaker 1>then the benevolent king who is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of all the good things about </v>

1294
01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1295
01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:51.170
<v Speaker 1>and you can see these things play out </v>
<v Speaker 1>August mythologies in political terms.</v>

1296
01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:56.160
<v Speaker 1>So I would say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually harping about the oppressive</v>

1297
01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:59.100
<v Speaker 1>nature of the Patriarchy is part of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>

1298
01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.660
<v Speaker 1>And the myth is that society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive.</v>

1299
01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.421
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1300
01:22:03.421 --> 01:22:04.254
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you know because you have to </v>

1301
01:22:07.051 --> 01:22:07.884
<v Speaker 1>be quite a bit like you and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be quite a bit like you even if you're </v>

1302
01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:14.940
<v Speaker 1>not so that you can get along great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody sacrifices a tremendous amount</v>

1303
01:22:14.941 --> 01:22:19.941
<v Speaker 1>of their individuality to the common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the common motive being asked.</v>

1304
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a tyrannical element to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>

1305
01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.940
<v Speaker 1>it's the basis of cooperation and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability of society.</v>

1306
01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:31.163
<v Speaker 1>And then the final element is perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>often represented in a masculine manner </v>

1307
01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:36.990
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1308
01:22:36.991 --> 01:22:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because our primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>domicile structures,</v>

1309
01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:43.530
<v Speaker 1>given the creatures we are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees.</v>

1310
01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:44.543
<v Speaker 1>The primary structures of dominance are </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and then outside of what's </v>

1311
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.060
<v Speaker 1>known is the unknown.</v>

1312
01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.473
<v Speaker 1>And we always have to contend with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's wonderful in that it's the </v>

1313
01:23:00.021 --> 01:23:00.854
<v Speaker 1>source of all new things and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible in the place where all the </v>

1314
01:23:04.221 --> 01:23:06.310
<v Speaker 1>things that destabilize you've come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

1315
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:11.830
<v Speaker 4>And so this is a good representation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although not the only one.</v>

1316
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:16.150
<v Speaker 4>So that's the feminine</v>
<v Speaker 4>nature,</v>

1317
01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:17.043
<v Speaker 4>that's the masculine order and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the individual who's destined to suffer </v>

1318
01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:26.400
<v Speaker 4>in the grasp of those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finish this next time.</v>

1319
01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:40.700
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1320
01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.310
<v Speaker 4>good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll see you next time.</v>

1321
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1322
01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:54.390
<v Speaker 4>So today to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to finish</v>

1323
01:23:56.150 --> 01:23:56.983
<v Speaker 4>the last lecture and then with any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to start the next one </v>

1324
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:02.550
<v Speaker 4>fanatically late anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you know what?</v>

1325
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:06.900
<v Speaker 4>All the lectures for the next call for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole course,</v>

1326
01:24:06.901 --> 01:24:11.580
<v Speaker 4>hopefully we'll be thematically linked </v>
<v Speaker 4>it to some degree given the knowledge,</v>

1327
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.860
<v Speaker 4>they're about the same topic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some are more types of late.</v>

1328
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:16.893
<v Speaker 4>So I started telling you</v>
<v Speaker 4>last week about this idea of the voyage </v>

1329
01:24:23.911 --> 01:24:28.911
<v Speaker 4>to the underworld and I want to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit more about that</v>

1330
01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:32.873
<v Speaker 4>young in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptualize the voyage to the </v>

1331
01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:40.041
<v Speaker 4>underworld as a journey into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious and the unconscious.</v>

1332
01:24:41.281 --> 01:24:42.114
<v Speaker 4>For the psychoanalyst is a place of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fantasy and dream and implicit </v>

1333
01:24:47.071 --> 01:24:50.560
<v Speaker 4>presupposition and habit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all crap.</v>

1334
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:52.103
<v Speaker 4>There is an unconscious and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's perfectly reasonable to </v>

1335
01:24:56.131 --> 01:24:58.140
<v Speaker 4>conceptualize it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the big difference,</v>

1336
01:24:58.141 --> 01:25:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>between the psychoanalysts and the later</v>

1337
01:25:01.351 --> 01:25:02.184
<v Speaker 4>more empirical scientists is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalysts sort of envisioned your </v>

1338
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:09.623
<v Speaker 4>psyche's as a place of living partial </v>
<v Speaker 4>personalities instead of cognitive </v>

1339
01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:23.460
<v Speaker 4>computational systems that they took </v>
<v Speaker 4>into account.</v>

1340
01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.293
<v Speaker 4>The fact that you're alive and the parts</v>
<v Speaker 4>of you are alive and you know there's a </v>

1341
01:25:29.611 --> 01:25:31.470
<v Speaker 4>neuroscientist named Gavin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They</v>

1342
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:36.780
<v Speaker 4>don't know how to say his name guys in </v>
<v Speaker 4>India.</v>

1343
01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:38.730
<v Speaker 4>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that,</v>

1344
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:39.720
<v Speaker 4>is that and go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1345
01:25:39.721 --> 01:25:41.380
<v Speaker 4>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>

1346
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:42.623
<v Speaker 4>he did some of the earliest experiments </v>
<v Speaker 4>on split brains and so sometimes if you </v>

1347
01:25:46.171 --> 01:25:49.110
<v Speaker 4>have intractable epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I wouldn't recommend by the way,</v>

1348
01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of the surgical procedures for </v>
<v Speaker 4>mediating gets negative effects.</v>

1349
01:25:56.041 --> 01:25:56.874
<v Speaker 4>There's something called a cut the </v>
<v Speaker 4>corpus callosum and it's very large </v>

1350
01:26:00.561 --> 01:26:03.120
<v Speaker 4>number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very large structure in the brain that</v>

1351
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:06.820
<v Speaker 4>connects the two separate hemispheres.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And No,</v>

1352
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:08.960
<v Speaker 4>it's not obvious why we have two </v>
<v Speaker 4>separate hemispheres,</v>

1353
01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.750
<v Speaker 4>although I'll probably do a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>about why I think it is,</v>

1354
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.490
<v Speaker 4>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do communicate.</v>

1355
01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:16.680
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that Nigga</v>

1356
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:19.303
<v Speaker 4>demonstrated was that you could tell one</v>
<v Speaker 4>hemisphere something without the other </v>

1357
01:26:24.171 --> 01:26:29.171
<v Speaker 4>one knowing that both hemispheres we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>conscious and that the consciousness was</v>

1358
01:26:29.661 --> 01:26:30.860
<v Speaker 4>somewhat independent.</v>

1359
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting.</v>

1360
01:26:33.771 --> 01:26:35.770
<v Speaker 4>It makes very interesting reading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading,</v>

1361
01:26:36.450 --> 01:26:37.283
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it suggests that fragments of </v>

1362
01:26:39.981 --> 01:26:41.060
<v Speaker 4>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can think of,</v>

1363
01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:42.373
<v Speaker 4>you have fragments of yourself within </v>
<v Speaker 4>you that are like low resolution </v>

1364
01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:46.480
<v Speaker 4>representations of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1365
01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:47.593
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the psychoanalysts would think of </v>

1366
01:26:48.651 --> 01:26:51.730
<v Speaker 4>those more as they're kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of like one giant.</v>

1367
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.903
<v Speaker 4>That might be a way of thinking about if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were thinking about it in a </v>

1368
01:26:54.531 --> 01:26:58.700
<v Speaker 4>fantastical way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's the angry you and you know,</v>

1369
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.720
<v Speaker 4>you all come into contact with the angry</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1370
01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:03.973
<v Speaker 4>It's a rather rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first thing you might say </v>

1371
01:27:05.961 --> 01:27:08.480
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impulsive than short term.</v>

1372
01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:09.613
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't take much about the past </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless it's bad things about whoever </v>

1373
01:27:13.431 --> 01:27:16.500
<v Speaker 4>you're angry at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in which case it makes them a lot.</v>

1374
01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:17.893
<v Speaker 4>It's not too concerned with longterm </v>
<v Speaker 4>future consequences and mostly at wants </v>

1375
01:27:21.711 --> 01:27:22.544
<v Speaker 4>to be right</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know when angry you disappears </v>

1376
01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:31.460
<v Speaker 4>and normal view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assuming such a thing exists,</v>

1377
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:32.510
<v Speaker 4>reappears.</v>

1378
01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:33.853
<v Speaker 4>You can be perfectly shocked about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>angry you behave and in fact sometimes </v>

1379
01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:45.190
<v Speaker 4>if angry you really gets out of hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>like it might in a battle and the war.</v>

1380
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.310
<v Speaker 4>It might do things that you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine that you would do.</v>

1381
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:50.783
<v Speaker 4>And under those circumstances you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>reveal parts of yourself to yourself </v>

1382
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:56.743
<v Speaker 4>that are so foreign and so horrifying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it will leave you with </v>

1383
01:28:03.231 --> 01:28:07.130
<v Speaker 4>posttraumatic stress disorder because it</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the case that</v>

1384
01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:09.553
<v Speaker 4>many but not all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who suffer from post traumatic </v>

1385
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:16.190
<v Speaker 4>stress disorder especially it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>battlefield related,</v>

1386
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.823
<v Speaker 4>get it because of something they did </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than something they saw or </v>

1387
01:28:21.291 --> 01:28:25.010
<v Speaker 4>something that happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's really we're thinking about.</v>

1388
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.943
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a lot of weird potential </v>

1389
01:28:27.711 --> 01:28:28.544
<v Speaker 4>nested inside people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see it under normal </v>

1390
01:28:31.011 --> 01:28:31.844
<v Speaker 4>circumstances because the circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 4>are normal and part of the reason that </v>

1391
01:28:35.961 --> 01:28:36.794
<v Speaker 4>we like the circumstances to be normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>is precisely so that we don't see those </v>

1392
01:28:42.831 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 4>parts of people we don't want to see.</v>

1393
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:47.780
<v Speaker 4>And that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were knowing.</v>

1394
01:28:47.781 --> 01:28:52.781
<v Speaker 4>It's really worth knowing because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why people are so identified with</v>

1395
01:28:54.471 --> 01:28:56.030
<v Speaker 4>your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why they need a coach.</v>

1396
01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:58.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the terror management theorists types.</v>

1397
01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:02.700
<v Speaker 4>It kind of think of culture as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanism that inhibits anxiety.</v>

1398
01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:03.613
<v Speaker 4>Think about it psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's something inside your your </v>

1399
01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:06.924
<v Speaker 4>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

1400
01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:08.123
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it gives meaning to advanced and </v>

1401
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:14.990
<v Speaker 4>stops you from collapsing into chaos and</v>
<v Speaker 4>protects you from death anxiety.</v>

1402
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:18.930
<v Speaker 4>But</v>
<v Speaker 4>that isn't done right.</v>

1403
01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.380
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that isn't what your culture is.</v>

1404
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Your culture is a set of value Laden </v>
<v Speaker 4>presuppositions that you orient yourself</v>

1405
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:34.250
<v Speaker 4>in the world that match the set of Value</v>
<v Speaker 4>Laden presuppositions.</v>

1406
01:29:34.561 --> 01:29:37.770
<v Speaker 4>But everyone in your culture has and </v>
<v Speaker 4>acts out.</v>

1407
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.903
<v Speaker 4>And so what that means is that when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe something and you're among your </v>

1408
01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:45.940
<v Speaker 4>own people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you believe something implicitly,</v>

1409
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:48.210
<v Speaker 4>the way you look at the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way you act things out,</v>

1410
01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.870
<v Speaker 4>you act about everyone expects you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>act the bowel,</v>

1411
01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:52.560
<v Speaker 4>they're happy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact.</v>

1412
01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.350
<v Speaker 4>So there's a match between what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>

1413
01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:58.290
<v Speaker 4>what you see and what you're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what other people expect.</v>

1414
01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:01.230
<v Speaker 4>And it's that matched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that regulates your emotions.</v>

1415
01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:04.770
<v Speaker 4>It's not the belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the match.</v>

1416
01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:06.443
<v Speaker 4>And so part of the reason that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so tied to their cultural identity </v>

1417
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:11.663
<v Speaker 4>is because their cultural identity </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulates their emotions and in a </v>

1418
01:30:17.461 --> 01:30:20.250
<v Speaker 4>profound way like this is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1419
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:21.323
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that stabilizes human </v>
<v Speaker 4>nervous systems is that you have a </v>

1420
01:30:27.091 --> 01:30:29.790
<v Speaker 4>domain of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's many domains of competence.</v>

1421
01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.670
<v Speaker 4>And of course in some of those domains </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're completely incompetent,</v>

1422
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:35.730
<v Speaker 4>but they met me not matter because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't go into that domain.</v>

1423
01:30:35.731 --> 01:30:36.564
<v Speaker 4>So you have some area of specialization </v>
<v Speaker 4>which you might think of as your sub </v>

1424
01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:42.180
<v Speaker 4>tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know your university students.</v>

1425
01:30:42.181 --> 01:30:43.014
<v Speaker 4>And so some of you are lower status by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rules of the university game and </v>

1426
01:30:47.461 --> 01:30:48.294
<v Speaker 4>some of you are higher status by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules of the university gate by the </v>

1427
01:30:50.851 --> 01:30:51.300
<v Speaker 4>tribe.</v>

1428
01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:52.133
<v Speaker 4>And so the higher status people tend to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be the ones who fit into the academic </v>

1429
01:30:56.491 --> 01:30:57.211
<v Speaker 4>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1430
01:30:57.211 --> 01:30:58.044
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and find it conducive to their mode of </v>

1431
01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:05.310
<v Speaker 4>being and all who also do well and their</v>
<v Speaker 4>serotonin levels rise.</v>

1432
01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:06.893
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the neurochemicals that moderate mood </v>

1433
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.270
<v Speaker 4>particularly are serotonergic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Serotonin,</v>

1434
01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.370
<v Speaker 4>it's lots of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an oversimplification,</v>

1435
01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:20.350
<v Speaker 4>but that'll do for now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you become dominant in a hierarchy,</v>

1436
01:31:20.351 --> 01:31:24.840
<v Speaker 4>your serotonin levels rise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what that means is that happy things</v>

1437
01:31:24.841 --> 01:31:27.990
<v Speaker 4>make you happier and sad things make you</v>
<v Speaker 4>less sad.</v>

1438
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:29.143
<v Speaker 4>Tunes your nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're down at the bottom of the </v>

1439
01:31:31.141 --> 01:31:32.690
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have your failing.</v>

1440
01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:33.573
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1441
01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:37.500
<v Speaker 4>hardly anything makes you happy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything makes you nervous.</v>

1442
01:31:37.501 --> 01:31:40.770
<v Speaker 4>And it's no wonder because it's not very</v>
<v Speaker 4>good down there.</v>

1443
01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.960
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1444
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:48.600
<v Speaker 4>the societal structure which which is an</v>
<v Speaker 4>elaborated dominance hierarchy,</v>

1445
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.753
<v Speaker 4>regulates your emotions because of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>match between your expectations and the </v>

1446
01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:56.370
<v Speaker 4>behaviors of the people within that </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure,</v>

1447
01:31:56.730 --> 01:32:01.090
<v Speaker 4>and then your position within the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy regulates the rate ratio.</v>

1448
01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:04.030
<v Speaker 4>Let's say empty intensity between </v>
<v Speaker 4>positive and negative emotion,</v>

1449
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:09.270
<v Speaker 4>so you mess with people's status at your</v>
<v Speaker 4>peril and you disrupt their culture.</v>

1450
01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:15.810
<v Speaker 4>They don't like that and no wonder </v>
<v Speaker 4>because when it's disrupted,</v>

1451
01:32:16.091 --> 01:32:18.940
<v Speaker 4>they fall into chaos and chaos is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety.</v>

1452
01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:20.653
<v Speaker 4>Anxiety is bad now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not just anxiety because when </v>

1453
01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:26.290
<v Speaker 4>you fall into chaos but things fall </v>
<v Speaker 4>apart for you.</v>

1454
01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:29.373
<v Speaker 4>Of course you're uncertain and anxious </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you don't know what the hell is </v>

1455
01:32:32.381 --> 01:32:35.290
<v Speaker 4>going on and you don't know where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are and you don't know what to do.</v>

1456
01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.213
<v Speaker 4>Pants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety provoking and maybe you can't </v>

1457
01:32:37.591 --> 01:32:39.850
<v Speaker 4>even understand your past property and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more of that.</v>

1458
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:40.743
<v Speaker 4>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that happens with people could be </v>

1459
01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:46.500
<v Speaker 4>trained and so you fall into this state </v>
<v Speaker 4>where nothing is certain.</v>

1460
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:51.370
<v Speaker 4>The way you construe the world isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain and even the way the world is no</v>

1461
01:32:51.371 --> 01:32:52.204
<v Speaker 4>longer certain because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to act or your actions aren't </v>

1462
01:32:56.231 --> 01:32:58.810
<v Speaker 4>working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the world is presenting itself as</v>

1463
01:32:58.811 --> 01:33:01.630
<v Speaker 4>something that's chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just psychological.</v>

1464
01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:03.033
<v Speaker 4>The chaos is a weird intermingling of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the chaotic world and the chaotic south </v>

1465
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:09.610
<v Speaker 4>and that's what happens when you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>unemployed,</v>

1466
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:12.240
<v Speaker 4>like devastated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1467
01:33:12.710 --> 01:33:15.310
<v Speaker 4>It's devastating to people and if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could say,</v>

1468
01:33:15.311 --> 01:33:16.390
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's psychological.</v>

1469
01:33:16.391 --> 01:33:16.961
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1470
01:33:16.961 --> 01:33:18.880
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're unemployed.</v>

1471
01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:23.890
<v Speaker 4>That makes the world far more </v>
<v Speaker 4>incomprehensible and uncertain.</v>

1472
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:27.820
<v Speaker 4>It's not just psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's psychological and that's bad,</v>

1473
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.250
<v Speaker 4>but it's also real and that's even </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse,</v>

1474
01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:31.084
<v Speaker 4>and then those two things can spiral,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they often do because you know if </v>

1475
01:33:35.911 --> 01:33:40.570
<v Speaker 4>you don't set your expectations properly</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a drug search and assume that you're</v>

1476
01:33:40.571 --> 01:33:44.230
<v Speaker 4>going to get 49 rejections for every </v>
<v Speaker 4>interview,</v>

1477
01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:47.980
<v Speaker 4>which you really need to know because if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get 49 rejections,</v>

1478
01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 4>it's not because you're useless because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the baseline for rejection is 98 percent</v>

1479
01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:53.973
<v Speaker 4>and that's okay because the base rate </v>
<v Speaker 4>for rejection for everything is 98 </v>

1480
01:33:57.791 --> 01:33:59.500
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No matter what you do,</v>

1481
01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:00.663
<v Speaker 4>but you need to know that so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't feel that it's like something </v>

1482
01:34:02.801 --> 01:34:03.634
<v Speaker 4>wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course you only have to get it </v>

1483
01:34:05.621 --> 01:34:09.400
<v Speaker 4>right once that India had the job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's a lottery,</v>

1484
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:10.960
<v Speaker 4>but you have to set yourself up.</v>

1485
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.801
<v Speaker 4>You have to take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1486
01:34:11.801 --> 01:34:13.000
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to look for a job.</v>

1487
01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.030
<v Speaker 4>I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many resumes can I tolerate?</v>

1488
01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:18.080
<v Speaker 4>Sending out a day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1489
01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:21.940
<v Speaker 4>it has to be enough so you don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like other useless moron and it can't be</v>

1490
01:34:21.941 --> 01:34:25.480
<v Speaker 4>so many that you're overwhelmed by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>burden.</v>

1491
01:34:25.481 --> 01:34:28.630
<v Speaker 4>So and I help people do this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing all the time.</v>

1492
01:34:28.631 --> 01:34:29.830
<v Speaker 4>So maybe you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1493
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:34.200
<v Speaker 4>you're going to send out 10 a day and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to work two hours on it and</v>

1494
01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:35.043
<v Speaker 4>it's going to take six months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you know you've got your </v>

1495
01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:41.140
<v Speaker 4>parameters set properly and you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>know what to expect in the world.</v>

1496
01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:46.810
<v Speaker 4>And your emotions are regulated and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the state of being unemployed,</v>

1497
01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:51.070
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't just produce psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences.</v>

1498
01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:52.773
<v Speaker 4>So the distinction between the psyche </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the world in some sense is quite </v>

1499
01:34:56.501 --> 01:34:59.660
<v Speaker 4>arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the psychoanalyst,</v>

1500
01:34:59.661 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>err too much on the side of the subject.</v>

1501
01:35:03.450 --> 01:35:04.283
<v Speaker 4>They came to think that too much of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>is inside of you and too little of us </v>

1502
01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.393
<v Speaker 4>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When part of the reason I believe that </v>

1503
01:35:11.781 --> 01:35:15.130
<v Speaker 4>it's because of my clinical experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the psychoanalyst map.</v>

1504
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:18.920
<v Speaker 4>They're brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're brilliant or deep.</v>

1505
01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:21.523
<v Speaker 4>They grappled with real problems like </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the problems when people have real </v>

1506
01:35:25.161 --> 01:35:25.994
<v Speaker 4>problems and I need profound problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There really profound moral problems or </v>

1507
01:35:29.511 --> 01:35:30.344
<v Speaker 4>problems of good and evil really know </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are things going on in their </v>

1508
01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:37.570
<v Speaker 4>family that are so terrible that well </v>
<v Speaker 4>the terrible.</v>

1509
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:41.180
<v Speaker 4>There are some times fabled lie upon lie</v>
<v Speaker 4>upon,</v>

1510
01:35:41.181 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 4>lie upon lie for decades and decades and</v>
<v Speaker 4>decades.</v>

1511
01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.393
<v Speaker 3>Awful.</v>

1512
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:55.180
<v Speaker 4>And that's not exactly inside them.</v>

1513
01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.630
<v Speaker 4>It's out there in the world and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that I see,</v>

1514
01:36:01.530 --> 01:36:06.530
<v Speaker 4>very famous critic of psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember his name,</v>

1515
01:36:07.171 --> 01:36:08.004
<v Speaker 4>but I probably will</v>
<v Speaker 4>criticize practice of psychology quite </v>

1516
01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:15.810
<v Speaker 4>effectively in the believe in the early </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixties.</v>

1517
01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:19.850
<v Speaker 4>The Myth of mental illness by Thomas sat</v>
<v Speaker 4>as zed,</v>

1518
01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:22.140
<v Speaker 4>a s zed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's classic.</v>

1519
01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:26.150
<v Speaker 4>You should read it if you're interested </v>
<v Speaker 4>in psychology reading like it's.</v>

1520
01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:31.170
<v Speaker 4>It's a classic and he basically said </v>
<v Speaker 4>most people have problems in living.</v>

1521
01:36:31.171 --> 01:36:35.550
<v Speaker 4>They don't have psychological problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I've experienced,</v>

1522
01:36:35.670 --> 01:36:36.503
<v Speaker 4>despite my love for the psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very frequently what I'm doing as a </v>

1523
01:36:40.531 --> 01:36:44.730
<v Speaker 4>therapist is helping people have a life </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would work.</v>

1524
01:36:45.690 --> 01:36:48.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can parameterize that.</v>

1525
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:50.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you need?</v>

1526
01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:54.300
<v Speaker 4>How about some friends that will kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

1527
01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.193
<v Speaker 4>How about an intimate relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone that you can trust that maybe </v>

1528
01:36:57.541 --> 01:36:58.380
<v Speaker 4>has a future?</v>

1529
01:36:58.650 --> 01:36:59.483
<v Speaker 4>That'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about a career that puts you in a </v>

1530
01:37:01.321 --> 01:37:02.154
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy somewhere so at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least you've got some possibility of </v>

1531
01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:08.340
<v Speaker 4>rising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some possibility of stabilizing yourself</v>

1532
01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:13.350
<v Speaker 4>and their schedule and a routine because</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one can live without a routine.</v>

1533
01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:16.320
<v Speaker 4>You just forget that if you guys don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a routine,</v>

1534
01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:17.843
<v Speaker 4>I would recommend you get one going </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you cannot be mentally healthy </v>

1535
01:37:21.811 --> 01:37:22.644
<v Speaker 4>without a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to pick a time to get up </v>

1536
01:37:25.170 --> 01:37:26.003
<v Speaker 4>whatever time you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but pick one and stick to it because </v>

1537
01:37:28.381 --> 01:37:33.330
<v Speaker 4>otherwise you've disregulate your </v>
<v Speaker 4>circadian rhythms and they regulate your</v>

1538
01:37:33.331 --> 01:37:36.210
<v Speaker 4>mood and eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the morning.</v>

1539
01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.033
<v Speaker 4>I had lots of clients that anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorders are one client who was </v>

1540
01:37:40.951 --> 01:37:43.980
<v Speaker 4>literally starving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very smart girl,</v>

1541
01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.990
<v Speaker 4>cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's very little that she liked.</v>

1542
01:37:45.991 --> 01:37:48.930
<v Speaker 4>She kind of tried to subsist on like </v>
<v Speaker 4>half a cup of rice a day.</v>

1543
01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:51.540
<v Speaker 4>She came to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no energy.</v>

1544
01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:54.780
<v Speaker 4>I come home and all I want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch the same movie over and over.</v>

1545
01:37:54.781 --> 01:37:57.840
<v Speaker 4>What is that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

1546
01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:59.280
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends about rj work,</v>

1547
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird,</v>

1548
01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:04.620
<v Speaker 4>but whatever familiar is looking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>comfort.</v>

1549
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:05.663
<v Speaker 4>So I did an analysis of her diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like three quarters of a cup of </v>

1550
01:38:09.871 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 4>rice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're starving,</v>

1551
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.310
<v Speaker 4>eat something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1552
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:21.150
<v Speaker 4>you'll feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she modified her diet and they're all</v>

1553
01:38:21.151 --> 01:38:23.510
<v Speaker 4>or anxiety went away and she had some </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy.</v>

1554
01:38:23.511 --> 01:38:24.840
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1555
01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:31.750
<v Speaker 4>so schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing man.</v>

1556
01:38:31.751 --> 01:38:32.584
<v Speaker 4>And your brain will thank you for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will stabilize your nervous system </v>

1557
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:37.710
<v Speaker 4>with a bit of a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing.</v>

1558
01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:41.040
<v Speaker 4>You need a career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need something productive to do with</v>

1559
01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:41.874
<v Speaker 4>your time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to regulate your use of drugs </v>

1560
01:38:44.761 --> 01:38:45.594
<v Speaker 4>and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most particularly the alcohol because </v>

1561
01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:52.731
<v Speaker 4>that does eat a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your family,</v>

1562
01:38:53.581 --> 01:38:56.340
<v Speaker 4>like the family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have your parents and all that.</v>

1563
01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:58.800
<v Speaker 4>It'd be nice if you all got along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could work on that.</v>

1564
01:38:58.801 --> 01:39:00.800
<v Speaker 4>That's a good thing to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you know what?</v>

1565
01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:03.060
<v Speaker 4>You probably need children at some point</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's life.</v>

1566
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:07.950
<v Speaker 4>That's what life is and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>missing,</v>

1567
01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:09.053
<v Speaker 4>you know you may have a good reason to </v>
<v Speaker 4>not be operating on one of those </v>

1568
01:39:12.181 --> 01:39:15.090
<v Speaker 4>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not mandatory,</v>

1569
01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:20.070
<v Speaker 4>but I can tell you that if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>operating reasonably well on four,</v>

1570
01:39:20.071 --> 01:39:20.904
<v Speaker 4>I think I mentioned six,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not operating reasonably well </v>

1571
01:39:22.771 --> 01:39:23.604
<v Speaker 4>on at least three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way you're going to be </v>

1572
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:28.703
<v Speaker 4>psychologically thriving and that's more</v>
<v Speaker 4>pragmatic in some sense than </v>

1573
01:39:33.361 --> 01:39:36.270
<v Speaker 4>psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like human beings have a nature.</v>

1574
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:37.583
<v Speaker 4>There's things we need and if we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>them well that's good and if we don't </v>

1575
01:39:41.131 --> 01:39:44.820
<v Speaker 4>have them well then we feel the lack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So behaviorists,</v>

1576
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:48.600
<v Speaker 4>behavioral psychologists concentrated a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot more on that sort of thing.</v>

1577
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:52.300
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's practical strategizing?</v>

1578
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:53.933
<v Speaker 4>Make a career plan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how to negotiate because </v>

1579
01:39:55.321 --> 01:39:57.720
<v Speaker 4>that's bloody important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Figuring out how to say what you need,</v>

1580
01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.273
<v Speaker 4>figure out how to tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how to listen to your </v>

1581
01:40:04.291 --> 01:40:07.920
<v Speaker 4>partner in particular because if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to them,</v>

1582
01:40:07.930 --> 01:40:08.763
<v Speaker 4>they will actually tell you what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>want and sometimes you can give it to </v>

1583
01:40:12.001 --> 01:40:12.834
<v Speaker 4>them and maybe they'll return the favor </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you practice that for like 15 </v>

1584
01:40:15.931 --> 01:40:16.764
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then maybe you don't constantly </v>

1585
01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:21.150
<v Speaker 4>giving each other what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well Hooray.</v>

1586
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:23.970
<v Speaker 4>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's two of you.</v>

1587
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:25.583
<v Speaker 4>Under most circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's better to have two brains than one </v>

1588
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.940
<v Speaker 4>because people think differently because</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their temperament mostly.</v>

1589
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:34.303
<v Speaker 4>And so the negotiation is where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wisdom arises and it's part of the </v>

1590
01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:39.984
<v Speaker 4>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychological transformation that's </v>

1591
01:40:42.001 --> 01:40:46.380
<v Speaker 4>attendant on an intimate relationship </v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the fundamental purposes of a</v>

1592
01:40:46.381 --> 01:40:50.430
<v Speaker 4>long term intimate relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways.</v>

1593
01:40:50.431 --> 01:40:51.264
<v Speaker 4>When that falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chaos ensues and that's why is </v>

1594
01:40:53.531 --> 01:40:58.450
<v Speaker 4>represented so continually and myths and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stories,</v>

1595
01:40:58.930 --> 01:41:01.510
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to walk you through a bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that more today.</v>

1596
01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:06.130
<v Speaker 4>I talked about the story of Jonah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1597
01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:07.360
<v Speaker 4>here's something to think about.</v>

1598
01:41:10.450 --> 01:41:11.283
<v Speaker 4>The internal representations of language</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning evolve partly from our pre </v>

1599
01:41:16.061 --> 01:41:20.290
<v Speaker 4>linguistic ancestor's knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>social relations like modern monkeys and</v>

1600
01:41:20.291 --> 01:41:21.124
<v Speaker 4>apes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our ancestors lived in groups with </v>

1601
01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:23.613
<v Speaker 4>intricate networks of relationships that</v>
<v Speaker 4>were simultaneously competitive and </v>

1602
01:41:27.341 --> 01:41:28.174
<v Speaker 4>cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The demands of social life created </v>

1603
01:41:29.801 --> 01:41:32.650
<v Speaker 4>selective pressures for just the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>complex,</v>

1604
01:41:32.651 --> 01:41:33.484
<v Speaker 4>abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conceptual and computational abilities </v>

1605
01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:36.243
<v Speaker 4>that are likely to have proceeded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The earliest forms of linguistic </v>

1606
01:41:38.921 --> 01:41:39.754
<v Speaker 4>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although baboons have concepts and </v>

1607
01:41:42.161 --> 01:41:45.370
<v Speaker 4>acquire propositional information from </v>
<v Speaker 4>other animals,</v>

1608
01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.250
<v Speaker 4>vocalizations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can articulate this information.</v>

1609
01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.200
<v Speaker 4>They understand dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships,</v>

1610
01:41:50.201 --> 01:41:52.770
<v Speaker 4>and matrilineal kinship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have the words for them.</v>

1611
01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:54.123
<v Speaker 4>This suggests that the internal </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation of many concept </v>

1612
01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:57.753
<v Speaker 4>relations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an actual action sequences does not </v>

1613
01:42:00.521 --> 01:42:01.354
<v Speaker 4>require language and the language did </v>
<v Speaker 4>not evolve because it was uniquely </v>

1614
01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.890
<v Speaker 4>suited to represent the thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>

1615
01:42:05.891 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can think without laying well,</v>

1616
01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:12.040
<v Speaker 4>take the case of someone who's deaf and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mute.</v>

1617
01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:15.580
<v Speaker 4>They have no language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1618
01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.270
<v Speaker 4>they can operate in society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they learn how to represent other people</v>

1619
01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:21.760
<v Speaker 4>and they do that with image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1620
01:42:21.761 --> 01:42:22.594
<v Speaker 4>the postmodernists who I</v>
<v Speaker 4>despised would be a reasonable way of </v>

1621
01:42:28.630 --> 01:42:29.463
<v Speaker 4>putting it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have this proposition that there's no </v>

1622
01:42:31.931 --> 01:42:35.170
<v Speaker 4>meaning outside language and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful argument by the way,</v>

1623
01:42:35.171 --> 01:42:37.000
<v Speaker 4>but it's seriously wrong.</v>

1624
01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.653
<v Speaker 4>There is a meaning network outside of </v>
<v Speaker 4>language and it's what language is </v>

1625
01:42:43.151 --> 01:42:48.151
<v Speaker 4>grounded in and that's this pre verbal </v>
<v Speaker 4>comprehension of the world.</v>

1626
01:42:49.091 --> 01:42:54.091
<v Speaker 4>It's an embodied comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world animals have lobsters have it,</v>

1627
01:42:55.130 --> 01:42:58.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this particular scientists say far</v>

1628
01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:03.580
<v Speaker 4>talks about our shared history with </v>
<v Speaker 4>higher primates.</v>

1629
01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.700
<v Speaker 4>That probably goes back 20 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

1630
01:43:06.701 --> 01:43:07.534
<v Speaker 4>something like that slip from the common</v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestor with chimps about 7 million </v>

1631
01:43:11.321 --> 01:43:12.950
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1632
01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:17.680
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lobsters have dominance hierarchies.</v>

1633
01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:20.110
<v Speaker 4>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a nervous system at all,</v>

1634
01:43:20.111 --> 01:43:22.180
<v Speaker 4>which is partly what you're studying </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite extensively.</v>

1635
01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.380
<v Speaker 4>And so they have a social structure and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they understand it.</v>

1636
01:43:26.650 --> 01:43:27.483
<v Speaker 4>Like at one lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a lobster to be quite a shock to </v>

1637
01:43:30.581 --> 01:43:31.414
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it happened and you were fighting </v>

1638
01:43:33.731 --> 01:43:36.730
<v Speaker 4>with another lobster and you lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would remember that.</v>

1639
01:43:36.731 --> 01:43:41.140
<v Speaker 4>And the next time you saw that lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd scuttle off somewhere else and you</v>

1640
01:43:41.170 --> 01:43:42.003
<v Speaker 4>know that.</v>

1641
01:43:42.010 --> 01:43:43.720
<v Speaker 4>And all the lobsters and an area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1642
01:43:43.721 --> 01:43:44.554
<v Speaker 4>who's taught lobster and who isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Pop lobster gets the best bloody </v>

1643
01:43:49.271 --> 01:43:51.530
<v Speaker 4>place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the best food.</v>

1644
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.750
<v Speaker 4>So this dominance issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this cultural issue,</v>

1645
01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:58.333
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we live in a social </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment is far deeper than people </v>

1646
01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:04.550
<v Speaker 4>usually consider it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also worth considering.</v>

1647
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:07.850
<v Speaker 4>This is what you might think of from an </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary perspective.</v>

1648
01:44:07.851 --> 01:44:08.684
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think of natural selection as </v>

1649
01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.320
<v Speaker 4>producing evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1650
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:15.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>random mutation with natural selection.</v>

1651
01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:18.650
<v Speaker 4>But here's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Darwin knew this,</v>

1652
01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:20.393
<v Speaker 4>but Darwin was really smart and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biologists who followed in his </v>

1653
01:44:22.971 --> 01:44:24.560
<v Speaker 4>footsteps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even up to now,</v>

1654
01:44:24.710 --> 01:44:28.960
<v Speaker 4>I've only expanded out a fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what he had the same.</v>

1655
01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:30.513
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was very interested in sexual </v>

1656
01:44:31.341 --> 01:44:35.360
<v Speaker 4>selection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now one of the things about human beings</v>

1657
01:44:35.361 --> 01:44:39.590
<v Speaker 4>that's unique is that human females are </v>
<v Speaker 4>picky majors.</v>

1658
01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:41.830
<v Speaker 4>You're choosing a.</v>

1659
01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:43.053
<v Speaker 4>they're also sneaky because you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell when they're articulating and with </v>

1660
01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.480
<v Speaker 4>many other female animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1661
01:44:48.170 --> 01:44:49.003
<v Speaker 4>so</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have hidden ovulation and their </v>

1662
01:44:52.431 --> 01:44:53.264
<v Speaker 4>choosing and they tend to choose men who</v>
<v Speaker 4>are more successful in the dominance </v>

1663
01:44:57.141 --> 01:44:58.280
<v Speaker 4>arch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1664
01:44:58.790 --> 01:45:02.090
<v Speaker 4>there there is a shock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you have a choice.</v>

1665
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:03.403
<v Speaker 4>Why don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pick someone who's at the bottom of </v>

1666
01:45:06.411 --> 01:45:07.244
<v Speaker 4>the competence hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that's probably not going to work </v>

1667
01:45:09.441 --> 01:45:13.790
<v Speaker 4>out very well for you and since women </v>
<v Speaker 4>bear the burden of reproduction,</v>

1668
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:16.423
<v Speaker 4>it's perfectly reasonable for them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>search out someone who's going to be </v>

1669
01:45:18.801 --> 01:45:20.420
<v Speaker 4>helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so productive,</v>

1670
01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.670
<v Speaker 4>fair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>generous,</v>

1671
01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:25.150
<v Speaker 4>and you know when you think of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy,</v>

1672
01:45:25.151 --> 01:45:27.080
<v Speaker 4>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's the powerful guy.</v>

1673
01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:30.670
<v Speaker 4>The aggressive guy say that rises to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>top of the dominance hierarchy.</v>

1674
01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even true among chimps.</v>

1675
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:34.423
<v Speaker 4>Like you can get a chimp tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then what happens is other chimps </v>

1676
01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:40.700
<v Speaker 4>ganging up on him and tear him to pieces</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't do it nicely.</v>

1677
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.923
<v Speaker 4>They don't do it nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the chimps that tend to maintain </v>

1678
01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:48.710
<v Speaker 4>their dominance for long periods of time</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a pretty wide network of friends.</v>

1679
01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:53.510
<v Speaker 4>Roughly speaking with whom they engage </v>
<v Speaker 4>in reciprocal interactions like grooming</v>

1680
01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:54.493
<v Speaker 4>and they actually pay a lot of positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to the female chimps who have </v>

1681
01:45:56.901 --> 01:45:59.630
<v Speaker 4>their own hierarchy by the way and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>their offspring.</v>

1682
01:46:00.110 --> 01:46:02.090
<v Speaker 4>So they're like baby kissing </v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians.</v>

1683
01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:06.550
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea that it's raw power that</v>
<v Speaker 4>produces dominance is a,</v>

1684
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:09.950
<v Speaker 4>it's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's wrong.</v>

1685
01:46:09.951 --> 01:46:10.730
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1686
01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:14.800
<v Speaker 4>tyrants pretty damn of unstable business</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a tyrant.</v>

1687
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:16.430
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of people who want to kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1688
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:17.390
<v Speaker 4>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1689
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:20.540
<v Speaker 4>you tend to rule over something </v>
<v Speaker 4>approximating Pale.</v>

1690
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:24.530
<v Speaker 4>So maybe that's why we're better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a subject in hell,</v>

1691
01:46:24.531 --> 01:46:28.460
<v Speaker 4>but it's not much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyway,</v>

1692
01:46:28.461 --> 01:46:31.760
<v Speaker 4>so this social social now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what this means,</v>

1693
01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:32.750
<v Speaker 4>think about this for a minute.</v>

1694
01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:36.860
<v Speaker 4>So imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine what I tell you.</v>

1695
01:46:36.861 --> 01:46:37.694
<v Speaker 4>Bear some resemblance to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's quite a lot of evidence </v>

1696
01:46:40.491 --> 01:46:42.860
<v Speaker 4>for it from a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from a biological perspective.</v>

1697
01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:45.553
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this choosy mating thing occurs with </v>

1698
01:46:47.481 --> 01:46:48.590
<v Speaker 4>lots of species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1699
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:52.080
<v Speaker 4>here's this bird called the bower bird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to look up bower birds,</v>

1700
01:46:52.081 --> 01:46:53.110
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those things are,</v>

1701
01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.570
<v Speaker 4>you just can't even believe they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when the Mayo Bower Bird,</v>

1702
01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:00.930
<v Speaker 4>he makes this really complicated nest </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's close to the ground.</v>

1703
01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:03.330
<v Speaker 4>He weaves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really quite nice.</v>

1704
01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.580
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't make one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1705
01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:06.533
<v Speaker 4>And then he sweeps this the yard in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of the nest and then he runs </v>

1706
01:47:11.671 --> 01:47:16.620
<v Speaker 4>around the forest or flies because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a bird finding pretty things.</v>

1707
01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:19.470
<v Speaker 4>So maybe he'll find a nice collection of</v>
<v Speaker 4>red leaves.</v>

1708
01:47:19.471 --> 01:47:20.304
<v Speaker 4>And so they'd helped take the red leaves</v>
<v Speaker 4>one by one and fly back to his front </v>

1709
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 4>door and make a little square.</v>

1710
01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:26.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a bird so it's not a great square,</v>

1711
01:47:26.701 --> 01:47:30.510
<v Speaker 4>but it makes a little patch of red and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he takes a look at that and then he goes</v>

1712
01:47:30.511 --> 01:47:33.630
<v Speaker 4>off and find something blue and had he </v>
<v Speaker 4>decorates it,</v>

1713
01:47:33.631 --> 01:47:36.990
<v Speaker 4>makes a little piece of abstract art in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the front of his nest.</v>

1714
01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.290
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of male bowerbirds do this all</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the same time.</v>

1715
01:47:40.770 --> 01:47:41.603
<v Speaker 4>And so then the females come along,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hop on something nearby and they </v>

1716
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:46.820
<v Speaker 4>kind of look at it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>check it out.</v>

1717
01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:50.310
<v Speaker 4>And if they're happy with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then things proceed.</v>

1718
01:47:50.311 --> 01:47:51.144
<v Speaker 4>But if they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd fly off to someone else's piece </v>

1719
01:47:52.801 --> 01:47:53.634
<v Speaker 4>of abstract art and if a mail piece of </v>
<v Speaker 4>already rejected by like three females </v>

1720
01:47:58.801 --> 01:48:02.070
<v Speaker 4>in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets irritated and brushes it all off</v>

1721
01:48:02.071 --> 01:48:04.320
<v Speaker 4>with his weight and then he makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>another one.</v>

1722
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:07.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1723
01:48:07.021 --> 01:48:10.230
<v Speaker 4>they obviously have a sense of a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>well developed sense of beauty.</v>

1724
01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:12.000
<v Speaker 4>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1725
01:48:12.330 --> 01:48:16.920
<v Speaker 4>and I guess the idea is that who knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell the ID is,</v>

1726
01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:20.070
<v Speaker 4>the female birds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like artistic mail,</v>

1727
01:48:20.071 --> 01:48:20.904
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're thinking about it </v>

1728
01:48:22.201 --> 01:48:23.034
<v Speaker 4>biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's an indication of </v>

1729
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:25.800
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1730
01:48:25.801 --> 01:48:26.634
<v Speaker 4>It's a marker of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly the case that female </v>

1731
01:48:30.271 --> 01:48:35.271
<v Speaker 4>humans prefer creative men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So wonder horse.</v>

1732
01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:39.120
<v Speaker 4>We wouldn't be creative if that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>the case.</v>

1733
01:48:39.121 --> 01:48:39.954
<v Speaker 4>So that imagine that there's two primary</v>
<v Speaker 4>forces of evolutionary selection </v>

1734
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:46.560
<v Speaker 4>operating on us and they're not really </v>
<v Speaker 4>the natural world,</v>

1735
01:48:46.561 --> 01:48:48.720
<v Speaker 4>which is what people always think like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the environment,</v>

1736
01:48:48.721 --> 01:48:52.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the animals and the trees and nature.</v>

1737
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:55.600
<v Speaker 4>But it isn't nature that selected us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to other things.</v>

1738
01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Partly it's two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one is the dominance hierarchy.</v>

1739
01:48:59.851 --> 01:49:04.851
<v Speaker 4>The male dominance hierarchy is one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the primary mechanisms of selection,</v>

1740
01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.740
<v Speaker 4>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1741
01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.520
<v Speaker 4>women are faced with a hard choice.</v>

1742
01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:09.840
<v Speaker 4>Which guided laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1743
01:49:09.841 --> 01:49:11.430
<v Speaker 4>That's a hard choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1744
01:49:11.431 --> 01:49:15.180
<v Speaker 4>so they do the same thing that people do</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the stock market.</v>

1745
01:49:15.450 --> 01:49:16.283
<v Speaker 4>They outsourced the cognitive problems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the computational problem to the male </v>

1746
01:49:19.951 --> 01:49:20.784
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they just let the mail sort </v>

1747
01:49:22.531 --> 01:49:23.364
<v Speaker 4>themselves out however they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the appeal from the top and so </v>

1748
01:49:26.731 --> 01:49:27.564
<v Speaker 4>what that means is the dominant male </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy itself is a </v>

1749
01:49:30.521 --> 01:49:33.300
<v Speaker 4>selection mechanism because if you fail </v>
<v Speaker 4>at it,</v>

1750
01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:38.720
<v Speaker 4>then you don't leave any offspring and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so what that means is at least in part,</v>

1751
01:49:39.601 --> 01:49:40.434
<v Speaker 4>is that we have adapted to be better and</v>
<v Speaker 4>better at attaining status in dominance </v>

1752
01:49:46.471 --> 01:49:49.300
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God only knows how long a period of time</v>

1753
01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:53.020
<v Speaker 4>and that doesn't mean just power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what it might mean?</v>

1754
01:49:53.021 --> 01:49:55.120
<v Speaker 4>Cognitive flexibility because you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine,</v>

1755
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:58.510
<v Speaker 4>do you want me to its hierarchy a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominance hierarchy,</v>

1756
01:49:58.511 --> 01:50:00.460
<v Speaker 4>b dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hierarchy seeds.</v>

1757
01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:02.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if like if you're really successful,</v>

1758
01:50:02.441 --> 01:50:05.170
<v Speaker 4>you've climb up dominance hierarchy a </v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1759
01:50:05.171 --> 01:50:07.240
<v Speaker 4>but you'd be in seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1760
01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.490
<v Speaker 4>If you have the landing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those you just be a failure,</v>

1761
01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:10.713
<v Speaker 4>so then you could say the ideal human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being as someone who can climb to the </v>

1762
01:50:14.891 --> 01:50:15.724
<v Speaker 4>top of a dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what the dominance hierarchy </v>

1763
01:50:17.531 --> 01:50:19.330
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1764
01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.150
<v Speaker 4>So we've evolved to.</v>

1765
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:25.143
<v Speaker 4>We've evolved such that success across </v>
<v Speaker 4>the set of possible dominance </v>

1766
01:50:29.771 --> 01:50:30.604
<v Speaker 4>hierarchies is the target and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why we have general intelligence </v>

1767
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:35.823
<v Speaker 4>because general intelligence is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>general problem solving mechanism and </v>

1768
01:50:39.730 --> 01:50:40.563
<v Speaker 4>it's a single factory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is intelligence is a single </v>

1769
01:50:43.331 --> 01:50:44.164
<v Speaker 4>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not divisible despite what people </v>

1770
01:50:47.951 --> 01:50:48.784
<v Speaker 4>like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robert Sternberg and Howard Gardner </v>

1771
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:58.790
<v Speaker 4>falsely played.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and then from the female perspective,</v>

1772
01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:04.720
<v Speaker 4>females are the next gate keeper and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why they're often.</v>

1773
01:51:04.721 --> 01:51:06.910
<v Speaker 4>Mother Nature took me a long time to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure this out.</v>

1774
01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Why the hell is it nature?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Feminine,</v>

1775
01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:12.070
<v Speaker 4>multiple representations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so very various.</v>

1776
01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.010
<v Speaker 4>It's extraordinarily common mother </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>

1777
01:51:15.130 --> 01:51:17.680
<v Speaker 4>You don't think a father of Mother </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nature.</v>

1778
01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:19.060
<v Speaker 4>It's like why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1779
01:51:19.061 --> 01:51:22.600
<v Speaker 4>nature brings forth new forms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's feminine.</v>

1780
01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Nature selects in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the definition of nature.</v>

1781
01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:30.693
<v Speaker 4>From a Darwinian perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nature is that which selects women </v>

1782
01:51:35.051 --> 01:51:40.051
<v Speaker 4>select their nature and that's partly </v>
<v Speaker 4>why far more men than you might think,</v>

1783
01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:43.053
<v Speaker 4>like far more terrified of women because</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be rejected as a romantic partner by </v>

1784
01:51:50.141 --> 01:51:55.141
<v Speaker 4>a woman is to be classified as vaguely </v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptable life form.</v>

1785
01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:02.660
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No value in propagating.</v>

1786
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:05.050
<v Speaker 4>All</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1787
01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:08.550
<v Speaker 4>so it's a major,</v>
<v Speaker 4>major rejection and no,</v>

1788
01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:12.040
<v Speaker 4>I've had</v>
<v Speaker 4>some clients and many,</v>

1789
01:52:12.041 --> 01:52:15.760
<v Speaker 4>many people write to me whose primary </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem is that?</v>

1790
01:52:15.761 --> 01:52:16.900
<v Speaker 4>They're so careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women,</v>

1791
01:52:16.901 --> 01:52:18.970
<v Speaker 4>they can't even approach them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

1792
01:52:18.971 --> 01:52:19.810
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very cool.</v>

1793
01:52:20.890 --> 01:52:21.723
<v Speaker 4>So alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to show you this little </v>

1794
01:52:24.551 --> 01:52:25.384
<v Speaker 4>triangle thing.</v>

1795
01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:27.773
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

1796
01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:38.670
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your no nonverbal,</v>

1797
01:53:38.671 --> 01:53:39.600
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nonverbal.</v>

1798
01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.990
<v Speaker 4>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1799
01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:44.213
<v Speaker 4>here's mother triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm guess mother triangle has circle as </v>

1800
01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:54.860
<v Speaker 4>a child and triangle</v>
<v Speaker 4>is maybe a friend,</v>

1801
01:53:56.190 --> 01:54:00.570
<v Speaker 4>but not one that's very welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>According to mother and a</v>

1802
01:54:04.710 --> 01:54:05.543
<v Speaker 4>child circled was trying to play with </v>
<v Speaker 4>triangle filed and mother doesn't like </v>

1803
01:54:11.161 --> 01:54:12.900
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she goes out there and pecks the hell</v>

1804
01:54:12.901 --> 01:54:15.690
<v Speaker 4>out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chases them away,</v>

1805
01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:21.740
<v Speaker 4>pushes child circle back into that hole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes into the that.</v>

1806
01:54:22.410 --> 01:54:25.170
<v Speaker 4>And then Charles Circle isn't very happy</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>

1807
01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:26.753
<v Speaker 4>Running around causing trouble and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>manages to escape and then bad child </v>

1808
01:54:31.141 --> 01:54:31.974
<v Speaker 4>train shows up and they play together </v>
<v Speaker 4>and run around and run around and run </v>

1809
01:54:34.441 --> 01:54:38.070
<v Speaker 4>around and run around with mother </v>
<v Speaker 4>chasing them and then they will.</v>

1810
01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:39.840
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they elope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows,</v>

1811
01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:43.440
<v Speaker 4>and then mother triangle has it fit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood was in the house,</v>

1812
01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:44.403
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1813
01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:48.233
<v Speaker 4>Reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you consider that a reasonable </v>

1814
01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:55.100
<v Speaker 4>story about what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perhaps you had other interpretations,</v>

1815
01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:58.860
<v Speaker 4>but I suspect they were vaguely along </v>
<v Speaker 4>that line,</v>

1816
01:54:59.570 --> 01:55:00.403
<v Speaker 4>but the point here is the point of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiment is how much information do </v>

1817
01:55:03.871 --> 01:55:08.300
<v Speaker 4>you need from which to derive the </v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative and the answer is like none.</v>

1818
01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:10.350
<v Speaker 4>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just immediate.</v>

1819
01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:11.213
<v Speaker 4>You can watch some triangles moving </v>
<v Speaker 4>around a box and instantly you </v>

1820
01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:16.613
<v Speaker 4>personalize it and that's because that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>what your life and the reason you're </v>

1821
01:55:22.231 --> 01:55:26.250
<v Speaker 4>like that is because your environment </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't nature.</v>

1822
01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:29.250
<v Speaker 4>Your environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these culture,</v>

1823
01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:32.380
<v Speaker 4>your environment is other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people,</v>

1824
01:55:32.970 --> 01:55:37.830
<v Speaker 4>and that was even more true for </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzees and so forth that especially</v>

1825
01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:41.100
<v Speaker 4>animals that had a limited diet like </v>
<v Speaker 4>gorillas,</v>

1826
01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:44.290
<v Speaker 4>they pretty much all eat leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

1827
01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:45.193
<v Speaker 4>Chimps spends like 12 hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 4>chewing and that's where they have got </v>

1828
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:52.320
<v Speaker 4>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can't eat leaves,</v>

1829
01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:53.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you tried,</v>

1830
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:56.040
<v Speaker 4>they have no nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you're going to eat leads,</v>

1831
01:55:56.041 --> 01:56:01.041
<v Speaker 4>you have to eat a lot of them and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes like three months to digest.</v>

1832
01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:05.820
<v Speaker 4>And so what we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is pretty cool because smart is</v>

1833
01:56:05.821 --> 01:56:10.821
<v Speaker 4>that we've traded gut for brain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we're so spelled and the way</v>

1834
01:56:11.401 --> 01:56:12.234
<v Speaker 4>we manage that it appears is that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>learned how to use fire to cook things </v>

1835
01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:19.440
<v Speaker 4>and that meant that we had high quality </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrition much higher.</v>

1836
01:56:19.441 --> 01:56:22.350
<v Speaker 4>It's easier to digest things especially </v>
<v Speaker 4>neat.</v>

1837
01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:23.753
<v Speaker 4>And so because we invented fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't have to have so much in test </v>

1838
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:29.820
<v Speaker 4>items.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could spend a little more time on the</v>

1839
01:56:29.821 --> 01:56:33.500
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So human beings really are fire users.</v>

1840
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:38.510
<v Speaker 4>We invented fire or discovered it or </v>
<v Speaker 4>mastered it at least a couple of million</v>

1841
01:56:38.581 --> 01:56:39.414
<v Speaker 4>years for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's all pretty cool as far as I'm </v>

1842
01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:45.353
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>

1843
01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:52.540
<v Speaker 4>So that's partly how we think</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's naturally how you think.</v>

1844
01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:54.113
<v Speaker 4>You think a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we'll say that your fundamental </v>

1845
01:56:56.491 --> 01:57:00.780
<v Speaker 4>architecture is social cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tend to view the world as a persona.</v>

1846
01:57:02.010 --> 01:57:06.480
<v Speaker 4>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world in which you emerge as a being was</v>

1847
01:57:06.481 --> 01:57:07.314
<v Speaker 4>primarily social.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you needed to know was who's the </v>

1848
01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:11.160
<v Speaker 4>big primate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's the little primate,</v>

1849
01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:12.740
<v Speaker 4>who's related to who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1850
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:13.583
<v Speaker 4>among chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If a big chimp is threatened by a small </v>

1851
01:57:16.231 --> 01:57:18.140
<v Speaker 4>chip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1852
01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:19.073
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big chimp just care this small chip </v>

1853
01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:20.993
<v Speaker 4>party,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the big chimp will back off if it </v>

1854
01:57:24.391 --> 01:57:29.280
<v Speaker 4>knows that the little chimp is </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with some really big chimps.</v>

1855
01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:30.803
<v Speaker 4>And so the little chip can bowling the </v>
<v Speaker 4>big chimp because it's part of a </v>

1856
01:57:33.570 --> 01:57:36.990
<v Speaker 4>dominant family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's because the nervous system of</v>

1857
01:57:36.991 --> 01:57:39.840
<v Speaker 4>the big gym doesn't respond to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>little chimp,</v>

1858
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:42.270
<v Speaker 4>like a little chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It responds to the little chimp,</v>

1859
01:57:42.271 --> 01:57:43.104
<v Speaker 4>like it's a little chimp with four great</v>
<v Speaker 4>monsters attached to it because it's </v>

1860
01:57:47.791 --> 01:57:48.624
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's nervous system is actually </v>

1861
01:57:50.491 --> 01:57:54.060
<v Speaker 4>responding to the network around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>champion.</v>

1862
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:56.220
<v Speaker 4>And so that's exactly what you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1863
01:57:56.221 --> 01:57:58.200
<v Speaker 4>it's not exactly what you're like </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're not chips,</v>

1864
01:57:58.201 --> 01:57:59.034
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that kind of platform that </v>

1865
01:58:01.831 --> 01:58:05.700
<v Speaker 4>constitutes the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>underpinnings of your psyche.</v>

1866
01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:09.480
<v Speaker 4>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1867
01:58:09.481 --> 01:58:12.210
<v Speaker 4>it means this is like perfectly fine to </v>
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

1868
01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:14.040
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can animate things.</v>

1869
01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:16.440
<v Speaker 4>Rabbits are people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No problem.</v>

1870
01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:18.030
<v Speaker 4>We'll go along with that.</v>

1871
01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:23.430
<v Speaker 4>You remember Roger Rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I presume most of you watch that.</v>

1872
01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:26.070
<v Speaker 4>So this is the detective who's name I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't remember.</v>

1873
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:27.263
<v Speaker 4>He asked to go to toontown because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's cartoons and there's people and </v>

1874
01:58:30.630 --> 01:58:33.890
<v Speaker 4>they share the same world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could go into toontown the.</v>

1875
01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:36.280
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of annoying because cartoon </v>
<v Speaker 4>figures,</v>

1876
01:58:36.281 --> 01:58:37.114
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like slapstick types and so he's very </v>

1877
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:42.190
<v Speaker 4>happy to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is what it looks like.</v>

1878
01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:47.410
<v Speaker 4>Everything's animated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning alive.</v>

1879
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:48.603
<v Speaker 4>Anima means soul underway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everything has a personality and you </v>

1880
01:58:53.321 --> 01:58:56.890
<v Speaker 4>know when you're reading books to kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his son has a personality,</v>

1881
01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:58.360
<v Speaker 4>train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a personality,</v>

1882
01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:00.880
<v Speaker 4>Jeff has a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what it is,</v>

1883
01:59:00.881 --> 01:59:01.714
<v Speaker 4>it has a personality and that's because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the child is learning to understand the </v>

1884
01:59:04.481 --> 01:59:06.850
<v Speaker 4>world using the architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>social,</v>

1885
01:59:06.851 --> 01:59:08.410
<v Speaker 4>cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>architecture and so.</v>

1886
01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:10.480
<v Speaker 4>And the thing that's really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that,</v>

1887
01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:11.373
<v Speaker 4>it's just blows me away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>know evolution is conservative and so </v>

1888
01:59:14.111 --> 01:59:16.750
<v Speaker 4>once it's produced something it has to </v>
<v Speaker 4>build on it.</v>

1889
01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:21.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like dos the operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like really?</v>

1890
01:59:22.150 --> 01:59:24.460
<v Speaker 4>It's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I remember correctly,</v>

1891
01:59:24.461 --> 01:59:29.440
<v Speaker 4>under windows 10 you can get rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>damn thing because it's part part of the</v>

1892
01:59:29.441 --> 01:59:32.860
<v Speaker 4>structure down and it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>keyboards we use,</v>

1893
01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:37.300
<v Speaker 4>which are actually designed to slow </v>
<v Speaker 4>typers down because with mechanical type</v>

1894
01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:38.950
<v Speaker 4>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you type too fast,</v>

1895
01:59:38.951 --> 01:59:41.470
<v Speaker 4>the keys with jam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they divided device,</v>

1896
01:59:41.471 --> 01:59:44.200
<v Speaker 4>the keyboard to slow you down and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>still use it,</v>

1897
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:46.330
<v Speaker 4>which is stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1898
01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:51.160
<v Speaker 4>you want the high frequency letters </v>
<v Speaker 4>close to your middle fingers.</v>

1899
01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:52.653
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's like at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we can't change it because everyone </v>

1900
01:59:54.521 --> 01:59:56.920
<v Speaker 4>uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your body plan,</v>

1901
01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:59.350
<v Speaker 4>that thing has been around a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1902
01:59:59.710 --> 02:00:03.070
<v Speaker 4>If you look at mammals particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody even lizard,</v>

1903
02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:08.080
<v Speaker 4>there's so much like us in their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their skeletal structure that is just</v>

1904
02:00:08.081 --> 02:00:09.220
<v Speaker 4>mind boggling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1905
02:00:09.230 --> 02:00:14.230
<v Speaker 4>enroll variants of the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>symmetrical four legged.</v>

1906
02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:17.033
<v Speaker 4>How here structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you have to build a what you </v>

1907
02:00:21.311 --> 02:00:22.144
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you have a social cognitive </v>

1908
02:00:23.531 --> 02:00:24.364
<v Speaker 4>architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have to first understand the </v>

1909
02:00:26.351 --> 02:00:28.480
<v Speaker 4>world through the social cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 4>categories.</v>

1910
02:00:28.690 --> 02:00:32.110
<v Speaker 4>And what sort of bloody strange about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is it actually seems to work.</v>

1911
02:00:32.290 --> 02:00:36.850
<v Speaker 4>We actually seem to develop a coherent </v>
<v Speaker 4>representation of being.</v>

1912
02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:40.090
<v Speaker 4>I would say I'm being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the same as nature.</v>

1913
02:00:40.590 --> 02:00:41.423
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same as the world because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we think of the world we think of </v>

1914
02:00:44.111 --> 02:00:44.944
<v Speaker 4>the objective world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not talking about the objective </v>

1915
02:00:47.090 --> 02:00:47.923
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about the world of human </v>

1916
02:00:49.031 --> 02:00:52.030
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we see that through social cognitive</v>

1917
02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:55.270
<v Speaker 4>filter and it makes perfect sense to us </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it works.</v>

1918
02:00:55.630 --> 02:00:57.610
<v Speaker 4>That's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

1919
02:00:58.630 --> 02:00:59.463
<v Speaker 4>everything's got this animated nature </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we don't have a problem with that </v>

1920
02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:04.780
<v Speaker 4>fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We actually find it quite fun.</v>

1921
02:01:06.170 --> 02:01:07.003
<v Speaker 4>No people go visit the Disney toontown </v>
<v Speaker 4>and participate in it to have fun with </v>

1922
02:01:14.201 --> 02:01:14.370
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1923
02:01:14.370 --> 02:01:15.203
<v Speaker 4>And so that shows you as well how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how natural it is for us to view things </v>

1924
02:01:20.231 --> 02:01:20.711
<v Speaker 4>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1925
02:01:20.711 --> 02:01:23.130
<v Speaker 4>cars have faces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1926
02:01:24.130 --> 02:01:24.963
<v Speaker 4>Designers know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know that people don't want a car </v>

1927
02:01:27.641 --> 02:01:28.474
<v Speaker 4>with three headlights because like who </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to be associated with the three </v>

1928
02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:33.670
<v Speaker 4>eyed monster?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>

1929
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:34.833
<v Speaker 4>It's like two eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's something you could be </v>

1930
02:01:36.281 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 4>comfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so cars have faces,</v>

1931
02:01:40.530 --> 02:01:43.970
<v Speaker 4>BMW's and the new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they really look cat like you know,</v>

1932
02:01:44.290 --> 02:01:47.030
<v Speaker 4>and they have sexy curves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do,</v>

1933
02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:49.340
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's been MRI studies of that.</v>

1934
02:01:49.341 --> 02:01:50.174
<v Speaker 4>So</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you show man photographs of </v>

1935
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:55.610
<v Speaker 4>attractive women looking directly at </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1936
02:01:55.611 --> 02:01:58.130
<v Speaker 4>there's a little part of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the nucleus accumbens that lights</v>

1937
02:01:58.131 --> 02:02:00.770
<v Speaker 4>up because to have someone look directly</v>
<v Speaker 4>at you,</v>

1938
02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:01.693
<v Speaker 4>especially if they have like a smile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is interpreted as an invitation to </v>

1939
02:02:05.001 --> 02:02:05.834
<v Speaker 4>approach and women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the same damn problem because </v>

1940
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:11.100
<v Speaker 4>with women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you go into drugstores saying</v>

1941
02:02:11.130 --> 02:02:13.640
<v Speaker 4>you look at women's magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all the same.</v>

1942
02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:16.190
<v Speaker 4>They've all evolved to the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>endpoint.</v>

1943
02:02:16.700 --> 02:02:18.290
<v Speaker 4>They all have an attractive woman on </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1944
02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:20.630
<v Speaker 4>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're looking right out.</v>

1945
02:02:20.810 --> 02:02:21.643
<v Speaker 4>And so when women see that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually see it as something to </v>

1946
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.640
<v Speaker 4>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an ideal.</v>

1947
02:02:26.210 --> 02:02:27.043
<v Speaker 4>And now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people say that those beauty ideals are </v>

1948
02:02:29.421 --> 02:02:32.240
<v Speaker 4>oppressive to women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All ideals are oppressive,</v>

1949
02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:33.373
<v Speaker 4>but the empirical research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of it down here suggests that </v>

1950
02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:41.080
<v Speaker 4>interacting with those images</v>
<v Speaker 4>helps the performance,</v>

1951
02:02:41.361 --> 02:02:42.194
<v Speaker 4>the psychological function of helping </v>
<v Speaker 4>the woman to equate yourself with the </v>

1952
02:02:44.721 --> 02:02:49.400
<v Speaker 4>ideal and in most cases that actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>produces a pop and elevation in mood and</v>

1953
02:02:49.401 --> 02:02:50.234
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>

1954
02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.313
<v Speaker 4>You're really going to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>magazine store when you're just looking </v>

1955
02:02:53.211 --> 02:02:54.044
<v Speaker 4>for something to do and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>buy something that makes you feel </v>

1956
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:58.640
<v Speaker 4>depressed and the oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1957
02:02:58.641 --> 02:02:59.750
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to do that.</v>

1958
02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:00.733
<v Speaker 4>Magazines that do that to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will die because no one will buy </v>

1959
02:03:04.161 --> 02:03:07.190
<v Speaker 4>them and there's a reason they all </v>
<v Speaker 4>turned out the same way.</v>

1960
02:03:07.191 --> 02:03:09.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're just responding to </v>
<v Speaker 4>demand.</v>

1961
02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:15.200
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>faces.</v>

1962
02:03:16.710 --> 02:03:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with regards to the sexy curves,</v>

1963
02:03:18.811 --> 02:03:19.644
<v Speaker 4>so</v>
<v Speaker 4>woman who looks woman's picture looking </v>

1964
02:03:22.891 --> 02:03:24.080
<v Speaker 4>right at us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1965
02:03:24.090 --> 02:03:26.850
<v Speaker 4>we'll produce this activation in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>primary reward system.</v>

1966
02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Cocaine produces the same response and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sodas,</v>

1967
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:33.810
<v Speaker 4>sports cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially curvy red sports car.</v>

1968
02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:35.093
<v Speaker 4>So that's why you often see an </v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive woman sitting on a curvy red </v>

1969
02:03:37.501 --> 02:03:40.680
<v Speaker 4>sports car in an APP because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1970
02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:43.920
<v Speaker 4>if there's an ad for beer on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1971
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:45.210
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's perfect.</v>

1972
02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:46.950
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

1973
02:03:46.951 --> 02:03:47.784
<v Speaker 4>those are all primary reward </v>
<v Speaker 4>representations that may produce </v>

1974
02:03:51.150 --> 02:03:53.850
<v Speaker 4>attraction because part of positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotion,</v>

1975
02:03:53.851 --> 02:03:54.684
<v Speaker 4>the Dopa beneath filament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>urgently mediated element of positive </v>

1976
02:03:57.090 --> 02:03:57.923
<v Speaker 4>emotion isn't approach emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a satiation satisfaction </v>

1977
02:04:01.561 --> 02:04:02.940
<v Speaker 4>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all good.</v>

1978
02:04:02.941 --> 02:04:04.760
<v Speaker 4>There's something good here I can move </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards.</v>

1979
02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:09.660
<v Speaker 4>And that that is what happiness is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's directed what happiness is.</v>

1980
02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:11.433
<v Speaker 4>It's not attaining something because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that just puts you in a whole new </v>

1981
02:04:13.771 --> 02:04:16.110
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to figure out what to do next.</v>

1982
02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:19.620
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I suggested to you</v>

1983
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:26.720
<v Speaker 4>that one of the problems that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that problem,</v>

1984
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:30.740
<v Speaker 4>I would say is not what the world is </v>
<v Speaker 4>made out of,</v>

1985
02:04:30.890 --> 02:04:31.723
<v Speaker 4>but how we should be in the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're alive and how we should </v>

1986
02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1987
02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:40.620
<v Speaker 4>it's fairly straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not so much pain would be good.</v>

1988
02:04:40.710 --> 02:04:42.510
<v Speaker 4>That'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Too much anxiety.</v>

1989
02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.520
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're on board for that.</v>

1990
02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:48.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm little pleasure down then some </v>
<v Speaker 4>stability,</v>

1991
02:04:48.710 --> 02:04:50.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not dying.</v>

1992
02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:52.530
<v Speaker 4>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big one.</v>

1993
02:04:52.890 --> 02:04:55.770
<v Speaker 4>And then let's say from a Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>

1994
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:59.210
<v Speaker 4>propagate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's what Raymond out.</v>

1995
02:04:59.211 --> 02:05:01.500
<v Speaker 4>And the reason we did that is you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about this,</v>

1996
02:05:01.501 --> 02:05:06.270
<v Speaker 4>it's so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So every single one of your,</v>

1997
02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:09.120
<v Speaker 4>of the relatives you have in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestry,</v>

1998
02:05:09.330 --> 02:05:10.163
<v Speaker 4>every single one of them</v>
<v Speaker 4>successfully produced a child who </v>

1999
02:05:16.161 --> 02:05:16.994
<v Speaker 4>successively successfully produced a </v>
<v Speaker 4>child all the way back to 3 billion </v>

2000
02:05:21.481 --> 02:05:24.750
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bloody unbelievable.</v>

2001
02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:26.850
<v Speaker 4>Like the probability that you exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2002
02:05:26.851 --> 02:05:27.684
<v Speaker 4>it's 100 percent because there you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the probability of predicting that </v>

2003
02:05:31.201 --> 02:05:32.700
<v Speaker 4>you would exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2004
02:05:32.701 --> 02:05:33.534
<v Speaker 4>if you tried to get predicted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the chance that the chances </v>

2005
02:05:36.811 --> 02:05:41.580
<v Speaker 4>that you're here so infinite testable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's just absolutely mind boggling.</v>

2006
02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:42.593
<v Speaker 4>Think about that unbroken sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 4>success over literally over billions of </v>

2007
02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:49.050
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2008
02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:51.660
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you have to,</v>

2009
02:05:52.650 --> 02:05:53.483
<v Speaker 4>obviously you have to think that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pretty strong proclivity for that to </v>

2010
02:05:58.111 --> 02:05:58.681
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2011
02:05:58.681 --> 02:06:00.570
<v Speaker 4>some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously it was a necessity,</v>

2012
02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:01.763
<v Speaker 4>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's necessary that impregnated </v>

2013
02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:06.713
<v Speaker 4>females have an infant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It isn't necessary that they keep it </v>

2014
02:06:09.841 --> 02:06:14.460
<v Speaker 4>alive so you can account for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>continuity.</v>

2015
02:06:14.461 --> 02:06:16.260
<v Speaker 4>Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from necessity,</v>

2016
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:17.333
<v Speaker 4>you have to interject at least a small </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of consideration that the care </v>

2017
02:06:22.651 --> 02:06:23.484
<v Speaker 4>that's associated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with taking care of infants </v>

2018
02:06:25.111 --> 02:06:25.944
<v Speaker 4>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2019
02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:30.240
<v Speaker 4>there are a lot of work that's there to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say this.</v>

2020
02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:31.073
<v Speaker 4>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's manifested in the </v>

2021
02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:33.084
<v Speaker 4>personality trait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agreeableness looks to be like </v>

2022
02:06:35.550 --> 02:06:36.383
<v Speaker 4>agreeableness is one of the dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 4>were admitting women very most </v>

2023
02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:39.293
<v Speaker 4>substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agreeableness looks to be like the </v>

2024
02:06:41.611 --> 02:06:42.444
<v Speaker 4>manifestation of the maternal instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now men can be agreeable to because of </v>

2025
02:06:45.421 --> 02:06:47.280
<v Speaker 4>course male human beings to take care of</v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

2026
02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:50.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a grizzly bear female.</v>

2027
02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:53.610
<v Speaker 4>You just chase the damn mail away </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he'll kill your cups.</v>

2028
02:06:53.611 --> 02:06:56.970
<v Speaker 4>That's not so helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not maternal at all.</v>

2029
02:06:57.210 --> 02:06:59.280
<v Speaker 4>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2030
02:06:59.281 --> 02:07:00.114
<v Speaker 4>human manner are pretty damn maternal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not as a wait a minute on </v>

2031
02:07:03.241 --> 02:07:04.074
<v Speaker 4>average,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although some women are less maternal </v>

2032
02:07:06.930 --> 02:07:09.600
<v Speaker 4>than some men because you know the </v>
<v Speaker 4>curves overlap.</v>

2033
02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:14.640
<v Speaker 4>But on balance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are we in the world?</v>

2034
02:07:14.670 --> 02:07:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're aware of our own vulnerability,</v>

2035
02:07:17.630 --> 02:07:21.060
<v Speaker 4>who are aware of our own shortcomings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>

2036
02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:22.073
<v Speaker 4>and that's I think that's partly from </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a social being because people are </v>

2037
02:07:24.661 --> 02:07:25.494
<v Speaker 4>always signaling your shortcomings to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to such a degree that you even say </v>

2038
02:07:28.361 --> 02:07:29.194
<v Speaker 4>go your shortcomings to yourself because</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you might as well fix them before </v>

2039
02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:32.844
<v Speaker 4>someone else points them out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's guilt and know when Freud called </v>

2040
02:07:36.851 --> 02:07:37.684
<v Speaker 4>that the Superego,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the superego is kind of like the </v>

2041
02:07:38.981 --> 02:07:43.420
<v Speaker 4>internalized representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>judgmental father and culture I think is</v>

2042
02:07:43.421 --> 02:07:45.550
<v Speaker 4>represented as a father figure.</v>

2043
02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:47.073
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the father dies say because it's </v>

2044
02:07:48.341 --> 02:07:49.174
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually quite a bit like there </v>

2045
02:07:50.351 --> 02:07:52.690
<v Speaker 4>isn't all CNI and it's all of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching you.</v>

2046
02:07:53.050 --> 02:07:53.883
<v Speaker 4>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really intelligent way of </v>

2047
02:07:54.881 --> 02:07:55.714
<v Speaker 4>conceptualizing it because the group </v>
<v Speaker 4>which is more or less eternal is </v>

2048
02:08:00.911 --> 02:08:03.580
<v Speaker 4>watching you all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

2049
02:08:03.970 --> 02:08:04.803
<v Speaker 4>And it's judging all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we know that if you put people in a </v>

2050
02:08:09.131 --> 02:08:11.450
<v Speaker 4>room when you put a pig eye on the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know nick,</v>

2051
02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:14.800
<v Speaker 4>you give them an opportunity to cheat on</v>
<v Speaker 4>some little cheesy thing.</v>

2052
02:08:14.801 --> 02:08:15.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing too important.</v>

2053
02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:17.793
<v Speaker 4>If they're in the room with the big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're less likely to cheat if they're </v>

2054
02:08:19.751 --> 02:08:23.020
<v Speaker 4>in the room with no light at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

2055
02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:23.913
<v Speaker 4>and what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You keep an eye on your kids and the </v>

2056
02:08:25.331 --> 02:08:26.164
<v Speaker 4>reason you do that and so they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>misbehave and we keep an eye on each </v>

2057
02:08:28.481 --> 02:08:33.340
<v Speaker 4>other and so we have a representation of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and as far as I can tell,</v>

2058
02:08:33.341 --> 02:08:37.930
<v Speaker 4>we represented as a transcendent figure </v>
<v Speaker 4>of judgment and just like.</v>

2059
02:08:37.931 --> 02:08:40.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2060
02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:44.640
<v Speaker 4>that's a pretty good metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

2061
02:08:48.670 --> 02:08:49.503
<v Speaker 4>one of the.</v>

2062
02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:53.973
<v Speaker 4>This is a major intellectual about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>major intellectual and it's raging in </v>

2063
02:09:00.191 --> 02:09:01.024
<v Speaker 4>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's basically a battle between post </v>

2064
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:08.950
<v Speaker 4>modernism and traditional and tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the right way of thinking</v>

2065
02:09:11.261 --> 02:09:14.650
<v Speaker 4>about it for the postmodernists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Human beings have no nature.</v>

2066
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:19.320
<v Speaker 4>We're blank slates and everything that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we are as inculturating,</v>

2067
02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:24.010
<v Speaker 4>so we're completely malleable and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>elements of our identity or going on the</v>

2068
02:09:24.011 --> 02:09:26.470
<v Speaker 4>other side are the traditionalists who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2069
02:09:26.530 --> 02:09:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I would say grounded more in</v>
<v Speaker 4>biology on the one hand,</v>

2070
02:09:30.821 --> 02:09:31.654
<v Speaker 4>but also in historical</v>
<v Speaker 4>humanities tradition that suggests that </v>

2071
02:09:37.421 --> 02:09:41.350
<v Speaker 4>people have in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I explained some of that nature.</v>

2072
02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:44.020
<v Speaker 4>Most people want to have friends as part</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your nature,</v>

2073
02:09:44.370 --> 02:09:45.203
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people want to find love part of </v>

2074
02:09:47.621 --> 02:09:50.900
<v Speaker 4>your nature and you suffer without it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

2075
02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:52.930
<v Speaker 4>he could say those are all social </v>
<v Speaker 4>constructs,</v>

2076
02:09:52.931 --> 02:09:53.764
<v Speaker 4>but</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can say you can say anything so you </v>

2077
02:09:57.701 --> 02:09:58.660
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

2078
02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:04.510
<v Speaker 4>no one ever trust someone who has one </v>
<v Speaker 4>explanation for everything.</v>

2079
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:07.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much intelligence does that take?</v>

2080
02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:08.953
<v Speaker 4>You got one explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just try to note for every </v>

2081
02:10:10.871 --> 02:10:14.260
<v Speaker 4>phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an alternative.</v>

2082
02:10:14.290 --> 02:10:15.730
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what happened in part</v>

2083
02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:19.990
<v Speaker 4>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back in the late 18,</v>

2084
02:10:19.991 --> 02:10:20.824
<v Speaker 4>hundreds was very interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>disillusion of traditional faith and in </v>

2085
02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:29.260
<v Speaker 4>the West we fell out of our myth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a way of thinking about it.</v>

2086
02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:30.423
<v Speaker 4>You start believing in its fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>axioms was he stopped believing that </v>

2087
02:10:33.621 --> 02:10:35.960
<v Speaker 4>there was such a thing as a transcendent</v>
<v Speaker 4>deity.</v>

2088
02:10:35.961 --> 02:10:36.794
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't mesh well with the </v>

2089
02:10:39.021 --> 02:10:43.220
<v Speaker 4>emerging scientific viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so in the late 18 hundreds,</v>

2090
02:10:43.221 --> 02:10:48.221
<v Speaker 4>Nietzsche announced the depth of God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which sounds fairly presumptuous,</v>

2091
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:51.223
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was celebrating the full quote and I </v>

2092
02:10:53.691 --> 02:10:55.690
<v Speaker 4>haven't gotten it exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His thoughts here,</v>

2093
02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:56.593
<v Speaker 4>we've killed them and we'll never find </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough water to wash away the rivers of </v>

2094
02:10:59.901 --> 02:11:01.320
<v Speaker 4>blood like that.</v>

2095
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:06.340
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot different than what you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>scrawled on bathroom walls and meet you.</v>

2096
02:11:07.590 --> 02:11:08.423
<v Speaker 4>Apply that in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Millions of people would die in the </v>

2097
02:11:12.411 --> 02:11:13.244
<v Speaker 4>conflicts over what values we're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to reign as an alternative to that </v>

2098
02:11:17.121 --> 02:11:20.360
<v Speaker 4>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he particularly brilliantly</v>

2099
02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:24.950
<v Speaker 4>pointed to communism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that's where it's going to be,</v>

2100
02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.770
<v Speaker 4>and dusty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she did the same thing and so</v>

2101
02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:34.460
<v Speaker 4>since then there's this been this battle</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the battle is kind of like this.</v>

2102
02:11:34.461 --> 02:11:38.030
<v Speaker 4>The battle is on the one hand between </v>
<v Speaker 4>social construction,</v>

2103
02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:42.410
<v Speaker 4>social constructionist utopians who </v>
<v Speaker 4>believed that human nature is infinitely</v>

2104
02:11:42.411 --> 02:11:45.770
<v Speaker 4>malleable and that with the proper </v>
<v Speaker 4>transformation since society,</v>

2105
02:11:45.771 --> 02:11:50.210
<v Speaker 4>you can bring the part about the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 4>state in the perfect human being and</v>

2106
02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:52.963
<v Speaker 4>and traditionalists</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you and I think is the classic </v>

2107
02:11:57.801 --> 02:11:58.634
<v Speaker 4>example of this who believed that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a human nature and it's deeply </v>

2108
02:12:02.661 --> 02:12:06.110
<v Speaker 4>embedded within us and that the culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>is we set up,</v>

2109
02:12:06.111 --> 02:12:10.580
<v Speaker 4>have to manifest themselves in </v>
<v Speaker 4>accordance with that nature or they will</v>

2110
02:12:10.581 --> 02:12:11.414
<v Speaker 4>fail.</v>

2111
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:14.263
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>young believed in the existence of a </v>

2112
02:12:15.910 --> 02:12:17.330
<v Speaker 4>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hero myth,</v>

2113
02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:18.253
<v Speaker 4>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he explained his connections to </v>

2114
02:12:20.511 --> 02:12:24.770
<v Speaker 4>various religious traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>staggeringly brilliant manner.</v>

2115
02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:25.873
<v Speaker 4>Camille Paglia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who I would recommend that they picked </v>

2116
02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:29.810
<v Speaker 4>already told me that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

2117
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:30.703
<v Speaker 4>she's already concluded after going </v>
<v Speaker 4>through a radical feminist period early </v>

2118
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:35.323
<v Speaker 4>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the proper way for society to </v>

2119
02:12:37.701 --> 02:12:38.534
<v Speaker 4>Orient itself is within a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure and that that's part of what </v>

2120
02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:46.340
<v Speaker 4>the humanities provides</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the alternative is</v>

2121
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:50.143
<v Speaker 4>rational arguments over what values are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to dominate and it isn't obvious </v>

2122
02:12:54.051 --> 02:12:57.200
<v Speaker 4>that rationality can solve that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it can.</v>

2123
02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:59.780
<v Speaker 4>That's humans point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>David Hume said,</v>

2124
02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:02.660
<v Speaker 4>you can't derive an entrepreneur is </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2125
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:05.390
<v Speaker 4>You cannot use science as a guide to </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>

2126
02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:07.370
<v Speaker 4>So what do you use?</v>

2127
02:13:09.650 --> 02:13:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instinct,</v>

2128
02:13:11.571 --> 02:13:15.890
<v Speaker 4>manifested in imagination and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolution,</v>

2129
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:18.860
<v Speaker 4>the evolved structure of your organic </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures,</v>

2130
02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:21.290
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they have a structure?</v>

2131
02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:23.300
<v Speaker 4>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2132
02:13:23.301 --> 02:13:27.530
<v Speaker 4>so you ask yourself this question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it that every human being shares</v>

2133
02:13:27.531 --> 02:13:28.364
<v Speaker 4>regardless of place and time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so any universally comprehensive </v>

2134
02:13:31.891 --> 02:13:35.430
<v Speaker 4>language that would be a Meta narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a myth,</v>

2135
02:13:35.431 --> 02:13:36.264
<v Speaker 4>the hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say a myth about what a human </v>

2136
02:13:38.281 --> 02:13:43.281
<v Speaker 4>being not only his life but shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 4>asked to speak to us about those aspects</v>

2137
02:13:43.801 --> 02:13:47.160
<v Speaker 4>of experience that we all share because </v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise we just kept the damn story.</v>

2138
02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:48.143
<v Speaker 4>Now we go to how we go to the stories </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we understand that all the time </v>

2139
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:54.060
<v Speaker 4>like star wars and it really doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter what country,</v>

2140
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:56.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody gets it more legs.</v>

2141
02:13:56.550 --> 02:14:00.600
<v Speaker 4>So obviously there are stories that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can understand and mutually,</v>

2142
02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:02.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we understand the law of stories.</v>

2143
02:14:02.311 --> 02:14:05.250
<v Speaker 4>We understand stories of conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we understand the stories of betrayal,</v>

2144
02:14:05.251 --> 02:14:08.400
<v Speaker 4>we understand stories of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's because we can feel jealousy.</v>

2145
02:14:08.401 --> 02:14:10.260
<v Speaker 4>We can feel love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can feel anger.</v>

2146
02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:13.140
<v Speaker 4>It's his party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right there.</v>

2147
02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:15.850
<v Speaker 4>We even know where the circuits are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2148
02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:18.540
<v Speaker 4>and then you're like other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel that too.</v>

2149
02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.540
<v Speaker 4>So very similar emotions as far as we </v>
<v Speaker 4>can tell.</v>

2150
02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:23.333
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2151
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:28.370
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>

2152
02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:31.700
<v Speaker 4>this is derived in large part from you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not only,</v>

2153
02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:34.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what we share,</v>

2154
02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:41.440
<v Speaker 4>natural world social world and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>of our existence as an individual.</v>

2155
02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:44.900
<v Speaker 4>And that can be represented different </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>

2156
02:14:44.901 --> 02:14:45.734
<v Speaker 4>It can be represented as you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the known and the unknown or it can be </v>

2157
02:14:50.091 --> 02:14:50.924
<v Speaker 4>you culture and nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the same representations and the </v>

2158
02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:59.180
<v Speaker 4>cultural representation tends to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>male.</v>

2159
02:14:59.750 --> 02:15:00.650
<v Speaker 4>That's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Father,</v>

2160
02:15:00.651 --> 02:15:02.090
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they</v>

2161
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:07.280
<v Speaker 4>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Feminine Representation tends to be</v>

2162
02:15:08.930 --> 02:15:11.990
<v Speaker 4>female.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the known</v>

2163
02:15:13.490 --> 02:15:14.323
<v Speaker 4>culture apollonian control that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with the sun son </v>

2164
02:15:17.730 --> 02:15:18.830
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cane,</v>

2165
02:15:18.831 --> 02:15:19.664
<v Speaker 4>the patriarch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cloud because it pushes up the </v>

2166
02:15:21.681 --> 02:15:22.514
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Phallus obviously order and </v>

2167
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:26.810
<v Speaker 4>authority and the crushing weight of </v>
<v Speaker 4>tradition,</v>

2168
02:15:26.811 --> 02:15:31.130
<v Speaker 4>the wise old man and the tyrant dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day sky,</v>

2169
02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:34.370
<v Speaker 4>the country down the iron heights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ancestral spirits,</v>

2170
02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:35.860
<v Speaker 4>the activity of the death</v>

2171
02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:40.843
<v Speaker 4>Captain Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a tyrant and that's why Peter Pan </v>

2172
02:15:42.621 --> 02:15:43.454
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to grow up to become him </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why Peter Pan doesn't grow </v>

2173
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:48.470
<v Speaker 4>because he thinks that adults are </v>
<v Speaker 4>pirates.</v>

2174
02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:51.570
<v Speaker 4>Why is captain hook a tyrant as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>crocodile?</v>

2175
02:15:51.571 --> 02:15:52.404
<v Speaker 4>Laid his hand in the crocodile has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>clock in its stomach and the reason for </v>

2176
02:15:55.551 --> 02:15:56.384
<v Speaker 4>that is that the crocodile is time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>time's over and he got a piece of </v>

2177
02:15:59.750 --> 02:16:02.210
<v Speaker 4>Captain Hook and he's not very happy </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

2178
02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:04.550
<v Speaker 4>He's bitter and resentful and too </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical,</v>

2179
02:16:04.670 --> 02:16:08.330
<v Speaker 4>and when Peter Pan looks out adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what he sees and he thinks,</v>

2180
02:16:08.331 --> 02:16:09.164
<v Speaker 4>why should I sacrifice the potential of </v>
<v Speaker 4>childhood for the singularity of </v>

2181
02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:13.633
<v Speaker 4>tyranny?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we stay as immature his entire </v>

2182
02:16:15.681 --> 02:16:19.850
<v Speaker 4>life and he's king of the lost boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus break.</v>

2183
02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:25.130
<v Speaker 4>There's a porn star named Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't remember his name.</v>

2184
02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.050
<v Speaker 4>Really good</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

2185
02:16:29.610 --> 02:16:32.770
<v Speaker 4>He didn't miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something funny.</v>

2186
02:16:32.771 --> 02:16:36.790
<v Speaker 4>I was watching a documentary about him </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he said the funniest thing.</v>

2187
02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:38.920
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

2188
02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:43.240
<v Speaker 4>with that hero to people who think </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like me are heroes.</v>

2189
02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a drag.</v>

2190
02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:47.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just in this horrible situation.</v>

2191
02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:49.870
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't admire the people that admire</v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2192
02:16:50.350 --> 02:16:52.030
<v Speaker 4>but he gets inspired by them all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

2193
02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:54.040
<v Speaker 4>but it's sort of like Peter Pan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2194
02:16:54.041 --> 02:16:55.210
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's kicking the lost boys.</v>

2195
02:16:55.330 --> 02:16:58.490
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't get windy though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2196
02:16:58.750 --> 02:17:00.640
<v Speaker 4>She grows up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She has family.</v>

2197
02:17:00.910 --> 02:17:03.340
<v Speaker 4>He asked to contend himself with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tinkerbell,</v>

2198
02:17:03.850 --> 02:17:06.250
<v Speaker 4>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tinkerbell doesn't exist.</v>

2199
02:17:07.370 --> 02:17:08.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what happens.</v>

2200
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:11.230
<v Speaker 4>You can do it for a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a representation of culture.</v>

2201
02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:12.523
<v Speaker 4>That's a nasty</v>

2202
02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:20.080
<v Speaker 4>hell kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kiss the statue of Stellar.</v>

2203
02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:25.030
<v Speaker 4>Who cares that he murdered 30 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>people culture?</v>

2204
02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:26.793
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2205
02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:30.400
<v Speaker 4>in university you hear a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>patriarchy and how oppressive it is.</v>

2206
02:17:30.401 --> 02:17:30.921
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2207
02:17:30.921 --> 02:17:32.230
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

2208
02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:33.273
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kidding,</v>

2209
02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:34.233
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of useful as well as provides </v>

2210
02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:37.453
<v Speaker 4>to eat the food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of that which kind of </v>

2211
02:17:40.301 --> 02:17:44.900
<v Speaker 4>counterbalances to some degree culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>has opposed development.</v>

2212
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:45.783
<v Speaker 4>Tenant take advil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the individual has a positive over </v>

2213
02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:48.173
<v Speaker 4>the negative element.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nature has a positive element and a </v>

2214
02:17:50.291 --> 02:17:51.124
<v Speaker 4>negative element and if people tell you </v>
<v Speaker 4>a one sided story which has the </v>

2215
02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:58.660
<v Speaker 4>ideological story they leave out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you say all culture is terrible.</v>

2216
02:17:58.790 --> 02:18:01.900
<v Speaker 4>Human being or despoiled and nature is </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>

2217
02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:03.033
<v Speaker 4>It's like no nature kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Culture keeps you alive and there's </v>

2218
02:18:08.970 --> 02:18:11.380
<v Speaker 4>things about you that are honorable and </v>
<v Speaker 4>good is wellness.</v>

2219
02:18:11.381 --> 02:18:14.740
<v Speaker 4>Things about you can learn and you need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to know both of those.</v>

2220
02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:16.810
<v Speaker 4>And that's what the great stories tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

2221
02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:19.613
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
