1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.183
<v Speaker 2>I guess since you started your videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and since you started having troubles </v>

3
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:20.394
<v Speaker 2>with know with human rights tribunals or</v>
<v Speaker 2>threats by u of t and I just think it's </v>

4
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 2>common sense that I said that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that promoting critical thinking,</v>

5
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.203
<v Speaker 2>helping people to be able to tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects that they may not feel </v>

6
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 2>comfortable about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they should be able to hear and</v>

7
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 2>process not based on emotions but based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on an actual analysis of the facts,</v>

8
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:40.284
<v Speaker 2>the evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality versus some agenda being </v>

9
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:42.834
<v Speaker 2>shoved down their throat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's media through the </v>

10
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 2>professors and anyone teaching in </v>
<v Speaker 2>academia knows that there are professors</v>

11
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 2>who have no problem with basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching their truths as fact.</v>

12
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.393
<v Speaker 2>And so I've been promoting this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting it within my own organization </v>

13
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 2>that are the Ontario Psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>Association.</v>

14
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of flack from other </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists who thought,</v>

15
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:02.844
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't allow this type of speech to </v>

16
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

17
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 2>That's a discussion that you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have had.</v>

18
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 2>The Travis didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.453
<v Speaker 2>it was October I believe when you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>those other professors coming in and </v>

20
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

21
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 2>the issue somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some psychologists wrote pieces in,</v>

22
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.523
<v Speaker 2>in national art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a media publication saying this kind of </v>

23
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 2>discussion should not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and this from psychologists,</v>

25
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:24.984
<v Speaker 2>the ones who are supposed to be best </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained to be able to tolerate the </v>

26
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 2>discomfort that goes around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes along with,</v>

27
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing uncomfortable topics.</v>

28
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 2>So I was hoping for you to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>share with,</v>

29
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience,</v>

30
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 2>your experience in the last few months </v>
<v Speaker 2>in trying to promote this.</v>

31
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

32
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 2>what you were basically trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>promote,</v>

33
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 2>which I think I'll let you describe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own words.</v>

34
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.633
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 3>So where do you think about those videos</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a minute?</v>

36
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there were two things that.</v>

37
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should give you some background on the</v>

38
00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:58.684
<v Speaker 3>videos I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just made them in my office at </v>

39
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't,</v>

40
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea what the consequence would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

41
00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I was just trying to sort out my </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts about pardoning both.</v>

42
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Not so much bill [inaudible] as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background policies that surround it,</v>

43
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.913
<v Speaker 3>especially on the Ontario Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>Commission website because the bill </v>

44
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 3>itself looks rather innocuous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only about two paragraphs long.</v>

45
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 3>The only part of it that isn't innocuous</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the insistence that</v>

46
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 3>the insistence on transforming the hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hate speech codes,</v>

47
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 3>including including harassment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>discrimination based on gender.</v>

48
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 3>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gender identity and gender expression,</v>

49
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 3>right in the hate speech codes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that's.</v>

50
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 3>That's weird that there's something out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

51
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.093
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started digging more into the </v>

52
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:45.714
<v Speaker 3>background on the Ontario Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>Commission website and the policies </v>

53
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:48.624
<v Speaker 3>surrounding bill [inaudible] to call </v>
<v Speaker 3>them appalling is barely scratched the </v>

54
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:52.854
<v Speaker 3>surface there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're unbelievably badly written and </v>

55
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.124
<v Speaker 3>contract internally contradictory and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over inclusive and dangerous and I mean </v>

56
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 3>they do things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

57
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:02.704
<v Speaker 3>like make employer's responsible for all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the speech acts of their employees </v>

58
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 3>whether they have intended or unintended</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

59
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 3>That's completely the only reason you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would write a law like that is to get as</v>

60
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 3>many employers in trouble as you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly manage because there's no other</v>

61
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:21.830
<v Speaker 3>reason for formulating the legislation </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way and I've also.</v>

62
00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 3>A colleague of mine came in recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>from at the university and he's starting</v>

63
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:26.764
<v Speaker 3>to teach a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background for this sort of thing and </v>

64
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.334
<v Speaker 3>one of his classes and he showed me the </v>
<v Speaker 3>developmental progression of the </v>

65
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:34.174
<v Speaker 3>policies surrounding bill c 16 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>originally they were written in a much </v>

66
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:37.624
<v Speaker 3>more in a tighter format,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then they were farmed out for what </v>

67
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:45.601
<v Speaker 3>they call public consultation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which basically meant they ran them by a</v>

68
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 3>variety of people who I would say are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very strongly on the activist end of the</v>

69
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:50.974
<v Speaker 3>political spectrum and they basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to not bother anyone who they </v>

70
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 3>had consulted with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they decided,</v>

71
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:58.144
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gender identity should be nothing </v>

72
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 3>but subjective choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is.</v>

73
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what to say about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

74
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 3>If you're a psychologist and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>any sense at all,</v>

75
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 3>that's a completely insane proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's first of all predicated on the idea</v>

76
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:11.164
<v Speaker 3>that your identity is your subjective </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice and that's never been the case </v>

77
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:15.694
<v Speaker 3>for any sort of identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anywhere you you take your identity is </v>

78
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.843
<v Speaker 3>twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing that your identity is a </v>

79
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 3>functional set of tools to help you </v>
<v Speaker 3>operate in the world,</v>

80
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 3>meaning read Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

81
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.480
<v Speaker 3>we've just scratched the surface of </v>
<v Speaker 3>piaget even and you find out that,</v>

82
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.583
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>children start to construct their </v>

83
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.374
<v Speaker 3>identities really when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>breastfeeding because that's when you </v>

84
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 3>first started your social interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start integrating your re.</v>

85
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.723
<v Speaker 3>Your basic biological reflex is from an </v>
<v Speaker 3>agenda perspective into something </v>

86
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:47.014
<v Speaker 3>resembling a social relationship because</v>
<v Speaker 3>breastfeeding actually happens to be </v>

87
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 3>quite a complex act and then you expand </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

88
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.153
<v Speaker 3>your developing identity out into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>small microcosmic social world of the </v>

89
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 3>family basically starting with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother.</v>

90
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 3>But then you have siblings and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>father and your relatives,</v>

91
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conventionally speaking and your </v>

92
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.473
<v Speaker 3>identity is a negotiating game and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not the only one in charge of it </v>

93
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 3>by any stretch of the imagination at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

94
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:15.034
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that Piaget pointed </v>

95
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 3>out was that between the ages of two and</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

96
00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 3>and I think later research has really </v>
<v Speaker 3>hammered this home,</v>

97
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.130
<v Speaker 3>that even kids who are hyper aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>at two,</v>

98
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 3>if there's a small proportion of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are like,</v>

99
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:27.934
<v Speaker 3>that learn to integrate their subjective</v>
<v Speaker 3>desires into a broader social game and </v>

100
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 3>become socially acceptable to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>children and they do that through play,</v>

101
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.903
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing is playing their </v>

102
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:40.594
<v Speaker 3>identity into being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once they're older than about </v>

103
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 3>four and they've become properly </v>
<v Speaker 3>socialized.</v>

104
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:46.054
<v Speaker 3>So other children actually want to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them because that's the critical </v>

105
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

106
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 3>It's the fundamental issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

107
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then then the,</v>

108
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 3>the peer community of children helps </v>
<v Speaker 3>bootstrap their identity up to something</v>

109
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 3>that will eventually approximate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>adult identity.</v>

110
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.910
<v Speaker 3>But that's functional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has nothing to do with whim.</v>

111
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.501
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

112
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.540
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

113
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then so,</v>

114
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.113
<v Speaker 3>so partly your identity is the set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tools with which you functioned in the </v>

115
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 3>actual world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And part of it is a negotiated agreement</v>

116
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:20.490
<v Speaker 3>with the other people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's all being taken out of that.</v>

117
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.733
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all actually as far as I can </v>

118
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 3>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's line of theorizing is technically</v>

119
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.203
<v Speaker 3>illegal now in Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not even talking about the </v>

120
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 3>potential biological basis of identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the idea that identity has no</v>

121
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:34.094
<v Speaker 3>biological basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just wrong it united factually </v>

122
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:39.044
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

123
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 3>and we've written a social </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructionist,</v>

124
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.193
<v Speaker 3>we've written a radical social </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructionist view of identity into </v>

125
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 3>the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even worse than that,</v>

126
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:48.644
<v Speaker 3>we've gone beyond social constructionism</v>
<v Speaker 3>because piaget was a construction </v>

127
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 3>constructionist into just pure.</v>

128
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 3>When your identity can be at any moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you assume that it's going to be,</v>

129
00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.900
<v Speaker 3>that's not a tenable solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

130
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing about that proposition </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's reasonable.</v>

131
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.893
<v Speaker 3>So I was looking into this and I thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just beyond comprehension that </v>

132
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.020
<v Speaker 3>we've written that idea into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies surrounding bill c 16.</v>

133
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 3>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I made that video.</v>

134
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to sort that out and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out even what it meant.</v>

135
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 3>The terminology is messy in the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

136
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 3>with regards to gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender identity is not a spectrum.</v>

137
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a modified by modal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're making law,</v>

138
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to muck around with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>

139
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:29.924
<v Speaker 3>you have to use the right words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a modified by mode of </v>

140
00:07:32.891 --> 00:07:33.724
<v Speaker 3>distribution because almost everyone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a biological identity of male or </v>

141
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 3>female identifies as male or female.</v>

142
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 3>It's 99 point seven percent and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could argue that that's a little tighter</v>

143
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 3>than it would be if society was more </v>
<v Speaker 3>accepting of gender variation,</v>

144
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even if it went down to 99 percent,</v>

145
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 3>which would be an increase of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

146
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be almost an order of magnitude</v>

147
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:01.004
<v Speaker 3>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still have the overwhelming number </v>

148
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:06.050
<v Speaker 3>of people whose gender identity matches </v>
<v Speaker 3>their biological sex.</v>

149
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 3>And then you can match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can stack on top of biological sex,</v>

150
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 3>gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually perfect match.</v>

151
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.970
<v Speaker 3>Then gender expression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost everyone who is biologically male</v>

152
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:17.804
<v Speaker 3>or female who identifies as biologically</v>
<v Speaker 3>male or female expresses themselves as </v>

153
00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:23.354
<v Speaker 3>male or female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the vast majority of them have </v>

154
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 3>a sexual orientation that's in keeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their,</v>

155
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in traditional keeping with their </v>

156
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 3>biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gender identity and gender expression.</v>

157
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.910
<v Speaker 3>So now we have a laws that says those </v>
<v Speaker 3>are independent guests.</v>

158
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.753
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the definition of </v>

159
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:39.914
<v Speaker 3>independence and you can't just play </v>
<v Speaker 3>much games with your legislative </v>

160
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 3>terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets,</v>

161
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 3>it gets people in trouble so it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum and that's that.</v>

162
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.983
<v Speaker 3>It's a modified by mobile distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there are obviously exceptions and I </v>

163
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>never argued once in the videos</v>

164
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.230
<v Speaker 4>that I put out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>despite what,</v>

165
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 4>how people reacted to them that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't exceptions.</v>

166
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.540
<v Speaker 4>Of course there are exceptions and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at temperament,</v>

167
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the big differences between men</v>

168
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 4>and women are agreeableness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>neuroticism.</v>

169
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.873
<v Speaker 4>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>women are about half a standard </v>

170
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 4>deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more agreeable,</v>

171
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.013
<v Speaker 4>that's compassionate blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're about half a standard </v>

172
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:15.864
<v Speaker 4>deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher in negative emotion and that's </v>

173
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 4>cross cultural by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it also accounts for the reasons why</v>

174
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:21.504
<v Speaker 4>women are about three to four times more</v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to suffer cross culturally from </v>

175
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:25.584
<v Speaker 4>depression and anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas men are more likely to be </v>

176
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.583
<v Speaker 4>aggressively in prison and to and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink and low agreeableness is actually </v>

177
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 4>the best predictor of incarceration </v>
<v Speaker 4>among manner.</v>

178
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.753
<v Speaker 4>Those are solid biological differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you try to segregate men and </v>

179
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:40.164
<v Speaker 4>women using only those two dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to get it right about 75 </v>

180
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 4>percent of the time.</v>

181
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 4>So there's substantial overlap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that still doesn't mean they're,</v>

182
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.163
<v Speaker 4>that's not a spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that there are no </v>

183
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 4>biological differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>

184
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.553
<v Speaker 4>it's such a preposterous claim that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't even believe that we would ever </v>

185
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:57.000
<v Speaker 4>have that discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

186
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have men have wider jaws,</v>

187
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 4>men are taller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have broader shoulders,</v>

188
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.920
<v Speaker 4>women have more endurance and endurance </v>
<v Speaker 4>sports.</v>

189
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 4>Women have a subcutaneous layer of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The shape is different.</v>

190
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 4>The way the arms are placed is </v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

191
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.230
<v Speaker 4>the voice is different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

192
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 4>and that's just gross morphology and not</v>
<v Speaker 4>even talking about genitalium.</v>

193
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.980
<v Speaker 4>And then you can look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>microstructures.</v>

194
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.823
<v Speaker 4>There's differences between men and </v>
<v Speaker 4>women at every level of the human </v>

195
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.663
<v Speaker 4>microstructure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the cellular all the way up to the </v>

196
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 4>social.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like what in the world are we talking</v>

197
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 4>about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on here?</v>

198
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was video number one.</v>

199
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.403
<v Speaker 4>Video number two was a bloody a human </v>
<v Speaker 4>resources department at the University </v>

200
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 4>of Toronto has adopted an equity </v>
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>

201
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.323
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what equity means is that it doesn't </v>

202
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:47.130
<v Speaker 4>mean equality of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It means equality of outcome,</v>

203
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 4>and that is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is the idea.</v>

204
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.730
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that you take as a social </v>
<v Speaker 4>institution like a university,</v>

205
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 4>and then you look at the organization of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that university at every single strategy</v>

206
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.770
<v Speaker 4>from the executive level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the way down to the student level.</v>

207
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:10.010
<v Speaker 4>Then what you do is you do an analysis </v>
<v Speaker 4>of each level by community demography,</v>

208
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.483
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get to define the demographic </v>

209
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 4>characteristics that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>discuss however,</v>

210
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.653
<v Speaker 4>which is actually a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you make the presupposition that </v>

211
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.283
<v Speaker 4>unless that organization at every level </v>
<v Speaker 4>matches the demographic representation </v>

212
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:27.840
<v Speaker 4>of the people at every level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's corrupt,</v>

213
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.733
<v Speaker 4>oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and discriminatory and it needs to be </v>

214
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:31.794
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

215
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.671
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you think,</v>

216
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong with that?</v>

217
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.090
<v Speaker 4>Every level should have 50 slash 50 men </v>
<v Speaker 4>and women,</v>

218
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:38.190
<v Speaker 4>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're really sure about that.</v>

219
00:11:38.191 --> 00:11:39.810
<v Speaker 4>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're so sure about that.</v>

220
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.480
<v Speaker 4>You don't think there's any natural </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences in interests between men and</v>

221
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:43.710
<v Speaker 4>women?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

222
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.610
<v Speaker 4>if you don't think so then why are most </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology classes,</v>

223
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.453
<v Speaker 4>80 percent women and that and that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that differentiation is accelerating </v>

224
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.523
<v Speaker 4>rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've seen it over the course of my </v>

225
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:55.594
<v Speaker 4>career from maybe 60 percent men at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning of my career to like 80 </v>

226
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:02.340
<v Speaker 4>percent women now and men occupy more of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the positions in the stem,</v>

227
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 4>in the stem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a stem fields,</v>

228
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 4>at least for now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same in bloody scandinavia.</v>

229
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 4>It's 20 to one nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 to one women to men,</v>

230
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:12.814
<v Speaker 4>nurses in Scandinavia and 20 to one men </v>
<v Speaker 4>to women in engineering and that's in </v>

231
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:23.030
<v Speaker 4>Scandinavia and so what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Scandinavia as they've made this site or</v>

232
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:23.973
<v Speaker 4>egalitarian in terms of its legal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>social structures is that the gender </v>

233
00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 4>differences in personality between men </v>
<v Speaker 4>and women have got bigger,</v>

234
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:31.690
<v Speaker 4>not smaller.</v>

235
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 4>So what that means is that social </v>
<v Speaker 4>constructionism is wrong.</v>

236
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.340
<v Speaker 4>That's what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wrong disproved.</v>

237
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.233
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly the opposite of what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory would have predicted because the </v>

238
00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 4>theory predicted and God only knew how </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was going to sort itself out.</v>

239
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.880
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like people knew this to begin with.</v>

240
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 4>The idea was that as you equalize the </v>
<v Speaker 4>social,</v>

241
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 4>the social,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

242
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.063
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>structure that the differences between </v>

243
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:59.290
<v Speaker 4>men and women would disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guess what,</v>

244
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.213
<v Speaker 4>that didn't happen and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Studies have just a few hundred people </v>

245
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:03.874
<v Speaker 4>in a few locations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are population wide studies and </v>

246
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 4>they'd be replicated multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

247
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:11.050
<v Speaker 4>and the funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

248
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.390
<v Speaker 4>so they're temperamental differences </v>
<v Speaker 4>between men and women.</v>

249
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.813
<v Speaker 4>It's and neuroticism and F and </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreeableness are not the only </v>

250
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 4>temperamental differences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you fragment extroversion,</v>

251
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:21.814
<v Speaker 4>it fragments into um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assertiveness and gregariousness women </v>

252
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 4>are more gregarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Men are more assertive.</v>

253
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.020
<v Speaker 4>If you fragment conscientiousness into </v>
<v Speaker 4>orderliness and industriousness ness,</v>

254
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.040
<v Speaker 4>women are more orderly at men are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>industrious if you fragment openness,</v>

255
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.053
<v Speaker 4>which is the creativity dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into interest in ideas and interest in </v>

256
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:40.384
<v Speaker 4>aesthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You find that women are more interested </v>

257
00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:44.200
<v Speaker 4>in aesthetics and men are more </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in ideas.</v>

258
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.363
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so because you've been fractionated the </v>

259
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 4>big five into 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get gender differences across all of</v>

260
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:52.210
<v Speaker 4>them and they're not trivial either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make a difference.</v>

261
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.400
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

262
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:55.234
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the equity thing of all the </v>

263
00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:01.510
<v Speaker 4>preposterous and idiotic ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so first of all,</v>

264
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.970
<v Speaker 4>to make gender equity across every </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimension of a,</v>

265
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.863
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of an organization who have to assume </v>

266
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 4>that men and women have identical </v>
<v Speaker 4>interests or and,</v>

267
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:11.914
<v Speaker 4>and temperaments and that if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the state should intervene to bloody </v>

268
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:16.414
<v Speaker 4>well ensure that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is something for all you women to </v>

269
00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:22.540
<v Speaker 4>figure out because now there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many what</v>

270
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.300
<v Speaker 4>positions in society that women </v>
<v Speaker 4>preferentially occupied.</v>

271
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.133
<v Speaker 4>So what are you going to do about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what are you going to do about the </v>

272
00:14:31.151 --> 00:14:34.930
<v Speaker 4>Asians because they occupy preferential </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions as well.</v>

273
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.793
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're overrepresented in all sorts of </v>

274
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:37.954
<v Speaker 4>professional institutions and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>probability is that that's going to </v>

275
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 4>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you gonna do about that?</v>

276
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:45.320
<v Speaker 4>What about the Jews but are going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>about them because they have,</v>

277
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.203
<v Speaker 4>they're in the same position as they </v>
<v Speaker 4>Asians going to put quotas on all those </v>

278
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:51.670
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of stupidity is bad?</v>

279
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.983
<v Speaker 4>And then it's worse too because let's </v>
<v Speaker 4>say you equalize women and just for the </v>

280
00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 4>sake of argument across all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>different dimensions of society.</v>

281
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:00.763
<v Speaker 4>Well then what are you going to do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get to equalize for black women and </v>

282
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.623
<v Speaker 4>Latino women and Asian women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to sub type black women </v>

283
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 4>because it's not like they're all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same.</v>

284
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.443
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to ensure that women from </v>
<v Speaker 4>lower classes are are represented just </v>

285
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:16.634
<v Speaker 4>as much as women from upper classes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>how many generations back are you going </v>

286
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 4>to go to check that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about intelligence?</v>

287
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.380
<v Speaker 4>What about attractiveness?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about height?</v>

288
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 4>How about weight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the problem with the fractionation by</v>

289
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:29.054
<v Speaker 4>group identity is that it's endless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way of ensuring equality </v>

290
00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:34.004
<v Speaker 4>across groups because there's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>infinite number of groups you can </v>

291
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 4>fragment group identity all the way down</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the level of the individual,</v>

292
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.333
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what we already did in the </v>

293
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.210
<v Speaker 4>west.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We figured,</v>

294
00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:47.030
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ultimate diverse population,</v>

295
00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:50.570
<v Speaker 4>there's a population of individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you let the individuals sorted out,</v>

296
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.140
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

297
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 4>we're going to replace that with group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

298
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:53.973
<v Speaker 4>what that means for the bloody social </v>
<v Speaker 4>activists is that they'll be able to </v>

299
00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:57.224
<v Speaker 4>play this game forever because you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>continually functioning group identity </v>

300
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 4>ad nauseum and so the system will never </v>
<v Speaker 4>be equal and you can bloody well be sure</v>

301
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:09.380
<v Speaker 4>that as we implement social policy to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make sure that all outcomes are equal,</v>

302
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.423
<v Speaker 4>the amount of space that you personally </v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to have to maneuver in is </v>

303
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:15.440
<v Speaker 4>going to shrink and shrink and shrink </v>
<v Speaker 4>and shrink.</v>

304
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 4>We've already seen that happen in many </v>
<v Speaker 4>societies.</v>

305
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.270
<v Speaker 4>You think we would learn from the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 4>century,</v>

306
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.360
<v Speaker 4>so that's the equity issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then worse,</v>

307
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.223
<v Speaker 4>even this is the HR and equity people </v>
<v Speaker 4>there actually mucking about with </v>

308
00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:30.590
<v Speaker 4>people's unconscious biases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is what we want,</v>

309
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:31.424
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want your employers and the state to </v>

310
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:34.814
<v Speaker 4>reeducate you so that your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's what we're talking about </v>

311
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:39.104
<v Speaker 4>with regards to unconscious bias,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that your perceptions fall into in </v>

312
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.440
<v Speaker 4>accordance with their demands and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>even your voluntary perceptions.</v>

313
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.840
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

314
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 4>your involuntary unconscious perceptions</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to be retrained.</v>

315
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.810
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe that's not so good,</v>

316
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.733
<v Speaker 4>especially when you look at that bloody </v>
<v Speaker 4>implicit association test mastering </v>

317
00:16:58.161 --> 00:16:58.994
<v Speaker 4>biology from Harvard and Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 4>Greenwald from the University of </v>

318
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.223
<v Speaker 4>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So biology is an avowed Marxist and </v>

319
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.943
<v Speaker 4>Greenwald and both bloody well know and </v>
<v Speaker 4>have written that there are implicit </v>

320
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:14.450
<v Speaker 4>association task has neither the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reliability northern validity to be used</v>

321
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:17.180
<v Speaker 4>as an individual diagnostic tests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know it.</v>

322
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just something like I've collected about</v>

323
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:21.100
<v Speaker 2>that in my class that not everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of that.</v>

324
00:17:21.101 --> 00:17:21.934
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to just give up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can bring up a powerpoint slide or do </v>

325
00:17:23.441 --> 00:17:24.880
<v Speaker 2>you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you do that?</v>

326
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to do that?</v>

327
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:26.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll let you take over when you do </v>

328
00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:31.060
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So despite the fact that.</v>

329
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.013
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

330
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.620
<v Speaker 2>will take me a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

331
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well despite this,</v>

332
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.900
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the implicit association task,</v>

333
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.300
<v Speaker 4>the principle is this word association </v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

334
00:17:45.301 --> 00:17:49.080
<v Speaker 4>It's actually predicated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say on psychoanalytic ideas,</v>

335
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 4>most particularly on union ideas because</v>
<v Speaker 4>young develop the association test many,</v>

336
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:54.570
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many years ago.</v>

337
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:55.404
<v Speaker 4>But it purports to investigate whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are unconsciously bias towards one </v>

338
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 4>group against another group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could be gender,</v>

339
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 4>could be ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could be race,</v>

340
00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 4>could be attractiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

341
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.893
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that when you give the same person </v>

342
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:12.000
<v Speaker 4>that damn I met twice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't get the same results.</v>

343
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:16.680
<v Speaker 4>So there's a rule for diagnostic tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the rule is the reliability test,</v>

344
00:18:16.681 --> 00:18:17.514
<v Speaker 4>retest reliability has to exceed </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like point eight or point </v>

345
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 4>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>point eight at least.</v>

346
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 4>So the big five does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iq tests do that,</v>

347
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 4>but there's a dam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

348
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.630
<v Speaker 4>there's damn few tasks that passed that </v>
<v Speaker 4>reliability criteria.</v>

349
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is the only reliable,</v>

350
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's about point five,</v>

351
00:18:35.311 --> 00:18:36.144
<v Speaker 4>which isn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not even near close enough to be </v>

352
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:40.020
<v Speaker 4>used as a diagnostic test.</v>

353
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Plus it's not valid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what does that mean?</v>

354
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.310
<v Speaker 4>Let's say I assess your unconscious bias</v>
<v Speaker 4>and give you a diagnosis.</v>

355
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.383
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no evidence that it predicts </v>

356
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:51.570
<v Speaker 4>your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

357
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what good is it?</v>

358
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.420
<v Speaker 4>What good is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

359
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:55.254
<v Speaker 4>it's good if you want people to send you</v>
<v Speaker 4>to retraining exercises so that you can </v>

360
00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:00.354
<v Speaker 4>have your perceptions adjusted in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction that your organization in the </v>

361
00:19:03.761 --> 00:19:06.360
<v Speaker 4>state thinks is proper and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening everywhere.</v>

362
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:09.120
<v Speaker 4>I got letters this week already for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people at CBC.</v>

363
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.180
<v Speaker 4>It's becoming mandatory there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>St Mike's Hospital,</v>

364
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.043
<v Speaker 4>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've decided that all of their </v>

365
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.900
<v Speaker 4>micro institutions within the hospital </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be equitable.</v>

366
00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:22.800
<v Speaker 4>There'll be 50 percent women and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent men at every single level of the</v>

367
00:19:22.801 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 4>organization or the organization is </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrupt and oppressive.</v>

368
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.880
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's and that it's spreading </v>
<v Speaker 4>so fast.</v>

369
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:30.714
<v Speaker 4>You can't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote Mazur and Banaji and Anthony </v>

370
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:33.910
<v Speaker 4>Greenwald yesterday.</v>

371
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.910
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't set it off to some of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>colleagues say,</v>

372
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.833
<v Speaker 4>are you going to come out and make a </v>
<v Speaker 4>public statement about the fact that </v>

373
00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:40.404
<v Speaker 4>your damn test is being used by </v>
<v Speaker 4>pathological people for nefarious </v>

374
00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:45.600
<v Speaker 4>purposes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

375
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:46.434
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll see what they have to say about </v>

376
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a bit more polite in my letters,</v>

377
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.873
<v Speaker 4>but there's no excuse for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's absolutely no excuse for it and </v>

378
00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:54.504
<v Speaker 4>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is part of the broader corruption of </v>

379
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:59.280
<v Speaker 4>social psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys may know or may not.</v>

380
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:00.114
<v Speaker 4>The social psychology has been rife with</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a controversy and scandal over the </v>

381
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:05.784
<v Speaker 4>last three or four years and a big part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the reason for that is it's damn </v>

382
00:20:08.521 --> 00:20:09.354
<v Speaker 4>corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Discipline and that use of the iat for </v>

383
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.740
<v Speaker 4>political reasons is a perfect example </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

384
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.270
<v Speaker 4>There is no excuse for it and the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>at St Mike's,</v>

385
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:17.791
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say,</v>

386
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:20.010
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is scientifically validated.</v>

387
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.850
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

388
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:21.684
<v Speaker 4>it's not and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you do have unconscious bias </v>

389
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:28.440
<v Speaker 4>just for the sake of argument and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could measure it reliably,</v>

390
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 4>which you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it was valid,</v>

391
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.003
<v Speaker 4>which it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's say all of those things were in </v>

392
00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:34.764
<v Speaker 4>case there's no evidence whatsoever that</v>
<v Speaker 4>those damn unconscious bias training </v>

393
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:41.010
<v Speaker 4>programs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>retraining programs have the effect that</v>

394
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.873
<v Speaker 4>they're supposed to have and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>some evidence that they actually have </v>

395
00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:45.144
<v Speaker 4>the reverse effect and maybe that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>because people don't like being marched </v>

396
00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:53.011
<v Speaker 4>off to reeducation by their employers </v>
<v Speaker 4>after they've been diagnosed as racist.</v>

397
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.920
<v Speaker 4>Even if there's no evidence that they in</v>
<v Speaker 4>fact are so,</v>

398
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:59.380
<v Speaker 4>it's an absolute misuse of psychology </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's in.</v>

399
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's politically motivated.</v>

400
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.820
<v Speaker 4>It's politically motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an assault on freedom.</v>

401
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.990
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made those two videos and I took,</v>

402
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:08.883
<v Speaker 4>tried to take the HR and equity people </v>
<v Speaker 4>at unt to task because they made that </v>

403
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:13.570
<v Speaker 4>training mandatory for their hr people.</v>

404
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.403
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the right as an employer </v>

405
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:16.923
<v Speaker 4>to invade the unconscious structures of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your employee's minds and alter their </v>

406
00:21:20.501 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 4>political perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though you can't do it.</v>

407
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.243
<v Speaker 4>You don't have the right to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>to think about it as something you </v>

408
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:28.420
<v Speaker 4>should do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a matter of course,</v>

409
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:33.421
<v Speaker 4>as part of your ethical duty is</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really want that.</v>

410
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.593
<v Speaker 4>You really want that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you want your employers to </v>

411
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:37.084
<v Speaker 4>be able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Figure out independently of your </v>

412
00:21:40.271 --> 00:21:41.104
<v Speaker 4>behavior whether or not you're like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a racist or classist or or a </v>

413
00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:45.754
<v Speaker 4>misogynist or whatever that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be and you already think that the </v>

414
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 4>bureaucrats at the university,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

415
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.713
<v Speaker 4>or bureaucrats anywhere for that matter </v>
<v Speaker 4>are actually capable and qualified of </v>

416
00:21:56.771 --> 00:22:00.030
<v Speaker 4>doing such a thing properly without </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing far more damage than,</v>

417
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.540
<v Speaker 4>than any possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

418
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>

419
00:22:03.821 --> 00:22:04.654
<v Speaker 4>I made those two videos trying to sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>this out into investigated in them for </v>

420
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:10.570
<v Speaker 4>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the proverbial well,</v>

421
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:11.404
<v Speaker 4>you know what happened by within two </v>
<v Speaker 4>months there was 180 newspaper articles </v>

422
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:15.964
<v Speaker 4>written about it and I don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 4>many millions of people have watched </v>

423
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:19.054
<v Speaker 4>these things online now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's plenty and so what that also </v>

424
00:22:21.521 --> 00:22:22.354
<v Speaker 4>means is I put my finger on something </v>
<v Speaker 4>because who cares what it did when it </v>

425
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.060
<v Speaker 4>professor from the University of Toronto</v>
<v Speaker 4>does with his spare time at midnight.</v>

426
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.163
<v Speaker 4>No one should care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should have had my 15 minutes of </v>

427
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:34.480
<v Speaker 4>notoriety if that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that isn't what happened.</v>

428
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:35.583
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was major news in Canada for three </v>

429
00:22:37.031 --> 00:22:39.690
<v Speaker 4>months and I'm still talking to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>all over the world about it.</v>

430
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:43.690
<v Speaker 4>I get a hundred letters a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least I can't keep up with them about</v>

431
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:44.524
<v Speaker 4>pete from people who are being cornered </v>
<v Speaker 4>in all sorts of ways by their idiot </v>

432
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:50.563
<v Speaker 4>employers and these safe space </v>
<v Speaker 4>propositions at universities and the </v>

433
00:22:53.621 --> 00:22:55.210
<v Speaker 4>restrictions on their speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can.</v>

434
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.830
<v Speaker 4>They tell me constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

435
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:59.470
<v Speaker 4>I really agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm afraid to say anything about it.</v>

436
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:00.970
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh good.</v>

437
00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:04.900
<v Speaker 4>That's a wonderful position for us to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>in where people are afraid.</v>

438
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.003
<v Speaker 4>They're afraid to speak their minds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell and it's not getting </v>

439
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 4>better and if we don't do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

440
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:13.120
<v Speaker 4>it's going to get a lot worse.</v>

441
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.050
<v Speaker 4>You saw what happened at Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just a taste of what's to come.</v>

442
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.023
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one day there's going to be an </v>

443
00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:19.483
<v Speaker 4>antifascist demonstration with a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit of violence and the bad guys on the </v>

444
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:24.694
<v Speaker 4>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to come out and we're not </v>

445
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 4>gonna like that very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe we should get our acts together</v>

446
00:23:29.861 --> 00:23:32.110
<v Speaker 4>and stop that from happening before it </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually happens,</v>

447
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 4>unless that's what you want and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't recommend it.</v>

448
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:35.643
<v Speaker 4>We have a pretty sophisticated society </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it wouldn't take much to put a </v>

449
00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 4>spanner into the spokes and with </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody on their forehead.</v>

450
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:46.790
<v Speaker 4>So wake up for Christ's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this is not good.</v>

451
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.370
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

452
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:50.204
<v Speaker 4>the bloody federal government has </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided that they won't let people pick </v>

453
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 4>the judiciary or unless they take </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconscious bias retraining.</v>

454
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.940
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What hail.</v>

455
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.180
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

456
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.020
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what happened</v>

457
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.040
<v Speaker 2>in addition to ideologically driven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to that,</v>

458
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:11.870
<v Speaker 2>do you think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always quite cynical.</v>

459
00:24:11.871 --> 00:24:12.704
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's also a make work </v>
<v Speaker 2>project for a bunch of people that they </v>

460
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:14.721
<v Speaker 2>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 2>we can create these tests that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>valid,</v>

462
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:18.650
<v Speaker 2>aren't reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got an industry,</v>

463
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's going to keep going forever </v>

464
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:21.374
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'd never expect social </v>

465
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:26.240
<v Speaker 2>psychologists to be careerists with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

466
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

467
00:24:27.231 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it got out of hand too.</v>

468
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:29.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 2>people don't necessarily plan these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

470
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:34.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that the Ontario Human Rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>Commission,</v>

471
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.190
<v Speaker 2>when they were talking about preferred </v>
<v Speaker 2>pronoun use,</v>

472
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.053
<v Speaker 2>had no idea whatsoever that within four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of introducing the policies that </v>

473
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 2>there would be 71 different gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity categories.</v>

474
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.590
<v Speaker 2>No one saw that coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could you possibly see that coming?</v>

475
00:24:49.591 --> 00:24:50.424
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think Banerji and Greenwald </v>
<v Speaker 2>had any idea that there tests would be </v>

476
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 2>transformed into an implement public </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy so rapidly.</v>

477
00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.093
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

478
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.980
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just for those who are interested,</v>

479
00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

480
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 2>the implicit associations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their implicit attitudes test,</v>

481
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my students,</v>

482
00:25:05.961 --> 00:25:07.970
<v Speaker 2>I always give a link to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if anyone's interested,</v>

483
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:08.804
<v Speaker 2>I can give you a link where you can go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the test and actually do it yourself </v>

484
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:11.744
<v Speaker 2>and find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the assumption is that if you </v>

485
00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 2>are implicitly racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so explicitly racist.</v>

486
00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Say I hate blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say implicitly racist.</v>

487
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of my best friends.</v>

488
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:26.590
<v Speaker 2>But when you do this test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that if you're shown a black</v>

489
00:25:27.471 --> 00:25:29.330
<v Speaker 2>person's face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

490
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.613
<v Speaker 2>Versus a white person's face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to associate that </v>

491
00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:33.464
<v Speaker 2>black person with us a violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically being primed </v>

492
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.000
<v Speaker 2>unconsciously is when you see a black </v>
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>

493
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 2>if you subsequently see a weapon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asked to decide whether this is a</v>

494
00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:43.064
<v Speaker 2>weapon or a tool there more quickly </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to say weapon because you're </v>

495
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:47.970
<v Speaker 2>already thinking dangerous violence </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons because you know,</v>

496
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.823
<v Speaker 2>you have this negative association of </v>
<v Speaker 2>blacks with weapons and you'll do that </v>

497
00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:55.460
<v Speaker 2>faster than when you see a white face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white face to be more neutral.</v>

498
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:56.563
<v Speaker 2>So whether you see after the white face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a gun or a weapon in theory should be </v>

499
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.510
<v Speaker 2>about equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equal time to determine whether you know</v>

500
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.450
<v Speaker 2>it is one or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

501
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:06.284
<v Speaker 2>This is the kind of test that they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've associated or they've done </v>

502
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:08.804
<v Speaker 2>this test as Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same with countless other types of </v>

503
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:13.790
<v Speaker 2>constructs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

504
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:16.550
<v Speaker 2>the reliability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the validity is not just suspect,</v>

505
00:26:16.551 --> 00:26:17.850
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not existent.</v>

506
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.060
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

507
00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 2>if you'd like to try it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

508
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:22.011
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

509
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 2>if you're a student check out on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bright space page,</v>

510
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:25.360
<v Speaker 2>if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>email me,</v>

511
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.540
<v Speaker 2>facebook me and it'll give you the link </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could have done it too,</v>

512
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 2>like I think 50 different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least you know,</v>

513
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Democrat Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican,</v>

514
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.263
<v Speaker 2>the vanilla strawberry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's all these different things </v>

515
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:40.520
<v Speaker 2>that you can do and see where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>implicit or unconscious biases are.</v>

516
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:41.623
<v Speaker 2>And as Dr Peterson saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting out of hand and this whole </v>

517
00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:44.094
<v Speaker 2>idea of the gender pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because during the debate that you had </v>

518
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:51.291
<v Speaker 2>or whatever that was at the u of t,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the people that I think she was a</v>

519
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:55.460
<v Speaker 2>lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very condescendingly ran across with.</v>

520
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.393
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

521
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of thing would never happen.</v>

522
00:26:58.141 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

523
00:26:59.131 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

524
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.040
<v Speaker 2>the Human Ontario human rights tribunal </v>
<v Speaker 2>page,</v>

525
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.580
<v Speaker 2>they specifically say that Jen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

526
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.961
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

527
00:27:04.961 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 2>you have to identify people by their </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferred identity or expression,</v>

528
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:12.370
<v Speaker 2>which includes pronoun usage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there on their page.</v>

529
00:27:12.371 --> 00:27:14.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not explicitly stated in Bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

530
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.073
<v Speaker 2>but the Ontario human rights tribunal </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will in fact enact any type of </v>

531
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 2>action against somebody who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

532
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 2>who's violated these policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

533
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 2>It's on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very page.</v>

534
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 2>And I know you spoke about your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

535
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I hope that because not everyone saw the</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>

536
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Can you just talk about that part where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's speaking to other professionals who</v>

537
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:35.740
<v Speaker 2>don't seem to be ideologically driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Kaufman?</v>

538
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they said about the,</v>

539
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:38.214
<v Speaker 2>the risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

540
00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 2>sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so important.</v>

541
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.060
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

542
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's definitely not looking at this the</v>

543
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:46.374
<v Speaker 2>same way that I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things she said we're in a </v>

544
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:50.004
<v Speaker 2>rather condescending manner was that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be sent to jail even though I </v>

545
00:27:53.731 --> 00:27:55.380
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

546
00:27:55.381 --> 00:27:58.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's roughly what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you know,</v>

547
00:27:58.331 --> 00:27:59.164
<v Speaker 2>that the human rights tribunal could </v>
<v Speaker 2>take away my property in my wages and </v>

548
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:04.134
<v Speaker 2>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that seemed to be okay for her as </v>

549
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:06.084
<v Speaker 2>long as it didn't extend to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's also nonsense because if </v>

550
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:09.774
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're found guilty by the human </v>

551
00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 2>rights started getting land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't pay,</v>

552
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:14.004
<v Speaker 2>then that's contempt of court and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to a different court and then they </v>

553
00:28:16.021 --> 00:28:17.760
<v Speaker 2>put you in jail and that's already </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

554
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.870
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

555
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.650
<v Speaker 2>it's crooked lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand waving fundamentally,</v>

556
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.330
<v Speaker 2>and it's an attempt to play down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of the law.</v>

557
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:28.223
<v Speaker 2>You go and read about you online and </v>
<v Speaker 2>read about the powers of the human </v>

558
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:32.940
<v Speaker 2>rights tribunal and then see how safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel.</v>

559
00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:36.270
<v Speaker 2>So here's one of the things they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is section one,</v>

560
00:28:36.271 --> 00:28:37.104
<v Speaker 2>point six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in a document about powers of the </v>

561
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 2>powers of the tribunals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call them social justice tribunals.</v>

562
00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:44.004
<v Speaker 2>In Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually called the social justice </v>

563
00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:47.430
<v Speaker 2>tribunal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mind boggling.</v>

564
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:48.623
<v Speaker 2>They can suspend precedent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead normal legal precedent and </v>

565
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 2>jurisprudential tradition in the pursuit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their age.</v>

566
00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.640
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually documented as one of their</v>

567
00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 2>powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

568
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Like we live in a society that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially bound by the restrictions of</v>

569
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:05.703
<v Speaker 2>English common law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>English common law is one of the most </v>

570
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.470
<v Speaker 2>remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 2>developments of civilization ever,</v>

571
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.870
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what?</v>

572
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.170
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the English system,</v>

573
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 2>basically the presupposition is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have all the rights,</v>

574
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.770
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not enumerate,</v>

575
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.643
<v Speaker 2>you just have all of them except when </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those rights imposes a </v>

576
00:29:26.011 --> 00:29:26.844
<v Speaker 2>restriction on someone else and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they get irritated you and take you to </v>

577
00:29:29.341 --> 00:29:32.880
<v Speaker 2>court and then the judge sorts out who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has which micro,</v>

578
00:29:32.881 --> 00:29:33.714
<v Speaker 2>right and then that's laid out is </v>
<v Speaker 2>precedent and so English common law is </v>

579
00:29:36.661 --> 00:29:41.661
<v Speaker 2>this tremendous body of evolved doctrine</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how the infinite number</v>

580
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:46.240
<v Speaker 3>of human rights that each individual has</v>
<v Speaker 3>interacts with everyone else's rights.</v>

581
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:51.241
<v Speaker 3>And like back when Trudeau Trudeau </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought the human rights code,</v>

582
00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.670
<v Speaker 3>the bill of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Canadian bill of rights,</v>

583
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.683
<v Speaker 3>there were lots of people who were upset</v>
<v Speaker 3>by it because it's a different form of </v>

584
00:29:58.241 --> 00:29:59.860
<v Speaker 3>legal reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bill of rights says,</v>

585
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:02.560
<v Speaker 3>here's the rights you have that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government is granting you.</v>

586
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.010
<v Speaker 3>That's not how it works under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>English code.</v>

587
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.840
<v Speaker 3>The English code is you have all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights there are,</v>

588
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.890
<v Speaker 3>but they rub up against other people's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

589
00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:10.724
<v Speaker 3>So we have to sort that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do that with court and precedent and </v>

590
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:18.181
<v Speaker 3>that's what the Human Rights Commission </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tried people in Ontario can dispense</v>

591
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 3>with if they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason there,</v>

592
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.710
<v Speaker 3>I know the reason that they put that </v>
<v Speaker 3>line in there,</v>

593
00:30:23.711 --> 00:30:24.544
<v Speaker 3>it's because the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis is that the legal structures </v>

594
00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:31.090
<v Speaker 3>of Western civilization are oppressive.</v>

595
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Patriarchal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

596
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:34.803
<v Speaker 3>are oppressive and patriarchal and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's perfectly reasonable to toss them </v>

597
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:38.674
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in pursuit of something like </v>

598
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:40.900
<v Speaker 3>social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

599
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.340
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

600
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.780
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead and do that.</v>

601
00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:44.614
<v Speaker 3>But if you think that you can transform </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we have already now into some kind </v>

602
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:52.840
<v Speaker 3>of utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're dangerous because that isn't</v>

603
00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:56.470
<v Speaker 3>how the world works and Utopians it'd be</v>
<v Speaker 3>more dangerous than any other people for</v>

604
00:30:56.471 --> 00:30:58.840
<v Speaker 3>the last hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>

605
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Like there's all sorts of things wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Western society always,</v>

606
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:03.514
<v Speaker 3>and there always will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but compared to 85 to 90 percent of the </v>

607
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:10.000
<v Speaker 3>rest of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is bloody heaven.</v>

608
00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.050
<v Speaker 3>And that's why people want to move here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can say,</v>

609
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:14.884
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's corrupt compared to my imaginary </v>

610
00:31:16.061 --> 00:31:16.990
<v Speaker 3>utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

611
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:18.010
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

612
00:31:18.011 --> 00:31:18.844
<v Speaker 3>It certainly is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if your imaginary utopia was </v>

613
00:31:22.121 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 3>realized in in hardcore politics over a </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 year period,</v>

614
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 3>everyone would be out in the streets </v>
<v Speaker 3>starving to death.</v>

615
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:28.893
<v Speaker 3>We already know that because it happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple times throughout the 20th </v>

616
00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:34.690
<v Speaker 3>century in societies that were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

617
00:31:34.691 --> 00:31:37.180
<v Speaker 3>they weren't as sophisticated as our </v>
<v Speaker 3>society is now,</v>

618
00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:38.014
<v Speaker 3>but they were plenty sophisticated for </v>
<v Speaker 3>their time and you'll hear the neo </v>

619
00:31:41.261 --> 00:31:42.094
<v Speaker 3>Marxist types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the most annoying argument ever </v>

620
00:31:43.811 --> 00:31:45.130
<v Speaker 3>anyone ever makes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

621
00:31:45.131 --> 00:31:45.964
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened in the Soviet Union that </v>

622
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 3>wasn't real communism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like first,</v>

623
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

624
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.950
<v Speaker 3>That's why it also happened in China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a very different society,</v>

625
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.950
<v Speaker 3>but what they really mean when they say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that as well.</v>

626
00:31:56.951 --> 00:32:00.250
<v Speaker 3>You know that stellan character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't such a good guy.</v>

627
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 3>He didn't really know how to implement </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Marxist doctrines,</v>

628
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:04.204
<v Speaker 3>but me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty pure of heart and if you </v>

629
00:32:05.771 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 3>would have made me dictator for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

630
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.330
<v Speaker 3>then the utopia would have arrived as </v>
<v Speaker 3>promised.</v>

631
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

632
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.680
<v Speaker 3>if you think that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong with you,</v>

633
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.000
<v Speaker 3>you're dangerous.</v>

634
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.013
<v Speaker 3>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just say for a minute that some </v>

635
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:19.324
<v Speaker 3>saint did get ahold of the tools of </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and try to implement from each </v>

636
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:24.124
<v Speaker 3>according to his ability to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to his knee and actually did </v>

637
00:32:27.491 --> 00:32:30.970
<v Speaker 3>that in a pure and safe manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what would happen.</v>

638
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 3>The next people in the revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>string,</v>

639
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:35.523
<v Speaker 3>like Stalin would come along and stab </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in their band in the middle of the </v>

640
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.700
<v Speaker 3>night and that would be the end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So No.</v>

641
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.080
<v Speaker 3>So there's absolutely no excuse </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever for that sort of thinking.</v>

642
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 3>And if you read Solzhenitsyn's school </v>
<v Speaker 3>like archipelago,</v>

643
00:32:48.231 --> 00:32:49.064
<v Speaker 3>which you should do like everyone should</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like the definitive </v>

644
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:56.060
<v Speaker 3>document of this sort of thing emerged </v>
<v Speaker 3>that emerged from the 20th century.</v>

645
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.163
<v Speaker 3>Solzhenitsyn laid out with extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 3>clarity first in his writings on Lenin </v>

646
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 3>and then in his writings on the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 3>Union more broadly,</v>

647
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:05.503
<v Speaker 3>exactly how the current dishes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathological Marxist doctrines were </v>

648
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:10.544
<v Speaker 3>transformed logically and systematically</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the sorts of laws that killed </v>

649
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.840
<v Speaker 3>millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Millions of people.</v>

650
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:23.360
<v Speaker 3>There were people starving so badly in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet Union by the 19 twenties that</v>

651
00:33:23.361 --> 00:33:26.150
<v Speaker 3>they had posters telling them not to eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>their children.</v>

652
00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:32.800
<v Speaker 3>So we've been down that road already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what the hell are we doing?</v>

653
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.800
<v Speaker 3>We're going down that road again under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guise of equity,</v>

654
00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

655
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:37.990
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

656
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.520
<v Speaker 3>and equality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

657
00:33:39.521 --> 00:33:42.780
<v Speaker 3>that was the doctrines that promoted </v>
<v Speaker 3>those laws to begin with.</v>

658
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.650
<v Speaker 5>Not Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

659
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.533
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

660
00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.720
<v Speaker 2>when Dr said when you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk this way,</v>

661
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:52.643
<v Speaker 2>some people are going to say either </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pulling things out of proportion </v>

662
00:33:54.481 --> 00:33:55.314
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've made a huge leap from where we </v>

663
00:33:56.281 --> 00:33:59.340
<v Speaker 2>are now to where we should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think there's a lot of room for</v>

664
00:33:59.341 --> 00:34:00.174
<v Speaker 2>misunderstanding for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they have certain </v>

665
00:34:01.831 --> 00:34:03.600
<v Speaker 2>ideologies that they would like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>protect.</v>

666
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:04.703
<v Speaker 2>So one of the reasons I want to invite </v>
<v Speaker 2>people over was to be able to ask </v>

667
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've heard Song Dr Peterson's,</v>

668
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tenants that he's trying to convey.</v>

669
00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

670
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't have any videos.</v>

671
00:34:17.611 --> 00:34:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Each person has watched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have an opportunity right now.</v>

672
00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:20.970
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone,</v>

673
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:24.250
<v Speaker 2>if someone has a specific question </v>
<v Speaker 2>either from somebody talking to Peterson</v>

674
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.900
<v Speaker 2>has said today or things you've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the videos will be negative.</v>

675
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I really want to ask them face to face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight up,</v>

676
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.950
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by this or what is your</v>
<v Speaker 2>solution to that?</v>

677
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Please?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm opening up the floor.</v>

678
00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:34.803
<v Speaker 2>Just talk really loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please let Mike can pick it up and that </v>

679
00:34:36.151 --> 00:34:36.984
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody have a specific question </v>

680
00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:41.220
<v Speaker 2>that you'd like to ask?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

681
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

682
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll let</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barbara K.</v>

683
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.550
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

684
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.470
<v Speaker 5>It's a little bit of a Sidebar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've watched.</v>

685
00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:48.363
<v Speaker 5>I've watched your videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're resilient than some of your </v>

686
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.770
<v Speaker 5>longer ones and explained and I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm intrigued by your.</v>

687
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:58.450
<v Speaker 5>I know one of your heroes was a great </v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

688
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:59.583
<v Speaker 5>I'm a little disturbed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to know why was the anti </v>

689
00:35:03.091 --> 00:35:03.924
<v Speaker 5>Semitic,</v>

690
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.693
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the book that he wrote in which he was </v>

691
00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:10.890
<v Speaker 3>accused of antisemitism has not been yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>translated into English.</v>

692
00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.960
<v Speaker 5>There's only one place.</v>

693
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that he did,</v>

694
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.353
<v Speaker 3>but he certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's certainly no sign of </v>

695
00:35:17.241 --> 00:35:18.074
<v Speaker 3>Antisemitism in the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not as far as I could tell and I don't </v>

696
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:24.770
<v Speaker 3>think in the other books I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen that either.</v>

697
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.633
<v Speaker 3>He did write a book near the end of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife on the role that Jewish </v>

698
00:35:28.161 --> 00:35:31.190
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals played in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>establishment of the Soviet Union,</v>

699
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:34.520
<v Speaker 3>but you can't get it in English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know what to say about that.</v>

700
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:39.300
<v Speaker 3>I know that it's being criticized from </v>
<v Speaker 3>both sides.</v>

701
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:41.160
<v Speaker 3>I would say one side saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

702
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:43.590
<v Speaker 3>this was a story that needed to be told </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other side saying,</v>

703
00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:44.424
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sphere is it down anti anti </v>

704
00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 3>Semitism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

705
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.380
<v Speaker 3>But you would ask that question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the question.</v>

706
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

707
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.193
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to venture out on a limb </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've been thinking about this </v>

708
00:35:58.081 --> 00:36:01.990
<v Speaker 3>for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to venture out on.</v>

709
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've.</v>

710
00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:11.523
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't gotten my thoughts formulated </v>

711
00:36:12.491 --> 00:36:13.324
<v Speaker 3>well enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The leftest doctrines tend to be very </v>

712
00:36:15.041 --> 00:36:15.874
<v Speaker 3>attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intellectuals and so any group </v>

713
00:36:18.461 --> 00:36:22.960
<v Speaker 3>that's overrepresented in intellectuals </v>
<v Speaker 3>is likely going to be overrepresented on</v>

714
00:36:22.961 --> 00:36:24.490
<v Speaker 3>the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the standard of the spectrum,</v>

715
00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.560
<v Speaker 3>and there are temperamental reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

716
00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.423
<v Speaker 3>We know that if you lean left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because you're hiring openness and </v>

717
00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:33.400
<v Speaker 3>lower in orderliness and that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be associated with,</v>

718
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.193
<v Speaker 3>with ICU at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to go into it any more </v>

719
00:36:38.411 --> 00:36:42.970
<v Speaker 3>than that because because I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought it through sufficiently,</v>

720
00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:44.403
<v Speaker 3>but I also haven't been able to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee and social mentors last book </v>

721
00:36:46.431 --> 00:36:47.264
<v Speaker 3>because you can't get an English hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>been translated for one reason or </v>

722
00:36:49.811 --> 00:36:50.930
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

723
00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.620
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think you'll see anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that in the Gulag archipelago.</v>

724
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.630
<v Speaker 3>There's another question before I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to ask.</v>

725
00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Have you asked the question but after we</v>
<v Speaker 3>get back to this,</v>

726
00:37:00.071 --> 00:37:00.904
<v Speaker 3>because you mentioned a number of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both the correlates between Iq and the </v>

727
00:37:04.301 --> 00:37:05.680
<v Speaker 3>left and that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

728
00:37:05.681 --> 00:37:06.514
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who believe in the support </v>

729
00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.960
<v Speaker 3>thought police are not actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not left.</v>

730
00:37:10.961 --> 00:37:12.790
<v Speaker 3>Is there a whole other category of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

731
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.430
<v Speaker 3>that's such an important distinction to </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn to in a few minutes.</v>

732
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.110
<v Speaker 3>But first this question please.</v>

733
00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:22.980
<v Speaker 5>So the current proposition in</v>
<v Speaker 5>regards to how you</v>

734
00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.453
<v Speaker 5>going.</v>

735
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.620
<v Speaker 3>I think we're doing a good job of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

736
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how fast do you think things,</v>

737
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.720
<v Speaker 3>how fast could you even hope for things </v>
<v Speaker 3>to change?</v>

738
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.613
<v Speaker 3>Look at what's happened to the situation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and limits inspected with women since </v>

739
00:37:40.901 --> 00:37:44.620
<v Speaker 3>1970 has changed so fast that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't even keep up.</v>

740
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:45.663
<v Speaker 3>It's not obvious by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there that it's been particularly </v>

741
00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:51.520
<v Speaker 3>good for women now you could make a case</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was good for society.</v>

742
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.473
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a tough one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a because the birth rate has plummeted </v>

743
00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.613
<v Speaker 3>and so maybe you don't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you think there's too many people </v>

744
00:37:58.961 --> 00:38:00.280
<v Speaker 3>on the planet already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

745
00:38:00.281 --> 00:38:04.840
<v Speaker 3>but if it isn't that easy to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 3>when something is working property,</v>

746
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.013
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we do know we seem to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know is there to the degree that rights </v>

747
00:38:09.461 --> 00:38:12.580
<v Speaker 3>are extended to women economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>prosperity follows.</v>

748
00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.013
<v Speaker 3>So you can see worldwide that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies that have extended the rights </v>

749
00:38:17.591 --> 00:38:18.424
<v Speaker 3>to women most extensively are also the </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies that seem to be flourishing </v>

750
00:38:21.521 --> 00:38:24.610
<v Speaker 3>economically and there does seem to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>causal relationship,</v>

751
00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.100
<v Speaker 3>but women have paid a big price for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

752
00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.413
<v Speaker 3>So what's happened in part is first of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all for for say a women who were middle </v>

753
00:38:32.381 --> 00:38:33.214
<v Speaker 3>class or lower their their lights if </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially fallen apart because </v>

754
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:40.330
<v Speaker 3>marriage is now restricted to the ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also something to think about.</v>

755
00:38:40.331 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 3>For those of you who think marriage is </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressive,</v>

756
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

757
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.153
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then why are only the rich people </v>

758
00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:49.360
<v Speaker 3>getting married?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're oppressing themselves.</v>

759
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.373
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the women who are in the lower </v>

760
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:53.704
<v Speaker 3>socioeconomic stratus are suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Madelyn and so are their children and </v>

761
00:38:57.581 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 3>they have terrible jobs most of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

762
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 3>like jobs in retail where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're called in every day for the next</v>

763
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:03.970
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

764
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a schedule that it set </v>
<v Speaker 3>out ahead of them.</v>

765
00:39:07.031 --> 00:39:07.864
<v Speaker 3>They get paid very badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got kids to take care of and so </v>

766
00:39:10.571 --> 00:39:11.404
<v Speaker 3>they have no free time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes them really easy targets for </v>

767
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.133
<v Speaker 3>useless predatory males and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard on the kids and that's like 40 </v>

768
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:20.230
<v Speaker 3>percent of the female population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

769
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.510
<v Speaker 3>You guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while I don't know about all of you,</v>

770
00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:23.344
<v Speaker 3>but you're in university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're part of the privileged cognitive </v>

771
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:26.410
<v Speaker 3>elite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

772
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.453
<v Speaker 3>so these sorts of things don't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>touch you the same way they touch other </v>

773
00:39:29.981 --> 00:39:30.814
<v Speaker 3>people and so women are much happier if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at national polls than they </v>

774
00:39:34.931 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 3>were say in the late 19 fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>early 19 sixties.</v>

775
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.830
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's partly because </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom and happiness,</v>

776
00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.190
<v Speaker 3>those are not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not even close.</v>

777
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.460
<v Speaker 3>And now I see young women all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggling to figure out what to do with</v>

778
00:39:48.461 --> 00:39:49.294
<v Speaker 3>their lives because they have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to have a job slash career and a </v>

779
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:52.954
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

780
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no answer to that.</v>

781
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.700
<v Speaker 3>It's a really difficult problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

782
00:39:57.701 --> 00:39:58.534
<v Speaker 3>and there's all sorts of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I did a lot of consulting for law </v>

783
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:01.744
<v Speaker 3>firms for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a decade and I had a lot of </v>

784
00:40:04.031 --> 00:40:07.210
<v Speaker 3>clients who were extremely high </v>
<v Speaker 3>functioning female lawyers,</v>

785
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:08.044
<v Speaker 3>younger ones trying to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>balance their career with their desire </v>

786
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:13.420
<v Speaker 3>to have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

787
00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:14.254
<v Speaker 3>you hear all the time about women being </v>
<v Speaker 3>denied access to positions of power and </v>

788
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 3>that that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the consequences of prejudice and</v>

789
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 3>oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

790
00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

791
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.390
<v Speaker 3>everything is caused by the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>

792
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have got one causal principle.</v>

793
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you're a philosopher.</v>

794
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.333
<v Speaker 3>You can figure out everything with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the law firms cannot keep </v>

795
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:35.920
<v Speaker 3>their women in their thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They cannot keep them.</v>

796
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.590
<v Speaker 3>The big law firms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all leave.</v>

797
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the women hit 30.</v>

798
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.850
<v Speaker 3>They're brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conscientious,</v>

799
00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:44.760
<v Speaker 3>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were deadly in highschool,</v>

800
00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:45.970
<v Speaker 3>deadly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and university.</v>

801
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.640
<v Speaker 3>They nailed law school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They whipped through their article.</v>

802
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.713
<v Speaker 3>They made partner by the time they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 and it's like they're in a rocket to </v>

803
00:40:52.061 --> 00:40:55.570
<v Speaker 3>the top position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they find when they get their 80</v>

804
00:40:55.571 --> 00:40:57.670
<v Speaker 3>hour work weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

805
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Because that's one of the things you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to think about.</v>

806
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that the people who run things</v>

807
00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:03.910
<v Speaker 3>are sitting at home smoking big cigars </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like</v>

808
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:07.010
<v Speaker 4>telling their minions what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that is not.</v>

809
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.873
<v Speaker 4>That's like the 19 twenties millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's on the cover of the monopoly </v>

810
00:41:11.601 --> 00:41:14.540
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going sociological analysis.</v>

811
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:15.710
<v Speaker 4>I know lots of people</v>

812
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:19.430
<v Speaker 3>or like that and they work all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>

813
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.210
<v Speaker 4>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wake up until the second they go to</v>

814
00:41:22.211 --> 00:41:25.120
<v Speaker 4>sleep and they don't just casually work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

815
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.700
<v Speaker 4>because I know some of you go to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>library for six hours and you say,</v>

816
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 4>well I studied in the library for six </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

817
00:41:29.861 --> 00:41:33.990
<v Speaker 4>Like no you did you study for half an </v>
<v Speaker 4>hour coffee</v>

818
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.460
<v Speaker 3>and you look through facebook and I went</v>
<v Speaker 3>home and you said,</v>

819
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:39.530
<v Speaker 3>well I studied for six hours and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy about it,</v>

820
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:42.560
<v Speaker 3>but you don't bloody well you did part </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't,</v>

821
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:43.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only read for about three and a </v>

822
00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 3>half hours until I'm done and I'm pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>good at it.</v>

823
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.320
<v Speaker 3>So these people who are running things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's corrupt people obviously,</v>

824
00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:54.240
<v Speaker 3>but the vast majority of them first are </v>
<v Speaker 3>self made.</v>

825
00:41:54.241 --> 00:41:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Its second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so bloody efficient and smart.</v>

826
00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 3>You cannot believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they work 80 hours a week at.</v>

827
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Most of them happened to be mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why is that?</v>

828
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.573
<v Speaker 3>Because there are a small number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>insane men who will do nothing but work </v>

829
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 3>80 hours a week and no matter where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>put them,</v>

830
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:12.794
<v Speaker 3>if you put them in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>forest with an ax and all they would do </v>

831
00:42:14.901 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 3>is run around chopping down trees.</v>

832
00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:22.190
<v Speaker 3>So the issue isn't why aren't there more</v>
<v Speaker 3>women in positions of power?</v>

833
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:27.110
<v Speaker 3>It's why are there any men insane enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever to occupy those positions?</v>

834
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:28.103
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we also know and the data on </v>

835
00:42:30.441 --> 00:42:31.274
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very clear what's the relationship </v>

836
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:36.680
<v Speaker 3>between money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be once you have enough money to</v>

837
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:37.514
<v Speaker 3>keep the bill collectors from your door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once you have enough money to stave </v>

838
00:42:41.331 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 3>off misery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is sort of lower middle class,</v>

839
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:47.360
<v Speaker 3>something like that in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a little little lower than that.</v>

840
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:51.890
<v Speaker 3>Extra money does not help you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does not improve your life.</v>

841
00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.810
<v Speaker 3>So why bother with it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

842
00:42:53.811 --> 00:42:55.760
<v Speaker 3>that's what the women in the law firms </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

843
00:42:55.761 --> 00:42:58.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the time they're in their thirties,</v>

844
00:42:58.551 --> 00:42:59.384
<v Speaker 3>are married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost all of them are married to men </v>

845
00:43:01.461 --> 00:43:02.294
<v Speaker 3>who make as much money or more than they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do because that's what women go for </v>

846
00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.810
<v Speaker 3>cross culturally four to five years </v>
<v Speaker 3>older,</v>

847
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:12.710
<v Speaker 3>equal or higher in socioeconomic status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so their.</v>

848
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Their husband's already made $350,000 a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

849
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:17.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

850
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:18.853
<v Speaker 3>I don't need much more money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The man used money to keep track of the </v>

851
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:22.184
<v Speaker 3>competition by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because all the male lawyers that I </v>

852
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:25.244
<v Speaker 3>talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her usually real hard ass guys really </v>

853
00:43:26.601 --> 00:43:28.940
<v Speaker 3>low in agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really high in conscientiousness,</v>

854
00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:32.630
<v Speaker 3>like conservative types,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low in openness as well and they want to</v>

855
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:33.464
<v Speaker 3>win and the reason they care about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn bonus at the end of the year isn't </v>

856
00:43:36.291 --> 00:43:37.124
<v Speaker 3>even so much because of the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because they got a much bigger </v>

857
00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:40.334
<v Speaker 3>bonus than the other son of a bitch </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting beside them and they're happy </v>

858
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:44.600
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a real,</v>

859
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:48.920
<v Speaker 3>like a real brass knuckles competition </v>
<v Speaker 3>that drives these sorts of things,</v>

860
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.060
<v Speaker 3>but we get things backwards so often in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

861
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.963
<v Speaker 3>in psychology and in sociology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not why there aren't more women in </v>

862
00:43:56.001 --> 00:43:56.960
<v Speaker 3>positions of power.</v>

863
00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.810
<v Speaker 3>It's whiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any men want those positions,</v>

864
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:00.973
<v Speaker 3>you just have no idea the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility that comes along with </v>

865
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:04.184
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just imagine for a minute trying to </v>

866
00:44:05.491 --> 00:44:09.380
<v Speaker 3>run a billion dollar corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even bloody well balanced your</v>

867
00:44:09.381 --> 00:44:12.320
<v Speaker 3>checkbook and there's dust bunnies </v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath your bed.</v>

868
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:15.080
<v Speaker 3>How in the world would you ever run a </v>
<v Speaker 3>billion dollar corporation?</v>

869
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:15.943
<v Speaker 3>Those things are complicated and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have enemies and they're trying to take </v>

870
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:22.500
<v Speaker 3>you out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at apple and Samsung,</v>

871
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.080
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just torturing each other in the</v>

872
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:25.750
<v Speaker 3>courts nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

873
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.780
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

874
00:44:26.781 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 3>if you're running a big corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be.</v>

875
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.820
<v Speaker 3>You'll be handling two or 300 lawsuits a</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and that's just,</v>

876
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:33.683
<v Speaker 3>that's just nothing compared to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity of what you actually have to </v>

877
00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:39.000
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stay on top of the technology,</v>

878
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.820
<v Speaker 3>constantly interact with your large </v>
<v Speaker 3>customers.</v>

879
00:44:41.821 --> 00:44:45.870
<v Speaker 3>Travel all the time because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain the relationships.</v>

880
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 3>You have to regulate the politics inside</v>
<v Speaker 3>the business.</v>

881
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.740
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>

882
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Speaker 3>it's no picnic and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

883
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:55.680
<v Speaker 3>they get a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

884
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:57.840
<v Speaker 3>what makes you think that's such a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>

885
00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a half crazy and you have</v>

886
00:45:00.721 --> 00:45:02.850
<v Speaker 3>a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be crazy a lot faster,</v>

887
00:45:02.851 --> 00:45:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that frees you from all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of constraints.</v>

888
00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know the data on lottery winners,</v>

889
00:45:09.871 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 3>they're no happier a year later and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them are done,</v>

890
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.733
<v Speaker 3>especially if they had like a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine problem to begin with because </v>

891
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being broke stops you from dying.</v>

892
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:20.463
<v Speaker 3>If you're a cocaine addict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get enough money and the way you </v>

893
00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:24.240
<v Speaker 3>go and you think to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

894
00:45:24.241 --> 00:45:26.520
<v Speaker 3>you've got all sorts of bad habits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weirdnesses.</v>

895
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Speaker 3>If somebody dumped an infinite amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>money on you,</v>

896
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:31.650
<v Speaker 3>what makes you think you would unravel </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely?</v>

897
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:35.140
<v Speaker 3>It's highly probable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

898
00:45:35.141 --> 00:45:38.750
<v Speaker 3>so back to these women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what they do in their thirties,</v>

899
00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:39.603
<v Speaker 3>they look around and they played hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>partner so they hit the pinnacle of </v>

900
00:45:41.941 --> 00:45:43.380
<v Speaker 3>their profession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think,</v>

901
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:44.783
<v Speaker 3>what the hell am I doing this for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would anyone in their right mind </v>

902
00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.060
<v Speaker 3>want to be woken up at three in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning,</v>

903
00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:53.460
<v Speaker 3>Sunday by they're irate Japanese client </v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants them to work for the next five</v>

904
00:45:53.461 --> 00:45:58.461
<v Speaker 3>hours nonstop to fix this damn problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is going to cost them $100,000,000</v>

905
00:45:58.650 --> 00:45:59.483
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we'll find someone else to pay $750 </v>

906
00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:06.000
<v Speaker 3>an hour or two to fix it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you think,</v>

907
00:46:06.001 --> 00:46:06.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

908
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a masculine form of value that.</v>

909
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:09.834
<v Speaker 3>Because that's one of the criticisms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the law firms just adopted a more </v>

910
00:46:12.871 --> 00:46:13.704
<v Speaker 3>feminine structure of value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what kind of bullshit is and </v>

911
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.120
<v Speaker 3>the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason that you get up,</v>

912
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:18.954
<v Speaker 3>it's three in the morning on Sunday to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to your Japanese client was </v>

913
00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:22.643
<v Speaker 3>freaking out about their contract is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you don't jump the hell up </v>

914
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:25.824
<v Speaker 3>and do it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some starving associate who's </v>

915
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.273
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably ambitious in New York will </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick up the pieces and two tenths of a </v>

916
00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:36.090
<v Speaker 3>second and they're smart and aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'll take you out.</v>

917
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:41.160
<v Speaker 3>So it has nothing to do with masculine </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures of values.</v>

918
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.690
<v Speaker 3>All the foolish ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

919
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not just law where this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

920
00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:48.840
<v Speaker 3>we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that female doctors were far fewer hours</v>

921
00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:50.910
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the more female doctors you have,</v>

922
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:51.803
<v Speaker 3>the more doctors you have to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not complaining about women's </v>

923
00:46:54.991 --> 00:46:58.860
<v Speaker 3>priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that women are wrong.</v>

924
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the older I get,</v>

925
00:47:01.591 --> 00:47:05.790
<v Speaker 3>the more I understand that marriage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>family are a primary importance.</v>

926
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.530
<v Speaker 3>And the more I see women in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

927
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.850
<v Speaker 3>they hit 35 or 40 and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>married,</v>

928
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.693
<v Speaker 3>they don't have kids and they are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy because what the hell are you </v>

929
00:47:14.341 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 3>going to do from the time you're 40 till</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time you're 80,</v>

930
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.340
<v Speaker 3>you've got no family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got no relationships.</v>

931
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:23.070
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go Run your company.</v>

932
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well if you're one in a thousand that'll</v>

933
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:30.520
<v Speaker 3>satisfy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you well better make sure you're that</v>

934
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:34.150
<v Speaker 3>one in a thousand and you're probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>not because those people are rare.</v>

935
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:35.750
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

936
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 3>so then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

937
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.630
<v Speaker 3>Dr Peterson one of the natural response </v>
<v Speaker 3>to what you said,</v>

938
00:47:40.631 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 3>would it be okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

939
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.173
<v Speaker 3>the priorities are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a rigged game because only when </v>

940
00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 3>there are the ones who are able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>procreate.</v>

941
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:49.390
<v Speaker 3>So what do we answer to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it's a rigged game.</v>

942
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.733
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it's a rate game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women have complicated lives and the </v>

943
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:55.780
<v Speaker 3>pill has made them more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's not.</v>

944
00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.540
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say that exactly because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

945
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.550
<v Speaker 3>100 years in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95,</v>

946
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:04.360
<v Speaker 3>the average person in the western world </v>
<v Speaker 3>lived on $1 a day in today's money.</v>

947
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those people worked so hard at slaved</v>

948
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:10.720
<v Speaker 3>away to such a degree that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even imagine it and all their kids die.</v>

949
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

950
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:17.170
<v Speaker 3>that the death rate among kids below </v>
<v Speaker 3>five years beyond comprehension.</v>

951
00:48:17.171 --> 00:48:19.720
<v Speaker 3>And so like women have terrible time as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

952
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:20.554
<v Speaker 3>So did men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got to be coal miners and soldiers </v>

953
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.520
<v Speaker 3>because now that wasn't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertaining,</v>

954
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So life was very,</v>

955
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

956
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.593
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard before we got rich and we're </v>

957
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 3>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even those of you who are in this class,</v>

958
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:33.880
<v Speaker 3>we think you're poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

959
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.260
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

960
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.770
<v Speaker 3>you're in the top one 10th of one </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent by historical standards.</v>

961
00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 3>And probably there by world standards as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

962
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:43.143
<v Speaker 3>Of course you can just compare yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the few people who Richard than you </v>

963
00:48:45.191 --> 00:48:46.024
<v Speaker 3>and feel sorry for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's pretty pathetic in my </v>

964
00:48:48.311 --> 00:48:49.144
<v Speaker 3>estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's ended certainly historically </v>

965
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:53.830
<v Speaker 3>uninformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

966
00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:56.830
<v Speaker 3>women have it rough obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's,</v>

967
00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.860
<v Speaker 3>there's other things to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do live eight years longer,</v>

968
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.080
<v Speaker 3>so that's not trivial.</v>

969
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Testosterone kills men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's basically why men die earlier.</v>

970
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>men are much more likely to be killed in</v>

971
00:49:08.121 --> 00:49:10.630
<v Speaker 3>dangerous jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do almost all the dangerous jobs.</v>

972
00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:11.464
<v Speaker 3>They do almost all the outside work and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of reasons that men get </v>

973
00:49:14.801 --> 00:49:17.470
<v Speaker 3>paid more than women that have nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with the prejudice.</v>

974
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.693
<v Speaker 3>It's because they take awful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible jobs like working in the oil </v>

975
00:49:21.221 --> 00:49:25.130
<v Speaker 3>rigs in northern Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's bloody 40 below and come out of</v>

976
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.920
<v Speaker 3>that after five years with two or three </v>
<v Speaker 3>fingers missing and,</v>

977
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:28.873
<v Speaker 3>and all warped up because you really </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to wrestle pipe when it's 40 below </v>

978
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 3>and it's filthy with a bunch of ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 3>man who are hung over beyond belief.</v>

979
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:42.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's not very entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

980
00:49:42.011 --> 00:49:42.844
<v Speaker 3>I mean each gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each sex has its own unfairness to deal </v>

981
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:48.880
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to think of that as a consequence of</v>

982
00:49:48.881 --> 00:49:50.230
<v Speaker 3>the social structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

983
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.790
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

984
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 3>what about nature itself?</v>

985
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:55.623
<v Speaker 3>And this is something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something that seems to be </v>

986
00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:00.520
<v Speaker 3>completely invisible on the left side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the political spectrum.</v>

987
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.863
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course you're bloody oppressed and </v>

988
00:50:02.831 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 3>your life is full of suffering </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

989
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.633
<v Speaker 3>but to think about that as a direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of unjust social structures </v>

990
00:50:09.341 --> 00:50:10.174
<v Speaker 3>is just moronic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's part of the reason a </v>

991
00:50:12.281 --> 00:50:15.250
<v Speaker 3>small part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look where you're sitting people,</v>

992
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.120
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty warm in here and you're so </v>
<v Speaker 3>privileged.</v>

993
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.850
<v Speaker 3>You can come here at Saturday morning </v>
<v Speaker 3>and listen to an intellectual lecture.</v>

994
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.013
<v Speaker 3>It's like you should be happy about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because by historical standards you </v>

995
00:50:25.511 --> 00:50:30.511
<v Speaker 3>should be out lifting rocks in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>skeletal form about five foot three with</v>

996
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:34.670
<v Speaker 3>no teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cougars,</v>

997
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:36.920
<v Speaker 3>cougars alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

998
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:38.300
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

999
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:40.490
<v Speaker 3>there's no gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

1000
00:50:40.491 --> 00:50:43.340
<v Speaker 3>There's no gratitude for what our </v>
<v Speaker 3>society is capable of doing.</v>

1001
00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 3>So a three.</v>

1002
00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:47.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dr Peterson.</v>

1003
00:50:47.651 --> 00:50:51.220
<v Speaker 6>Tell them what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I was thinking what happens when</v>

1004
00:50:51.221 --> 00:50:56.160
<v Speaker 6>the forces of the gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gender expression clash with the Marx,</v>

1005
00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:58.780
<v Speaker 6>the capitalist market forces,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

1006
00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:00.003
<v Speaker 6>sports is a multibillion dollar industry</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if some women start saying we </v>

1007
00:51:03.581 --> 00:51:07.720
<v Speaker 6>express ourselves as bad because we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>mad and the law is on their side.</v>

1008
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:08.763
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that this billion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 6>industry is going to come out with some </v>

1009
00:51:12.161 --> 00:51:16.150
<v Speaker 6>women wanting to be football teams on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Toronto Maple leafs?</v>

1010
00:51:16.151 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sad.</v>

1011
00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:17.883
<v Speaker 6>Whenever you do of the market forces </v>
<v Speaker 6>will will clash with this and then some </v>

1012
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.433
<v Speaker 6>of these issues.</v>

1013
00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.053
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>market forces will be a constraining </v>

1014
00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.353
<v Speaker 3>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Partly because the market tends to </v>

1015
00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:37.570
<v Speaker 3>punish things that don't work in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>market very,</v>

1016
00:51:37.571 --> 00:51:38.890
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1017
00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:43.030
<v Speaker 3>and that's another thing with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about say equality or equity in</v>

1018
00:51:43.031 --> 00:51:43.864
<v Speaker 3>the workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you believe that there is a </v>

1019
00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:52.480
<v Speaker 3>equivalent distribution of talent across</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the categories,</v>

1020
00:51:52.481 --> 00:51:53.314
<v Speaker 3>that you have some reason to wait for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the market to sort itself out because </v>

1021
00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:59.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're a,</v>

1022
00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:03.520
<v Speaker 3>an anticapitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you at least have to understand that the</v>

1023
00:52:03.521 --> 00:52:06.340
<v Speaker 3>people that you despise are motivated by</v>
<v Speaker 3>greed.</v>

1024
00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.780
<v Speaker 3>And so they're going to try to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who will make them the most money</v>

1025
00:52:10.781 --> 00:52:11.614
<v Speaker 3>and they basically do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a pretty stupid employer who won't </v>

1026
00:52:14.081 --> 00:52:16.360
<v Speaker 3>take someone tell them to when they come</v>
<v Speaker 3>along and you might say,</v>

1027
00:52:16.361 --> 00:52:18.250
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're prejudiced and they're not doing</v>

1028
00:52:18.251 --> 00:52:21.160
<v Speaker 3>such a great job of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of like sorting out the applicants.</v>

1029
00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

1030
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:22.923
<v Speaker 3>There'll be stomped real good by people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who are much better at it because like </v>

1031
00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:26.873
<v Speaker 3>talent is unbelievably rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you guys have talked </v>

1032
00:52:28.661 --> 00:52:31.450
<v Speaker 3>about the freedom distribution at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1033
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:32.583
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>productivity is not normally </v>

1034
00:52:34.271 --> 00:52:36.880
<v Speaker 3>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even learned psychology.</v>

1035
00:52:36.881 --> 00:52:38.440
<v Speaker 3>That's everything is normally </v>
<v Speaker 3>distributed.</v>

1036
00:52:38.441 --> 00:52:38.851
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1037
00:52:38.851 --> 00:52:42.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>random.</v>

1038
00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Things are normally distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but productivity isn't random.</v>

1039
00:52:45.611 --> 00:52:46.444
<v Speaker 3>And so what you see that productivity is</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually governed by something called </v>

1040
00:52:49.031 --> 00:52:49.864
<v Speaker 3>price's law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a variation of another </v>

1041
00:52:51.551 --> 00:52:54.850
<v Speaker 3>principle called the preto principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was discovered back in the late 18</v>

1042
00:52:54.851 --> 00:52:57.700
<v Speaker 3>hundreds by deal Fredel Pareto who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>an economist.</v>

1043
00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:02.380
<v Speaker 3>What price showed he price actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying scientific productivity.</v>

1044
00:53:02.381 --> 00:53:04.390
<v Speaker 3>And so what he shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's quite cool.</v>

1045
00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.480
<v Speaker 3>At the time when he did this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was in 1960,</v>

1046
00:53:07.481 --> 00:53:11.470
<v Speaker 3>the typical phd student had one </v>
<v Speaker 3>publication on graduation,</v>

1047
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:13.630
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half as many had two,</v>

1048
00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:14.763
<v Speaker 3>half as many as that had three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>half as many as that had a massive step </v>

1049
00:53:19.641 --> 00:53:20.474
<v Speaker 3>down in productivity and you see this in</v>
<v Speaker 3>beside in scientific productivity </v>

1050
00:53:23.501 --> 00:53:24.334
<v Speaker 3>periods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what happens that in any given </v>

1051
00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:29.430
<v Speaker 3>scientific domain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a clump of people sort of on the</v>

1052
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:30.264
<v Speaker 3>left side of the distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less productive side and there have </v>

1053
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.500
<v Speaker 3>an in that clump.</v>

1054
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.393
<v Speaker 3>Men and women are equally productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's a tiny percentage of </v>

1055
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:43.881
<v Speaker 3>people who publish all the papers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all men and they're those insane</v>

1056
00:53:44.011 --> 00:53:47.130
<v Speaker 3>man that I was telling you about before </v>
<v Speaker 3>that do not work for 80,</v>

1057
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:49.110
<v Speaker 3>almost a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>

1058
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:51.080
<v Speaker 3>if you want to rise to the top of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>profession,</v>

1059
00:53:51.081 --> 00:53:53.510
<v Speaker 3>do you think about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you need to rise to the top of a</v>

1060
00:53:53.511 --> 00:53:57.060
<v Speaker 3>competitive profession?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You better be smart cars,</v>

1061
00:53:57.061 --> 00:53:57.894
<v Speaker 3>smart makes you fast and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get to the next place faster </v>

1062
00:54:00.961 --> 00:54:02.880
<v Speaker 3>than anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're faster than them.</v>

1063
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.270
<v Speaker 3>You bloody well better be conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>industrious in particular,</v>

1064
00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:07.104
<v Speaker 3>so it should make you feel horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>every second of your life you spent </v>

1065
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:11.993
<v Speaker 3>doing something that involves leisure </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's going to be some people in </v>

1066
00:54:14.371 --> 00:54:16.560
<v Speaker 3>here that know that Mr hyperconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>branches,</v>

1067
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.450
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand sitting around doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

1068
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I got to find some art to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1069
00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:21.243
<v Speaker 3>when you'll do whatever you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's work because you feel guilty and </v>

1070
00:54:24.001 --> 00:54:24.834
<v Speaker 3>horrible if you're sitting around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you need to be hyper conscientious </v>

1071
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:28.673
<v Speaker 3>and so maybe you need to be in the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>one percent for intelligence and maybe </v>

1072
00:54:32.401 --> 00:54:34.350
<v Speaker 3>the top five percent for </v>
<v Speaker 3>industriousness.</v>

1073
00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:37.800
<v Speaker 3>So that's one percent of five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're looking at it.</v>

1074
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.400
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that one percent?</v>

1075
00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Five percent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.820
<v Speaker 3>One in 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One in 20.</v>

1077
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.500
<v Speaker 3>One in $2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right.</v>

1078
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a rare bird if you're going to be</v>

1079
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:52.320
<v Speaker 3>in that position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1080
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:53.783
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because because of the credo </v>

1081
00:54:56.011 --> 00:54:56.844
<v Speaker 3>distribution and because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentration of productivity in a very </v>

1082
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.760
<v Speaker 3>small number of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's tremendous economic incentive to</v>

1083
00:55:02.761 --> 00:55:05.190
<v Speaker 3>identify those people no matter where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're from.</v>

1084
00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.053
<v Speaker 3>No matter who they are and employers who</v>
<v Speaker 3>have any sense know that and they're </v>

1085
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.820
<v Speaker 3>hungry like these law firms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1086
00:55:11.821 --> 00:55:12.654
<v Speaker 3>you don't have no idea that knots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tie themselves in trying to keep </v>

1087
00:55:15.661 --> 00:55:19.320
<v Speaker 3>their qualified women because those </v>
<v Speaker 3>women are worth a bloody fortune.</v>

1088
00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:20.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pay them a lot,</v>

1089
00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:22.680
<v Speaker 3>but they bring in way more business </v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

1090
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:27.060
<v Speaker 3>than they bring in far more economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>

1091
00:55:27.061 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Then they take the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Firms want to keep them.</v>

1092
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.203
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean the man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the men in the law firms don't have </v>

1093
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.073
<v Speaker 3>no problems with highly qualified women </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't know what to do with </v>

1094
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:38.370
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1095
00:55:38.371 --> 00:55:42.360
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a guy and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>assertive and competitive,</v>

1096
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.553
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to be asserting </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and competitive with other </v>

1097
00:55:45.061 --> 00:55:45.894
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a lot harder to do that with a </v>

1098
00:55:47.071 --> 00:55:48.450
<v Speaker 3>woman because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1099
00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:50.160
<v Speaker 3>what am I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How am I going to be?</v>

1100
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.413
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to be like hyper aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>around her because that just doesn't </v>

1101
00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:55.800
<v Speaker 3>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the guys,</v>

1102
00:55:55.801 --> 00:55:56.634
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what to do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would say there's some residual </v>

1103
00:55:59.221 --> 00:56:02.580
<v Speaker 3>trouble in law firms and other high end </v>
<v Speaker 3>industries because of that.</v>

1104
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:06.120
<v Speaker 3>They just don't know how to sort it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But mostly the employers are thinking,</v>

1105
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.253
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you're green,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a smart and you can bring in </v>

1106
00:56:10.351 --> 00:56:11.184
<v Speaker 3>business and you're reliable and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>solve problems like we don't have </v>

1107
00:56:14.161 --> 00:56:15.750
<v Speaker 3>anybody like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need you,</v>

1108
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.240
<v Speaker 3>please stay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't happen.</v>

1109
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.000
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the market forces will.</v>

1110
00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:21.943
<v Speaker 3>But the market forces I think are </v>
<v Speaker 3>already going push things hard and then </v>

1111
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:25.743
<v Speaker 3>in the direction of maximizing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>utility of television because you just </v>

1112
00:56:30.131 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 3>have no idea how much more productive a </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive person is.</v>

1113
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Then a nonproductive person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1114
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:39.830
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just to that a publication which is to</v>

1115
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:41.280
<v Speaker 3>get your blood boiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1116
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Somebody said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>glaciers,</v>

1117
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.863
<v Speaker 3>gender and science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a feminist glaciology framework for </v>

1118
00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:51.160
<v Speaker 3>global environmental change research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to talk about productivity.</v>

1119
00:56:51.161 --> 00:56:55.660
<v Speaker 3>And then there's academia</v>
<v Speaker 3>that degree all of academia.</v>

1120
00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:57.730
<v Speaker 3>But unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a profession in which,</v>

1121
00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:58.773
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have killed them truly in the </v>

1122
00:57:00.771 --> 00:57:05.771
<v Speaker 3>trees for bullshit basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just thought that would be ironic.</v>

1123
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.010
<v Speaker 3>Twist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1124
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 3>well you know the postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe in.</v>

1125
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much you know about </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodern philosophy.</v>

1126
00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:14.620
<v Speaker 3>You're at Ryerson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so probably quite advanced,</v>

1127
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:18.400
<v Speaker 3>but not at the uft is any better because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1128
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.310
<v Speaker 3>but the postmodern is don't believe it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

1129
00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:22.323
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of things they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe and they don't believe in logic </v>

1130
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:27.160
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not making this stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can go read it for yourself.</v>

1131
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.473
<v Speaker 3>In particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think that logic is part of the </v>

1132
00:57:29.891 --> 00:57:30.724
<v Speaker 3>oppressive patriarchy and that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no point in dialogue because all the </v>

1133
00:57:33.071 --> 00:57:33.904
<v Speaker 3>reasons different power groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>identified by their groups and they </v>

1134
00:57:35.891 --> 00:57:36.724
<v Speaker 3>can't really talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a power struggle and that's </v>

1135
00:57:39.011 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 3>why the radical leftist stop people from</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking on campus.</v>

1136
00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:43.443
<v Speaker 3>That's why I couldn't find anybody to </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate me rough and speaking at the </v>

1137
00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:47.523
<v Speaker 3>University of Toronto and I went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Queens University two weeks ago to the </v>

1138
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:50.224
<v Speaker 3>law school there because I was invited </v>
<v Speaker 3>by a group called Runnymede Association </v>

1139
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:55.240
<v Speaker 3>and they asked six professors if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would debate me.</v>

1140
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:56.223
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1141
00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.273
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even a lawyer and lawyers can </v>

1142
00:57:59.081 --> 00:58:00.850
<v Speaker 3>debate like they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're good at that.</v>

1143
00:58:00.851 --> 00:58:02.440
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're trained to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1144
00:58:02.441 --> 00:58:03.274
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't debate me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they had to get somebody to play </v>

1145
00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:07.450
<v Speaker 3>devil's advocate and he did a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1146
00:58:07.451 --> 00:58:09.190
<v Speaker 3>he did a very credible job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

1147
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.080
<v Speaker 3>but you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1148
00:58:11.081 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 3>why would they come debate me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's easy.</v>

1149
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:16.660
<v Speaker 3>They don't believe in dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>period.</v>

1150
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.050
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the philosophy because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to believe in logic.</v>

1151
00:58:20.051 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to believe in dialogue.</v>

1152
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:22.683
<v Speaker 3>You have to believe that people can </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate as like as individuals </v>

1153
00:58:25.331 --> 00:58:26.164
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally and not that you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>locked in your identity as a group </v>

1154
00:58:29.381 --> 00:58:30.214
<v Speaker 3>member against all the other identity </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups that are struggling for power in </v>

1155
00:58:33.701 --> 00:58:37.720
<v Speaker 3>the Kinda hobsy and landscape that's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of postmodernism.</v>

1156
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.870
<v Speaker 3>So and this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1157
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.450
<v Speaker 3>this is just an extension of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like science is just a patriarchal,</v>

1158
00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:44.284
<v Speaker 3>oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal structure and so we need to </v>

1159
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:49.660
<v Speaker 3>reconstitute it from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's from the bottom up.</v>

1160
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:53.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like they type on their computers </v>
<v Speaker 3>while they say this.</v>

1161
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:57.910
<v Speaker 3>Not noticing that by the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're using the damn computer,</v>

1162
00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.770
<v Speaker 3>which wouldn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1163
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:01.023
<v Speaker 3>People had to figure out quantum </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanics before they could make </v>

1164
00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:06.430
<v Speaker 3>community computers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use the computer science,</v>

1165
00:59:06.431 --> 00:59:08.110
<v Speaker 3>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Science isn't real.</v>

1166
00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.490
<v Speaker 3>They do the same thing when they're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>jet planes.</v>

1167
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:17.580
<v Speaker 3>Science isn't real 600 miles an hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>typing on my computer so I could six.</v>

1168
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:19.383
<v Speaker 3>That's called a performative </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradiction from a philosophical </v>

1169
00:59:21.921 --> 00:59:25.190
<v Speaker 3>perspective and that's the same as a as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a logical paradox.</v>

1170
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:29.440
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to say one thing and do </v>
<v Speaker 3>another and say that you've got it while</v>

1171
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:30.463
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a postmodernist because you </v>

1172
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:32.084
<v Speaker 3>can do whatever you want if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist and the reason the damn </v>

1173
00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists are Marxists as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can tell,</v>

1174
00:59:37.101 --> 00:59:37.934
<v Speaker 3>because inevitably they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because the problem with </v>

1175
00:59:40.311 --> 00:59:41.144
<v Speaker 3>postmodernism is it doesn't even leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists anything to do because </v>

1176
00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:49.250
<v Speaker 3>postmodernists don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>overarching directional narratives.</v>

1177
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:50.383
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with that proposition is</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have an overarching </v>

1178
00:59:53.451 --> 00:59:54.284
<v Speaker 3>directive narrative for your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what to do and it's </v>

1179
00:59:57.411 --> 00:59:59.760
<v Speaker 3>really important that you know what to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do because you're alive,</v>

1180
00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:00.623
<v Speaker 3>that you need to do things well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just turn back to the original </v>

1181
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 3>Marxism and we'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1182
01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:05.474
<v Speaker 3>we'll just get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just group ourselves up in </v>

1183
01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:07.523
<v Speaker 3>oppressed groups and we'll have wars </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the oppressed groups that'll </v>

1184
01:00:10.011 --> 01:00:12.710
<v Speaker 3>give us a sufficient overarching </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative.</v>

1185
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:14.083
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't matter that it contradicts the </v>
<v Speaker 3>postmodernist thesis because they don't </v>

1186
01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:19.880
<v Speaker 3>care about contradictions so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

1187
01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 3>So hence this feminist glaciology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1188
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:26.990
<v Speaker 3>So I've got a few questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me watch your hands pop up.</v>

1189
01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:28.090
<v Speaker 3>So there's one back that first</v>

1190
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:35.890
<v Speaker 7>you've</v>
<v Speaker 7>been determined as</v>

1191
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:54.030
<v Speaker 7>women</v>
<v Speaker 7>and</v>

1192
01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.380
<v Speaker 7>gender choice or not choice?</v>

1193
01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.150
<v Speaker 3>It's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question.</v>

1194
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1195
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:12.350
<v Speaker 3>Even though I think your question is </v>
<v Speaker 3>well formulated,</v>

1196
01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:13.184
<v Speaker 3>that intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that the economy is </v>

1197
01:01:15.561 --> 01:01:16.394
<v Speaker 3>that straightforward because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of deterministic </v>

1198
01:01:19.431 --> 01:01:20.264
<v Speaker 3>thinking on the social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the distribution to because they </v>

1199
01:01:23.511 --> 01:01:26.840
<v Speaker 3>regard you as the deterministic product </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your environment.</v>

1200
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.170
<v Speaker 3>So it's more like the localization of </v>
<v Speaker 3>determinism.</v>

1201
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:31.543
<v Speaker 3>So you might say that for the dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the more biologically oriented </v>

1202
01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:35.504
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more biological determinism but </v>

1203
01:01:37.071 --> 01:01:39.280
<v Speaker 3>then so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think that the,</v>

1204
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.133
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conflict between free will and </v>

1205
01:01:41.421 --> 01:01:44.360
<v Speaker 3>determinism basically runs across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire political spectrum.</v>

1206
01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:45.643
<v Speaker 3>But then I would also say it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>an ill formed argument because there </v>

1207
01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:51.644
<v Speaker 3>isn't an absolute paradoxical </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradiction between free will and </v>

1208
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.800
<v Speaker 3>determinism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quite the contrary.</v>

1209
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:59.930
<v Speaker 3>You actually need elements of </v>
<v Speaker 3>determinism,</v>

1210
01:01:59.931 --> 01:02:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I think for a system to operate freely.</v>

1211
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:05.180
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about playing chess.</v>

1212
01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.033
<v Speaker 3>You can do a lot of things when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing chess or think about composing </v>

1213
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.273
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do a lot of things when you're </v>

1214
01:02:11.571 --> 01:02:14.360
<v Speaker 3>composing music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's an underlying rule structure</v>

1215
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.880
<v Speaker 3>that sets up the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1216
01:02:16.881 --> 01:02:17.714
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the environment within which all of </v>

1217
01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:22.980
<v Speaker 3>those choices manifest themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same with online video games,</v>

1218
01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:23.700
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1219
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.533
<v Speaker 3>which are reading good example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think because they are micro worlds </v>

1220
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:28.283
<v Speaker 3>and they're determined in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they have an underlying rule </v>

1221
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:34.680
<v Speaker 3>structure that's the rules of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're free in many other ways.</v>

1222
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:40.070
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't think there's anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much on any side of the political</v>

1223
01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 3>spectrum who would regard people as </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely possessed a freewill.</v>

1224
01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have constraints and limits and the,</v>

1225
01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:50.160
<v Speaker 3>we're also pretty good at adjusting </v>
<v Speaker 3>those on the fly.</v>

1226
01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:51.483
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be much less irritated if at </v>

1227
01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:57.960
<v Speaker 3>three year old runs into you carelessly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well tryciclics than you will if a,</v>

1228
01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an adult man runs into with his scooter </v>

1229
01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.130
<v Speaker 3>because you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll take,</v>

1230
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:06.150
<v Speaker 3>you'll take the constraints of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual into account very,</v>

1231
01:03:06.151 --> 01:03:09.300
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think so.</v>

1232
01:03:09.301 --> 01:03:10.134
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>

1233
01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:13.670
<v Speaker 3>it's not as simple as free will versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>determinism mount onto the political.</v>

1234
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:27.680
<v Speaker 7>You mentioned that somebody thought that</v>
<v Speaker 7>socialism was</v>

1235
01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:36.210
<v Speaker 7>a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a,</v>

1236
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:42.150
<v Speaker 7>there's something wrong with that person</v>
<v Speaker 7>and see what you're saying.</v>

1237
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.433
<v Speaker 7>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I asked her to say those are the video </v>

1238
01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:48.070
<v Speaker 7>about compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about how people get their compassion,</v>

1239
01:03:48.071 --> 01:03:52.430
<v Speaker 7>altruism and that you appeal to an </v>
<v Speaker 7>individual.</v>

1240
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:57.110
<v Speaker 7>It seems that like attacking that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not your peer,</v>

1241
01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.210
<v Speaker 7>but it seems that even get people on </v>
<v Speaker 7>their heels sort of,</v>

1242
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.150
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I see like some hatred for Americans</v>

1243
01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:06.483
<v Speaker 7>or Muslims and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I think that just makes people they </v>

1244
01:04:08.461 --> 01:04:11.000
<v Speaker 7>naturally feel identified with like </v>
<v Speaker 7>their land,</v>

1245
01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:11.883
<v Speaker 7>their category.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'll just make them defend that stance </v>

1246
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:19.850
<v Speaker 7>even more reaching for the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like understanding compassionate.</v>

1247
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.073
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I take that apart a little bit </v>

1248
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.410
<v Speaker 3>because is a bunch of issues with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>

1249
01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.013
<v Speaker 3>how many people are in your psychology </v>
<v Speaker 3>course or taking psychology or most of </v>

1250
01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:32.434
<v Speaker 3>you taking psychology courses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people are taking psychology </v>

1251
01:04:34.391 --> 01:04:35.500
<v Speaker 3>courses?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1252
01:04:35.501 --> 01:04:37.300
<v Speaker 3>so a goodly number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1253
01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.580
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you want to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the conception,</v>

1254
01:04:39.581 --> 01:04:40.414
<v Speaker 3>like compassionate as you actually want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to start thinking about it like a </v>

1255
01:04:42.971 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 3>psychologist or like a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because compassion is actually definable</v>

1256
01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:48.563
<v Speaker 3>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the easiest way to approach it </v>

1257
01:04:50.741 --> 01:04:52.810
<v Speaker 3>is to think about it in big five terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it.</v>

1258
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:53.723
<v Speaker 3>It maps onto agreeableness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially you can break agreeableness </v>

1259
01:04:57.641 --> 01:05:01.120
<v Speaker 3>down into compassion and politeness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the liberal types,</v>

1260
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:04.250
<v Speaker 3>especially the social justice types are </v>
<v Speaker 3>way higher in compassion.</v>

1261
01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:07.060
<v Speaker 3>It's actually their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their fundamental characteristic and you</v>

1262
01:05:07.061 --> 01:05:07.810
<v Speaker 3>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1263
01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:09.340
<v Speaker 3>compassion is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a virtue.</v>

1264
01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:10.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1265
01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.750
<v Speaker 3>it is average you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but any unit,</v>

1266
01:05:13.751 --> 01:05:14.584
<v Speaker 3>dimensional virtue immediately becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 3>vice because real is the intermingling </v>

1267
01:05:18.701 --> 01:05:19.534
<v Speaker 3>of a number of virtues and their and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their integration into a functional </v>

1268
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:27.430
<v Speaker 3>identity that can be expressed socially </v>
<v Speaker 3>and compassion.</v>

1269
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:33.160
<v Speaker 3>Passion is great if you happen to be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entity towards which it is directive,</v>

1270
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:34.383
<v Speaker 3>but compassion tends to divide the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a crying children and predatory </v>

1271
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:40.990
<v Speaker 3>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1272
01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:42.730
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're a crying child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1273
01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:43.564
<v Speaker 3>great man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you happen to be identified as </v>

1274
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:48.520
<v Speaker 3>one of the predatory snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better look the hell out.</v>

1275
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:50.860
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1276
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.400
<v Speaker 3>compassionate is what the mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grizzly bear feels for her cubs when she</v>

1277
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 3>eats you because you got in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1278
01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:58.390
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1279
01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.253
<v Speaker 3>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to be thinking for a </v>

1280
01:05:59.981 --> 01:06:02.920
<v Speaker 3>second that compassion isn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1281
01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:06.760
<v Speaker 3>a virtue that could lead to violence </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it certainly can.</v>

1282
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.380
<v Speaker 3>And the other problem with compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why we have conscientiousness,</v>

1283
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:12.873
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's five canonical personality </v>

1284
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:15.214
<v Speaker 3>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agreeableness is pretty good if you're </v>

1285
01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:17.584
<v Speaker 3>dealing and getting akin system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to distribute resources </v>

1286
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:22.120
<v Speaker 3>equally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1287
01:06:22.121 --> 01:06:24.520
<v Speaker 3>among your children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you want all of them to have not</v>

1288
01:06:24.521 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 3>only the same chance you even walk them </v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly to have the same outcome,</v>

1289
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.860
<v Speaker 3>a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is,</v>

1290
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:34.861
<v Speaker 3>is you can't extend that moral network </v>
<v Speaker 3>to larger groups.</v>

1291
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:37.180
<v Speaker 3>Not as far as I can tell you need </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>

1292
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:42.130
<v Speaker 3>which is a much colder virtue and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>also a virtue that's much more concerned</v>

1293
01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:45.940
<v Speaker 3>with larger structures over the longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time.</v>

1294
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.793
<v Speaker 3>So and you can take about </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness is a form of </v>

1295
01:06:50.291 --> 01:06:52.000
<v Speaker 3>compassion to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange form.</v>

1296
01:06:52.001 --> 01:06:55.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like straighten the hell up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>work hard and your life will go well.</v>

1297
01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:57.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like I don't care how your </v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings,</v>

1298
01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.353
<v Speaker 3>how you feel about that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and like someone who's cold low in </v>

1299
01:07:02.471 --> 01:07:04.810
<v Speaker 3>agreeableness say and high in </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>

1300
01:07:04.811 --> 01:07:06.550
<v Speaker 3>that's what they'll tell you every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

1301
01:07:06.551 --> 01:07:09.190
<v Speaker 3>don't come whining to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care about your feelings.</v>

1302
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Do Your Goddamn job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to be out on the street?</v>

1303
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:12.933
<v Speaker 3>Think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh that person's being really hard on </v>

1304
01:07:13.871 --> 01:07:15.250
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like not necessarily.</v>

1305
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:19.420
<v Speaker 3>They might have your long term best </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest in mind and you're fortunate if</v>

1306
01:07:19.421 --> 01:07:20.254
<v Speaker 3>you come across someone who's like not </v>
<v Speaker 3>too radically disagreeable but </v>

1307
01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.113
<v Speaker 3>moderately disagreeable and high in </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness because the whip you </v>

1308
01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:28.294
<v Speaker 3>into shape.</v>

1309
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 3>And that's really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>

1310
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:34.210
<v Speaker 3>you'll admire people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You won't be able to help it,</v>

1311
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:35.021
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you think,</v>

1312
01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:35.854
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person's actually giving me good </v>

1313
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.013
<v Speaker 3>information even though you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like a slug after you after </v>

1314
01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:44.560
<v Speaker 3>they've taken you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So okay,</v>

1315
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:45.394
<v Speaker 3>so that's the compassion issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't just transform that </v>

1316
01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:48.334
<v Speaker 3>into a political stance and I think part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what we're seeing is actually the </v>

1317
01:07:51.881 --> 01:07:54.370
<v Speaker 3>rise of a form of female </v>
<v Speaker 3>totalitarianism.</v>

1318
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:55.603
<v Speaker 3>So we have no idea what totalitarianism </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like if women read because </v>

1319
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:02.440
<v Speaker 3>that's never happened before in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of the planet.</v>

1320
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:07.750
<v Speaker 3>And so we've introduced women into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political sphere radically over the last</v>

1321
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:08.584
<v Speaker 3>50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea what the consequence of </v>

1322
01:08:10.371 --> 01:08:12.910
<v Speaker 3>that is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do know from our research,</v>

1323
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:13.744
<v Speaker 3>which is preliminary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that agreeableness really predicts </v>

1324
01:08:16.851 --> 01:08:17.684
<v Speaker 3>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but female gender predicts over and </v>

1325
01:08:20.511 --> 01:08:22.070
<v Speaker 3>above the personality trait.</v>

1326
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:24.620
<v Speaker 3>And that's something we found very </v>
<v Speaker 3>rarely in our research.</v>

1327
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Usually the sex differences are wiped </v>
<v Speaker 3>out by the personality differences,</v>

1328
01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.970
<v Speaker 3>but not in this particular case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1329
01:08:30.971 --> 01:08:31.804
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women are getting married later and </v>

1330
01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.530
<v Speaker 3>they're having children much later and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're having fewer of them.</v>

1331
01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:41.770
<v Speaker 3>And so you also have to wonder what </v>
<v Speaker 3>their feminine orientation is doing with</v>

1332
01:08:41.961 --> 01:08:42.794
<v Speaker 3>itself in the interim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking and lot of it's being </v>

1333
01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:49.460
<v Speaker 3>expressed as political opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in fair enough.</v>

1334
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:50.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1335
01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:54.080
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not fine when it starts to shut</v>

1336
01:08:54.081 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 3>down discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also if you think about politics,</v>

1337
01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.740
<v Speaker 3>politics from a temperamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

1338
01:08:59.741 --> 01:09:03.530
<v Speaker 3>if it gets to be extraordinarily useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have conservative,</v>

1339
01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:04.873
<v Speaker 3>you're high in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly orderliness and you're low </v>

1340
01:09:08.151 --> 01:09:09.740
<v Speaker 3>in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1341
01:09:09.741 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 3>so what good are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1342
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:12.763
<v Speaker 3>you're not great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had to have a wonderful </v>

1343
01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:17.390
<v Speaker 3>philosophical conversation about ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then go ahead and art movie.</v>

1344
01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:20.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like no conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>

1345
01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Wrong date for that particular bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

1346
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.183
<v Speaker 3>But if you want someone to run a company</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's already been established or to </v>

1347
01:09:28.491 --> 01:09:32.840
<v Speaker 3>make sure that algorithmize processes </v>
<v Speaker 3>are being undertaken properly,</v>

1348
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:34.423
<v Speaker 3>you want conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very good at managing and </v>

1349
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.004
<v Speaker 3>they're very good at administrative </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness is the best predictor </v>

1350
01:09:40.401 --> 01:09:43.250
<v Speaker 3>of those two domains part from Icu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1351
01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:46.100
<v Speaker 3>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you need the damn liberals for?</v>

1352
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want them running anything but</v>

1353
01:09:49.431 --> 01:09:53.750
<v Speaker 3>you want them thinking up new things </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the entrepreneurs and artists or</v>

1354
01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:57.620
<v Speaker 3>are high in openness and low in </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>

1355
01:09:57.621 --> 01:09:58.454
<v Speaker 3>especially orderliness and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be because if you're starting something </v>

1356
01:10:01.011 --> 01:10:02.810
<v Speaker 3>new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to have everything in the</v>

1357
01:10:02.811 --> 01:10:05.180
<v Speaker 3>neat little boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to break rules,</v>

1358
01:10:05.181 --> 01:10:06.014
<v Speaker 3>you have to take things apart and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that liberals need the conservatives to </v>

1359
01:10:09.891 --> 01:10:14.020
<v Speaker 3>run enterprises and the conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 3>need the liberals to start them and then</v>

1360
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:14.590
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1361
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:16.700
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense from a temperamental </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

1362
01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:17.563
<v Speaker 3>if you think about it too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's five basic personality </v>

1363
01:10:20.601 --> 01:10:21.434
<v Speaker 3>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all normally distributed and </v>

1364
01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:23.294
<v Speaker 3>what that implies is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>niche for every personality type in </v>

1365
01:10:27.621 --> 01:10:28.454
<v Speaker 3>proportion to the frequency of the of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the occurrence within that normal </v>

1366
01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:33.494
<v Speaker 3>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some places for really </v>

1367
01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.273
<v Speaker 3>extroverted people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more places for people who are </v>

1368
01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:40.820
<v Speaker 3>moderately extroverted and moderately </v>
<v Speaker 3>introvert,</v>

1369
01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:41.953
<v Speaker 3>but there are places for everyone in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that dimensional structure and there's </v>

1370
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:49.400
<v Speaker 3>utility for all of those people and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why you have to keep the dialogue</v>

1371
01:10:49.401 --> 01:10:50.810
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're hyper liberal,</v>

1372
01:10:50.811 --> 01:10:51.644
<v Speaker 3>you have to talk to the damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatives because sometimes they're </v>

1373
01:10:54.171 --> 01:10:56.750
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you're right,</v>

1374
01:10:57.050 --> 01:11:01.730
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so if you don't talk then the system</v>

1375
01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.000
<v Speaker 3>tilts off to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

1376
01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.440
<v Speaker 3>to the extreme that's represented by </v>
<v Speaker 3>that temperament.</v>

1377
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:07.873
<v Speaker 3>And so what you'd have is a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberals talking about new things while </v>

1378
01:11:09.921 --> 01:11:11.420
<v Speaker 3>the buildings were falling down around </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1379
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:15.810
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we need each other and that's part of</v>

1380
01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:18.450
<v Speaker 3>what's happened in the West is we </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured that out a long time ago.</v>

1381
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.340
<v Speaker 3>We figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well you haven't got to talk to those</v>

1382
01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:21.174
<v Speaker 3>stupid people who don't think the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do because sometimes despite the </v>

1383
01:11:24.451 --> 01:11:27.600
<v Speaker 3>fact that they're annoying and nowhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>near as smart as you,</v>

1384
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:28.703
<v Speaker 3>they're actually correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so here's another way of thinking </v>

1385
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:34.470
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine the environment.</v>

1386
01:11:34.471 --> 01:11:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Does this like a snake?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always moving,</v>

1387
01:11:37.351 --> 01:11:38.184
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where the damn thing's </v>

1388
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:43.650
<v Speaker 3>going and you want to be in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like to cliffs that keeps shifting.</v>

1389
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.810
<v Speaker 3>You want to be in the middle of far from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cliffs.</v>

1390
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:48.900
<v Speaker 3>It keeps moving around and you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to walk forward.</v>

1391
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's over here,</v>

1392
01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:52.374
<v Speaker 3>so the conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to pull it back and sometimes </v>

1393
01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:56.190
<v Speaker 3>it's over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the liberals,</v>

1394
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 3>they have to pull it back and.</v>

1395
01:11:58.050 --> 01:11:58.883
<v Speaker 3>But because it keeps changing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know who's right and so you </v>

1396
01:12:01.591 --> 01:12:02.424
<v Speaker 3>have to keep talking and that's what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic society actually allows for </v>

1397
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:11.430
<v Speaker 3>exchange the opinions move the damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>polity so that we can stay in the middle</v>

1398
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:13.020
<v Speaker 3>of the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking.</v>

1399
01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:17.100
<v Speaker 3>And so you got to have some respect for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who aren't like you.</v>

1400
01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:22.190
<v Speaker 3>They're actually not like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I figured out recently I think that I</v>

1401
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:24.384
<v Speaker 3>couldn't figure out why openness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness are the dimensions </v>

1402
01:12:26.611 --> 01:12:29.580
<v Speaker 3>that are determining political belief </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're not even correlated.</v>

1403
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.550
<v Speaker 3>So why the hell do they clump for </v>
<v Speaker 3>political belief?</v>

1404
01:12:32.551 --> 01:12:36.600
<v Speaker 3>And I think I figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's because of a borders.</v>

1405
01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.720
<v Speaker 3>I think the fundamental political issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>is how open versus closed borders should</v>

1406
01:12:43.021 --> 01:12:43.854
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't just mean borders between </v>

1407
01:12:44.941 --> 01:12:48.180
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean borders between states,</v>

1408
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:52.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean borders between the institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the borders between genders,</v>

1409
01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:55.200
<v Speaker 3>borders between sexes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>borders between ideas.</v>

1410
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:59.280
<v Speaker 3>The Conservatives say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep everything where it belongs because</v>

1411
01:12:59.281 --> 01:13:02.040
<v Speaker 3>it's working and the liberals say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1412
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:04.680
<v Speaker 3>it's working for now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unless we make some adjustments,</v>

1413
01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:07.500
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to keep working and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both right,</v>

1414
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:13.790
<v Speaker 3>so we better have the dialogue because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise we wander off the cliff on the</v>

1415
01:13:14.071 --> 01:13:16.350
<v Speaker 3>left or the right and we know where that</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes.</v>

1416
01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.213
<v Speaker 3>That goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's flames down at the bottom of </v>

1417
01:13:18.121 --> 01:13:18.954
<v Speaker 3>those events and people die horribly </v>
<v Speaker 3>down there and we've seen that on the </v>

1418
01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:25.500
<v Speaker 3>right and the left with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had plenty of evidence for that.</v>

1419
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.173
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1420
01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 7>smart sort of friends</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I have like.</v>

1421
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:34.883
<v Speaker 7>It feels like their compassion got </v>
<v Speaker 7>twisted somehow and I have compassion </v>

1422
01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.110
<v Speaker 7>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't like.</v>

1423
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:39.983
<v Speaker 7>I want to speak to to that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These are people that I love and stuff </v>

1424
01:13:42.771 --> 01:13:45.660
<v Speaker 7>like this and I think that they are kind</v>
<v Speaker 7>of ideologically twisted such</v>

1425
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:49.610
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I've also spent a fair</v>

1426
01:13:49.611 --> 01:13:50.444
<v Speaker 3>bit of time thinking about is the role </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the resentment plays in political </v>

1427
01:13:53.151 --> 01:13:56.960
<v Speaker 3>ideology and I have recommended in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures,</v>

1428
01:13:56.961 --> 01:13:57.794
<v Speaker 3>but I'll recommend it here too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great book by George Orwell </v>

1429
01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.553
<v Speaker 3>called Road to Wigan pier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I wouldn't Wyg in which I would </v>

1430
01:14:03.411 --> 01:14:06.470
<v Speaker 3>highly recommend what orwell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a leftist.</v>

1431
01:14:06.471 --> 01:14:07.304
<v Speaker 3>He went and fought with the on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>communist side in the Spanish civil war </v>

1432
01:14:09.831 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 3>against the fascists roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1433
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Orwell was a tough guy and very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very smart,</v>

1434
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.063
<v Speaker 3>super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he went up to visit the coal miners </v>

1435
01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:20.810
<v Speaker 3>in the 19 thirties and in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1436
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.890
<v Speaker 3>in northern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in northern Uk.</v>

1437
01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people bad.</v>

1438
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:27.700
<v Speaker 3>They had to crawl to work for two and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>half miles in a tunnel.</v>

1439
01:14:27.701 --> 01:14:31.330
<v Speaker 3>It was like three and a half feet high </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to get to their shift.</v>

1440
01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.621
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1441
01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 3>that meant breaking rock for seven and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>half hours.</v>

1442
01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Then they had to crawl back and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't get paid for the commute,</v>

1443
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:39.603
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they had rough time and they have no </v>

1444
01:14:41.291 --> 01:14:43.450
<v Speaker 3>teeth by the time they were 30 and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1445
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:45.940
<v Speaker 3>they were done in old by the time they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were 40.</v>

1446
01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.410
<v Speaker 3>It was rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1447
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:48.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>orwell went up there and said,</v>

1448
01:14:48.911 --> 01:14:50.820
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>industrial nightmares,</v>

1449
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:52.560
<v Speaker 3>just killing these poor oppressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1450
01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:53.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1451
01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:55.660
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he lays it out.</v>

1452
01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:00.720
<v Speaker 3>You can read that without thinking a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thank God I'm not a coal miner and be.</v>

1453
01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:02.763
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty rough at the bottom of the </v>

1454
01:15:03.881 --> 01:15:06.700
<v Speaker 3>industrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like seriously rough,</v>

1455
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.930
<v Speaker 3>but in the second half of the book he </v>
<v Speaker 3>did an analysis of socialist philosophy.</v>

1456
01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:11.853
<v Speaker 3>One of the things he pointed out was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that his observation was that the sort </v>

1457
01:15:15.451 --> 01:15:16.284
<v Speaker 3>of middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologically bound socialists types </v>

1458
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:19.660
<v Speaker 3>didn't care for the poor at all.</v>

1459
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:21.520
<v Speaker 3>They just hated the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1460
01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:23.520
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1461
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Not everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not everyone.</v>

1462
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:30.400
<v Speaker 3>I worked for the MVP when I was young </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I met a number of the leaders of the</v>

1463
01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:32.320
<v Speaker 3>MDP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including grand oddly.</v>

1464
01:15:32.321 --> 01:15:35.290
<v Speaker 3>I knew him quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was Rachel Notley's father because we</v>

1465
01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:36.124
<v Speaker 3>come from the same town and I had a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of admiration for the leaders of the </v>

1466
01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:40.203
<v Speaker 3>back then no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were really trying to give </v>

1467
01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:42.850
<v Speaker 3>a voice to the working class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1468
01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:43.684
<v Speaker 3>you better give a voice to the working </v>
<v Speaker 3>class or you had never electing trump </v>

1469
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:48.640
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1470
01:15:48.641 --> 01:15:51.070
<v Speaker 3>the Socialists have abandoned the down </v>
<v Speaker 3>working class.</v>

1471
01:15:51.071 --> 01:15:51.581
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1472
01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:52.414
<v Speaker 3>we'll go play identity politics and </v>
<v Speaker 3>staff like that worked out really well </v>

1473
01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:55.684
<v Speaker 3>for Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed so because it was identity </v>

1474
01:15:58.001 --> 01:15:58.834
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's certainly shifted the election </v>

1475
01:16:01.121 --> 01:16:04.150
<v Speaker 3>towards trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She lost the working class people.</v>

1476
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:05.463
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone has to give them a voice so </v>

1477
01:16:07.481 --> 01:16:08.314
<v Speaker 3>there are genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are People on the left were genuinely </v>

1478
01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:11.194
<v Speaker 3>working to better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lot of people who because of </v>

1479
01:16:14.351 --> 01:16:17.230
<v Speaker 3>situation haven't had the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might've,</v>

1480
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:21.460
<v Speaker 3>but so many people are resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1481
01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:22.323
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's some people out there that </v>

1482
01:16:22.751 --> 01:16:23.584
<v Speaker 3>have more than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a terrible thing for North </v>

1483
01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:27.213
<v Speaker 3>American to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're so goddamn privileged </v>

1484
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.943
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should spend at least one extra day </v>

1485
01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:35.620
<v Speaker 3>in hell after we die for every time we </v>
<v Speaker 3>complained about how poor we are.</v>

1486
01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:36.911
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1487
01:16:36.911 --> 01:16:38.830
<v Speaker 3>there's some people who are richer than </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

1488
01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty rough,</v>

1489
01:16:41.441 --> 01:16:41.981
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1490
01:16:41.981 --> 01:16:44.500
<v Speaker 3>that's a rough break for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're still.</v>

1491
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:45.463
<v Speaker 3>It's the funny thing you hear about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>one percent all the time in North </v>

1492
01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:48.693
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1493
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:49.990
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one percent.</v>

1494
01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.760
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a moving target.</v>

1495
01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:54.280
<v Speaker 3>People in the one percent shift like </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

1496
01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.593
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about a 10 percent chance of </v>

1497
01:16:56.831 --> 01:16:57.664
<v Speaker 3>being in the one percent at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life and about a 40 percent chance </v>

1498
01:17:00.731 --> 01:17:03.190
<v Speaker 3>of being in the top 10 percent for at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least one year of your life.</v>

1499
01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.370
<v Speaker 3>So there is a one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's moving,</v>

1500
01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.630
<v Speaker 3>but you're the bloody one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1501
01:17:09.631 --> 01:17:11.870
<v Speaker 3>you have to do is compare yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the world.</v>

1502
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:17.030
<v Speaker 3>So like what are you complaining about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These tiny proportion of people who have</v>

1503
01:17:17.031 --> 01:17:20.210
<v Speaker 3>more than you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's up with you?</v>

1504
01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.390
<v Speaker 3>How can you be so clueless that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would do that?</v>

1505
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.350
<v Speaker 3>How can you be so ungrateful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrogant and blind?</v>

1506
01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:30.080
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1507
01:17:30.081 --> 01:17:32.090
<v Speaker 3>people have rough lives and the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

1508
01:17:32.091 --> 01:17:33.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're making people,</v>

1509
01:17:33.351 --> 01:17:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Richard Very fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1510
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:39.860
<v Speaker 3>300,000 people a day now get connected </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the electrical grid and about 250,000</v>

1511
01:17:39.861 --> 01:17:41.690
<v Speaker 3>people lifted out of abject poverty.</v>

1512
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:43.183
<v Speaker 3>We wiping out abject poverty faster than</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever before in human history by a huge </v>

1513
01:17:46.671 --> 01:17:49.790
<v Speaker 3>margin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's all for the good.</v>

1514
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:52.040
<v Speaker 3>It's really impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1515
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.210
<v Speaker 3>but a huge chunk of that twisted </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassion is just resentment.</v>

1516
01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.270
<v Speaker 3>So since there's a few people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>better off than me,</v>

1517
01:17:59.271 --> 01:18:02.330
<v Speaker 3>maybe if I compare the two myself across</v>
<v Speaker 3>one dimension,</v>

1518
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Jesus dismal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what that was getting lost in</v>

1519
01:18:05.361 --> 01:18:06.680
<v Speaker 3>the discussion today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>

1520
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:09.200
<v Speaker 3>it's so deflecting outward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all trying to,</v>

1521
01:18:09.201 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's say it's like,</v>

1522
01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.410
<v Speaker 3>it's this resentment is this wanting and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

1523
01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:17.990
<v Speaker 3>It's this lack of gratitude for just how</v>
<v Speaker 3>lucky we really are.</v>

1524
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.600
<v Speaker 3>And it's just this complete lack of </v>
<v Speaker 3>insight and reflection.</v>

1525
01:18:20.601 --> 01:18:21.790
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1526
01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:25.460
<v Speaker 3>it's partly lack of historical knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like people,</v>

1527
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:28.130
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to take what we have for </v>
<v Speaker 3>granted.</v>

1528
01:18:28.131 --> 01:18:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lights are off.</v>

1529
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:30.103
<v Speaker 3>It's like some stupid poor son of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitches out there climbing some power </v>

1530
01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 3>line in the freezing rain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1531
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.553
<v Speaker 3>with this damaged arm to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can all sit here and complain about </v>

1532
01:18:40.071 --> 01:18:42.080
<v Speaker 3>how oppressed we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1533
01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:42.914
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty pathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's no wonder we take it for </v>

1534
01:18:44.841 --> 01:18:45.674
<v Speaker 3>granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the funny thing because your </v>

1535
01:18:46.881 --> 01:18:50.000
<v Speaker 3>minds are organized so that if something</v>
<v Speaker 3>always works,</v>

1536
01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:52.760
<v Speaker 3>you ignore it because well why would you</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay attention to it?</v>

1537
01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It always works.</v>

1538
01:18:53.751 --> 01:18:57.800
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to pay attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as soon as something is predictable,</v>

1539
01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.380
<v Speaker 3>you zero it out and so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1540
01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.960
<v Speaker 3>in courses like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just how it is.</v>

1541
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1542
01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:04.453
<v Speaker 3>this is not how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bloody miracle that this stuff </v>

1543
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:07.094
<v Speaker 3>works ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazily improbable and it always </v>

1544
01:19:10.941 --> 01:19:11.570
<v Speaker 3>breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1545
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Everything is always breaking all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and somebody out there dealing away</v>

1546
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:16.880
<v Speaker 3>trying to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1547
01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:21.020
<v Speaker 3>so we're ungrateful partly because we </v>
<v Speaker 3>take things that work for granted.</v>

1548
01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:24.500
<v Speaker 3>If our systems worked only 99 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

1549
01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.100
<v Speaker 3>our society would probably be better </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when the lights went off,</v>

1550
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:29.940
<v Speaker 3>everyone would go and the and the heat </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1551
01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.650
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't see in the dark pool.</v>

1552
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Then there's no furnace and it comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>back on and you think,</v>

1553
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's much better,</v>

1554
01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.440
<v Speaker 3>but it always works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1555
01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:41.300
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's great.</v>

1556
01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:43.790
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Speaking of envy and resentment,</v>

1557
01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.070
<v Speaker 7>would you care to comment on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>apparently well established numerous,</v>

1558
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:48.043
<v Speaker 7>this idea that men have a collective </v>
<v Speaker 7>common collective interests and women </v>

1559
01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:54.070
<v Speaker 7>have a separate common collective </v>
<v Speaker 7>interests,</v>

1560
01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 7>class interest,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that these interests are becoming to</v>

1561
01:19:57.951 --> 01:19:58.784
<v Speaker 7>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a competition sometimes on a </v>

1562
01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.650
<v Speaker 7>collective level.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1563
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I think there is competition between men</v>
<v Speaker 3>and women,</v>

1564
01:20:06.341 --> 01:20:10.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's nested inside a broader arena </v>
<v Speaker 3>of cooperation.</v>

1565
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.453
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is another thing that you learned </v>

1566
01:20:12.781 --> 01:20:14.860
<v Speaker 3>from reading Psj if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're careful this,</v>

1567
01:20:14.861 --> 01:20:15.694
<v Speaker 3>but because piaget was smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that there is no dichotomous </v>

1568
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 3>opposition between cooperation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition.</v>

1569
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.513
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the sort of tenants of the kind </v>

1570
01:20:25.381 --> 01:20:29.370
<v Speaker 3>of this Mumbo jumbo that I hate is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you should.</v>

1571
01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Kids shouldn't play competitive games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1572
01:20:33.331 --> 01:20:35.070
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be cooperative games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1573
01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:36.990
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take that apart.</v>

1574
01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:37.853
<v Speaker 3>Let's take hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it competitive or cooperative or </v>

1575
01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:42.810
<v Speaker 3>competitive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1576
01:20:42.811 --> 01:20:45.900
<v Speaker 3>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one brings a basketball to the hockey</v>

1577
01:20:45.901 --> 01:20:47.200
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1578
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:48.083
<v Speaker 3>No one brings a chessboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone that comes to the hockey game </v>

1579
01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.210
<v Speaker 3>comes there to play hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That constitutes cooperation.</v>

1580
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:58.290
<v Speaker 3>We'll mutually define the aim or does </v>
<v Speaker 3>piaget and cooperation.</v>

1581
01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:01.380
<v Speaker 3>We'll mutually define the aim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will assign each other rules.</v>

1582
01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:04.410
<v Speaker 3>We'll all agree to stick to the roles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1583
01:21:04.411 --> 01:21:07.140
<v Speaker 3>that's cooperation and if you break the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>

1584
01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:09.060
<v Speaker 3>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get stuck in the penalty box.</v>

1585
01:21:09.061 --> 01:21:12.060
<v Speaker 3>You're not playing hockey off you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people,</v>

1586
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:14.940
<v Speaker 3>people go off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go sit in the penalty box,</v>

1587
01:21:14.941 --> 01:21:16.350
<v Speaker 3>they don't go kill the referee with</v>

1588
01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:20.250
<v Speaker 1>go and sit in the penalty box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1589
01:21:20.290 --> 01:21:25.290
<v Speaker 1>six foot seven slash 300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>

1590
01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.520
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what about within the team</v>

1591
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:30.480
<v Speaker 3>that cooperation or competition?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1592
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.540
<v Speaker 3>each team member is trying to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best player,</v>

1593
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.290
<v Speaker 3>but try not passing to your colleagues </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see what happens.</v>

1594
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're a really good,</v>

1595
01:21:38.791 --> 01:21:41.370
<v Speaker 3>they'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just a diva and no one's going to</v>

1596
01:21:41.371 --> 01:21:42.480
<v Speaker 3>be happy with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1597
01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:44.880
<v Speaker 3>they'll put horrible things in your beer</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the game.</v>

1598
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:46.363
<v Speaker 3>So it's cooperation there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a Meta level of </v>

1599
01:21:50.131 --> 01:21:50.964
<v Speaker 3>cooperation which is that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to improve their skills </v>

1600
01:21:53.191 --> 01:21:57.690
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that serves a higher order good.</v>

1601
01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:02.010
<v Speaker 3>And everyone's trying to learn how to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good player so that they can play many</v>

1602
01:22:02.011 --> 01:22:03.060
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1603
01:22:03.061 --> 01:22:04.710
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't play competitive games.</v>

1604
01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:06.930
<v Speaker 3>So like you must've been educated at </v>
<v Speaker 3>noisey.</v>

1605
01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very sad and it's so,</v>

1606
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:20.310
<v Speaker 3>so ignorant for people who know </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about child development to say</v>

1607
01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:23.100
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just what is with you,</v>

1608
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:27.810
<v Speaker 3>where were you educated or where were </v>
<v Speaker 3>you educated is the right response.</v>

1609
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.390
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then so with men and women,</v>

1610
01:22:30.391 --> 01:22:33.450
<v Speaker 3>well there is group competition for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

1611
01:22:33.451 --> 01:22:36.360
<v Speaker 3>you're competing roughly speaking with </v>
<v Speaker 3>all your classmates,</v>

1612
01:22:36.361 --> 01:22:37.194
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of the women are going to </v>

1613
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 3>outshine you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>

1614
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:40.723
<v Speaker 3>that's tough for men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's particularly tough for men because </v>

1615
01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:48.210
<v Speaker 3>it isn't obvious how you compete full </v>
<v Speaker 3>bore with women.</v>

1616
01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:51.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not obvious and we don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to solve that problem.</v>

1617
01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:52.733
<v Speaker 3>And then of course status in </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to the male hierarchy is </v>

1618
01:22:56.821 --> 01:22:57.654
<v Speaker 3>more important for men than it is for </v>
<v Speaker 3>women because women pick their mates </v>

1619
01:23:00.271 --> 01:23:02.340
<v Speaker 3>based on their position in the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

1620
01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.740
<v Speaker 3>And so that puts me in also in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>awkward way.</v>

1621
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.820
<v Speaker 3>It puts women in an awkward position </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1622
01:23:06.821 --> 01:23:07.654
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of your women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say there's a fair number of you </v>

1623
01:23:09.461 --> 01:23:13.800
<v Speaker 3>here who have an Iq of more than 130 </v>
<v Speaker 3>puts you in like maybe the talk.</v>

1624
01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:18.160
<v Speaker 3>You're one in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>95th percentile and then you know you've</v>

1625
01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:18.994
<v Speaker 3>got pretty good career proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like your pool of eligible mates is </v>

1626
01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:27.650
<v Speaker 3>minuscule that the data shows that </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly $50,</v>

1627
01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:28.553
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 point increase in icu for a woman </v>

1628
01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:34.060
<v Speaker 3>decreases your probability of finding a </v>
<v Speaker 3>partner by 40 percent.</v>

1629
01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.090
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has zero effect for men by the way,</v>

1630
01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.820
<v Speaker 3>because men made across and down </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominance hierarchies,</v>

1631
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:40.743
<v Speaker 3>one across the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a smart woman and you're </v>

1632
01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.133
<v Speaker 3>and you're attractive and you're young </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're hardworking and you have a </v>

1633
01:23:46.361 --> 01:23:49.330
<v Speaker 3>good career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you need a man who's smart,</v>

1634
01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.970
<v Speaker 3>hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young who has a good career,</v>

1635
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:54.280
<v Speaker 3>but he has to be a little better at </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things than you.</v>

1636
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck,</v>

1637
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:56.583
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be rough because there </v>

1638
01:23:57.461 --> 01:23:58.294
<v Speaker 3>just aren't that many people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's another problem that </v>

1639
01:24:01.151 --> 01:24:01.984
<v Speaker 3>faces women too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is you're not going to be smart </v>

1640
01:24:04.151 --> 01:24:06.730
<v Speaker 3>card working with a good career till </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 30,</v>

1641
01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:10.300
<v Speaker 3>then you have to compete with 25 year </v>
<v Speaker 3>old women.</v>

1642
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:11.703
<v Speaker 3>And so that's also an insoluble problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the thing about 25 year old </v>

1643
01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.920
<v Speaker 3>women is they put less stress on men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1644
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:19.143
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they can have babies for an </v>

1645
01:24:21.191 --> 01:24:23.060
<v Speaker 3>extra five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every guy pittance.</v>

1646
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Y'All have kids sometime because he can </v>

1647
01:24:25.961 --> 01:24:28.090
<v Speaker 3>think that he can have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's 80.</v>

1648
01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:30.560
<v Speaker 3>What the hell does he care women?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1649
01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty 5:40.</v>

1650
01:24:32.171 --> 01:24:33.004
<v Speaker 3>You better get it together by there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you're 30 and you've got </v>

1651
01:24:35.681 --> 01:24:36.514
<v Speaker 3>your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got those 25 year old women to </v>

1652
01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:39.950
<v Speaker 3>compete with very.</v>

1653
01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:42.370
<v Speaker 3>And men don't care about your damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>stamps.</v>

1654
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:44.890
<v Speaker 3>So it's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rough.</v>

1655
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:47.440
<v Speaker 3>So there is lots of competition between </v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women,</v>

1656
01:24:47.441 --> 01:24:51.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's nested inside a much broader </v>
<v Speaker 3>domain of cooperation marriages.</v>

1657
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.633
<v Speaker 3>This fundamental solution to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the evidence for that is </v>

1658
01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:58.630
<v Speaker 3>also clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's better for women.</v>

1659
01:24:58.690 --> 01:25:01.780
<v Speaker 3>It's you have a better sex life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're healthier,</v>

1660
01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.673
<v Speaker 3>your kids are better off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not nearly as likely to plummet </v>

1661
01:25:05.531 --> 01:25:09.040
<v Speaker 3>into a lower socioeconomic category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which almost always happens to women who</v>

1662
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:13.060
<v Speaker 3>get divorced because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to one income,</v>

1663
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:14.740
<v Speaker 3>you got kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck,</v>

1664
01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:19.720
<v Speaker 3>like you're poor and if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because you're working so often.</v>

1665
01:25:19.721 --> 01:25:23.030
<v Speaker 3>The only time you have to have a date is</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some psychopathic man.</v>

1666
01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:26.230
<v Speaker 3>His schedule around yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1667
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen plenty of this man.</v>

1668
01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.673
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking through my hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know exactly what the hell happens </v>

1669
01:25:31.901 --> 01:25:32.734
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were a little older and a </v>

1670
01:25:34.091 --> 01:25:38.200
<v Speaker 3>little poor and a little more desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not exactly fun,</v>

1671
01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.513
<v Speaker 3>so I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't recommend that you end up </v>

1672
01:25:40.871 --> 01:25:42.010
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1673
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:43.241
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On that.</v>

1674
01:25:43.241 --> 01:25:44.074
<v Speaker 3>Happy Valentine's Day.</v>

1675
01:25:46.170 --> 01:25:48.470
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's two part question.</v>

1676
01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.740
<v Speaker 5>You mentioned you were talking earlier </v>
<v Speaker 5>about English common law.</v>

1677
01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:53.683
<v Speaker 5>About 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read an article from a constitutional </v>

1678
01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.033
<v Speaker 5>expert who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lauren against he the negative </v>

1679
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 5>repercussions can come from</v>

1680
01:26:04.630 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 6>the way we wrote the charter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really codifying,</v>

1681
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:11.510
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>select the victim groups,</v>

1682
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.170
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and um,</v>

1683
01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:14.920
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1684
01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:15.750
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1685
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:20.110
<v Speaker 6>and that we turned our back on 800 years</v>
<v Speaker 6>of English common law and,</v>

1686
01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:22.000
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1687
01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:24.000
<v Speaker 6>and effectively stepped away from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>rule of law.</v>

1688
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:28.660
<v Speaker 6>And the second,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the second part to that question,</v>

1689
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:35.430
<v Speaker 6>the great granddaughter of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lack of stories which your,</v>

1690
01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.493
<v Speaker 6>that was your question and how those two</v>
<v Speaker 6>relate in my mind is my escape from a </v>

1691
01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:45.380
<v Speaker 6>communist country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1692
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:47.120
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I've had,</v>

1693
01:26:47.190 --> 01:26:48.023
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dinner time conversations for decades </v>

1694
01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:51.104
<v Speaker 6>now with Michael other brother though </v>
<v Speaker 6>about what that looked like and what </v>

1695
01:26:55.041 --> 01:26:56.280
<v Speaker 6>that felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1696
01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.730
<v Speaker 6>and I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1697
01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well the Baldwin's great granddaughter's</v>

1698
01:27:02.241 --> 01:27:03.074
<v Speaker 6>question was important,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which we don't have the stories that </v>

1699
01:27:05.991 --> 01:27:06.824
<v Speaker 6>would inform us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you touched on that because some of </v>

1700
01:27:09.531 --> 01:27:12.710
<v Speaker 6>the stories from your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>horrible,</v>

1701
01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:13.544
<v Speaker 6>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I know there's all kinds of </v>

1702
01:27:14.991 --> 01:27:16.400
<v Speaker 6>Canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1703
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.950
<v Speaker 6>and they actually are fearful for where </v>
<v Speaker 6>we are in society right now,</v>

1704
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:23.300
<v Speaker 6>but they're frightened to speak out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1705
01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:28.320
<v Speaker 6>and I think bringing that back around to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the charter of rights and freedoms we've</v>

1706
01:27:28.581 --> 01:27:30.020
<v Speaker 6>codified,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1707
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:35.500
<v Speaker 6>preferred,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we've overlooked in that most,</v>

1708
01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.220
<v Speaker 6>most,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1709
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:38.203
<v Speaker 6>trauma and abuse happens within groups </v>
<v Speaker 6>and also the case earlier we started </v>

1710
01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.133
<v Speaker 6>overlooked and it someone because just </v>
<v Speaker 6>because someone said it doesn't mean </v>

1711
01:27:49.281 --> 01:27:51.830
<v Speaker 6>that they're also not a perpetrator.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1712
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:53.330
<v Speaker 6>and that doesn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1713
01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:54.980
<v Speaker 6>a lot of press.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

1714
01:27:55.210 --> 01:27:56.043
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever anyone claims victim status </v>

1715
01:27:57.221 --> 01:27:59.800
<v Speaker 3>without simultaneously claiming </v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetrator status,</v>

1716
01:27:59.801 --> 01:28:00.634
<v Speaker 3>you should run away from that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm a saint and everyone's </v>

1717
01:28:03.491 --> 01:28:04.700
<v Speaker 3>been hurting me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1718
01:28:04.701 --> 01:28:05.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not.</v>

1719
01:28:05.710 --> 01:28:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a saint.</v>

1720
01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.040
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1721
01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:10.443
<v Speaker 3>I doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've imagined you have your fair share </v>

1722
01:28:12.611 --> 01:28:15.640
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of abstract blonde to one of your hands,</v>

1723
01:28:15.641 --> 01:28:16.474
<v Speaker 3>just like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so people need to take </v>

1724
01:28:18.011 --> 01:28:21.040
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for that mean speed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1725
01:28:21.041 --> 01:28:22.930
<v Speaker 3>So just one more</v>

1726
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:24.833
<v Speaker 6>and I'm wondering if what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>just reading now is basically what I </v>

1727
01:28:28.861 --> 01:28:30.270
<v Speaker 6>didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She didn't you decades ago.</v>

1728
01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:31.573
<v Speaker 6>Morning,</v>

1729
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.313
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a catastrophe to lay that bit </v>

1730
01:28:35.301 --> 01:28:38.450
<v Speaker 3>of logical rationality on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>English law.</v>

1731
01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:39.523
<v Speaker 3>Common law system was a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was unnecessary and it is resulting </v>

1732
01:28:44.271 --> 01:28:45.104
<v Speaker 3>in much of what we're seeing today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the codify bill of </v>

1733
01:28:46.941 --> 01:28:50.390
<v Speaker 3>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rights conflict right now,</v>

1734
01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:52.550
<v Speaker 3>English common law dealt with it by just</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1735
01:28:52.551 --> 01:28:54.320
<v Speaker 3>forget we're not a new marine and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn right.</v>

1736
01:28:54.321 --> 01:28:56.450
<v Speaker 3>So you have all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1737
01:28:57.260 --> 01:28:59.120
<v Speaker 3>what problems are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that going to solve it?</v>

1738
01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:00.103
<v Speaker 3>We don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll solve them one by one as they </v>

1739
01:29:02.041 --> 01:29:03.990
<v Speaker 3>emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>

1740
01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:06.570
<v Speaker 3>It's an evolutionary approach to law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Essentially.</v>

1741
01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:11.730
<v Speaker 3>English common law is phenomenal and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>made a huge mistake codifying our rights</v>

1742
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:12.623
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that is part of what's put us </v>

1743
01:29:14.491 --> 01:29:17.390
<v Speaker 3>here and then building in the victim </v>
<v Speaker 3>hood of,</v>

1744
01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.380
<v Speaker 3>of groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a hell of a thing to tell someone</v>

1745
01:29:19.381 --> 01:29:21.270
<v Speaker 3>to your part of the victim group.</v>

1746
01:29:21.650 --> 01:29:24.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so clueless historically too,</v>

1747
01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1748
01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:30.390
<v Speaker 3>that surfs in the Ussr who are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>much all Caucasian.</v>

1749
01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:32.880
<v Speaker 3>They weren't emancipated until the late </v>
<v Speaker 3>18 hundreds.</v>

1750
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:33.743
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't have to go very far back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in anybody's racial history to find the </v>

1751
01:29:38.551 --> 01:29:40.380
<v Speaker 3>equivalent of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1752
01:29:40.381 --> 01:29:41.830
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surfs weren't slaves.</v>

1753
01:29:41.831 --> 01:29:42.171
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1754
01:29:42.171 --> 01:29:43.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>

1755
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.200
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were sold with the property,</v>

1756
01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's 150 years ago.</v>

1757
01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:50.243
<v Speaker 3>Slavery was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slavery was not some exception </v>

1758
01:29:51.961 --> 01:29:54.270
<v Speaker 3>perpetrated on the world by the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

1759
01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:55.104
<v Speaker 3>Every damn society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtually that ever existed up until we </v>

1760
01:29:57.841 --> 01:30:00.630
<v Speaker 3>invented machines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran on slave labor.</v>

1761
01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:02.880
<v Speaker 3>So saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1762
01:30:03.150 --> 01:30:03.983
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some groups have been affected more by </v>

1763
01:30:08.011 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 3>slavery in the recent past than others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's fair to say it,</v>

1764
01:30:11.431 --> 01:30:14.370
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what exactly do you do about that,</v>

1765
01:30:14.371 --> 01:30:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Dan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who defines it to?</v>

1766
01:30:16.530 --> 01:30:17.363
<v Speaker 3>It's a big mess and besides none of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is to be trusted anyways because all it </v>

1767
01:30:20.881 --> 01:30:25.140
<v Speaker 3>is is postmodern deal marks sleight of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

1768
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism got demolished in the seventies.</v>

1769
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.990
<v Speaker 3>Demolished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ruined was never to rise again.</v>

1770
01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:35.760
<v Speaker 3>The postmodernists sneaky friendships </v>
<v Speaker 3>and French intellectuals played a little</v>

1771
01:30:35.761 --> 01:30:36.990
<v Speaker 3>slight of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1772
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:40.620
<v Speaker 3>It's not the working class against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy.</v>

1773
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:44.460
<v Speaker 3>It's the victims against the oppressors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1774
01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:48.120
<v Speaker 3>All we did was move the goalposts </v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly.</v>

1775
01:30:48.121 --> 01:30:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Now we get to play the same game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:30:50.371 --> 01:30:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot easier than thinking.</v>

1777
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:56.800
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>competence.</v>

1778
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:59.640
<v Speaker 3>That's what they thought.</v>

1779
01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:05.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

1780
01:31:05.611 --> 01:31:06.444
<v Speaker 3>I teach about the gulag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Archipelago is my personality class of </v>

1781
01:31:08.391 --> 01:31:11.150
<v Speaker 3>hold the dopey places to teach it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I,</v>

1782
01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:12.510
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning of the class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

1783
01:31:12.511 --> 01:31:14.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of you know that 30 million,</v>

1784
01:31:14.850 --> 01:31:15.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1785
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Soviet citizens were destroyed through </v>
<v Speaker 3>internal repression between 19,</v>

1786
01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:23.410
<v Speaker 3>19 in 1959.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like four people put up their hands</v>

1787
01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:23.791
<v Speaker 3>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1788
01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:26.370
<v Speaker 3>how do you know I watched your lectures </v>
<v Speaker 3>on youtube?</v>

1789
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:28.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not taught in school.</v>

1790
01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know why.</v>

1791
01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:34.710
<v Speaker 3>It's because the bloody intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftists have never apologized for their</v>

1792
01:31:34.711 --> 01:31:38.760
<v Speaker 3>complicity in the catastrophes of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>20th century for Germans,</v>

1793
01:31:38.761 --> 01:31:42.900
<v Speaker 3>apologized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry about the Nazis with the left wing</v>

1794
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:43.830
<v Speaker 3>intellectuals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

1795
01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:44.820
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that was real.</v>

1796
01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.530
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't real Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

1797
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.310
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1798
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:48.143
<v Speaker 3>How many carbs is have to pile up around</v>
<v Speaker 3>you before you're willing to question </v>

1799
01:31:51.541 --> 01:31:53.560
<v Speaker 3>your beloved it?</v>

1800
01:31:53.630 --> 01:31:54.463
<v Speaker 3>Theological presuppositions and face </v>
<v Speaker 3>your resentment and your narcissism and </v>

1801
01:31:59.411 --> 01:32:03.040
<v Speaker 3>your desire for destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't like people anyways.</v>

1802
01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:06.760
<v Speaker 3>The planet has too many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like a nice warm.</v>

1803
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I cleared that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then all the plants can grow again.</v>

1804
01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:11.983
<v Speaker 3>You know the club of Rome and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about the population explosion </v>

1805
01:32:14.621 --> 01:32:16.720
<v Speaker 3>that was going to wipe out the planet by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the year 2000.</v>

1806
01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:19.600
<v Speaker 3>They say outright that human beings were</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cancer on the planet.</v>

1807
01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:21.460
<v Speaker 3>Lots of people think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1808
01:32:21.490 --> 01:32:22.323
<v Speaker 3>oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>next put the atom bomb a phone in your </v>

1809
01:32:24.971 --> 01:32:27.940
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings are a cancer on the planet.</v>

1810
01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:32.320
<v Speaker 3>What a hell of a thing to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying that to a four year old,</v>

1811
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:33.423
<v Speaker 3>I saw bloody professor at Queen's </v>
<v Speaker 3>University tell a whole room full of 18 </v>

1812
01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:40.210
<v Speaker 3>year olds that if they had an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 3>fiber in their body,</v>

1813
01:32:40.211 --> 01:32:41.044
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't have any kids or they'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>only have one because all they're doing </v>

1814
01:32:43.631 --> 01:32:45.640
<v Speaker 3>is going out there raping the planet.</v>

1815
01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:47.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1816
01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:48.850
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell?</v>

1817
01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.770
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand that.</v>

1818
01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:53.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like human beings are hard on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

1819
01:32:53.051 --> 01:32:55.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty damn hard on us in </v>
<v Speaker 3>return,</v>

1820
01:32:55.301 --> 01:32:56.134
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're just sort of trying not </v>

1821
01:32:57.251 --> 01:33:00.100
<v Speaker 3>to die to miserably and we make a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mess.</v>

1822
01:33:00.101 --> 01:33:00.811
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

1823
01:33:00.811 --> 01:33:01.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1824
01:33:02.050 --> 01:33:02.883
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've only known for 50 years that we </v>

1825
01:33:04.241 --> 01:33:07.990
<v Speaker 3>were disrupting the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How fast do you think we can learn?</v>

1826
01:33:08.730 --> 01:33:10.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 years ago,</v>

1827
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a great biologist,</v>

1828
01:33:12.981 --> 01:33:15.870
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oceans are so plentiful.</v>

1829
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:18.190
<v Speaker 3>It was not a chance we could ever put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dam in them.</v>

1830
01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.220
<v Speaker 3>So I was only 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty years ago we thought,</v>

1831
01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:22.054
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more of us and we're better at </v>

1832
01:33:23.081 --> 01:33:24.640
<v Speaker 3>this than we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1833
01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:27.130
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how fast do you expect people to learn?</v>

1834
01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:29.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one generation,</v>

1835
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:32.020
<v Speaker 3>one year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to do our best.</v>

1836
01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:32.883
<v Speaker 3>Most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people are trying to do their best </v>

1837
01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:37.330
<v Speaker 3>and some people are trying to do their </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst,</v>

1838
01:33:37.331 --> 01:33:38.164
<v Speaker 3>but most people are trying to do their </v>
<v Speaker 3>best and so we should have a little </v>

1839
01:33:40.541 --> 01:33:43.060
<v Speaker 3>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little sympathy for human beings instead</v>

1840
01:33:43.061 --> 01:33:47.260
<v Speaker 3>of considering ourselves like raping </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal,</v>

1841
01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.510
<v Speaker 3>oppressive destroyers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of the world,</v>

1842
01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't like that label.</v>

1843
01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.560
<v Speaker 3>So cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so mean.</v>

1844
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:57.191
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1845
01:33:57.191 --> 01:33:58.024
<v Speaker 3>It has no sympathy there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like most of the people I know are </v>

1846
01:34:00.911 --> 01:34:03.010
<v Speaker 3>struggling hard to get fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually.</v>

1847
01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:06.310
<v Speaker 3>The other thing about people that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting and you really learn this if</v>

1848
01:34:06.311 --> 01:34:07.144
<v Speaker 3>you're a clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that every single one of you in this </v>

1849
01:34:09.881 --> 01:34:14.020
<v Speaker 3>room has at least one serious problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're laboring under,</v>

1850
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:17.200
<v Speaker 3>and that's why the whole handicap thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a big problem as well.</v>

1851
01:34:17.201 --> 01:34:18.460
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1852
01:34:18.461 --> 01:34:21.730
<v Speaker 3>you're not mentally ill this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you will be.</v>

1853
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:22.743
<v Speaker 3>You'll be depressed or anxious or you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit some trauma in your life that'll </v>

1854
01:34:25.121 --> 01:34:25.954
<v Speaker 3>take you out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even if you happen to be in the </v>

1855
01:34:27.491 --> 01:34:28.324
<v Speaker 3>small minority of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically healthy their whole life and </v>

1856
01:34:30.491 --> 01:34:33.070
<v Speaker 3>emotionally healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have a family member,</v>

1857
01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.420
<v Speaker 3>a child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a parent,</v>

1858
01:34:34.421 --> 01:34:37.750
<v Speaker 3>a parent with Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a child who's got some illness.</v>

1859
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.823
<v Speaker 3>You know you're going to be carrying </v>
<v Speaker 3>some vicious burden for most of your </v>

1860
01:34:41.621 --> 01:34:42.454
<v Speaker 3>life and most of the time you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to stumble off the work anyhow and do </v>

1861
01:34:46.961 --> 01:34:50.920
<v Speaker 3>your damn job and contribute to society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I can never,</v>

1862
01:34:50.921 --> 01:34:51.754
<v Speaker 3>I can't even believe that our system </v>
<v Speaker 3>works because you just have to talk to </v>

1863
01:34:54.671 --> 01:34:56.350
<v Speaker 3>someone for five minutes and they tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1864
01:34:56.351 --> 01:34:57.184
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the three horrible things that </v>

1865
01:34:58.521 --> 01:35:01.850
<v Speaker 3>happened to me in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're horrible things.</v>

1866
01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Their mother died of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1867
01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:08.000
<v Speaker 3>some degenerative neurological disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are particularly entertaining.</v>

1868
01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:11.390
<v Speaker 3>And their father was alcoholic and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to beat them up and their sisters,</v>

1869
01:35:11.391 --> 01:35:13.130
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like</v>

1870
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:15.583
<v Speaker 3>right away they go and do their minor </v>
<v Speaker 3>hero wisdom for the day and the light </v>

1871
01:35:18.261 --> 01:35:19.250
<v Speaker 3>stay on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1872
01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:20.773
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings were admirable creatures </v>

1873
01:35:22.281 --> 01:35:23.690
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1874
01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:27.650
<v Speaker 3>finite and useless and vicious and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those things.</v>

1875
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:28.484
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1876
01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.850
<v Speaker 5>it did</v>
<v Speaker 5>incorporate</v>

1877
01:35:38.490 --> 01:35:42.780
<v Speaker 5>physician suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should I tell him what to do?</v>

1878
01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:48.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should pay very careful attention to</v>

1879
01:35:48.161 --> 01:35:48.994
<v Speaker 3>their definitions of diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to pay careful </v>

1880
01:35:51.881 --> 01:35:55.840
<v Speaker 3>attention to the criteria by which you </v>
<v Speaker 3>choose people.</v>

1881
01:35:56.230 --> 01:35:57.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

1882
01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.353
<v Speaker 3>that's an extraordinarily difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>question because it's a personnel </v>

1883
01:36:00.161 --> 01:36:00.994
<v Speaker 3>selection,</v>

1884
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:02.203
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1885
01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.400
<v Speaker 3>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things I would say is,</v>

1886
01:36:04.401 --> 01:36:05.234
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're looking for managers and </v>

1887
01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:07.760
<v Speaker 3>administrators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screenings for conscientiousness,</v>

1888
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:11.090
<v Speaker 3>you get about a point two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five point three correlation.</v>

1889
01:36:11.130 --> 01:36:13.130
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's nothing that's wrong.</v>

1890
01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:15.800
<v Speaker 3>It switches your probability of hiring </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1891
01:36:16.290 --> 01:36:21.290
<v Speaker 3>an above average employee from 50 slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>50 to 67 point five slash 32 point five.</v>

1892
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:24.710
<v Speaker 3>If it's a point three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three zero,</v>

1893
01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:25.880
<v Speaker 3>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1894
01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:26.713
<v Speaker 3>60 5:35 point three zero correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because there's massive variability </v>

1895
01:36:32.181 --> 01:36:34.280
<v Speaker 3>in the productivity of individuals </v>
<v Speaker 3>tilting,</v>

1896
01:36:34.281 --> 01:36:37.100
<v Speaker 3>your selection up to that degree will </v>
<v Speaker 3>have massive,</v>

1897
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:40.620
<v Speaker 3>massive economic payoffs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done the calculation.</v>

1898
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:45.050
<v Speaker 3>There are crazy and there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no bias in a conscientiousness.</v>

1899
01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:45.893
<v Speaker 3>Tests</v>

1900
01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:52.200
<v Speaker 5>test for hiring for that.</v>

1901
01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.810
<v Speaker 3>When the court says the board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the board</v>

1902
01:37:03.190 --> 01:37:04.023
<v Speaker 3>during the diversity officer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you might do is track </v>

1903
01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:11.900
<v Speaker 3>the shifting ratio of men versus women </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the corporation.</v>

1904
01:37:11.901 --> 01:37:15.080
<v Speaker 3>But that's the sort of thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>requires a micro analysis.</v>

1905
01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Know like there's going to be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly.</v>

1906
01:37:17.781 --> 01:37:18.614
<v Speaker 3>There are many disciplines where women </v>
<v Speaker 3>are overrepresented at every single </v>

1907
01:37:21.591 --> 01:37:23.630
<v Speaker 3>level that's happening in university so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast.</v>

1908
01:37:23.631 --> 01:37:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Don't be a damn man left in the Faculty </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Arts and science at 10 years.</v>

1909
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for all you women who are looking for</v>

1910
01:37:29.061 --> 01:37:29.894
<v Speaker 3>mates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you better be thinking about that </v>

1911
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:33.320
<v Speaker 3>because when men of bailing out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>university so fast,</v>

1912
01:37:33.321 --> 01:37:34.970
<v Speaker 3>you cannot believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1913
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:35.833
<v Speaker 3>I've watched the curves for 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so linear up for women linear down for </v>

1914
01:37:39.571 --> 01:37:41.570
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you can think,</v>

1915
01:37:41.571 --> 01:37:43.280
<v Speaker 3>well that's really good for women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

1916
01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.260
<v Speaker 3>that's so clueless is there can't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that's bad for men.</v>

1917
01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:52.820
<v Speaker 3>That's good for women and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know another thing too.</v>

1918
01:37:52.821 --> 01:37:54.450
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So back to the board,</v>

1919
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:55.303
<v Speaker 3>you have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1920
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:59.700
<v Speaker 3>the what's the industry?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that map onto the valid natural</v>

1921
01:37:59.701 --> 01:38:00.534
<v Speaker 3>interests of men and women?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any evidence that we're hiring </v>

1922
01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:04.644
<v Speaker 3>stupidly and the mere fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have as many women or as many men </v>

1923
01:38:07.891 --> 01:38:12.600
<v Speaker 3>in one place versus another doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicate therefore that your prejudice,</v>

1924
01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:15.300
<v Speaker 3>you have to buy the equity argument to </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy that.</v>

1925
01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:17.970
<v Speaker 3>And if you buy the equity argument while</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're done with anyway,</v>

1926
01:38:17.971 --> 01:38:18.804
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so because you're going to fall down </v>

1927
01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:21.870
<v Speaker 3>that spiral move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never get out of it,</v>

1928
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:24.930
<v Speaker 3>you'll never hit equity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a chance.</v>

1929
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Now a lot of these corporations are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it out of guilt and fear.</v>

1930
01:38:29.461 --> 01:38:31.890
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said that people are afraid to speak</v>

1931
01:38:31.891 --> 01:38:32.724
<v Speaker 3>up for Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have no idea how afraid people </v>

1932
01:38:34.501 --> 01:38:35.334
<v Speaker 3>are to speak up.</v>

1933
01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:37.560
<v Speaker 3>And it's actually no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1934
01:38:37.561 --> 01:38:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I've made those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like I got hit by a tidal wave.</v>

1935
01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:43.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it freaked me right out and still does.</v>

1936
01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.750
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's been.</v>

1937
01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:46.584
<v Speaker 3>I would say overall it's been good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not necessarily the kind of </v>

1938
01:38:49.741 --> 01:38:52.920
<v Speaker 3>good you would wish on someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of would like to have my old life</v>

1939
01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:54.570
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whatever,</v>

1940
01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew what was coming.</v>

1941
01:38:56.491 --> 01:39:01.020
<v Speaker 3>So it was only a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But people are so afraid to speak up.</v>

1942
01:39:01.021 --> 01:39:04.110
<v Speaker 3>You just cannot believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tenured professors,</v>

1943
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:09.030
<v Speaker 3>those are the most protected people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe and they're afraid to speak</v>

1944
01:39:09.031 --> 01:39:09.864
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that tells you a lot about what </v>

1945
01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:13.290
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I should tell you,</v>

1946
01:39:13.291 --> 01:39:16.080
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be afraid to speak up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll tell you something else.</v>

1947
01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.270
<v Speaker 3>You should be more afraid not to speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1948
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:22.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're screwed both ways.</v>

1949
01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:23.483
<v Speaker 3>Pick your poison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can either suffer the consequences </v>

1950
01:39:26.881 --> 01:39:31.380
<v Speaker 3>of having a voice or you can suffer the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of not having a voice.</v>

1951
01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:35.370
<v Speaker 3>And I would highly recommend that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't pick the suffering that goes along</v>

1952
01:39:35.371 --> 01:39:40.020
<v Speaker 3>with not having a voice that's dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you might say,</v>

1953
01:39:40.021 --> 01:39:41.010
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't speak up,</v>

1954
01:39:41.011 --> 01:39:41.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1955
01:39:41.971 --> 01:39:44.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are for for the next 15 minutes,</v>

1956
01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.630
<v Speaker 3>but you sacrificed a bit of your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might need that thing to get through</v>

1957
01:39:48.631 --> 01:39:51.420
<v Speaker 3>life without getting all bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>twisted and resentful.</v>

1958
01:39:51.930 --> 01:39:55.920
<v Speaker 3>So if you've got something to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even to your board,</v>

1959
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:59.580
<v Speaker 3>you say it and you don't know what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to happen,</v>

1960
01:39:59.850 --> 01:40:01.470
<v Speaker 3>it might be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be good.</v>

1961
01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:05.340
<v Speaker 3>Like silence has exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

1962
01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:06.923
<v Speaker 3>So and Dr Peterson's hiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they get rid of it or they're </v>

1963
01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.313
<v Speaker 3>hiring to replace me there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not by the way the university is backed </v>

1964
01:40:14.401 --> 01:40:15.234
<v Speaker 3>off completely and I'm sure that was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big part of because of the older public </v>

1965
01:40:19.351 --> 01:40:20.790
<v Speaker 3>support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1966
01:40:20.791 --> 01:40:21.624
<v Speaker 3>not that I mean I'm not trying to paint </v>
<v Speaker 3>them as evil villains because they're </v>

1967
01:40:24.010 --> 01:40:24.843
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1968
01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:25.943
<v Speaker 3>But also the students were very </v>
<v Speaker 3>welcoming to me when I came back to </v>

1969
01:40:28.321 --> 01:40:29.154
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a big deal because I was very </v>

1970
01:40:30.571 --> 01:40:33.240
<v Speaker 3>nervous when I came back to class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like very nervous.</v>

1971
01:40:33.330 --> 01:40:34.163
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what the hell was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen or even if I was going to come </v>

1972
01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:37.980
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1973
01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:39.293
<v Speaker 3>But</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one more question or two </v>

1974
01:40:43.321 --> 01:40:44.720
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Colorado.</v>

1975
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:49.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Difficult for you to say</v>

1976
01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:55.323
<v Speaker 6>you would not recommend that today's you</v>
<v Speaker 6>attended university in the traditional </v>

1977
01:40:59.021 --> 01:41:00.130
<v Speaker 6>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1978
01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.193
<v Speaker 6>so I to know what advice you would have </v>
<v Speaker 6>for people as far into the clinical </v>

1979
01:41:04.511 --> 01:41:09.100
<v Speaker 6>psychologist or want to pursue any </v>
<v Speaker 6>further education.</v>

1980
01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Don't take any nonsense.</v>

1981
01:41:18.170 --> 01:41:19.003
<v Speaker 3>Read the damn classics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know in clinical psychology </v>

1982
01:41:21.291 --> 01:41:24.170
<v Speaker 3>programs here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're reading that bloody waiting,</v>

1983
01:41:24.171 --> 01:41:28.190
<v Speaker 3>derald sue or whatever his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a microaggression guy.</v>

1984
01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:29.493
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1985
01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:31.880
<v Speaker 3>here's how you do cross cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>counseling,</v>

1986
01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:34.760
<v Speaker 3>so I know that that's a bunch of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't do.</v>

1987
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:35.421
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1988
01:41:35.421 --> 01:41:36.254
<v Speaker 3>that's what the books are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's things that you shouldn't do if </v>

1989
01:41:37.911 --> 01:41:40.190
<v Speaker 3>you're doing cross cultural constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's helpful,</v>

1990
01:41:40.191 --> 01:41:42.800
<v Speaker 3>but what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reading Freud,</v>

1991
01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:44.360
<v Speaker 3>read young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read Adler,</v>

1992
01:41:44.361 --> 01:41:45.380
<v Speaker 3>greed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogers,</v>

1993
01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:46.233
<v Speaker 3>read mass up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people knew what the hell they </v>

1994
01:41:48.051 --> 01:41:50.570
<v Speaker 3>were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The behaviors get,</v>

1995
01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.960
<v Speaker 3>get yourself educated with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience.</v>

1996
01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:55.333
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of great things out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>to read and if your professors are too </v>

1997
01:41:57.531 --> 01:41:59.720
<v Speaker 3>stupid to teach you what they should </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach you with you,</v>

1998
01:41:59.830 --> 01:42:02.210
<v Speaker 3>you got to educate yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>university anyways,</v>

1999
01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:04.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2000
01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:06.230
<v Speaker 3>so that's what I would recommend.</v>

2001
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:09.090
<v Speaker 3>The institution is corrupt always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>

2002
01:42:09.170 --> 01:42:11.850
<v Speaker 3>you're lucky you're lucky if you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>graduate,</v>

2003
01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:14.900
<v Speaker 3>graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one in five classes is really worth</v>

2004
01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:16.190
<v Speaker 3>taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2005
01:42:17.210 --> 01:42:18.043
<v Speaker 3>you can't get too cynical about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things don't necessarily work all that </v>

2006
01:42:21.261 --> 01:42:23.720
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are great things to read.</v>

2007
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:26.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>radio don't turn you inside out,</v>

2008
01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:28.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read nature.</v>

2009
01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.740
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of great thinkers there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2010
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:31.583
<v Speaker 3>you have to read them intelligently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People squawk about nature because he </v>

2011
01:42:33.741 --> 01:42:36.320
<v Speaker 3>was slightly misogynistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2012
01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:37.790
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was sick.</v>

2013
01:42:37.791 --> 01:42:38.624
<v Speaker 3>He could hardly even see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can only write like one sentence at </v>

2014
01:42:40.701 --> 01:42:42.470
<v Speaker 3>a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lived alone.</v>

2015
01:42:42.770 --> 01:42:45.530
<v Speaker 3>He didn't get along with women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were always rejecting them,</v>

2016
01:42:45.710 --> 01:42:49.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the same thing to do with the women.</v>

2017
01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:52.070
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't know if anyone ever was </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever going to read what he wrote.</v>

2018
01:42:52.071 --> 01:42:54.920
<v Speaker 3>He sold like 500 copies of beyond good </v>
<v Speaker 3>and evil.</v>

2019
01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now when they did go to Noida,</v>

2020
01:42:57.090 --> 01:43:00.740
<v Speaker 3>didn't wrote something snippy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Jesus gave the guy a break,</v>

2021
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:04.760
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you read Freud as well,</v>

2022
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:07.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff's dated so you have to adjust</v>

2023
01:43:07.731 --> 01:43:12.150
<v Speaker 3>your reading for the context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when someone comes across a slate of</v>

2024
01:43:12.170 --> 01:43:14.500
<v Speaker 3>mysogeny mystic statement and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2025
01:43:14.501 --> 01:43:17.450
<v Speaker 3>well I'm not reading this person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they're saying is they're too stupid</v>

2026
01:43:17.451 --> 01:43:20.000
<v Speaker 3>to separate the wheat from the chaff or </v>
<v Speaker 3>too lazy.</v>

2027
01:43:20.001 --> 01:43:20.451
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2028
01:43:20.451 --> 01:43:22.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to read nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a relief,</v>

2029
01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.290
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

2030
01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:26.653
<v Speaker 3>So I was thinking more about parents who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are trying to make a decision to send </v>

2031
01:43:30.021 --> 01:43:31.820
<v Speaker 3>their kids to university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

2032
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:39.490
<v Speaker 3>so much of it is corrupt social work and</v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropology,</v>

2033
01:43:40.270 --> 01:43:42.910
<v Speaker 3>social psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>

2034
01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:47.260
<v Speaker 3>English literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A huge chunk of the humanities,</v>

2035
01:43:47.261 --> 01:43:48.094
<v Speaker 3>which is absolute catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The humanities school universities are </v>

2036
01:43:50.441 --> 01:43:54.830
<v Speaker 3>done because they're the sole of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities technical training.</v>

2037
01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:56.153
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can be trained technically in all </v>

2038
01:43:57.111 --> 01:43:57.944
<v Speaker 3>sorts of other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incorporations are starting to figure </v>

2039
01:43:59.211 --> 01:44:02.560
<v Speaker 3>this out fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we lose the humanities.</v>

2040
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:03.403
<v Speaker 3>The universities are gone and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>losing them fast because all they do is </v>

2041
01:44:06.471 --> 01:44:10.040
<v Speaker 3>teach you identity politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

2042
01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:13.460
<v Speaker 3>you can learn the rules that came in one</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

2043
01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:14.893
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Divide the world into oppressed and </v>

2044
01:44:16.551 --> 01:44:17.960
<v Speaker 3>oppressor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's easy,</v>

2045
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:19.130
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a snap.</v>

2046
01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:20.563
<v Speaker 3>Assume the old presses are the bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the oppressed or the good </v>

2047
01:44:22.701 --> 01:44:24.110
<v Speaker 3>people that's easy.</v>

2048
01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Make noise about it and feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's basically that.</v>

2049
01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:33.500
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't pay any attention to your role.</v>

2050
01:44:35.710 --> 01:44:36.543
<v Speaker 3>So $2,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>while in the university is a for a big </v>

2051
01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:43.910
<v Speaker 3>shakeup because they don't know what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to hit them with,</v>

2052
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:44.833
<v Speaker 3>with youtube and online lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got no idea what's coming down </v>

2053
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:50.260
<v Speaker 3>the pipes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so because it,</v>

2054
01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 3>because online lectures are powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond belief and someone who's going to</v>

2055
01:44:54.501 --> 01:44:57.350
<v Speaker 3>sort out the accreditation for all in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next four or five years,</v>

2056
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:59.180
<v Speaker 3>a couple universities off at their </v>
<v Speaker 3>knees,</v>

2057
01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.530
<v Speaker 3>so certainly going to come within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next 10 years.</v>

2058
01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:04.510
<v Speaker 3>My question</v>

2059
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:09.510
<v Speaker 6>for is as a training therapist for her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do you think that that might bags?</v>

2060
01:45:11.770 --> 01:45:14.490
<v Speaker 6>That's the process of therapy.</v>

2061
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it puts you in there with all sorts of a</v>

2062
01:45:17.521 --> 01:45:18.354
<v Speaker 3>priori axioms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know one of the things I really liked </v>

2063
01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.073
<v Speaker 3>Carl Rogers and one of the things Rogers</v>
<v Speaker 3>does is listen to what you do as a </v>

2064
01:45:27.781 --> 01:45:28.614
<v Speaker 3>therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The better you aren't listening to </v>

2065
01:45:30.211 --> 01:45:31.044
<v Speaker 3>pastor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your clients will get better and you </v>

2066
01:45:32.131 --> 01:45:36.000
<v Speaker 3>have to listen without prejudice and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't mean that in the technical sense.</v>

2067
01:45:36.001 --> 01:45:36.541
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2068
01:45:36.541 --> 01:45:38.660
<v Speaker 3>so I'm listening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I don't know what you're going</v>

2069
01:45:38.661 --> 01:45:43.590
<v Speaker 3>to say and I don't know if you're right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not going to tell you what to do</v>

2070
01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:44.603
<v Speaker 3>because I don't know what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's something about being a </v>

2071
01:45:47.131 --> 01:45:47.964
<v Speaker 3>therapist is like you do not want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell people what to do because that's </v>

2072
01:45:51.211 --> 01:45:52.044
<v Speaker 3>their life that you might screw it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you want to do is listen to </v>

2073
01:45:55.471 --> 01:45:58.230
<v Speaker 3>them very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very carefully and let them unwind their</v>

2074
01:45:58.231 --> 01:45:59.040
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

2075
01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.200
<v Speaker 3>And most of them they'll take care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

2076
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:02.383
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because no one's listened to them so </v>

2077
01:46:04.021 --> 01:46:04.854
<v Speaker 3>they don't even know what they think </v>
<v Speaker 3>their head is full of jumbled mess of </v>

2078
01:46:08.281 --> 01:46:09.114
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's like a tangling of knots </v>

2079
01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:17.070
<v Speaker 3>and maybe the person needs to talk for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like three years to sort it all out.</v>

2080
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:21.090
<v Speaker 3>And what you should do is listen to them</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a different culture,</v>

2081
01:46:21.091 --> 01:46:21.924
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's going to be friction </v>

2082
01:46:22.651 --> 01:46:25.710
<v Speaker 3>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you'll come out at least to some</v>

2083
01:46:25.711 --> 01:46:27.360
<v Speaker 3>degree with different assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

2084
01:46:28.890 --> 01:46:31.910
<v Speaker 3>read the damn therapists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people were smart.</v>

2085
01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:32.973
<v Speaker 3>They tell you things about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each of them gives you a different </v>

2086
01:46:34.831 --> 01:46:37.290
<v Speaker 3>toolbox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not scientific theories.</v>

2087
01:46:37.291 --> 01:46:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as a clinician,</v>

2088
01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:40.710
<v Speaker 3>you're not a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a.</v>

2089
01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:44.610
<v Speaker 3>you're an engineer of the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a better way of thinking about it</v>

2090
01:46:44.611 --> 01:46:45.870
<v Speaker 3>because it's an applied.</v>

2091
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:48.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an applied science,</v>

2092
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:50.700
<v Speaker 3>so makes it not a science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2093
01:46:50.701 --> 01:46:55.701
<v Speaker 3>You can use scientific knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're still aiming at the good,</v>

2094
01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:57.173
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're doing as a therapist </v>

2095
01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:00.090
<v Speaker 3>with the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>

2096
01:47:00.091 --> 01:47:00.924
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already know that things aren't as </v>

2097
01:47:02.731 --> 01:47:03.564
<v Speaker 3>good for you as they need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to work on that and you're </v>

2098
01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.073
<v Speaker 3>here to make things better and I'm here </v>
<v Speaker 3>to help you figure out how to make </v>

2099
01:47:09.991 --> 01:47:10.824
<v Speaker 3>things better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll listen to you and we'll move </v>

2100
01:47:13.171 --> 01:47:14.004
<v Speaker 3>toward some place that's lighter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and and then you have tools that </v>

2101
01:47:18.211 --> 01:47:19.044
<v Speaker 3>you can use in that kind of analytical </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening process and the great </v>

2102
01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.830
<v Speaker 3>psychotherapists math.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people have their 10,000 hours,</v>

2103
01:47:25.831 --> 01:47:26.664
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all come at it from slightly </v>

2104
01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:28.674
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Temperamental perspectives like young's </v>

2105
01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:33.300
<v Speaker 3>work is really useful for dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are high in openness.</v>

2106
01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:36.810
<v Speaker 3>So his whole philosophy is you have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>open client,</v>

2107
01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:39.870
<v Speaker 3>you'll works if you have a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 3>clients,</v>

2108
01:47:39.871 --> 01:47:41.160
<v Speaker 3>forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2109
01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:42.330
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole different thing.</v>

2110
01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:44.323
<v Speaker 6>What I'm hearing from you is that that </v>
<v Speaker 6>postmodern stance is helpful for the </v>

2111
01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:49.613
<v Speaker 6>therapy from off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from what you're saying is that listen </v>

2112
01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:53.780
<v Speaker 6>and that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're not giving an absolute truth</v>

2113
01:47:53.781 --> 01:47:55.190
<v Speaker 6>to these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to these clients.</v>

2114
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is the postmodern thing </v>

2115
01:47:57.601 --> 01:48:00.090
<v Speaker 3>works out pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they keep asking it in Marxism.</v>

2116
01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2117
01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:06.170
<v Speaker 3>but their primary identity is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is is like sex or gender or ethnicity or</v>

2118
01:48:06.811 --> 01:48:07.740
<v Speaker 3>race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2119
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:08.940
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

2120
01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:10.373
<v Speaker 3>we're not going there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not exactly postmodernism </v>

2121
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:14.753
<v Speaker 3>because the postmodernists are </v>
<v Speaker 3>misinformed about the nature of </v>

2122
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:19.103
<v Speaker 3>scientific theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they don't really see them as </v>

2123
01:48:21.121 --> 01:48:21.954
<v Speaker 3>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I see the best tools and so you can </v>

2124
01:48:24.781 --> 01:48:27.670
<v Speaker 3>have a diverse range of tools and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't eat.</v>

2125
01:48:28.050 --> 01:48:32.730
<v Speaker 3>Each one doesn't have to claim a pistol </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological or ontological priority,</v>

2126
01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:33.953
<v Speaker 3>but that means that you have to view </v>
<v Speaker 3>those sorts of theories as tools that </v>

2127
01:48:36.481 --> 01:48:40.310
<v Speaker 3>makes you a pragmatist post modernists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2128
01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:42.190
<v Speaker 3>and speaking of patients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2129
01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.353
<v Speaker 2>in an hour or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few things I want to wrap up now just </v>

2130
01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:47.313
<v Speaker 2>to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said this earlier today and first of </v>

2131
01:48:50.051 --> 01:48:50.884
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons I really wanted to </v>

2132
01:48:51.101 --> 01:48:53.290
<v Speaker 2>have Dr Peterson comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and first of all,</v>

2133
01:48:53.291 --> 01:48:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Cirina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you very much for arranging that.</v>

2134
01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:56.081
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she did.</v>

2135
01:48:56.081 --> 01:48:58.410
<v Speaker 2>She said that she wants to go to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>you come in and say,</v>

2136
01:48:58.411 --> 01:48:59.244
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2137
01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:01.380
<v Speaker 2>And she did it until he really </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate a serene.</v>

2138
01:49:01.381 --> 01:49:02.510
<v Speaker 2>It'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially Dr Peterson,</v>

2139
01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:10.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have preferred to have broadcast</v>

2140
01:49:10.611 --> 01:49:14.570
<v Speaker 2>as widely known what I want all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson haters to come in.</v>

2141
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I want you to have a chance to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually face to face,</v>

2142
01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:21.770
<v Speaker 2>confront what you're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be ignorant,</v>

2143
01:49:21.771 --> 01:49:25.050
<v Speaker 2>don't just impose your own beliefs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your biases and everything onto what you</v>

2144
01:49:25.051 --> 01:49:25.884
<v Speaker 2>were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually hear process and come to a </v>

2145
01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:32.000
<v Speaker 2>reality and fact based conclusion about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that you're trying to promote</v>

2146
01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.073
<v Speaker 2>because in today's society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly everything you've been talking </v>

2147
01:49:34.791 --> 01:49:36.530
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's like verbally.</v>

2148
01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that we are going down a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous path.</v>

2149
01:49:38.421 --> 01:49:39.254
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing the consequences of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've been in all my students know </v>

2150
01:49:41.931 --> 01:49:44.510
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have been promoting this in therapy.</v>

2151
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like glasses and my family,</v>

2152
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:47.853
<v Speaker 2>this idea that you need to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>expose yourself to things that make you </v>

2153
01:49:50.411 --> 01:49:52.420
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not aware of.</v>
