00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.423
<v Speaker 1>Bark is hard to listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to listen to his pieces over </v>

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least I do.</v>

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't suppose you have to if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>musical genius,</v>

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>but because goal interpreted them </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.673
<v Speaker 1>it was easier to take the music apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and understand in an auditory way what </v>

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.433
<v Speaker 1>Bach was trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music helps demonstrate the reality of </v>

7
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>meaning and it does that for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does that.</v>

8
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>For people who are deeply atheistic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even nihilistic,</v>

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.253
<v Speaker 1>and that's interesting too because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take bitterly disaffected punk </v>

10
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:32.184
<v Speaker 1>rockers and they listen to music and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're overwhelmed by a sense of it's </v>

11
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>really a sense of religious meaning they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even notice it except that without</v>

12
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>it they'd be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people who are low in openness,</v>

13
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.344
<v Speaker 1>which is a psychological trait and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty opaque to what art </v>

14
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.423
<v Speaker 1>represents and so they have a hard time </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it or maybe they need more less </v>

15
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated art.</v>

16
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>It's too shocking to them if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated in and profound,</v>

17
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.703
<v Speaker 1>they can't handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people are terrified by art and </v>

18
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>they like things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like music.</v>

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>They like catch because if it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too much for them.</v>

20
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>They're terrified of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>

21
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>isn't that they don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that they can't handle it.</v>

23
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid of people are even afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of color.</v>

24
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why everybody uses Bayesian.</v>

25
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>They're decorating and creams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:23.674
<v Speaker 1>they're terrified of color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people are terrified of deep truths </v>

27
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.103
<v Speaker 1>and wonder so they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't be deep if they weren't </v>

28
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we look at the world,</v>

29
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:38.361
<v Speaker 1>we see objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handleable and usable objects in motion,</v>

30
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't really what the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

31
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:46.911
<v Speaker 1>What the world is like is a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interlocking and interconnected patterns</v>

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.073
<v Speaker 1>at multiple levels of resolution from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tiniest to the largest all playing </v>

33
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>together in a patterned and somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable manner,</v>

34
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>not completely predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like music isn't completely predictable,</v>

35
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.623
<v Speaker 1>and so the reason that music is </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful when you listen to it is </v>

36
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:03.204
<v Speaker 1>because music demonstrates to you what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the university is </v>

37
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Speaker 1>actually like and your senses.</v>

38
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Your visual sense blinds you to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's more practical in a way.</v>

39
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>It shows you what you need to live right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

40
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.373
<v Speaker 1>whereas music gives you this sculptural </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of quantized patterns </v>

41
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>interacting at multiple levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis simultaneously,</v>

42
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>and that infuses people with a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning are truly artistic.</v>

43
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:34.611
<v Speaker 1>Production is full of inarticulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning it's inarticulate because it's.</v>

44
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.753
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still in the developmental stage </v>

45
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:41.454
<v Speaker 1>before articulate knowledge and so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>grips people with a sense of </v>

46
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.414
<v Speaker 1>significance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't necessarily say why and </v>

47
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:49.194
<v Speaker 1>the reason they can't say yes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the why for that kind of meaning hasn't </v>

48
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>been explicated yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that art</v>

49
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>is meaningful to people is because art </v>
<v Speaker 1>is meaningful.</v>

50
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.143
<v Speaker 1>It's full of the next set of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking about it or </v>

51
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:06.814
<v Speaker 1>it's or it's full of eternal ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people still haven't fully comprehended </v>

52
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>and so you can't help but be gripped by </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
