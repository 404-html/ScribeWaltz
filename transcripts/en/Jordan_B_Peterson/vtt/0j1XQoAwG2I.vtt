1
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.603
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to talk to you today about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a different way of looking at what real </v>

2
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to figure out what real is</v>

3
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:20.434
<v Speaker 1>because we don't really have infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and so we're always making </v>

4
00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:27.961
<v Speaker 1>some sets of presuppositions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's most real and really matters what</v>

5
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 1>you assume is most real because you base</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decisions that you make that run the</v>

6
00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>entire course of your life on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions,</v>

7
00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:36.154
<v Speaker 1>whether you recognize it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you get the assumptions wrong or </v>

8
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>even if you leave them in complete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pay a big price for it.</v>

9
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.463
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 1>the assumptions that we use in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

11
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>although they've enabled us to develop a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously potent technology,</v>

12
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.620
<v Speaker 1>are incomplete in ways that have also </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost us in,</v>

13
00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:04.621
<v Speaker 1>that are extremely dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the scientific age began.</v>

14
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.663
<v Speaker 1>We've lived in a universe where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom strata of reality is considered </v>

15
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.800
<v Speaker 1>to be something that's dead like dirt.</v>

16
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's objective,</v>

17
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>external,</v>

18
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.553
<v Speaker 1>and there isn't any element of it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lends any reality to phenomena like </v>

19
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:35.194
<v Speaker 1>meaning or purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all been relegated to this </v>

20
00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 1>objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways to the illusory,</v>

21
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.363
<v Speaker 1>but it's by no means self evident that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that set of presuppositions is correct </v>

22
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.683
<v Speaker 1>because we lack infinite knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many things about the structure </v>

23
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 1>of being that we don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>main one being consciousness.</v>

24
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 1>We can't account for it at all and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't account for the role it appears to</v>

25
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:05.080
<v Speaker 1>play in the transformation of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>into actuality,</v>

26
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>which is a role that's been recognized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by physicists for almost 100 years now.</v>

27
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 1>And which remains one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsolved mysteries in science.</v>

28
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>There are other ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's real</v>

29
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.373
<v Speaker 1>and these other ways have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages and one of the advantages </v>

30
00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:23.044
<v Speaker 1>they have is that they protect us </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing these other ways of operating </v>

31
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.190
<v Speaker 1>within reality.</v>

32
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Defining reality protect us from certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of pathologies.</v>

33
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:34.801
<v Speaker 1>And modern people are prone to a fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of pathologies that stem from the</v>

34
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.510
<v Speaker 1>assumptions of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their,</v>

35
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.430
<v Speaker 1>of the systems they use to define </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

36
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And one of those pathologies is a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a nihilistic hopelessness,</v>

37
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:44.674
<v Speaker 1>which is a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition that in the final analysis </v>

38
00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 1>nothing really has any meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because life is difficult and that's</v>

39
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:58.111
<v Speaker 1>a meaning that you can't escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being forced to abandon your belief in a</v>

40
00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>positive or a meaning can leave you </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

41
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.923
<v Speaker 1>the times when you really can least </v>
<v Speaker 1>afford to be weak and there's more </v>

42
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>important pathologies that it's opened </v>
<v Speaker 1>us up to two.</v>

43
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.854
<v Speaker 1>And those are pathologies of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we saw the most horrifying </v>

44
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:12.994
<v Speaker 1>examples of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully the most horrifying examples </v>

45
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>in the 20th century where people whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems were shattered,</v>

46
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.323
<v Speaker 1>at least in part by the competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>between religious and scientific </v>

47
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:22.564
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned in large numbers to mass </v>

48
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>movements that were in error in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>way as substitute,</v>

49
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:29.794
<v Speaker 1>a moral rational in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>substitute for religious beliefs that </v>

50
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>appeared no longer tenable.</v>

51
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>And the consequences of that was it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just about annihilation.</v>

52
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Because we came close to annihilation </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

53
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>once in the sixties and once in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>

54
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>And even without the totality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>annihilation,</v>

55
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.183
<v Speaker 1>we lost hundreds of millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of pathological belief </v>

56
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:52.414
<v Speaker 1>systems in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if belief systems become </v>

57
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.034
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they po that pathology can pose the </v>

58
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>biggest threat possibly to our very </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

59
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:03.304
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a Darwinian in any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that the things </v>

60
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:08.404
<v Speaker 1>that pose the biggest threats to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival are the most real things they </v>

61
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>have to be dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

62
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.933
<v Speaker 1>here's another way of looking at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with the definition of this </v>

63
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:20.614
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This word famous thigh is the root word </v>

64
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:23.284
<v Speaker 1>of phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon and phenomena are the things </v>

65
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:27.514
<v Speaker 1>that appear to you and famous by means </v>
<v Speaker 1>to shine forth and the phenomenologists </v>

66
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:32.194
<v Speaker 1>who were interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the shining forth of things made the </v>

67
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:35.164
<v Speaker 1>presumption that the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested themselves to you as most </v>

68
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 1>meaningful word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most real things.</v>

69
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.173
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can make a strong case </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's actually how your brain is </v>

70
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.534
<v Speaker 1>wired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your brain is wired to react to </v>

71
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 1>things that have meaning before they </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct the perceptions that you think</v>

72
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:50.404
<v Speaker 1>of as objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because the </v>

73
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>meaning of things is more real in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

74
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>but more important than the view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things as objects.</v>

75
00:04:58.781 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

76
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>a famous philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

77
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 1>division said that when you approach a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliff,</v>

78
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a falling off place.</v>

79
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.463
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that it's an object cliff to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you attribute the meaning of </v>

80
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>falling off place too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the falling off place.</v>

81
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:18.844
<v Speaker 1>Perception comes first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the abstraction of the objective </v>

82
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it ever happens at all,</v>

83
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>it comes much later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much later conceptually,</v>

84
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>because even babies can detect cliffs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and much later,</v>

85
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:29.434
<v Speaker 1>historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poets have noticed this phenomenon </v>

86
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.710
<v Speaker 1>shining forth reality and they've often </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with childhood.</v>

87
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's good reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

88
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I think your brain is not so much of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibitory structure when you're a child</v>

89
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>before it's fully developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

90
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.053
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's neurological reasons for noting </v>

91
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:51.184
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also reasons that stem from </v>

92
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>the level of lived experience you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell when you're around children,</v>

93
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:56.704
<v Speaker 1>that they're open things in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults aren't there wide eyed with </v>

94
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>wonder and adults like being around </v>
<v Speaker 1>children for that reason.</v>

95
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Because although the child takes an </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful lot of care and is,</v>

96
00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:08.554
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

97
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.643
<v Speaker 1>a terrifying object in some ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>behold if you have a relationship with </v>

98
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>the child because they're so vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of the way they pay you back is</v>

99
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:16.724
<v Speaker 1>they open up your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes that have been closed by your </v>

100
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>experience and that have learned to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shield out the things that shine forth.</v>

101
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.573
<v Speaker 1>And when you have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look through the child's eyes </v>

102
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me it's like they're on fire in a</v>

103
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:30.614
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like a candle or something </v>

104
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:32.144
<v Speaker 1>that's burning brightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's also partly because </v>

105
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.484
<v Speaker 1>we actually don't screen out fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually see fire and that's why we </v>

106
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:37.904
<v Speaker 1>can't not look at it when it's around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same thing happens when </v>

107
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you're in love with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

108
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>if it's genuine love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because genuine love gives you a hint of</v>

109
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>what could be in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could just set yourself right,</v>

110
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>you get a glimpse of what could be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

111
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>If you fall in love with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get that without work,</v>

112
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:57.884
<v Speaker 1>but you get a glimpse of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's because when you fall </v>

113
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:00.794
<v Speaker 1>in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe this is likely a </v>

114
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:02.354
<v Speaker 1>biochemical transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the perceptual structures that </v>

115
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 1>normally stop you from seeing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you really don't see people.</v>

116
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>You just see shadows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did that,</v>

117
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:11.723
<v Speaker 1>that that the barriers are lifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporarily and what's really there </v>

118
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>shines through and it's overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to stay in that state,</v>

119
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires a tremendous amount of moral</v>

120
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 1>effort is really the right way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

121
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.993
<v Speaker 1>Words were said about children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a time when meadow grove and </v>

122
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:32.324
<v Speaker 1>stream the earth and every common sight </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me did seem appareled in celestial </v>

123
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:37.244
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The glory and the freshness of a dream </v>

124
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>it is not now as it has been of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn,</v>

125
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 1>were soever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may by night or day,</v>

126
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.713
<v Speaker 1>the things which I have seen I now can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see no more earth fills her lap with </v>

127
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:53.834
<v Speaker 1>pleasures of her own yearnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She have in her own natural kind and </v>

128
00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:00.840
<v Speaker 1>even with something of a mother's mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no unworthy aim.</v>

129
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>The homely nurse doth all she can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make her foster child,</v>

130
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>her inmate man.</v>

131
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.453
<v Speaker 1>Forget the glories he hath known and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Imperial Pellets Palace whence he </v>

132
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:15.800
<v Speaker 1>came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he means by this is that as you</v>

133
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>develop as an as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a competent adult,</v>

134
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:19.394
<v Speaker 1>which which is precisely the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The direction towards which you should </v>

135
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:23.743
<v Speaker 1>develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of what you're doing is actually </v>

136
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.353
<v Speaker 1>closing in and narrowing your closing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and narrowing towards a particular goal </v>

137
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:30.434
<v Speaker 1>in a particular way of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's necessary because as you </v>

138
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to develop towards a particular</v>

139
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:37.634
<v Speaker 1>way of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you don't develop it all and you can </v>

140
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 1>stay a child forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That goes,</v>

141
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.680
<v Speaker 1>that goes sour of its own accord and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are destined to close their</v>

142
00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:52.931
<v Speaker 1>perceptions in to sharpen themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to focus on very little so that they can</v>

143
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>at least do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the price we pay for that is that we</v>

144
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>start to replace the relationship we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have with untrammeled reality,</v>

145
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.433
<v Speaker 1>with the shadows that are only complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to let us do what we need to do </v>

146
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>and no more.</v>

147
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.603
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we become more competent in </v>

148
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:10.974
<v Speaker 1>other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've become more blind and we kind of </v>

149
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 1>know how this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens from the bottom up.</v>

150
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:16.404
<v Speaker 1>Now this is the Greek painting and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>painting as an obvious meaning in a </v>

151
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:20.724
<v Speaker 1>sense which is that we're blinded even </v>
<v Speaker 1>to what's right in front of us by the </v>

152
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:29.751
<v Speaker 1>objects that we see and we think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing is letting in the light,</v>

153
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's only letting in a very small </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraction of the light because we're only</v>

154
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:36.234
<v Speaker 1>capable of contemplating a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraction of everything whenever we're </v>

155
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:40.194
<v Speaker 1>doing any particular thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so very much of what we're doing is </v>

156
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 1>screening things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very much of your cortex is inhibitory</v>

157
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.140
<v Speaker 1>and the greed is trying to get at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that idea.</v>

158
00:09:50.141 --> 00:09:52.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a businessman there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's dressed in his uniform.</v>

159
00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:53.404
<v Speaker 1>He can't see beyond the immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immediate thing that's in front of </v>

160
00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:57.610
<v Speaker 1>his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that happen?</v>

161
00:09:57.611 --> 00:09:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're a baby.</v>

162
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.820
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn.</v>

163
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.980
<v Speaker 1>You build your body from the bottom up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your build,</v>

164
00:10:02.981 --> 00:10:05.290
<v Speaker 1>your perceptual and actual structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom up.</v>

165
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.860
<v Speaker 1>You learn to move your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learned to close your hand.</v>

166
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Then you learn to do things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical with those abilities.</v>

167
00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:15.520
<v Speaker 1>You lift the spoon while you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to feed yourself.</v>

168
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.833
<v Speaker 1>You learn to move a plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn to set the table that's </v>

169
00:10:19.271 --> 00:10:20.104
<v Speaker 1>starting to become social now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can set the table for you and for </v>

170
00:10:22.481 --> 00:10:25.210
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn to make a meal.</v>

171
00:10:25.211 --> 00:10:26.044
<v Speaker 1>That's a more complex sequencing of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motor activities and perceptual </v>

172
00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:30.160
<v Speaker 1>abilities that's very focused.</v>

173
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.983
<v Speaker 1>As you continue to develop the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you chained together become more and </v>

174
00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:38.600
<v Speaker 1>more complex and and but also more </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific.</v>

175
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.443
<v Speaker 1>You have to care for your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means there's all sorts of other </v>

176
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 1>things you're not doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to find a good job,</v>

177
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.283
<v Speaker 1>which almost everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're young experiences as the </v>

178
00:10:47.601 --> 00:10:49.850
<v Speaker 1>contemplation of limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not everyone,</v>

179
00:10:49.851 --> 00:10:51.230
<v Speaker 1>but many people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

180
00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:52.064
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to settle for this </v>

181
00:10:54.801 --> 00:10:56.690
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to only be that role,</v>

182
00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:59.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's better to be that role that no </v>
<v Speaker 1>role at all,</v>

183
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.770
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the way through the role to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side is through the role,</v>

184
00:11:03.771 --> 00:11:04.604
<v Speaker 1>don't want around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no avoiding the responsibility </v>

185
00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:09.470
<v Speaker 1>of narrowing and shaping and </v>
<v Speaker 1>specializing.</v>

186
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.023
<v Speaker 1>Be a good parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the sacrifice you make for </v>

187
00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:15.590
<v Speaker 1>the next generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be a good partner.</v>

188
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:21.340
<v Speaker 1>The same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a good citizen.</v>

189
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.473
<v Speaker 1>It's easy for young people in particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be skeptical of that because the old </v>

190
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.710
<v Speaker 1>society is always corrupt and archaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blind to become a member of.</v>

191
00:11:30.711 --> 00:11:31.544
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be in part two to allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to adopt that same agent </v>

192
00:11:36.141 --> 00:11:39.740
<v Speaker 1>blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that thing also educates you.</v>

193
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:40.574
<v Speaker 1>It shapes every word you speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you have to be </v>

194
00:11:42.831 --> 00:11:43.664
<v Speaker 1>grateful to even in its agent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an archaic form and it's part of the </v>

195
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:51.800
<v Speaker 1>necessities of human responsibility that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become a good citizen</v>

196
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.050
<v Speaker 1>and that means</v>

197
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.040
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving up more of what could be at least</v>

198
00:11:58.041 --> 00:11:59.390
<v Speaker 1>to sustain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is</v>

199
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 1>is a satirical song from the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

200
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.900
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>

201
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I am the very model of a modern major </v>
<v Speaker 1>general of information,</v>

202
00:12:10.161 --> 00:12:12.140
<v Speaker 1>vegetable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and mineral.</v>

203
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.003
<v Speaker 1>I know the kings of England and I quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fights historical from marathon to </v>

204
00:12:16.941 --> 00:12:20.490
<v Speaker 1>waterloo in order categorical and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>satire.</v>

205
00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:22.340
<v Speaker 1>He as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has the knowledge.</v>

206
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>He's an official functionary and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to do that,</v>

207
00:12:28.011 --> 00:12:28.844
<v Speaker 1>but in the same way it's very limited in</v>
<v Speaker 1>categorical and of course an artists </v>

208
00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.084
<v Speaker 1>would object to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's better than nothing at all and </v>

209
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:37.300
<v Speaker 1>that's the alternative.</v>

210
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.163
<v Speaker 1>Well above that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe what's above good citizen because </v>

211
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:42.474
<v Speaker 1>sometimes good citizen is not so good if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a good citizen of Nazi Germany </v>

212
00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:47.700
<v Speaker 1>or a good citizen of the Soviet Union or</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Mao's China,</v>

213
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you know you were narrowed in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular way,</v>

214
00:12:49.921 --> 00:12:53.130
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe an unnecessary way,</v>

215
00:12:53.131 --> 00:12:53.964
<v Speaker 1>but also in a very pathological way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it seems to be that there has to </v>

216
00:12:57.841 --> 00:13:01.980
<v Speaker 1>be something even though adopting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted viewpoint is necessary.</v>

217
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.053
<v Speaker 1>There has to be something above it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's also the thing that </v>

218
00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:05.634
<v Speaker 1>can restore the sense you have of a true</v>
<v Speaker 1>entanglement with the deepest and most </v>

219
00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:11.754
<v Speaker 1>meaningful realities of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the issue of being a good </v>

220
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:16.260
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's above being a citizen.</v>

221
00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:17.094
<v Speaker 1>It's something else that has something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with the development of </v>

222
00:13:18.361 --> 00:13:21.090
<v Speaker 1>individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're also wired for that.</v>

223
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.380
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like we're wired to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we had to specialize,</v>

224
00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:27.480
<v Speaker 1>but then once we're specialized to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reopen,</v>

225
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.493
<v Speaker 1>once we've got the skills built into our</v>
<v Speaker 1>body and then can handle handle reality </v>

226
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.150
<v Speaker 1>because we're more adapted and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid and more flexible than we can.</v>

227
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.983
<v Speaker 1>Start opening the doors again and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that your nervous system </v>

228
00:13:39.931 --> 00:13:43.410
<v Speaker 1>is set up to help you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't interfere with it.</v>

229
00:13:43.411 --> 00:13:44.244
<v Speaker 1>If you notice and you notice that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the things that </v>

230
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.720
<v Speaker 1>manifest themselves to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shine forth as interesting,</v>

231
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.583
<v Speaker 1>they grab you and where you're grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>is where the obscuring map you live in </v>

232
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.840
<v Speaker 1>isn't obscuring the reality that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath.</v>

233
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:04.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a hole in the map and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the light shines through that and you're</v>

234
00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:05.334
<v Speaker 1>attracted to that and that will pull you</v>
<v Speaker 1>along and that's when your interest is </v>

235
00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:10.950
<v Speaker 1>seized by something that's your nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system doing that.</v>

236
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.480
<v Speaker 1>You don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

237
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.373
<v Speaker 1>it's an unconscious force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could even say it was the world </v>

238
00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:16.194
<v Speaker 1>itself talking to you and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists didn't feel that way </v>

239
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.423
<v Speaker 1>and it's a real phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a secondary thing and you know </v>

240
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:25.830
<v Speaker 1>that because you can't live without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Die.</v>

241
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.703
<v Speaker 1>He stultify you get cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get nihilistic or you adopt some </v>

242
00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:30.414
<v Speaker 1>wild belief system if you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>attachment to some genuine life giving </v>

243
00:14:35.671 --> 00:14:36.504
<v Speaker 1>meaning in your own life and it's a hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to follow that because it doesn't </v>

244
00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:40.224
<v Speaker 1>necessarily put you into perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition with society because it's </v>

245
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:45.900
<v Speaker 1>not society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not being a good citizen.</v>

246
00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:46.734
<v Speaker 1>It's something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the thing that rebuilds how </v>

247
00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:50.430
<v Speaker 1>you would be a good citizen.</v>

248
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.460
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians knew about this a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago.</v>

249
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:56.570
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew</v>

250
00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:58.903
<v Speaker 1>because they acted things out and drama </v>
<v Speaker 1>and portrayed them mythologically </v>

251
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't have the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate the ideas fully,</v>

252
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:04.994
<v Speaker 1>but the Egyptians worshiped the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>eye and they worshiped the eye because </v>

253
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:09.854
<v Speaker 1>they knew the I was the thing that paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention like we're really visual </v>

254
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:12.674
<v Speaker 1>creatures and your eyes automatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to the things that manifest </v>

255
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 1>themselves or shine forth in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you have to look at them.</v>

256
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.673
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

257
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.613
<v Speaker 1>If you pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the things that shine forth because </v>

258
00:15:27.151 --> 00:15:29.220
<v Speaker 1>what you're seeing is the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of the map,</v>

259
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.820
<v Speaker 1>you're gaining access to the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that's in the world.</v>

260
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not prepackaged information because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be forced.</v>

261
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.983
<v Speaker 1>It's the real information flowing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the ground of being and if you pay </v>

262
00:15:39.421 --> 00:15:40.254
<v Speaker 1>attention to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will help you move towards the goals </v>

263
00:15:42.961 --> 00:15:46.070
<v Speaker 1>that you've already established for </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a good citizen that are,</v>

264
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.840
<v Speaker 1>that are part of the inbuilt value </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that you've adopted.</v>

265
00:15:48.841 --> 00:15:50.730
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time it will do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

266
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.833
<v Speaker 1>It will lead you to transform the nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those goals because as you pursued </v>

267
00:15:55.951 --> 00:16:00.951
<v Speaker 1>the thing that guides your interest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more information is revealed.</v>

268
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Then by absorbing that information which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is learning,</v>

269
00:16:04.861 --> 00:16:08.070
<v Speaker 1>essentially you build yourself into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different person,</v>

270
00:16:08.071 --> 00:16:11.130
<v Speaker 1>a stronger and more informed person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a more,</v>

271
00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.173
<v Speaker 1>a more intact person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person with more integrity and with </v>

272
00:16:14.461 --> 00:16:15.294
<v Speaker 1>more straight than with more direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time you differentiate </v>

273
00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:20.850
<v Speaker 1>your map and so you're living more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more in the real world,</v>

274
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.863
<v Speaker 1>so as you approach your specific goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a culturally conditioned </v>

275
00:16:24.271 --> 00:16:25.104
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the learning that you do along the way </v>

276
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.880
<v Speaker 1>transforms you and it transforms the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of your goal.</v>

277
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.143
<v Speaker 1>Things shine forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason for that and you know </v>

278
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:38.684
<v Speaker 1>that because when you're attending to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you're interested in and </v>

279
00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:43.040
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you're alive.</v>

280
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 1>That's when life is worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so worthwhile that in those moments</v>

281
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:47.234
<v Speaker 1>you don't even ask the question about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question itself goes away because </v>

282
00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:51.824
<v Speaker 1>the meaning that you're united with is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so powerful that it can push back the </v>

283
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.490
<v Speaker 1>adversity that would otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterize life.</v>

284
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who has a why can bear anyhow</v>

285
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.870
<v Speaker 1>and and that's a really useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know because you think,</v>

286
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:06.704
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very vulnerable creatures in our </v>

287
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:11.330
<v Speaker 1>life ends catastrophic and and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things happen,</v>

288
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:12.164
<v Speaker 1>and how can we bear that in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer to that is and always has </v>

289
00:17:14.331 --> 00:17:19.331
<v Speaker 1>been that you have to be in sync with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's beyond you because that</v>

290
00:17:20.001 --> 00:17:20.834
<v Speaker 1>synchrony gives you the strength that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to bear your terrible </v>

291
00:17:23.181 --> 00:17:24.014
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>

292
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 1>You see this played out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People know this.</v>

293
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that our culture isn't good at</v>

294
00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:31.100
<v Speaker 1>articulating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've lost a lot of this.</v>

295
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.533
<v Speaker 1>We haven't developed their knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this as much as we've developed </v>

296
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 1>our knowledge of the objective world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're paying for it.</v>

297
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.160
<v Speaker 1>You see it in weird places on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the right here,</v>

298
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 1>there's an old symbol at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the round chaos.</v>

299
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.350
<v Speaker 1>When the alchemists believed that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>round chaos was the thing that held,</v>

300
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the world was ultimately made up,</v>

301
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.003
<v Speaker 1>the thing that was most real and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it as something like </v>

302
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.740
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought about it.</v>

303
00:17:56.741 --> 00:17:57.574
<v Speaker 1>There's a combination of spirit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter and it was a combination of </v>

304
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:00.774
<v Speaker 1>spirit and matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what information is in a sense </v>

305
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:06.150
<v Speaker 1>because when you interacted with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you took some of the information and you</v>

306
00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:06.984
<v Speaker 1>built yourself out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was the spiritual element and </v>

307
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:10.134
<v Speaker 1>you took some of the information and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>built the world out of it and that was </v>

308
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:12.744
<v Speaker 1>the material element and they thought of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality itself is something that </v>

309
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:16.134
<v Speaker 1>preceded the spiritual and the material </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that reality was what showing </v>

310
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 1>for and that's been dramatized and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>entails modern tales of transformation.</v>

311
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 1>The most interesting places popped up is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Harry Potter stories were central</v>

312
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 1>to the Harry Potter theme is a game </v>
<v Speaker 1>called quidditch and inquisitive,</v>

313
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 1>which is a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way you win the game is by playing a</v>

314
00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:38.580
<v Speaker 1>game that's sort of outside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quidditch game.</v>

315
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.673
<v Speaker 1>You win the quidditch game by finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>following this thing that beckons this </v>

316
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 1>golden thing that glimmers and moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

317
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:49.800
<v Speaker 1>If you catch that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you win.</v>

318
00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:53.520
<v Speaker 1>The game is so does your whole team and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside that is.</v>

319
00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 1>It is the resurrection stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

320
00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:01.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a diamond that says it's a jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that if you follow the thing</v>

321
00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:03.600
<v Speaker 1>that manifests itself to you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

322
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.123
<v Speaker 1>it will lead you through adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lead you to do things that are </v>

323
00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:07.884
<v Speaker 1>difficult and as that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not beyond your capacity because </v>

324
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.273
<v Speaker 1>it's tempered for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will happen is as you hit yourself </v>

325
00:19:13.801 --> 00:19:16.590
<v Speaker 1>against the world pursuing what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>

326
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you'll tap yourself into alignment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your molecules,</v>

327
00:19:20.381 --> 00:19:21.214
<v Speaker 1>your structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal structure will become non </v>

328
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 1>contradictory like the internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of a jewel,</v>

329
00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:29.340
<v Speaker 1>which is something that reflects light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you hard and durable,</v>

330
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.500
<v Speaker 1>unable to bear the terrible conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of existence without becoming corrupt.</v>

331
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.950
<v Speaker 1>He had said something about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shall not cease from exploration,</v>

332
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:42.503
<v Speaker 1>and the end of all our exploring will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>to arrive where we started and to know </v>

333
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:51.111
<v Speaker 1>the place for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's five line summary of the most</v>

334
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.633
<v Speaker 1>remarkable elaboration of the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the individual </v>

335
00:20:01.311 --> 00:20:05.640
<v Speaker 1>human consciousness and reality itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ever been panned.</v>

336
00:20:05.641 --> 00:20:06.474
<v Speaker 1>And and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the combination of have a system of </v>

337
00:20:08.451 --> 00:20:11.210
<v Speaker 1>thought that's been developing over </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years.</v>

338
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Which we have lost and cannot properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I follow what you're interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll take you to have adversity and </v>

340
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:22.644
<v Speaker 1>then through it it'll transform you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a citizen into an individual and then </v>

341
00:20:25.681 --> 00:20:26.514
<v Speaker 1>the doors will open again and at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point you're strong enough to have your </v>

342
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.104
<v Speaker 1>life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at that point you're strong enough </v>

343
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.440
<v Speaker 1>not to fall prey to pathological belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and work towards the destruction</v>

344
00:20:39.441 --> 00:20:40.274
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>

345
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.213
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
