00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.913
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a paper you're supposed to read </v>

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>this week was gray marble of the limbic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and Basal Ganglia.</v>

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.833
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy compared to the optional </v>

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was Swanson.</v>

5
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>And I had everybody read that last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

6
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>people were basically having </v>
<v Speaker 1>convulsions.</v>

7
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And so I decided that it wasn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair to get you to read it.</v>

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.973
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would very much recommend that you </v>

9
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>read it and because it's a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant paper and you'll,</v>

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>you'll learn so much from it that it'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be worth,</v>

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.893
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific element of psychology at </v>

12
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:37.404
<v Speaker 1>Swanson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart guy and that's a great </v>

13
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:39.564
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I really liked </v>

14
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:42.264
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I'm going to an end </v>

15
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>about grey's papers as well as be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

16
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>they're describing brain physiology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between that physiology</v>

17
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:53.004
<v Speaker 1>and behavior in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently sophisticated so that I </v>

18
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>actually think it's psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>revealing.</v>

19
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.791
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

20
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.624
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful and important to know these </v>

21
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what's happening,</v>

22
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.553
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking more and more that </v>

23
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>that hierarchy that I've showed you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over,</v>

24
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I really think that that's basically a </v>
<v Speaker 1>map of the unconscious.</v>

25
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that hierarchy I showed you</v>

26
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>isn't obviously a fully worked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the unconscious,</v>

27
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad schemata.</v>

28
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think what it's missing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>the at near the bottom where you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual actions,</v>

30
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.933
<v Speaker 1>those actions are actually sequenced </v>
<v Speaker 1>into what you might call motor melodies </v>

31
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>that have a perceptual frame associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

32
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And then those are nested inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental motivational systems.</v>

33
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And Swanson's paper does a lovely job of</v>
<v Speaker 1>detailing the,</v>

34
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>the physiological substrate for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

35
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:49.014
<v Speaker 1>So basically what he shows is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system is built up of </v>

36
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:52.764
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical models that started in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body that basically start with spinal </v>

37
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>reflexes.</v>

38
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.873
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of quick and dirty spinal </v>

39
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>reflexes that cause your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

40
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 1>your people think of their brain is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their head.</v>

41
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

42
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a big part of your brain in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

43
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>but a huge part of it's distributed </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your body.</v>

44
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:13.104
<v Speaker 1>So I re I re,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading and I hope this is </v>

45
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:16.164
<v Speaker 1>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are more neurons in your </v>

46
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:17.784
<v Speaker 1>autonomic nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there are in your central nervous </v>

47
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:20.394
<v Speaker 1>system and the autonomic nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 1>is distributed throughout the body and </v>

48
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>it's the part of the nervous system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>governs all the things.</v>

49
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:26.484
<v Speaker 1>You're too stupid to take care of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how your liver works and how your </v>

50
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>heart should stay beating and how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>digest food and it's,</v>

51
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated things that consciousness </v>

52
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>isn't capable of dealing with and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to,</v>

53
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to downplay the </v>

54
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>complexity of those sorts of functions.</v>

55
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>There are so important that evolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>does let you mess around with them.</v>

56
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

57
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:47.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

59
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.573
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voluntary motor system and the </v>

60
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>sensory system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the central nervous system,</v>

61
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:52.644
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.693
<v Speaker 1>your spine is fairly hefty bit of neural</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue and then of course the neurons </v>

63
00:02:58.441 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>themselves distributed through your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

64
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.170
<v Speaker 1>So really your brain is distributed </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your body.</v>

65
00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>And there's also a tremendous number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurons in your gut as well.</v>

66
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.923
<v Speaker 1>And some of those seem to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce information that might actually </v>

67
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>even acquire consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

68
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily mean at the gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

69
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly informs you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

70
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>so Swanson's basic proposition is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a piagetian proposition.</v>

71
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you lay out these initial reflex of</v>

72
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>behaviors and then they're sequenced </v>
<v Speaker 1>into more complex melodies.</v>

73
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

74
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.893
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowest level,</v>

76
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:34.444
<v Speaker 1>highest resolution behaviors you </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice and practice until you're an </v>

77
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>expert at them.</v>

78
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to graph,</v>

79
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got these elements of behavior</v>

80
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that you can basically parcel off to </v>
<v Speaker 1>automated systems.</v>

81
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:46.834
<v Speaker 1>And some of those automated systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so automated that they're handled by </v>

82
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:51.740
<v Speaker 1>very low brain areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like spinal level.</v>

83
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:52.574
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take out paraplegic person and </v>

84
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>have you take a paraplegic person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you suspend them under the arms,</v>

86
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.793
<v Speaker 1>over a treadmill and tilt them forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll walk has pretty remarkable a </v>

87
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't think that.</v>

88
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>But walking isn't that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that.</v>

89
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Walking could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be handled by the spine.</v>

90
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out where you want to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more complicated.</v>

91
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 1>So higher order brain systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in that,</v>

92
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>but so you think about it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

93
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

94
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.833
<v Speaker 1>that Swanson really concentrates on is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the function of the </v>

95
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>

96
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would tell you some things about the</v>

97
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sorta sits at the top of the,</v>

98
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>of the spinal cord and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that big.</v>

99
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bitty brain area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's,</v>

100
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>it's also not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.124
<v Speaker 1>you gotta remember that when you hear a </v>
<v Speaker 1>word like hypothalamus or word like </v>

102
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>emotion or word like brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are low resolution words,</v>

103
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phenomena itself isn't homogenous.</v>

104
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's composed of modules.</v>

105
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And then those modules are composed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>modules.</v>

106
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:03.094
<v Speaker 1>And those modules modules are composed </v>
<v Speaker 1>of modules and all the way down to the </v>

107
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:07.084
<v Speaker 1>cellular level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's some modules there and </v>

108
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 1>that goes all the way down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular level.</v>

109
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>And then there's sub modules at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular level.</v>

110
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>So it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complicated.</v>

111
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.134
<v Speaker 1>And to think about it as a homogenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is just a low resolution </v>

112
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

113
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.263
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus isn't an entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a group of functionally related </v>

114
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 1>entities that are composed of groups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>functionally related entities.</v>

115
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:30.604
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't start at the highest level of </v>

116
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>detail and progress forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to use shortcuts.</v>

117
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:36.604
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus isn't a very big brain </v>

118
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:39.454
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an important one and it's </v>

119
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.154
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently sophisticated so that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a female cat and there's an </v>

120
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>important reason that it's female and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take out basically it's whole brain,</v>

121
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>the limbic system that's responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and the whole critical cap.</v>

122
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>So it basically has no brain except for </v>
<v Speaker 1>his cord,</v>

123
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:58.424
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you keep it in a relatively </v>

124
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>closed environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like a like a cage,</v>

125
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it pretty much acts like a normal cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can do all the normal cat things.</v>

126
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can engage in defensive aggression,</v>

127
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 1>it can eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can drink,</v>

128
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 1>it can sleep.</v>

129
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.603
<v Speaker 1>It's Co,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's conscious as you know in so far as </v>

130
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>you can tell whether or not an animal is</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>

131
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.503
<v Speaker 1>it's hyper exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is extraordinarily peculiar </v>

132
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:24.884
<v Speaker 1>because the last thing you'd expect of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cap with no brain would be to be hyper </v>

133
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>exploratory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

134
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be insanely curious about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and that's what that seems to</v>

135
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>indicate is that it's psychomotor </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory system,</v>

136
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:38.774
<v Speaker 1>which is in fact grounded in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus is still active but it </v>

137
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:42.104
<v Speaker 1>can't build up the memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations that would inhibit the </v>

138
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:45.344
<v Speaker 1>exploratory activity because basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing when you explore is </v>

139
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you're taking something something </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and then your mapping.</v>

140
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:53.804
<v Speaker 1>It's responses in relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations of your body and in so </v>

141
00:06:58.191 --> 00:06:59.024
<v Speaker 1>far as the set of transformations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body that you're likely to </v>

142
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:07.091
<v Speaker 1>manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in this place have zero motivational</v>

143
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:08.474
<v Speaker 1>relevance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really what you're hoping for </v>

144
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>most of the time.</v>

145
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Then you build up a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the place that's,</v>

146
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.193
<v Speaker 1>that's part of that for septual motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and it shuts off your </v>

147
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 1>curiosity about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what you perceived from then on</v>

148
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 1>in really is your representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing rather than the thing itself.</v>

149
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.563
<v Speaker 1>And you're kind of happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's easier to see what you've </v>

150
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 1>already learned that it is to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing itself.</v>

151
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.733
<v Speaker 1>Now things can get re novelized you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone acts very peculiarly right </v>

152
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 1>beside you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like the whole space around you,</v>

153
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:42.374
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get renormalize very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly and your body will go on alert </v>

154
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Mick,</v>

155
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 1>basically what you're doing is learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to ignore,</v>

156
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.973
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you want and you want to play </v>

157
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:55.070
<v Speaker 1>attention to everything all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's,</v>

158
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.933
<v Speaker 1>that's a short path to exhaustion </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if everything's relevant than </v>

159
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:00.164
<v Speaker 1>your body goes on hyper alert and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce cortisol and you know you're </v>

160
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>ready for anything and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of exciting.</v>

161
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 1>But as a longterm survival strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

162
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:09.494
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't have the energy to </v>

163
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:11.534
<v Speaker 1>maintain that for any length of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the reason the cat is hyper </v>

164
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:15.404
<v Speaker 1>exploratory is because the systems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediate exploration are still intact as </v>

165
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:20.024
<v Speaker 1>long as it has a hypothalamus and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rough underlying circuitry that </v>

166
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>associates that with the motor output </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

167
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.293
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can't remember what it's </v>

168
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>explored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just stays hyper exploratory.</v>

169
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.060
<v Speaker 1>It's also hyperreactive safety accuse of</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

170
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I would say like a hypothalamic cat is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot like a two year old,</v>

171
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that in the best possible </v>

172
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:41.910
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>two year olds that are extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious,</v>

174
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>they're hyper exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>

175
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 1>very reactive to stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

176
00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>they cry easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they laugh easily,</v>

177
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>they run around easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

178
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.240
<v Speaker 1>they get scared easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

179
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience pain easily.</v>

180
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't until they built the higher</v>

181
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 1>order structures in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

182
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptual motor hierarchy that that all</v>

183
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:04.854
<v Speaker 1>gets integrated and they're not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactive then they're nowhere near as </v>

184
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.530
<v Speaker 1>much fun at that point either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 1>and so the female cat can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can regulate it.</v>

187
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It's water intake and it can also engage</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sexual activity.</v>

188
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.443
<v Speaker 1>No male cat can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs more brain than just the </v>

189
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:21.024
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus because it's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated to sequence male sexual </v>

190
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:27.790
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can tell the difference between a</v>

191
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.643
<v Speaker 1>male cat with no court tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say a no limbic system and a </v>

192
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 1>female cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pretty much only in that,</v>

193
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>in that particularities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

194
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.144
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's very interesting because if </v>

196
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:41.334
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you study neuropsychology and you're </v>

197
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 1>taught by clinical neuropsychologist </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

198
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:49.740
<v Speaker 1>or even neuropsychologists that have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical background,</v>

199
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.360
<v Speaker 1>they're very cortical centric.</v>

200
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's,</v>

201
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.790
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your hangover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

202
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 1>since we got unseated from our position </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the center of the universe,</v>

204
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:00.930
<v Speaker 1>we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:01.764
<v Speaker 1>rat rat radically running around trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what it is that makes us </v>

206
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:05.004
<v Speaker 1>special in relationship to animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we kind of cottoned onto the idea </v>

207
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 1>we have this big cortical cap and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the prefrontal Cortex,</v>

209
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's very large in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our body,</v>

210
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it is.</v>

211
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.771
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 1>somehow that distinguishes us from other</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

213
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.040
<v Speaker 1>which it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

214
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:21.963
<v Speaker 1>but that's also led us into thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the most recently evolved parts of </v>

215
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 1>the brain are the most important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

216
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in some sense the smartest,</v>

217
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a real error of presumption </v>

218
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:35.544
<v Speaker 1>there because you might also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think instead that it's those </v>

219
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:42.390
<v Speaker 1>parts of the brain that evolution has </v>
<v Speaker 1>had the longest time to work on that are</v>

220
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 1>in fact the smartest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

221
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And they do take care of all the heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting.</v>

222
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.311
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

223
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

224
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness isn't entrusted with </v>
<v Speaker 1>any of the heavy lifting.</v>

225
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>You can fiddle around the edges with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to be allowed to do</v>

226
00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:57.770
<v Speaker 1>anything that's really pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.613
<v Speaker 1>that's really physiologically profound </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a good thing because you just </v>

228
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:02.184
<v Speaker 1>don't have the intellectual capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage that kind of ongoing </v>

229
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:07.404
<v Speaker 1>physiological monitoring in all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't understand your body if </v>

230
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:11.964
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing works and you can ignore it </v>

231
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

232
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.533
<v Speaker 1>But if it ever goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck trying to figure it out </v>

233
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 1>consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

234
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting somewhere with that,</v>

235
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:22.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to do so.</v>

236
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.143
<v Speaker 1>So we should think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus for a bit because it seems </v>

237
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:32.340
<v Speaker 1>to be pretty damn important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say,</v>

238
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have wondered sometimes and </v>

239
00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:36.174
<v Speaker 1>they've asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.900
<v Speaker 1>where's the Super Ego and the ego and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ID located in the brain.</v>

241
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:40.763
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a stupid question and it's not a </v>

242
00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:46.720
<v Speaker 1>stupid question at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

243
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a useful question at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis because you could say,</v>

244
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:51.834
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end from the Freudian is sort of </v>

245
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:54.964
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural force that propels </v>

246
00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

247
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we say motivation,</v>

248
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 1>we're not saying much different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying in,</v>

249
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:05.951
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 1>it's the same kind of low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

251
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:09.783
<v Speaker 1>And it's clearly the case that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental motivational systems and </v>

252
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:16.530
<v Speaker 1>that we do share them with animals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they do drive our behavior in it.</v>

253
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.650
<v Speaker 1>But they also drive our perceptions in </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the ways that Freud thought about,</v>

254
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I really like </v>

255
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:23.554
<v Speaker 1>about the psychoanalysts is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never make the mistake of assuming </v>

256
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:29.523
<v Speaker 1>that a motivational system or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional system is a mechanical system </v>

257
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>that reacts to deterministically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say no,</v>

258
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:39.820
<v Speaker 1>those things are like personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

259
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:40.683
<v Speaker 1>that's much more sophisticated viewpoint</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the typical behaviorist or the </v>

260
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:47.260
<v Speaker 1>typical cognitive psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

261
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.483
<v Speaker 1>because they tend to think of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer in either stimulus response </v>

262
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:52.324
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically deterministic chains </v>

263
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.280
<v Speaker 1>or as if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

264
00:12:56.281 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 1>the information processing system is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>computational apparatus,</v>

265
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Speaker 1>which it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not only that,</v>

266
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an embodied computational apparatus</v>

267
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and the body is a very sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

268
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

269
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.340
<v Speaker 1>it's been very difficult for us to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied robots.</v>

270
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the case that until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>build embodied robots,</v>

271
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 1>the things don't really get smart.</v>

272
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a body for the thing to</v>

273
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:21.364
<v Speaker 1>actually have any intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was actually figured out by a </v>

274
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:24.514
<v Speaker 1>robotics engineer named Rodney Brooks </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the 1990s 92 93 published a </v>

275
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:30.190
<v Speaker 1>couple of papers on that saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 1>that if we were going to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence,</v>

277
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.633
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't start from the top down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't build a world modeling </v>

278
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:38.044
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then embedded in something that </v>

279
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:40.984
<v Speaker 1>moves around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should build something that sort of </v>

280
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:45.280
<v Speaker 1>moves around semi autonomously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a stupid insect.</v>

281
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:46.563
<v Speaker 1>Insects aren't stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do mean as stupid insect and if we </v>

282
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.210
<v Speaker 1>could manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd really be doing something,</v>

283
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we've,</v>

284
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.580
<v Speaker 1>you might've gotten beyond the stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>insect level of,</v>

285
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.900
<v Speaker 1>of robots so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

286
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.450
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starting to ramp up really fast,</v>

287
00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:03.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's in large part because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are embodied.</v>

288
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And so because it is the case as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've discussed that your,</v>

289
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.773
<v Speaker 1>your perceptual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cognitive perceptual motor systems </v>

290
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.013
<v Speaker 1>have to be embedded in an output system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can interact with the world in </v>

291
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 1>order for them to be doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actual or real.</v>

292
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

293
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.220
<v Speaker 1>back to the hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

294
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.240
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and I'm no expert on </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic function and I had to pound</v>

295
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 1>by way through Swanson's paper because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite complex,</v>

296
00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:34.714
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hypothalamus is sort of the </v>

297
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 1>nexus between the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind and the body.</v>

298
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.953
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very good at monitoring your </v>

299
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:44.284
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the states of your body and it can </v>

300
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 1>figure out basically when your blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar's too low and when you need water.</v>

301
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:52.580
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly remember how it's,</v>

302
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the regulation of </v>

303
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:55.484
<v Speaker 1>breathing because I suspect that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a different system and I don't remember </v>

304
00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>that being a sub component of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>

305
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 1>but it does also regulate things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual behavior and sex,</v>

306
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.060
<v Speaker 1>sexual attraction and temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation and excretion and,</v>

307
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.223
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that you would associate </v>

308
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:15.650
<v Speaker 1>with the basic biological functions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>come along with being a complex animal.</v>

309
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.521
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:20.180
<v Speaker 1>we share those functions way down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary chain.</v>

311
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.403
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we share a lot of the functions with </v>

312
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 1>everything that moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach and avoidance.</v>

313
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:27.290
<v Speaker 1>We share with pretty much everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that moves.</v>

314
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:32.030
<v Speaker 1>And by the time you get to the higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammalian functions,</v>

315
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we share those with pretty much all </v>

316
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:35.204
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why we can understand </v>

317
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 1>mammals pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

318
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:38.744
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of have a lizard as a pet </v>

319
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.650
<v Speaker 1>and some of them are more social than </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

320
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.540
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really have a pad,</v>

321
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:45.374
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a mammal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's even better if it's a social </v>

322
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:48.380
<v Speaker 1>mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

323
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.213
<v Speaker 1>like a dog because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can understand dogs and they can </v>

324
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:53.024
<v Speaker 1>understand you cause they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical animals and they have the </v>

325
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:59.390
<v Speaker 1>same roughly the same set of biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions that you do.</v>

326
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.553
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brains are organized around smell </v>

327
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.130
<v Speaker 1>and not around vision.</v>

328
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.323
<v Speaker 1>And almost all animals are like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>except for people and maybe hunting </v>

329
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 1>birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

330
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:12.260
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishes us from dogs,</v>

331
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.393
<v Speaker 1>but we're similar enough in or embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior so that we can directly relate </v>

332
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 1>to dogs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can even play and plays a circuit.</v>

333
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 1>So there's a guy named Jaak Panksepp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>j a k Panksepp,</v>

334
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 1>p a n k,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s,</v>

335
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:32.240
<v Speaker 1>e p.</v>
<v Speaker 1>P who I would roundly recommend that you</v>

336
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:36.020
<v Speaker 1>read if you're interested in in </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral neuroscience.</v>

337
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:36.854
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sort of on par with gray as far as </v>

338
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:39.914
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on par with Swanson and Panksepp I </v>

339
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.660
<v Speaker 1>believe discovered the play circuit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>

340
00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two thumbs up for him.</v>

341
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:47.234
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of like discovering a </v>

342
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Speaker 1>continent from the psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

343
00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:51.884
<v Speaker 1>And it's a search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a circuit that's separate from </v>

344
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:54.434
<v Speaker 1>exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of interesting cause you </v>

345
00:16:56.061 --> 00:16:58.700
<v Speaker 1>think about play as a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory behavior,</v>

346
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.803
<v Speaker 1>but it's sufficiently different from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from standard exploratory behavior that </v>

347
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 1>it has a circuit that's devoted to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of primary circuits,</v>

348
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're networked in with the rest </v>

349
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:10.340
<v Speaker 1>of the brain.</v>

350
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.680
<v Speaker 1>And obviously circuit is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

351
00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:13.514
<v Speaker 1>a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could say there's a lot of primary </v>

352
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.110
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like one eyed monster.</v>

353
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.080
<v Speaker 1>There's only one thing thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.290
<v Speaker 1>and there's a whole bunch of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so roughly speaking,</v>

355
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.363
<v Speaker 1>they regulate the things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already mentioned that the </v>

356
00:17:28.161 --> 00:17:30.980
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus regulates defensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>

357
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>sexual behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>

358
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:35.360
<v Speaker 1>regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food and water intake,</v>

359
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.300
<v Speaker 1>excretion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while then there's one for breathing,</v>

360
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>then there's another for pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's another for anxiety.</v>

361
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's another for exploration and </v>

362
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 1>there's others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's sensory modules as well.</v>

363
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a visual circuit and an auditory</v>

364
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:54.920
<v Speaker 1>circuit to know olfactory circuit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the circuit gets devoted to taste and,</v>

365
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.960
<v Speaker 1>and there's a circuit that keeps track </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how your body is localized in space.</v>

366
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a parietal circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

367
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 1>what else is important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

368
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:06.294
<v Speaker 1>There's a circuit that you can use to </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractly model perceptual structures </v>

369
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 1>and patterns of behavior before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>implement them in the world.</v>

370
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.130
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be a higher cortical </v>
<v Speaker 1>function fundamentally.</v>

371
00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 1>And you associate that with the contents</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your consciousness.</v>

372
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a language circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

373
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.001
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

374
00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:26.970
<v Speaker 1>There's an empathy circuit that mediates</v>
<v Speaker 1>maternal behavior.</v>

375
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a hunting circuit that mediates </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory behavior.</v>

376
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a circuit to check dominance and</v>

377
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 1>subordinate subordination.</v>

378
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.353
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

379
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a circuit that mediates </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity and human beings.</v>

380
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a circuit that mediates social </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

381
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:47.451
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

382
00:18:47.451 --> 00:18:48.284
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive reinforcing nature of </v>

383
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:50.574
<v Speaker 1>social activity and that's quite tightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>expo associated with the exploratory </v>

384
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:54.864
<v Speaker 1>circuit.</v>

385
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

386
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.301
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:18:59.301 --> 00:19:00.134
<v Speaker 1>that's not too bad for beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I've missed some and I'll </v>

388
00:19:01.941 --> 00:19:02.840
<v Speaker 1>remember them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

389
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.680
<v Speaker 1>and each of those subsystems is </v>
<v Speaker 1>important enough so that there's a neuro</v>

390
00:19:06.681 --> 00:19:07.514
<v Speaker 1>architecture devoted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some of those neural architectures </v>

391
00:19:10.971 --> 00:19:14.750
<v Speaker 1>are flexible enough so that if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't develop in one brain area,</v>

392
00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:16.280
<v Speaker 1>they'll develop in another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

393
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.173
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly as if the location of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these functions is specifically </v>

394
00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:23.930
<v Speaker 1>determined in advance before </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

395
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.920
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a baby and it has,</v>

396
00:19:27.921 --> 00:19:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy and the epilepsy is really bad,</v>

397
00:19:30.291 --> 00:19:32.960
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they'll take out the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>left or right hemisphere.</v>

398
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And if they do that early enough doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really seem to have much consequence for</v>

399
00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:38.240
<v Speaker 1>the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:19:38.241 --> 00:19:39.470
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>

401
00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:40.304
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of the brain that problem fairly </v>

402
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.103
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in some sense it's as if the </v>

403
00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:45.104
<v Speaker 1>cortical elements of the brain are </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory that can be inhabited in </v>

404
00:19:49.551 --> 00:19:51.980
<v Speaker 1>colonized by the lower levels of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

405
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:56.240
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say that the lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of the brain,</v>

406
00:19:56.241 --> 00:19:59.930
<v Speaker 1>including the visual input systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would just as soon call a nice,</v>

407
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.793
<v Speaker 1>what we call the visual cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if there's no visual cortex because </v>

408
00:20:03.801 --> 00:20:04.634
<v Speaker 1>it's been removed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll just go call tonight as </v>

409
00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:08.150
<v Speaker 1>part of the auditory cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

410
00:20:08.151 --> 00:20:12.640
<v Speaker 1>and what you see in other situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes is that people have high,</v>

411
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.483
<v Speaker 1>high hydrocephaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that their </v>

412
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.030
<v Speaker 1>cerebral spinal fluid builds up in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

413
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>And so the ventricles get very enlarged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take an x ray or an MRI or</v>

414
00:20:23.631 --> 00:20:25.070
<v Speaker 1>other sort of scan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if these people,</v>

415
00:20:25.071 --> 00:20:25.904
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that their entire skull is </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of water except for like a half </v>

416
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.220
<v Speaker 1>inch thin slice of court at old tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the water,</v>

417
00:20:34.221 --> 00:20:35.054
<v Speaker 1>like a balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the guys who was like that </v>

418
00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.650
<v Speaker 1>had a phd in mathematics from Cambridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

419
00:20:39.651 --> 00:20:42.140
<v Speaker 1>5% of his brain tissue was intact.</v>

420
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.093
<v Speaker 1>Now it was pretty active that 5% and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could also be sure that it would not </v>

421
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.350
<v Speaker 1>have been very resilient to damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

422
00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 1>So part of the reason that we have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excess of cortical tissue,</v>

423
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.533
<v Speaker 1>so to speak is because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to be resilient to assaults and </v>

424
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:00.880
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it does appear,</v>

425
00:21:00.881 --> 00:21:02.530
<v Speaker 1>perhaps this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

426
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.520
<v Speaker 1>this is the sort of discussion that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Summers kicked out of Harvard.</v>

427
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like men are,</v>

428
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.340
<v Speaker 1>are somewhat more differentiated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their cortical function than women.</v>

429
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.720
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very small subset of spatial skills that</v>

430
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:17.554
<v Speaker 1>men seem to have an advantage in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the price they pay for that is that </v>

431
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:20.944
<v Speaker 1>they're much more susceptible to a brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>malfunction and also to brain damage </v>

432
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:28.270
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have redundancy built</v>
<v Speaker 1>in to the same degree women do.</v>

433
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.523
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the reason why there </v>

434
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.980
<v Speaker 1>were far more boys who have learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>disabilities for example,</v>

435
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 1>than there are women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

436
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:37.443
<v Speaker 1>now people debate about that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's contaminated with concerns about </v>

437
00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:40.954
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

438
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

439
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.043
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the brain's gone all these like </v>

440
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 1>specialized sub circuits and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>variable in their expression.</v>

441
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:51.574
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that basically means is that on </v>

442
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 1>average across people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're likely to be located in the same</v>

443
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:58.450
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's,</v>

444
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.640
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some discrepancies,</v>

445
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:04.120
<v Speaker 1>cause lefthanders are different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>right handers and people also have mixed</v>

446
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:04.954
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so their brains can be organized in </v>

447
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 1>ways that are not exactly cononical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're saying roughly speaking,</v>

448
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.423
<v Speaker 1>and it extends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it extends in some weird ways to </v>

449
00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:15.724
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that you wouldn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>think could possibly be organized in </v>

450
00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:19.720
<v Speaker 1>that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

451
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.243
<v Speaker 1>the part of the brain that you use for </v>
<v Speaker 1>silent reading and the visual Cortex is </v>

452
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:29.710
<v Speaker 1>back here and then the auditory cortex </v>
<v Speaker 1>is about here.</v>

453
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.933
<v Speaker 1>And then the part of the brain that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>use for silent reading is where the </v>

454
00:22:33.491 --> 00:22:37.600
<v Speaker 1>auditory and the visual cortex overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>

455
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:38.434
<v Speaker 1>So what it means is that you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and you hear them because your </v>

456
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 1>eyes are using the auditory cortex as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representational structures.</v>

457
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:45.454
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out that people who </v>

458
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:51.040
<v Speaker 1>silent read pretty much used the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain area to do that.</v>

459
00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think about that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological preparedness in some sense.</v>

460
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:59.260
<v Speaker 1>But of course people didn't learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read silently til 500 years ago,</v>

461
00:22:59.261 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

462
00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:04.840
<v Speaker 1>even the earliest literate people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them read out loud,</v>

463
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.300
<v Speaker 1>silent reading was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare phenomenon.</v>

464
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Julius Caesar could read silently and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people thought that that was part of his</v>

465
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.560
<v Speaker 1>magical power because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's pretty damn weird.</v>

466
00:23:14.561 --> 00:23:16.510
<v Speaker 1>You know that you can use your eyes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

467
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you can all do it.</v>

468
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.790
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

469
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 1>anybody can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

470
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.423
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty new thing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary horizon and to be able to </v>

471
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:26.620
<v Speaker 1>hear with your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like good work guys.</v>

472
00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:28.960
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not an easy thing to manage.</v>

473
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

474
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.400
<v Speaker 1>the brain is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has specialized subsystem,</v>

475
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.253
<v Speaker 1>but it's a dynamic biological systems so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can muck about with it quite a bit </v>

476
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:41.110
<v Speaker 1>and it'll set itself up in slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>

477
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.303
<v Speaker 1>So the systems aren't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>localized exactly the same place in </v>

478
00:23:45.861 --> 00:23:47.690
<v Speaker 1>every one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But roughly speaking,</v>

479
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 1>everyone has those systems and roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

480
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:53.540
<v Speaker 1>they're in the same place across people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

481
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of variability and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that makes you know,</v>

482
00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:57.983
<v Speaker 1>Mri studies in the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very difficult to interpret because if </v>

483
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:04.250
<v Speaker 1>you average across a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means is you blur things out,</v>

484
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you can only extract out the </v>

485
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:07.214
<v Speaker 1>commonalities and although you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting better and better at </v>

486
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:09.890
<v Speaker 1>dealing with that.</v>

487
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

488
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.313
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other ways that you can think </v>

489
00:24:19.611 --> 00:24:20.444
<v Speaker 1>about the brain too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all approaches to </v>

490
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:23.770
<v Speaker 1>understanding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

491
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.620
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

492
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex thing.</v>

493
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.880
<v Speaker 1>In fact it's the most complex thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

494
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.103
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are more patterns of combinations </v>

495
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.193
<v Speaker 1>of neuro connections in your brain than </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are subatomic particles in the </v>

496
00:24:36.681 --> 00:24:38.360
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you are,</v>

497
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.283
<v Speaker 1>I know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't believe that because it </v>

498
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:40.754
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can do the math and you'll </v>

499
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:42.824
<v Speaker 1>figure out that it's actually right it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're the most complicated thing </v>

500
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:46.994
<v Speaker 1>there is and by a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense there's more space </v>

501
00:24:51.201 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 1>inside your head then there is space </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside your head.</v>

502
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.510
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

503
00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:57.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can conceptualize space as </v>

504
00:24:59.241 --> 00:25:03.710
<v Speaker 1>the number of ways that something can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>configured and that state space,</v>

505
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a a magnitude measurement,</v>

506
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the distance between things,</v>

507
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:11.000
<v Speaker 1>well that's another way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing space.</v>

508
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.820
<v Speaker 1>But if you're wanting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to think about big,</v>

509
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:15.523
<v Speaker 1>what's inside you is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's bigger than what's </v>

510
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:19.394
<v Speaker 1>outside you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly that way in terms of </v>

511
00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:22.700
<v Speaker 1>complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you factor in the other brains,</v>

512
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

513
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:26.930
<v Speaker 1>So that's very much we're thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that,</v>

514
00:25:26.931 --> 00:25:29.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we don't understand about the brain</v>

515
00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:31.460
<v Speaker 1>is going to fill many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many books.</v>

516
00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:34.850
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we really don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand his consciousness,</v>

517
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 1>people just don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't really look,</v>

518
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that consciousness is an</v>

519
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:43.400
<v Speaker 1>emergent late evolutionary function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

520
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:45.740
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't really look like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

521
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when people become demented and,</v>

522
00:25:48.061 --> 00:25:48.894
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose almost all of their higher </v>

523
00:25:50.001 --> 00:25:50.834
<v Speaker 1>cortical function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt there's still </v>

524
00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:54.710
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so consciousness might be way,</v>

525
00:25:54.711 --> 00:25:56.450
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way older than we think.</v>

526
00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's highly probable.</v>

527
00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a hypothalamic cat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

528
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.460
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly a wake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

529
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.160
<v Speaker 1>and distinguishing between awake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious is no easy thing.</v>

530
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.971
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

531
00:26:07.971 --> 00:26:09.590
<v Speaker 1>animals aren't conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

532
00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:10.424
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.100
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what people norm normally think</v>

534
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:18.560
<v Speaker 1>is that humans are different than other </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

535
00:26:18.561 --> 00:26:21.740
<v Speaker 1>And so before you anthropomorphize an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>

536
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 1>you should be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's complete rubbish.</v>

537
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.173
<v Speaker 1>I think it's exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before you assume that humans have </v>

538
00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:30.104
<v Speaker 1>attributes that animals don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to prove it because there's </v>

539
00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:34.550
<v Speaker 1>continuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>

540
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:35.384
<v Speaker 1>tremendous continuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's right to anthropomorphize </v>

541
00:26:38.871 --> 00:26:39.704
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong is to presume a priority </v>

542
00:26:42.861 --> 00:26:43.694
<v Speaker 1>that humans are qualitatively different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there are some very bizarre things </v>

543
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>

544
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 1>you know these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have opposable thumbs,</v>

545
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can grip things.</v>

546
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a massive deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out that there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

548
00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:00.150
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

549
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.103
<v Speaker 1>your brain maps your body onto its </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface onto its motor strip and it's </v>

550
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 1>sensory strip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are roughly here on the brain.</v>

551
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.773
<v Speaker 1>And if you take the motor strip or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory strip and you make a </v>

552
00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:16.170
<v Speaker 1>representation of how it represents the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

553
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.270
<v Speaker 1>which is called a Homerun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keyless wilder,</v>

554
00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:21.510
<v Speaker 1>penfield wilder penfield still did this </v>
<v Speaker 1>first at mcgill university.</v>

555
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.673
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this and </v>

556
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.520
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you'll be fortunate enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience it,</v>

557
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:31.530
<v Speaker 1>but people who have brain surgery are </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious when it happens.</v>

558
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.173
<v Speaker 1>And that's so that the surgeons can </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out whether this little part is </v>

559
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 1>doing anything important before they </v>
<v Speaker 1>take it out.</v>

560
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's getting very horrific thought.</v>

561
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.313
<v Speaker 1>But Penn field when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did some of the early psychosurgery </v>

562
00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:46.230
<v Speaker 1>for epilepsy because in tractable </v>
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy,</v>

563
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the only thing to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical surgery,</v>

564
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:49.224
<v Speaker 1>like a corpus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You caught the Corpus callosum for </v>

565
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:52.170
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the,</v>

566
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the electrical storm so to speak,</v>

567
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:58.590
<v Speaker 1>can't transmit across the hemispheres </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole brain won't be affected.</v>

568
00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while he was doing that,</v>

569
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.553
<v Speaker 1>he used the little electrode to map out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface of the brain and he mapped </v>

570
00:28:05.011 --> 00:28:05.844
<v Speaker 1>out the motor strip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just behind the prefrontal </v>

571
00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:09.930
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the sensory strip,</v>

572
00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:10.764
<v Speaker 1>which is just behind that to find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the body representatives or the </v>

573
00:28:14.671 --> 00:28:18.870
<v Speaker 1>brain represents the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically what he showed was that on</v>

574
00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:20.460
<v Speaker 1>the motor strip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:21.323
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thumb has as much representation as </v>

576
00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:28.440
<v Speaker 1>your whole trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically your thumb is as smart from</v>

577
00:28:28.441 --> 00:28:32.580
<v Speaker 1>a motoric perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than you from here to here,</v>

578
00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:33.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well try picking up something with your </v>

579
00:28:35.521 --> 00:28:36.660
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

580
00:28:36.661 --> 00:28:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and you'll figure out exactly why that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

581
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:39.743
<v Speaker 1>And the thumb basically has almost as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much representation as the rest of the </v>

582
00:28:42.691 --> 00:28:43.524
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the hands are like gigantic </v>

583
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 1>balloons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

584
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:48.760
<v Speaker 1>And the arms are a little skinny sticks </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

585
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.850
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater fairly highly</v>

586
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.160
<v Speaker 1>represented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the sensory cortex because</v>

587
00:28:56.161 --> 00:28:57.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be careful about what you,</v>

588
00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.100
<v Speaker 1>what you step on.</v>

589
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.173
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the representation of </v>

590
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:03.894
<v Speaker 1>the feet on the sensory strip is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right beside the representation of </v>

591
00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:09.600
<v Speaker 1>the Genitalia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's crosstalk.</v>

592
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And so some of you are pretty into foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>massages and that's why,</v>

593
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

594
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:16.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a consequence of the overlap.</v>

595
00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Now why that overlap is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly,</v>

596
00:29:19.471 --> 00:29:20.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

597
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.140
<v Speaker 1>maybe the brain had organized itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So particularly sensitive surfaces.</v>

598
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:27.210
<v Speaker 1>We're taking advantage of the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue,</v>

599
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.300
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

600
00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:33.060
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting case of it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>synesthesia and sent in a sense,</v>

601
00:29:33.061 --> 00:29:35.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like sensory synesthesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

602
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:38.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as your brain's concerned,</v>

603
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 1>your all hands and your hands are almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>all thumb and you're quite a bit of feet</v>

604
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:43.924
<v Speaker 1>and your lips are massive and so is your</v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue and your face is very highly </v>

605
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:48.970
<v Speaker 1>represented too.</v>

606
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.953
<v Speaker 1>So basically as far as your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with regards to sensory input </v>

607
00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:54.244
<v Speaker 1>and motor output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're this huge face with great big </v>

608
00:29:56.711 --> 00:29:57.544
<v Speaker 1>lips and tongue and you have massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>balloon like hands and your feet are </v>

609
00:30:00.821 --> 00:30:01.654
<v Speaker 1>pretty big too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a fair bit of sensory </v>

610
00:30:03.191 --> 00:30:05.950
<v Speaker 1>representation for the Genitalia as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

611
00:30:05.951 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 1>And then the body's hardly there at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

612
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.690
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of what a human being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

613
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:11.524
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all thumbs in hands and we talk </v>

614
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:13.294
<v Speaker 1>about what we do with our thumbs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands all the time and we take things </v>

615
00:30:15.701 --> 00:30:16.534
<v Speaker 1>apart with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we put them together and then we </v>

616
00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:19.510
<v Speaker 1>tell everybody else how we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

617
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.643
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're thinking about the </v>

618
00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:24.214
<v Speaker 1>difference between human beings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly encephalitis mammals like </v>

619
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:28.894
<v Speaker 1>dolphins and whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people have claimed that </v>

620
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 1>dolphins and whales are extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and you know,</v>

621
00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:37.930
<v Speaker 1>dolphins don't seem particularly simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>minded,</v>

622
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 1>but look at the things they're in.</v>

623
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Like if they're in these test tube </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped bodies,</v>

624
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flip sand up into buildings?</v>

625
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:49.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like they can't manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the embodied the,</v>

626
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:49.863
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which their nervous system</v>
<v Speaker 1>is embodied turns out to be </v>

627
00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:53.674
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily important when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand something like the </v>

628
00:30:55.931 --> 00:30:59.440
<v Speaker 1>relationship between cortical tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass and intelligence,</v>

629
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:04.630
<v Speaker 1>you can't just think about mind as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's floating like a soul in</v>

630
00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:08.320
<v Speaker 1>space if it isn't stuck in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can use,</v>

631
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.393
<v Speaker 1>it's not particularly good for anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything that human beings would </v>

632
00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:16.150
<v Speaker 1>regard as particularly intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

633
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.680
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

634
00:31:20.681 --> 00:31:21.514
<v Speaker 1>here's another way that you can think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the brain and you can also think </v>

635
00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:24.064
<v Speaker 1>about it as divided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of a Schema that there was </v>

636
00:31:28.781 --> 00:31:30.970
<v Speaker 1>more popular with the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologist,</v>

637
00:31:30.971 --> 00:31:32.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

638
00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:33.483
<v Speaker 1>you can think about the front part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain is being concerned with motor </v>

639
00:31:35.621 --> 00:31:36.454
<v Speaker 1>output.</v>

640
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:37.953
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the motor strip that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows you to sequence activities and </v>

641
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:42.874
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make these kinetic melodies that are </v>

642
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:46.420
<v Speaker 1>chains of things that you know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

643
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in front of that is the </v>

644
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:53.530
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal cortex and the prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex grew out of the motor cortex.</v>

645
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.753
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty interesting because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about that from an </v>

646
00:31:57.131 --> 00:31:57.964
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that implies is that thought is </v>

647
00:32:01.361 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 1>abstracted action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

648
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:05.703
<v Speaker 1>Because that's where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so basically what you're doing when </v>

649
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:08.494
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking is you're figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 1>action sequences that you could </v>

650
00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:12.364
<v Speaker 1>implement and modeling their </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences and evaluating them before </v>

651
00:32:15.821 --> 00:32:16.654
<v Speaker 1>you implement them in behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think it was Alfred </v>

652
00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.810
<v Speaker 1>North Whitehead though I should might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting that wrong.</v>

653
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:24.170
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

654
00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 1>we think so that our thoughts can die </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of us.</v>

655
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a lovely way of thinking about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

656
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:30.544
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like we generate </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract avatars of ourselves acting in </v>

657
00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:37.720
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the Avatar does something stupid,</v>

658
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

659
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.220
<v Speaker 1>we kill it often and we don't implement </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in our own bodies.</v>

660
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:44.383
<v Speaker 1>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically we're thrown off abstract </v>

661
00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 1>representations of ourselves so they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>perish instead of us.</v>

662
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:50.763
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So also what you do when you're playing </v>

663
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:53.204
<v Speaker 1>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So does anybody know where the word </v>

664
00:32:57.021 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Avatar came from?</v>

665
00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.400
<v Speaker 2>Anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

666
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

667
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.393
<v Speaker 2>directly.</v>

668
00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>

669
00:33:10.201 --> 00:33:13.140
<v Speaker 1>So an Avatar is the embodiment of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>daddy on earth.</v>

670
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.280
<v Speaker 1>He's such a cool idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting that that would word</v>

671
00:33:17.281 --> 00:33:18.114
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was used to represent your fictional </v>

672
00:33:19.561 --> 00:33:21.870
<v Speaker 1>self insight in a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

673
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:22.853
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the mysteries about words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know how those things get </v>

674
00:33:24.871 --> 00:33:27.000
<v Speaker 1>generated or catch on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

675
00:33:27.001 --> 00:33:31.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such an interesting idea that you,</v>

676
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

677
00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.563
<v Speaker 1>you limit yourself in some interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and toss yourself into an abstract </v>

678
00:33:36.601 --> 00:33:38.910
<v Speaker 1>world and you think that's really fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

679
00:33:38.911 --> 00:33:39.744
<v Speaker 1>And then that thing dies and gets reborn</v>
<v Speaker 1>or does whatever the hell it wants to </v>

680
00:33:42.421 --> 00:33:44.130
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think that's very entertaining,</v>

681
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.550
<v Speaker 1>but the real you is behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.590
<v Speaker 1>so you can toss off all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

683
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:50.483
<v Speaker 1>what do you call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pseudo selves in a sense and play about </v>

684
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.750
<v Speaker 1>with them without any real costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Few and maybe with some benefit.</v>

685
00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.910
<v Speaker 1>And that the term for that is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>avatar.</v>

686
00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:01.560
<v Speaker 1>That's very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

687
00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:03.060
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

688
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.970
<v Speaker 1>it is an extension of what you do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to abstract,</v>

689
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're,</v>

690
00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.730
<v Speaker 1>you're producing simulated worlds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you act in a simulated way.</v>

691
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.593
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you do when you were </v>

692
00:34:15.161 --> 00:34:17.000
<v Speaker 1>imagining things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

693
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you do when you write </v>
<v Speaker 1>books of fiction.</v>

694
00:34:19.811 --> 00:34:21.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do when you go to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

695
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:24.250
<v Speaker 1>And so all avatars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing,</v>

696
00:34:24.251 --> 00:34:27.910
<v Speaker 1>one form or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of those are archetipal avatars.</v>

697
00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way the Russians,</v>

698
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:32.943
<v Speaker 1>the Russians had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long and illustrious history of </v>

699
00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:37.960
<v Speaker 1>producing psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

700
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.900
<v Speaker 1>and I'm hoping I'm getting this right to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pavlov.</v>

701
00:34:40.901 --> 00:34:42.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Pavlov and Pavlov's dog.</v>

702
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.833
<v Speaker 1>Pavlov was Leery as instructor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And luria was the instructor of Vinegar </v>

703
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Dova and socal off who discovered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orienting response,</v>

704
00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:51.154
<v Speaker 1>which we're going to talk about it a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's the most important </v>

705
00:34:53.231 --> 00:34:55.270
<v Speaker 1>discovery that was ever made in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience.</v>

706
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have gotten a Nobel prize </v>

707
00:34:57.251 --> 00:34:59.380
<v Speaker 1>for that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

708
00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.573
<v Speaker 1>and then soak law of in vinegar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dover were precursors to gray and great </v>

709
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:05.343
<v Speaker 1>wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed the most well thought through </v>

710
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:12.190
<v Speaker 1>theory of anxiety and incentive </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

711
00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.060
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

712
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.883
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to kind of know that </v>

713
00:35:16.961 --> 00:35:21.040
<v Speaker 1>developmental history luria was also </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by Piaget by the way.</v>

714
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And he was also influenced by a thinker </v>
<v Speaker 1>from mit called Norbert Wiener,</v>

715
00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:29.800
<v Speaker 1>which is like the perfect name for </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who goes to mit.</v>

716
00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.300
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a real,</v>

717
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.770
<v Speaker 1>he was a real genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

718
00:35:32.771 --> 00:35:35.410
<v Speaker 1>what are the pioneers of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence research?</v>

719
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:36.543
<v Speaker 1>And he developed cybernetic of embodied </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognition and the cybernetic models are </v>

720
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:45.150
<v Speaker 1>the models that gray uses in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychology of anxiety.</v>

721
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.023
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to know the history of the </v>

722
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:51.510
<v Speaker 1>development of these ideas because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how things connect behind the scenes</v>

723
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:52.344
<v Speaker 1>in ways that you wouldn't really think </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible took me years to figure out </v>

724
00:35:55.561 --> 00:35:56.394
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those intellectual connections by the </v>

725
00:35:58.111 --> 00:35:59.070
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

726
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.083
<v Speaker 1>so if you remember them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you won't have to spend years </v>

727
00:36:04.351 --> 00:36:07.050
<v Speaker 1>figuring them up yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

728
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:09.263
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways that luria </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized the brain was as motor </v>

729
00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:13.704
<v Speaker 1>versus sensory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the motor was the motor circuit </v>

730
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:17.573
<v Speaker 1>and then the prefrontal cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that determined the range of </v>

731
00:36:21.451 --> 00:36:22.284
<v Speaker 1>potentials that you could manifest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and space and also helped you </v>

732
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:29.160
<v Speaker 1>implement them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the back of the brain basically</v>

733
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.720
<v Speaker 1>that rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

734
00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:31.554
<v Speaker 1>the back half was the sensory half and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sensory half is a lot of it's </v>

735
00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:36.390
<v Speaker 1>auditory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

736
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:39.630
<v Speaker 1>that's about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a huge chunk of it is visual.</v>

737
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

738
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.553
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's areas that are more central to </v>

739
00:36:46.411 --> 00:36:47.244
<v Speaker 1>the brain that are much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much older that are associated with </v>

740
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.430
<v Speaker 1>olfaction and taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause those are the,</v>

741
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.720
<v Speaker 1>has been around for a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>

742
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And the smell circuits in and taste </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuits are extraordinarily archaic.</v>

743
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.910
<v Speaker 1>So they're not part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking the sensory cortex.</v>

744
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.190
<v Speaker 1>So you can think of motor versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory,</v>

745
00:37:05.191 --> 00:37:08.070
<v Speaker 1>that sort of front versus back </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>

746
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.460
<v Speaker 1>And then you can also think about a left</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus right distinction.</v>

747
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.863
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people often think of the left as </v>

748
00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:18.690
<v Speaker 1>the linguistic hemisphere and the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the non-linguistic hemisphere.</v>

749
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's roughly accurate if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about lefthanded males.</v>

750
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.493
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's roughly accurate for everyone </v>

751
00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:25.554
<v Speaker 1>else too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

752
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.513
<v Speaker 1>but it's mostly accurate for them cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more complications in brain </v>

753
00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:32.280
<v Speaker 1>lateralization in people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a simple thing.</v>

754
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:33.923
<v Speaker 1>One of Leary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a student's guide named El Conan </v>

755
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:38.873
<v Speaker 1>Goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with an alternative theory of </v>

756
00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:42.120
<v Speaker 1>hemispheric function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is better.</v>

757
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought that the right hemisphere was</v>

758
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:45.834
<v Speaker 1>specialized for the initial stages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty analysis and detection and that </v>

759
00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:53.910
<v Speaker 1>the left hemisphere was specialized for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

760
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.103
<v Speaker 1>creation of the detailed responses to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things and the storage of those </v>

761
00:37:58.891 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 1>detailed responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the back of the,</v>

762
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.950
<v Speaker 1>in the back of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he thought of the right hemisphere is</v>

763
00:38:04.951 --> 00:38:09.300
<v Speaker 1>an anomaly detection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And first stage modeling system that was</v>

764
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:10.134
<v Speaker 1>primarily under limbic control and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that the linguistic capacities </v>

765
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:14.574
<v Speaker 1>of the left hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're merely a reflection of its </v>

766
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:19.650
<v Speaker 1>capacity to generate detailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>

767
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:20.821
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

768
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:21.654
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you that for a specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason because it's relevant to graze </v>

769
00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:24.864
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

770
00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

771
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

772
00:38:27.491 --> 00:38:30.970
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to describe to you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration,</v>

773
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:36.030
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking between Swanson's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortal and graze model and the orienting</v>

774
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 1>reflex mod models of soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clove and vote Victor Cordova.</v>

775
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.563
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>people started to get interested in the </v>

776
00:38:44.351 --> 00:38:47.230
<v Speaker 1>lower levels of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really I would say,</v>

777
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.120
<v Speaker 1>well the animal psychologists got there </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

778
00:38:49.121 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 1>but there was a flurry of activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the hippocampus,</v>

779
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:52.864
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the 1960s and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>begun first by the Russians who are </v>

780
00:38:56.951 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 1>playing around with electrical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

781
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.393
<v Speaker 1>eeg analysis of brain function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know your brain produces a lot of </v>

782
00:39:04.811 --> 00:39:05.644
<v Speaker 1>electrical activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a 100 watt light bulbs where </v>

783
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:09.034
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's busily buzzing away on all of </v>

784
00:39:11.041 --> 00:39:11.874
<v Speaker 1>the things that it does and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some low resolution insight into </v>

785
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:15.874
<v Speaker 1>brain function by analyzing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different patterns of electrical </v>

786
00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:19.894
<v Speaker 1>activity it produces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been likened to listening to a </v>

787
00:39:21.911 --> 00:39:26.830
<v Speaker 1>symphony with a stethoscope stethoscope </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a six foot concrete shell,</v>

788
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:31.540
<v Speaker 1>which is approximately correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an investigative technique that</v>

789
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 1>has some utility.</v>

790
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that,</v>

791
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.870
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this to you,</v>

792
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I put you in a chair and I strapped eeg </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrodes to you.</v>

793
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And then now and then I have you </v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to a beep,</v>

794
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:48.700
<v Speaker 1>beep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beep,</v>

795
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.100
<v Speaker 1>beep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there'd be a little fraction of</v>

796
00:39:51.101 --> 00:39:55.240
<v Speaker 1>time and I'd play a louder beep beep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that was allowed to beat by the</v>

797
00:39:55.241 --> 00:39:56.074
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there'd be some beeps after </v>

798
00:39:57.971 --> 00:39:58.804
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if I did that to you a hundred </v>

799
00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:01.894
<v Speaker 1>times and then I averaged the manner in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which your brain waves were manifesting </v>

800
00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:08.350
<v Speaker 1>themselves across all those hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

801
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.423
<v Speaker 1>I could extract out a particular pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>of brainwave that was locked to that </v>

802
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:18.670
<v Speaker 1>stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I could infer I couldn't,</v>

803
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.713
<v Speaker 1>I would first of all have the wave form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would have a temporal element and </v>

804
00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:23.524
<v Speaker 1>I could actually do some calculations if</v>
<v Speaker 1>my instrumentation was sophisticated </v>

805
00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:30.490
<v Speaker 1>enough about exactly where that wave </v>
<v Speaker 1>form was emanating.</v>

806
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So keep that in the back of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What soak glove and vinegar Dova started</v>

807
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:38.320
<v Speaker 1>investigating was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

808
00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.300
<v Speaker 1>that's an electrophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation.</v>

809
00:40:40.301 --> 00:40:42.790
<v Speaker 1>What they started investigating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something a bit simpler,</v>

810
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.530
<v Speaker 1>which was skin conductance response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that if I take you and I</v>

811
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:48.423
<v Speaker 1>put you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what the scientologists used to </v>

812
00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:51.760
<v Speaker 1>read in grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

813
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.550
<v Speaker 1>in case you're wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

814
00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.900
<v Speaker 1>in grams or memory traces that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically left from the time that we</v>

815
00:40:58.901 --> 00:41:01.270
<v Speaker 1>inhabited Venus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's their theories.</v>

816
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something like that.</v>

817
00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:07.570
<v Speaker 1>So if I put you in a chair and I hook up</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrodes to your hands,</v>

818
00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I can pass a current through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrodes through your skin.</v>

819
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.453
<v Speaker 1>And how well that current is transmitted</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to depend on how much you're </v>

820
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 1>sweating and how much you're sweating is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to depend on how much your body is</v>

821
00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:20.830
<v Speaker 1>preparing to act.</v>

822
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:21.913
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it starts to prepare to do something </v>

823
00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 1>is that sweats a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

824
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.020
<v Speaker 1>I presume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you start acting,</v>

825
00:41:29.021 --> 00:41:29.854
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he might as well prepare to cool </v>

826
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:32.860
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it happens very,</v>

827
00:41:32.861 --> 00:41:36.740
<v Speaker 1>very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I play a tone to you,</v>

828
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tone goes off.</v>

829
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 1>What will happen is that your skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>conductance will increase.</v>

830
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.740
<v Speaker 1>And then if I play the tone again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

831
00:41:44.741 --> 00:41:47.120
<v Speaker 1>it'll increase again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but less.</v>

832
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.983
<v Speaker 1>And then it'll increase again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But last and then soon I can play the </v>

833
00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:51.764
<v Speaker 1>tone to you and it's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now then if I take the tone and I </v>

834
00:41:56.751 --> 00:41:59.120
<v Speaker 1>increased the volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if I change the pitch,</v>

835
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:03.710
<v Speaker 1>or if I even changed the timing of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any little tiny change whatsoever,</v>

836
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.930
<v Speaker 1>and I play the tone to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>

837
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:08.480
<v Speaker 1>the original response will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinstated.</v>

838
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 1>So the Russians were thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

839
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:11.954
<v Speaker 1>they were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

840
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.340
<v Speaker 1>well what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that imply?</v>

841
00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

842
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.393
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's analogous to an earlier phenomenon </v>

843
00:42:20.081 --> 00:42:23.810
<v Speaker 1>that was known as habituation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a snail,</v>

844
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 1>it'll come out of its shell and you tap </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

845
00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 1>then it'll go into a shell and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>will slowly come out of its shell.</v>

846
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:31.244
<v Speaker 1>You can tap it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're into teasing snails and </v>

847
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that enough,</v>

848
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.180
<v Speaker 1>the stale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just start to ignore you.</v>

849
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Now you could call that fatigue because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be fatigue or you could call it</v>

850
00:42:43.671 --> 00:42:44.504
<v Speaker 1>habituation is what happens is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory nerves are no longer sending a </v>

851
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:51.110
<v Speaker 1>signal to the motor nerves to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing contract.</v>

852
00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 1>And so that's habituation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of learning.</v>

853
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.403
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of learned irrelevance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Soak love and vinegar Dova weren't </v>

854
00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.353
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with the sort of odd </v>
<v Speaker 1>hermiticity that was implied by the </v>

855
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:04.844
<v Speaker 1>habituation models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they came up with a slightly </v>

856
00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:11.621
<v Speaker 1>different suggestion for what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening when the orienting response</v>

857
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

858
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:13.963
<v Speaker 1>Was he was declining across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They suggested that what you did when </v>

859
00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you were listening to a tone was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build an interior model of the tone.</v>

860
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.413
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a representation of the tone in </v>

861
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:28.790
<v Speaker 1>all of it's important dimensions in so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as you were capable of doing that,</v>

862
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your particular level of hearing </v>

863
00:43:31.011 --> 00:43:35.930
<v Speaker 1>acuity and that you had inferred that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tone was irrelevant.</v>

864
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So you've mapped it in the map says this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is safe territory,</v>

865
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:43.580
<v Speaker 1>and then when the tone occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the map inhibits your response.</v>

866
00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.340
<v Speaker 1>If something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model inhibits your response.</v>

867
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.413
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea would be you're always </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying a model of the world around in </v>

868
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:51.104
<v Speaker 1>your head that you've learned and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>long as the world is behaving in </v>

869
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:56.120
<v Speaker 1>accordance with that model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you stay calm.</v>

870
00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.580
<v Speaker 1>A very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart idea.</v>

871
00:43:58.581 --> 00:43:59.414
<v Speaker 1>And so the orienting reflects is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>initial response when something happens </v>

872
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:05.810
<v Speaker 1>that your map does not cover.</v>

873
00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.053
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

874
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.080
<v Speaker 1>And they localize that to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus,</v>

875
00:44:15.081 --> 00:44:17.780
<v Speaker 1>which is very good at them with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive equipment.</v>

876
00:44:17.781 --> 00:44:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Back in the 1960s these were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart people.</v>

877
00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.213
<v Speaker 1>The Russians got there way before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Americans and they western </v>

878
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:26.414
<v Speaker 1>Europeans because who are the only ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing investigations into this sort of </v>

879
00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:30.344
<v Speaker 1>thing at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Russians had figured out </v>

880
00:44:33.391 --> 00:44:34.224
<v Speaker 1>very early that the brain was stuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the body and so that bodily </v>

881
00:44:37.831 --> 00:44:38.664
<v Speaker 1>responses and emotional responses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational responses were were valid </v>

882
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:43.794
<v Speaker 1>indexes of of brain activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took the western neuropsychologists </v>

883
00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.990
<v Speaker 1>till the 1990s really to start figuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>this out.</v>

884
00:44:51.991 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And it was Antonio Damasio who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who led the way he,</v>

885
00:44:55.591 --> 00:44:56.424
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had generated this hypothesis called </v>

886
00:44:58.321 --> 00:44:59.154
<v Speaker 1>the somatic marker hypothesis would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of the way that you evaluate </v>

887
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:07.440
<v Speaker 1>things when they occur is by reading off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the report of your body.</v>

888
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:08.843
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's going to react in various </v>

889
00:45:09.691 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>

890
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's going to tell you what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is.</v>

891
00:45:12.241 --> 00:45:13.074
<v Speaker 1>And the way reason he figured that out </v>
<v Speaker 1>was because he was reading abstracts </v>

892
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:17.514
<v Speaker 1>from Russian neuropsychologists and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the only one doing it in the late </v>

893
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.930
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell though,</v>

894
00:45:21.931 --> 00:45:22.764
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was because I read gray and </v>

895
00:45:24.991 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 1>gray had done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

896
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians got there very early and it</v>

897
00:45:29.731 --> 00:45:30.564
<v Speaker 1>was so clove and vinegar Dova that </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically is basically identified the </v>

898
00:45:34.471 --> 00:45:35.304
<v Speaker 1>orienting response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think that deserves a </v>

899
00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prize is because it's the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that piaget was talking about.</v>

900
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.370
<v Speaker 1>You know how Piaget would say that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child will run through its Schemas,</v>

901
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.213
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the Schema produces something </v>

902
00:45:49.411 --> 00:45:50.610
<v Speaker 1>novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

903
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:51.444
<v Speaker 1>so the kid is moving its arms and bang </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wax into a little immobile and the </v>

904
00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:58.020
<v Speaker 1>child Sorta startles but says do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

905
00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then it tries to do it again.</v>

906
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:01.134
<v Speaker 1>So it tries to replicate the emergence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the phenomena by modeling it's </v>

907
00:46:05.971 --> 00:46:10.050
<v Speaker 1>interactions with it and constructing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psycho motor perceptual schema.</v>

908
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:15.290
<v Speaker 1>But the initial like burst of awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an orienting reflects.</v>

909
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.340
<v Speaker 1>And so what soak love and vinegar Nova </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered was how people reacted to the</v>

910
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:23.310
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a major thing man.</v>

911
00:46:23.311 --> 00:46:24.144
<v Speaker 1>Because everything you learn is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of you interacting with the </v>

912
00:46:27.781 --> 00:46:29.640
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

913
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge discovery and you know,</v>

914
00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it's psychology is a funny science </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we never,</v>

915
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 1>we've never really figured out when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've discovered something that's really</v>

916
00:46:39.511 --> 00:46:40.680
<v Speaker 1>worth discovering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

917
00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:42.540
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the discovery,</v>

918
00:46:42.541 --> 00:46:43.374
<v Speaker 1>the orienting reflects that was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>home run milner olds and milner </v>

919
00:46:46.651 --> 00:46:49.770
<v Speaker 1>discovered the reward system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the incentive reward system.</v>

920
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:54.130
<v Speaker 1>When was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was in the take.</v>

921
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:55.970
<v Speaker 1>That was in the early seventies it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

922
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:56.803
<v Speaker 1>It was Nobel prize winning stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the whole circuit for </v>

923
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:01.554
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion and exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a big deal to discover </v>

924
00:47:04.891 --> 00:47:05.461
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

925
00:47:05.461 --> 00:47:06.294
<v Speaker 1>and then Panksepp discovered the play </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit and that's another whopping </v>

926
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:10.164
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I really do think these things are </v>

927
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:14.730
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to discovery continents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal.</v>

928
00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:16.530
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason</v>

929
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not modesty I don't think,</v>

930
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.490
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists don't seem to be that good</v>

931
00:47:26.491 --> 00:47:27.324
<v Speaker 1>at figuring out when what they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered is like a major league </v>

932
00:47:29.981 --> 00:47:31.660
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

933
00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.533
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

934
00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:33.913
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

935
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.610
<v Speaker 1>So what happened with regards to Soak </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lovan Vinegar Dover?</v>

936
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.340
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole flurry of,</v>

937
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:47.950
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ideas that their research generated.</v>

938
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that was among artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

939
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigators.</v>

940
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.133
<v Speaker 1>And what they basically concluded was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the way that creatures work in the </v>

941
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:04.231
<v Speaker 1>world was that they produced expectancy </v>
<v Speaker 1>maps</v>

942
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:07.263
<v Speaker 1>of how the world would lay itself out </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they acted in a particular way and </v>

943
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:14.980
<v Speaker 1>then they would transform the mortal </v>
<v Speaker 1>internally.</v>

944
00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.773
<v Speaker 1>This is probably how you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think they transformed the model </v>

945
00:48:19.481 --> 00:48:22.660
<v Speaker 1>internally and make a prediction about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the outcome of their behavior would</v>

946
00:48:22.661 --> 00:48:23.494
<v Speaker 1>be</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that would manifest that </v>

947
00:48:25.781 --> 00:48:29.350
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is stimulus.</v>

948
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.350
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea was stimulus response.</v>

949
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually true if you don't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>much above the spine.</v>

950
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.570
<v Speaker 1>So at the behaviors were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're right about that.</v>

951
00:48:37.571 --> 00:48:38.404
<v Speaker 1>There are deterministic levels at which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nervous system operates or or </v>

952
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 1>roughly deterministic.</v>

953
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 1>But as the amount of brain tissue </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases,</v>

954
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.020
<v Speaker 1>as the number of processing interfaces </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases,</v>

955
00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:54.010
<v Speaker 1>the number of neuro connections between </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulus and response increase.</v>

956
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.143
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it's deterministic starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fall apart because it's chained </v>

957
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.210
<v Speaker 1>complex chain networks of activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the,</v>

958
00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:02.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the action or the stimulus and the </v>

959
00:49:04.091 --> 00:49:04.924
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are circuits that are really </v>

960
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:07.054
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one neuron or two neurons and </v>

961
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:10.270
<v Speaker 1>those things are super fast and you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

962
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:11.493
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to jump out of the way </v>

963
00:49:11.921 --> 00:49:13.150
<v Speaker 1>of the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

964
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.160
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about snakes.</v>

965
00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:18.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want your eyes to activate</v>
<v Speaker 1>your spinal cord.</v>

966
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 1>So you jumped to the side that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

967
00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's way too fast to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

968
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:25.720
<v Speaker 1>So when we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've conserved all those,</v>

969
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic systems because we need to be </v>

970
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:29.104
<v Speaker 1>fast and you can model the way those </v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic systems work by using the </v>

971
00:49:33.491 --> 00:49:34.324
<v Speaker 1>standard tendance of behaviorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can get quite long way doing </v>

972
00:49:37.511 --> 00:49:39.170
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't get everywhere.</v>

973
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 1>So the mapping idea that I'm describing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

974
00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:43.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean in part it's,</v>

975
00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:47.140
<v Speaker 1>it's the entrance of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cognition into the,</v>

976
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.240
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into behaviorism.</v>

977
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

978
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 1>it was more complicated than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was part of it.</v>

979
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:54.063
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

980
00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that kind of makes sense.</v>

981
00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that's the way you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

982
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:02.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see something,</v>

983
00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.653
<v Speaker 1>you think about what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you figure out what you're going to do </v>

984
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.220
<v Speaker 1>and then you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it either works,</v>

985
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.360
<v Speaker 1>in which case that's great for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>or it doesn't work.</v>

986
00:50:13.361 --> 00:50:17.050
<v Speaker 1>And then you have an orienting reflex </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was their basic idea,</v>

987
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:18.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

988
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.840
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty smart idea.</v>

989
00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.840
<v Speaker 1>It turns out to be wrong in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>

990
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.110
<v Speaker 1>and I can't even tell you exactly why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong,</v>

991
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:30.973
<v Speaker 1>although I do know that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that it's wrong is that it turns </v>

992
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:36.074
<v Speaker 1>out that it's way more complicated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce these damn models than anybody </v>

993
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:39.494
<v Speaker 1>thought because the behavior is to at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point and Soak Lovan vinod grid </v>

994
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:46.400
<v Speaker 1>over we're behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of had this implicit idea.</v>

995
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:51.670
<v Speaker 1>You think stimulus response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in between that there's a black box,</v>

996
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:53.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's whatever the brain is doing.</v>

997
00:50:53.601 --> 00:50:54.434
<v Speaker 1>They didn't care about that because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't think you had to take it into </v>

998
00:50:56.391 --> 00:50:57.224
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's still two other elements of </v>

999
00:50:59.331 --> 00:51:03.680
<v Speaker 1>that theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One element is there is a stimulus.</v>

1000
00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Another element is there is a response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1001
00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:11.420
<v Speaker 1>we won't go into the response part yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we will go into the stimulus part.</v>

1002
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:13.003
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you look at someone </v>

1003
00:51:15.381 --> 00:51:17.360
<v Speaker 1>attractive and your heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases.</v>

1004
00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the stimulus</v>

1005
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 1>exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person,</v>

1006
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person's eyes,</v>

1007
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 1>the way their eyes are configured in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the rest of their face.</v>

1008
00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older shape,</v>

1009
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:38.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

1010
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:41.150
<v Speaker 1>What's the stimulus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

1011
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the hell knows?</v>

1012
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Because figuring out what the stimulus </v>
<v Speaker 1>is turns out to be hard and the behavior</v>

1013
00:51:48.371 --> 00:51:50.060
<v Speaker 1>is they just pretended that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1014
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Everything was made out of homogenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocks.</v>

1015
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.950
<v Speaker 1>And when you looked at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they were,</v>

1016
00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.110
<v Speaker 1>and that was the stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

1017
00:51:57.111 --> 00:51:57.944
<v Speaker 1>So they pretended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got rid of having to consider the </v>

1018
00:52:00.831 --> 00:52:01.664
<v Speaker 1>complexity of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember half year damn cortex is </v>

1019
00:52:05.061 --> 00:52:08.270
<v Speaker 1>devoted to seeing it turns out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing is very difficult.</v>

1020
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:09.463
<v Speaker 1>The behavior's just the funnest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That by by just pretending it wasn't a </v>

1021
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:13.964
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just assumed the stimulus was </v>

1022
00:52:16.371 --> 00:52:18.290
<v Speaker 1>given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

1023
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.133
<v Speaker 1>there's the box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a picture of the box on your </v>

1024
00:52:22.971 --> 00:52:23.804
<v Speaker 1>retina.</v>

1025
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.350
<v Speaker 1>That picture is translated into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>little guy inside your hand.</v>

1026
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.540
<v Speaker 1>And then he figures out how to move your</v>
<v Speaker 1>arms.</v>

1027
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:30.763
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1028
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not right.</v>

1029
00:52:32.931 --> 00:52:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very difficult to specify </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stimulus.</v>

1030
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:36.463
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the reason why it's </v>

1031
00:52:39.661 --> 00:52:41.930
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's taken so long to develop artificial</v>

1032
00:52:41.931 --> 00:52:45.530
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and you can't teach the </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn things to see.</v>

1033
00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's because there's no edges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no lines.</v>

1034
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:49.903
<v Speaker 1>There's no primary objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that is something that our brain </v>

1035
00:52:52.581 --> 00:52:54.980
<v Speaker 1>constructs for us on the fly </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously.</v>

1036
00:52:54.981 --> 00:52:55.814
<v Speaker 1>So we think it's just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of you have probably played </v>

1037
00:52:58.761 --> 00:53:01.340
<v Speaker 1>with photoshop trying to adjust an image</v>
<v Speaker 1>chain.</v>

1038
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:02.803
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there lines in that image or there </v>

1039
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:05.930
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are edges.</v>

1040
00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:08.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You increase the resolution,</v>

1041
00:53:08.421 --> 00:53:13.421
<v Speaker 1>it just turns into a massive pixels that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are fundamentally indistinguishable from</v>

1042
00:53:13.701 --> 00:53:14.420
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>

1043
00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.253
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a photograph of someone and </v>

1044
00:53:17.151 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 1>you try to cut them out and put them </v>
<v Speaker 1>against a different background,</v>

1045
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:21.944
<v Speaker 1>what you find right away is that you end</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with this cutout looking thing </v>

1046
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.760
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make something into it.</v>

1047
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:29.663
<v Speaker 1>A manipulable object that's segregated </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the world that actually isn't </v>

1048
00:53:33.631 --> 00:53:36.270
<v Speaker 1>represented that way in the photograph </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

1049
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.940
<v Speaker 1>You might see it that way and in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1050
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:41.370
<v Speaker 1>But if you start to play with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

1051
00:53:41.371 --> 00:53:43.380
<v Speaker 1>you find that just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1052
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:44.243
<v Speaker 1>it's pixels all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very hard and photoshop is </v>

1053
00:53:47.671 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll do edge detection for you,</v>

1054
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

1055
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1056
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.690
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough to fool your eyes.</v>

1057
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:57.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to see things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was one of the,</v>

1058
00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 1>that's actually one of the places where </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is,</v>

1059
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.120
<v Speaker 1>which we will talk more about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to fall apart.</v>

1060
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.080
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1061
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.273
<v Speaker 1>it turns out the problem is a problem of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stimulus is like way more </v>

1062
00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:08.724
<v Speaker 1>complicated than we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it also turned out that the </v>

1063
00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:13.080
<v Speaker 1>problem of the behavior was way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

1064
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.393
<v Speaker 1>So the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you train a wrap to run </v>

1065
00:54:16.411 --> 00:54:17.244
<v Speaker 1>down the runway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way you do that is you take the </v>

1066
00:54:20.581 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 1>rap and he make sure he's hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skinner's rats,</v>

1067
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:25.351
<v Speaker 1>bf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skinner,</v>

1068
00:54:25.351 --> 00:54:26.184
<v Speaker 1>he was like the dean of behaviorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His rats were starved to 75% of their </v>

1069
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:34.240
<v Speaker 1>body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a Skinnerian rack was a weird rap.</v>

1070
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:38.100
<v Speaker 1>It was really lonesome and isolated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was starving and so,</v>

1071
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:41.700
<v Speaker 1>and so you could kind of treat it like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>one dimensional entity,</v>

1072
00:54:41.701 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it would do anything for food.</v>

1073
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:48.450
<v Speaker 1>So it was an extraordinarily hungry rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was also an isolated frat.</v>

1074
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.420
<v Speaker 1>So it was a simplified model of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual rat.</v>

1075
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's a simplified model of a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

1076
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.493
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that I'm not very fond </v>

1077
00:54:57.721 --> 00:55:00.180
<v Speaker 1>of the idea that you can model human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings with rats,</v>

1078
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 1>but I'm actually extremely fond of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1079
00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rack is a way,</v>

1080
00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:05.534
<v Speaker 1>Barrett better model of who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then your model of who you are is a </v>

1081
00:55:08.641 --> 00:55:10.320
<v Speaker 1>model of who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1082
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.273
<v Speaker 1>so a rat is a lot more like you then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thought of you is like you and </v>

1083
00:55:15.541 --> 00:55:17.730
<v Speaker 1>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like give the guy some credit man.</v>

1084
00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Those things are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1085
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.090
<v Speaker 1>and they are like us in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1086
00:55:21.091 --> 00:55:23.220
<v Speaker 1>many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many important ways.</v>

1087
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.233
<v Speaker 1>So you can get along way with a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I told you at the beginning </v>

1088
00:55:26.701 --> 00:55:27.534
<v Speaker 1>of this class is like part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacology that a lobster uses to </v>

1089
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:31.464
<v Speaker 1>determine its position in a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is the same pharmacology that </v>

1090
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 1>you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1091
00:55:36.151 --> 00:55:39.930
<v Speaker 1>you're quite a bit like a lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're even more like Iraq.</v>

1092
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:42.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's enough compliments for one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1093
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:43.583
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1094
00:55:48.310 --> 00:55:49.143
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so the behavior is modeled as simple </v>

1095
00:55:50.711 --> 00:55:51.544
<v Speaker 1>behaviors model didn't work out so well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and neither did the idea that in some </v>

1096
00:55:55.181 --> 00:55:56.014
<v Speaker 1>way you were generating a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an accurate model of the world and then </v>

1097
00:56:00.491 --> 00:56:01.324
<v Speaker 1>you were comparing the actual world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that model and that that's how you </v>

1098
00:56:05.651 --> 00:56:09.670
<v Speaker 1>planned your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots about that.</v>

1099
00:56:09.671 --> 00:56:11.500
<v Speaker 1>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but but there's lots of boat.</v>

1100
00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:12.790
<v Speaker 1>If it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

1101
00:56:12.791 --> 00:56:13.624
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to treat it like it's true for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time being because we can get quite </v>

1102
00:56:15.671 --> 00:56:20.671
<v Speaker 1>a long ways with low resolution theories</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're not completely right.</v>

1103
00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:22.144
<v Speaker 1>They may still have tremendous benefits </v>
<v Speaker 1>and behaviorism had tremendous benefits </v>

1104
00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:25.594
<v Speaker 1>because we learned all sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about behavior in the brain from the </v>

1105
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:28.594
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything we know from a </v>

1106
00:56:31.091 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective about psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's behaviorists.</v>

1107
00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I've learned way more from the animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>researchers than from anyone else except</v>

1108
00:56:39.131 --> 00:56:42.200
<v Speaker 1>for the clinicians way more there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1109
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.053
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1110
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:46.630
<v Speaker 1>They're so careful in their terminology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their scientific approach.</v>

1111
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.153
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1112
00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:50.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.360
<v Speaker 1>You remember that little oval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I keep showing you point B,</v>

1114
00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:58.450
<v Speaker 1>point a you're trying to get from point </v>
<v Speaker 1>a to point b.</v>

1115
00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.493
<v Speaker 1>And point B is a representation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>point a is a representation </v>

1116
00:57:02.471 --> 00:57:03.690
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

1117
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you invoke actions or perceptual schemes</v>

1118
00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:10.630
<v Speaker 1>that are necessary to translate one </v>
<v Speaker 1>state into the other.</v>

1119
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:11.763
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine for a moment what the </v>

1120
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:20.490
<v Speaker 1>primary biological brain systems do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>grab hold of that oval and they say,</v>

1121
00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.330
<v Speaker 1>point a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hungry.</v>

1122
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Point B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need food.</v>

1123
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Here's the behaviors and the perceptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that of you that you've used in the past</v>

1124
00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:37.060
<v Speaker 1>to solve that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's prime them and implement them.</v>

1125
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what's happening during </v>
<v Speaker 1>your day is like you get hungry,</v>

1126
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:45.730
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus grabs that little oval </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you're,</v>

1127
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:46.743
<v Speaker 1>you're under the control of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic perceptual and motor </v>

1128
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.233
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's connected to the rest of the </v>

1129
00:57:53.921 --> 00:57:54.280
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

1130
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to do this in a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated way,</v>

1131
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.633
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to call on procedures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>routines that you already know in order </v>

1132
00:58:02.291 --> 00:58:03.610
<v Speaker 1>to solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1133
00:58:03.611 --> 00:58:06.160
<v Speaker 1>you know where the fridge is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to open the peanut butter,</v>

1134
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:08.680
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is you're going to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how to hold a knife,</v>

1135
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all those things are going to be </v>

1136
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:13.060
<v Speaker 1>primed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1137
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.553
<v Speaker 1>the behaviorists thought of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought of the action of the </v>

1138
00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:19.840
<v Speaker 1>fundamental biological systems as </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives.</v>

1139
00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And there's a deterministic element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive,</v>

1140
00:58:22.601 --> 00:58:24.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're hungry.</v>

1141
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:25.833
<v Speaker 1>The hunger makes you move your foot down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stairs in a sort of stereotype </v>

1142
00:58:29.531 --> 00:58:30.370
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1143
00:58:30.371 --> 00:58:33.360
<v Speaker 1>chaining of behavioral outputs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple reflexes,</v>

1144
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.563
<v Speaker 1>and it drives you to the fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that drives you to unscrew the </v>

1145
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:41.250
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter and to take out the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are all chained reflexes.</v>

1146
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:43.570
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1147
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:46.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's an entry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a useful and interesting model.</v>

1148
00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:48.243
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

1149
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:53.160
<v Speaker 1>the way it was demonstrated that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was wrong.</v>

1150
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:54.023
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we're going to go back to rats </v>

1151
00:58:54.841 --> 00:58:55.674
<v Speaker 1>for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a rat and you put them in </v>

1152
00:58:58.951 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1153
00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:02.940
<v Speaker 1>in a maze and you want to teach them how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get through the maze.</v>

1154
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:07.380
<v Speaker 1>So you put the rat there and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put a little food pellet in front of the</v>

1155
00:59:07.381 --> 00:59:10.320
<v Speaker 1>rack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the rack reddens down in the</v>

1156
00:59:10.321 --> 00:59:12.570
<v Speaker 1>maze and eats the food palate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's only this far.</v>

1157
00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:16.980
<v Speaker 1>And so then you put the rat back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you put a foot pet food pellet there</v>

1158
00:59:16.981 --> 00:59:17.814
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it runs down the runway and it gets </v>

1159
00:59:19.681 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 1>the food pellet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you do three or four times and</v>

1160
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 1>you put the right back in the other cage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they leave him for a day.</v>

1161
00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.370
<v Speaker 1>And then the next day you take the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>route and you put it back in and you put</v>

1162
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 1>the food pellet about three inches </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther.</v>

1163
00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.350
<v Speaker 1>And so it runs down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabs the food pellet,</v>

1164
00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.473
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you put another three inches </v>

1165
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another three inches,</v>

1166
00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:37.304
<v Speaker 1>another three inches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and soon the rack is zipping through </v>

1167
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:39.644
<v Speaker 1>that through the maze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see how you could </v>

1168
00:59:41.331 --> 00:59:44.720
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize that as the simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaining of reflex behaviors,</v>

1169
00:59:44.721 --> 00:59:45.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's,</v>

1170
00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:46.283
<v Speaker 1>it's not that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rat has to walk reflexive and then </v>

1171
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.830
<v Speaker 1>just has to change in the reflexes </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

1172
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.220
<v Speaker 1>And you want to have a simple model if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a scientist.</v>

1173
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:58.640
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then some wise guy took a rat,</v>

1174
00:59:58.970 --> 00:59:59.803
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was extraordinarily funny as far </v>

1175
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:04.094
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took the rat and he caught up its </v>

1176
01:00:06.051 --> 01:00:11.051
<v Speaker 1>back legs and then he put its back late </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a little cart and then he put the rat</v>

1177
01:00:11.151 --> 01:00:15.110
<v Speaker 1>in the maze and sure enough the rap go </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this through the maze to get to the</v>

1178
01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

1179
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.573
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously that's not reflex </v>

1180
01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>chaining because like rats don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheels,</v>

1181
01:00:20.121 --> 01:00:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but if you stick wheels on a rack it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out pretty damn quick.</v>

1182
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.123
<v Speaker 1>And so it was experiments like that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>blew apart the simple reflex chaining </v>

1183
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis of behaviorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

1184
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.073
<v Speaker 1>that's a such a funny experiment to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they must've just cackled away </v>

1185
01:00:35.451 --> 01:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>when they come in a talk that went up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1186
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>talk about your ultimate nerd </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

1187
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:40.763
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's put wheels on this rat and see </v>

1188
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

1189
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:49.933
<v Speaker 1>so soulful love and vinegar dove and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of other people started </v>

1190
01:00:52.071 --> 01:00:53.840
<v Speaker 1>believing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1191
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:54.703
<v Speaker 1>animals weren't simple chains of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexes from sensation to behavioral </v>

1192
01:00:58.971 --> 01:00:59.804
<v Speaker 1>output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that they generated models of the </v>

1193
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:04.190
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the basic model would be,</v>

1194
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>and this is a cybernetic model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this comes from Norbert Wiener from back</v>

1195
01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:12.650
<v Speaker 1>in the 1940s when he was studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple,</v>

1196
01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.140
<v Speaker 1>simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent machines.</v>

1197
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things wiener worked on </v>
<v Speaker 1>was anti missile systems.</v>

1198
01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.753
<v Speaker 1>So cause you imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get a muscle and it's zooming </v>

1199
01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>along and you want to shoot another </v>
<v Speaker 1>missile added to it.</v>

1200
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:27.463
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a complicated problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to hit a moving target and </v>

1201
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:32.683
<v Speaker 1>he construed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the antimissile missiles should do </v>

1202
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.183
<v Speaker 1>is track its trajectory towards the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ideal trajectory towards the </v>

1203
01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>missile and then correct for deviations </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>

1204
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.513
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if it got a little too far to the </v>

1205
01:01:47.811 --> 01:01:48.644
<v Speaker 1>left then it would move to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if it got a little too far to </v>

1206
01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would move to the left.</v>

1207
01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Thermostat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>it's basically the same system that's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thermostat.</v>

1209
01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.820
<v Speaker 1>It's the simplest form of intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

1210
01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:00.493
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually the model that gray </v>
<v Speaker 1>used was quite funny because when I was </v>

1211
01:02:03.951 --> 01:02:04.784
<v Speaker 1>teaching about this in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an engineer in one of my classes </v>

1212
01:02:06.981 --> 01:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>and I went through the gray model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the cybernetic model.</v>

1213
01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:10.971
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

1214
01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:11.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1215
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:12.543
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the same system that we </v>

1216
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>use to design and he missile missiles on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1217
01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really weird.</v>

1218
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:19.484
<v Speaker 1>That's a of a coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the engineer went off to </v>

1219
01:02:21.511 --> 01:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>England where he met Jeffrey Gray and </v>
<v Speaker 1>jet and he said that like,</v>

1220
01:02:25.021 --> 01:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>isn't this an interesting coincidence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Grace said,</v>

1221
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:27.984
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a coincidence because it was </v>

1222
01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:30.443
<v Speaker 1>the anti missile missile researchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>work that or at least a branch of that </v>

1223
01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>work that had the same intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>history as this particular theory.</v>

1224
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:38.963
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1225
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>that was quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's all stemming from this guy at</v>

1226
01:02:41.611 --> 01:02:42.444
<v Speaker 1>mit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine what happens is your </v>

1227
01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1228
01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't have enough sugar in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>

1229
01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:54.411
<v Speaker 1>And so like it pops up this perceptual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call them motivation action maps.</v>

1230
01:02:55.741 --> 01:02:56.461
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1231
01:02:56.461 --> 01:02:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't even remember.</v>

1232
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>But I called them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1233
01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.260
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1234
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.910
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1235
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.851
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little,</v>

1236
01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:09.600
<v Speaker 1>those little ovals and they contain a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at the world.</v>

1237
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:15.260
<v Speaker 1>So a way of focusing in on the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are relevant and they contain that.</v>

1238
01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:16.224
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the branching sequence of ready made </v>

1239
01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 1>actions and perceptions that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>use to solve the problem.</v>

1240
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>And they sort of prime those so they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>at hand.</v>

1241
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what you basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced when you get hungry.</v>

1242
01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:29.723
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hunger isn't just the feeling in </v>

1243
01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:32.970
<v Speaker 1>your stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the empty feeling.</v>

1244
01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:35.700
<v Speaker 1>It's also this impulse to act right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1245
01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:40.170
<v Speaker 1>in a particular direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a heightened particular taste.</v>

1246
01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:41.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even for a particular </v>

1247
01:03:42.331 --> 01:03:44.910
<v Speaker 1>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out this is quite cool.</v>

1248
01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:47.003
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's five or six or seven primary </v>

1249
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:54.021
<v Speaker 1>tastes and part of your brain tells you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you're tasting.</v>

1250
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:59.190
<v Speaker 1>And then another part of your brain says</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not that is a good taste or a</v>

1251
01:03:59.191 --> 01:04:01.500
<v Speaker 1>bad taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a good taste,</v>

1252
01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:02.334
<v Speaker 1>then you'll pursue it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a bad taste or even a </v>

1253
01:04:04.831 --> 01:04:06.510
<v Speaker 1>neutral taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't pursue it.</v>

1254
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.120
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that as you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

1255
01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the goodness of the taste increases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you eat it decreases.</v>

1256
01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.500
<v Speaker 1>It tastes the same though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1257
01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Which is kind of interesting cause you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might think that,</v>

1258
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:20.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were eating something salty,</v>

1259
01:04:20.251 --> 01:04:22.920
<v Speaker 1>the way he would stop is it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't taste salty anymore.</v>

1260
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:23.963
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you have a goodness </v>

1261
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.480
<v Speaker 1>adjuster and it works independently for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different tastes.</v>

1262
01:04:30.481 --> 01:04:31.314
<v Speaker 1>So that's why when you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have room for dessert because </v>

1263
01:04:34.501 --> 01:04:37.230
<v Speaker 1>that part is unsatiated that taste isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>satiated yet.</v>

1264
01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1265
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hypothalamus,</v>

1266
01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:41.814
<v Speaker 1>let's say pops up this little sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and it's the eating </v>

1267
01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:45.750
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality.</v>

1268
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>And if it's like a really desperate </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating subpersonality,</v>

1269
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:50.820
<v Speaker 1>you better not get in its way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1270
01:04:50.821 --> 01:04:51.654
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never experienced that to speak of </v>

1271
01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Americans are never hungry.</v>

1272
01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Hungry is what happens after you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten for 30 days,</v>

1273
01:04:57.991 --> 01:04:58.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hungry.</v>

1274
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will,</v>

1275
01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:02.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to get in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like that.</v>

1276
01:05:02.161 --> 01:05:05.490
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be occupying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

1277
01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:07.283
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>action and perception module all the </v>

1278
01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:11.280
<v Speaker 1>time and in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very motivated way.</v>

1279
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And the hypothalamus is no hiker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got massive projections reaching up</v>

1280
01:05:17.411 --> 01:05:18.244
<v Speaker 1>into the parts of the brain that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would associate more particularly with </v>

1281
01:05:21.401 --> 01:05:22.234
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it wants to subordinate you to </v>

1282
01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will.</v>

1283
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Binge eaters,</v>

1284
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a binge eater will starve </v>

1285
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>usually herself and starve herself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>starve herself and starve herself.</v>

1286
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:35.883
<v Speaker 1>And then the hypothalamus will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if she gets a little upset </v>

1287
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.083
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the negative emotion will suppress her </v>

1288
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:45.450
<v Speaker 1>preferred in frontal cortical function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the hypothalamus ago,</v>

1289
01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>and then the little eating bark module </v>
<v Speaker 1>pops up and you know,</v>

1290
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>she's in the fridge eating two ports of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice cream in 15 seconds.</v>

1291
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>And then she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

1292
01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1293
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:58.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

1294
01:05:58.810 --> 01:05:59.643
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a fundamental biological </v>

1295
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:05.260
<v Speaker 1>subcircuit that is devoted to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>letting you starve yourself to death,</v>

1296
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:06.753
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to get into war </v>

1297
01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:08.164
<v Speaker 1>with one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what happens in </v>

1298
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.313
<v Speaker 1>bulemia in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a war between higher cortical </v>

1299
01:06:13.751 --> 01:06:17.890
<v Speaker 1>centers and lower subcortical centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good,</v>

1300
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:18.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1301
01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:22.110
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off pops the Little Lod,</v>

1302
01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:24.610
<v Speaker 1>you all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says state a,</v>

1303
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.740
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have enough food.</v>

1304
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:27.603
<v Speaker 1>Your blood sugar's too low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>State be solved that by having a peanut </v>

1305
01:06:31.301 --> 01:06:32.470
<v Speaker 1>butter sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1306
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:34.450
<v Speaker 1>it's context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's context specific.</v>

1307
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Solve it by eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1308
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Now what that has done is set up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework for satiation.</v>

1309
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:42.431
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1310
01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:43.264
<v Speaker 1>satiation is a kind of reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think that satiation is </v>

1311
01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:48.724
<v Speaker 1>the kind of reward that everyone wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's actually what people </v>

1312
01:06:51.251 --> 01:06:52.360
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1313
01:06:52.361 --> 01:06:55.480
<v Speaker 1>they think that what you want is to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your goal.</v>

1314
01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.530
<v Speaker 1>And generally we presume that getting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your goal is rewarding.</v>

1315
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:02.410
<v Speaker 1>But it's a funny kind of reward because </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1316
01:07:02.411 --> 01:07:05.680
<v Speaker 1>because it's a consumer Tory reward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a particular kind of reward,</v>

1317
01:07:05.681 --> 01:07:06.514
<v Speaker 1>it has its own circuitry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consumer Tory reward just shuts off </v>

1318
01:07:09.551 --> 01:07:13.360
<v Speaker 1>the system that was pursuing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the consequence.</v>

1319
01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.900
<v Speaker 1>So the drive goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny reward,</v>

1320
01:07:16.901 --> 01:07:17.734
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you stopped being impelled by </v>

1321
01:07:19.091 --> 01:07:22.450
<v Speaker 1>the drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of happy about that.</v>

1322
01:07:22.451 --> 01:07:24.880
<v Speaker 1>But all that happens is that system </v>
<v Speaker 1>sinks and Poof,</v>

1323
01:07:24.881 --> 01:07:28.600
<v Speaker 1>up pops another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Conservatory reward does this strange</v>

1324
01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:29.434
<v Speaker 1>kind of reward because it's never really</v>
<v Speaker 1>final and all it does is shut down the </v>

1325
01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>part of you that wanted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1326
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's consumer Tory reward.</v>

1327
01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's important to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see why after awhile.</v>

1328
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine what could happen as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>move towards the consumer Tory reward.</v>

1329
01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:48.903
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some rough things that could </v>

1330
01:07:49.901 --> 01:07:50.734
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1331
01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.340
<v Speaker 1>The things that you're doing could work </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way you want them to work.</v>

1332
01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:57.403
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's kind of the no hassle </v>

1333
01:07:58.401 --> 01:07:59.840
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1334
01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:02.090
<v Speaker 1>you go downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you opened the cupboard,</v>

1335
01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.460
<v Speaker 1>the peanut butters there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a sandwich,</v>

1336
01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:06.080
<v Speaker 1>you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go back to study.</v>

1337
01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:07.183
<v Speaker 1>Pretty</v>

1338
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:09.600
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited.</v>

1339
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a boring story and that's</v>

1340
01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:14.280
<v Speaker 1>the kind of story you want and inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Habit.</v>

1341
01:08:14.281 --> 01:08:15.114
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you want the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know how to do to produce the </v>

1342
01:08:18.441 --> 01:08:20.630
<v Speaker 1>results that you want to produce to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1343
01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>And that basically keeps your emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated.</v>

1344
01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:27.163
<v Speaker 1>So now that we understand this a to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and we understand how the </v>

1345
01:08:32.691 --> 01:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>underlying biological subsystems </v>
<v Speaker 1>modulate that,</v>

1346
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>now we can start to think about emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

1347
01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're walking towards your goal,</v>

1348
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.943
<v Speaker 1>you're evaluating what happens as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk and as long as the things that you </v>

1349
01:08:50.391 --> 01:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>want to have happen are happening while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk,</v>

1350
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:57.170
<v Speaker 1>then you're dopaminergic system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the source of incentive reward,</v>

1351
01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:01.250
<v Speaker 1>which is the second kind of reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dopamine system is going,</v>

1352
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.390
<v Speaker 1>good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good job,</v>

1353
01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 1>good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good job,</v>

1354
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.330
<v Speaker 1>good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of liked that.</v>

1355
01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:06.163
<v Speaker 1>It keeps you alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're on the right track </v>

1356
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.863
<v Speaker 1>and it reinforces that behavior because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body assumes that if the thing is </v>

1357
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:13.483
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing is working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the circuit that does that should </v>

1358
01:09:16.101 --> 01:09:16.934
<v Speaker 1>get a little stronger and a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>well developed because it's producing </v>

1359
01:09:19.671 --> 01:09:22.820
<v Speaker 1>the desired outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you feel good about that.</v>

1360
01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.133
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason you feel good </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that is because your brain is </v>

1361
01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:28.850
<v Speaker 1>actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in a state of growth.</v>

1362
01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 1>It's producing chemicals that help your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain grow.</v>

1363
01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's the feeling of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have as a positive feeling.</v>

1364
01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Now how you feel that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why wouldn't you feel that?</v>

1365
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:45.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like the thing you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>

1366
01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 1>it should thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're pretty happy about that.</v>

1367
01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:50.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's like mild level positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

1368
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1369
01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:58.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that you expect or predict.</v>

1370
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:01.980
<v Speaker 1>It's expect if you use a pure cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>warrant,</v>

1371
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:03.973
<v Speaker 1>it's desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you use a model that incorporates </v>

1372
01:10:06.981 --> 01:10:07.814
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause socolow lovin vinegar Dova and to </v>

1373
01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:14.180
<v Speaker 1>some degree gray kind of thinks about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain as something that predicts and</v>

1374
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:15.980
<v Speaker 1>expects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1375
01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:19.160
<v Speaker 1>So as long as what you expect to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>is happening,</v>

1376
01:10:19.161 --> 01:10:21.200
<v Speaker 1>then you stay calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a,</v>

1377
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:24.530
<v Speaker 1>there's an error in that in the error is</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you don't just expect things,</v>

1378
01:10:24.531 --> 01:10:26.060
<v Speaker 1>you want them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1379
01:10:26.061 --> 01:10:29.450
<v Speaker 1>And you're always aiming at something </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific.</v>

1380
01:10:29.451 --> 01:10:30.284
<v Speaker 1>And it's the biological systems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying motivation that they're </v>

1381
01:10:32.751 --> 01:10:35.660
<v Speaker 1>specifying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't think of yourself as a cold</v>

1382
01:10:35.661 --> 01:10:39.140
<v Speaker 1>calculating expectancy machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive expectancy machine.</v>

1383
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want things,</v>

1384
01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:43.003
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're moving along towards you </v>

1385
01:10:44.001 --> 01:10:44.834
<v Speaker 1>target and the things that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happen are happening and the cues </v>

1386
01:10:49.071 --> 01:10:52.550
<v Speaker 1>that you're approaching the target are </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearing as they should be.</v>

1387
01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.280
<v Speaker 1>And your dopamine system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is grounded by the way,</v>

1388
01:10:55.281 --> 01:10:56.114
<v Speaker 1>in half of the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so half of the hypothalamus is devoted </v>

1389
01:10:59.511 --> 01:11:00.344
<v Speaker 1>towards popping up these little bubbles </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tell you what you should want and </v>

1390
01:11:03.411 --> 01:11:04.244
<v Speaker 1>how to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other half is devoted to </v>

1391
01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:09.680
<v Speaker 1>exploring and to mostly to exploring </v>
<v Speaker 1>into paying attention.</v>

1392
01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:10.543
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1393
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:11.683
<v Speaker 1>and it will be ticking along just quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely as long as what you're doing is </v>

1394
01:11:14.131 --> 01:11:15.870
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then we'll say,</v>

1395
01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if what you're doing isn't working?</v>

1396
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.553
<v Speaker 1>What if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1397
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:20.753
<v Speaker 1>what if you get to the cupboard and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>open it and your little brother has </v>

1398
01:11:23.641 --> 01:11:26.040
<v Speaker 1>eaten all the peanut butter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1399
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:26.791
<v Speaker 1>what you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

1400
01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:29.790
<v Speaker 1>is a mismatch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like instead of the presence of the</v>

1401
01:11:29.791 --> 01:11:30.624
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the absence of the peanut </v>

1402
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually a stimulus.</v>

1403
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.400
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The absence of a desired entity is,</v>

1404
01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:38.550
<v Speaker 1>it is a punishment.</v>

1405
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:42.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty abstract,</v>

1406
01:11:42.061 --> 01:11:43.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's pretty abstract punishment.</v>

1407
01:11:43.801 --> 01:11:46.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hole where there shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a whole,</v>

1408
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:47.933
<v Speaker 1>will produce an orienting response and </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrate you and make you aggressive </v>

1409
01:11:51.031 --> 01:11:52.770
<v Speaker 1>and irritated and all those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1410
01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to feel that negatively</v>

1411
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1412
01:11:58.321 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a punishment.</v>

1413
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.273
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had suspicions that the peanut </v>

1414
01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:06.180
<v Speaker 1>butter might be missing when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening the door,</v>

1415
01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 1>that would make you anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause anxiety,</v>

1416
01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.313
<v Speaker 1>fear more particularly fear is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation that a punishment might </v>

1417
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:17.303
<v Speaker 1>occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have a separate interesting </v>

1418
01:12:19.341 --> 01:12:20.130
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's,</v>

1419
01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:25.130
<v Speaker 1>it's in relationship to a punishment </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you might think of as a primary,</v>

1420
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:29.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconditioned stimulus,</v>

1421
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:31.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unconditioned stimulus cause he,</v>

1422
01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.140
<v Speaker 1>you naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're naturally respond to it.</v>

1423
01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Fear which could be considered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>

1424
01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:37.854
<v Speaker 1>Stimulus actually has its own circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so common that what we want might </v>

1425
01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:43.914
<v Speaker 1>not be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we've evolved the whole circuit </v>

1426
01:12:45.691 --> 01:12:46.524
<v Speaker 1>just to deal with things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening as well as things that are </v>

1427
01:12:49.201 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 1>punishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punishment,</v>

1428
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.713
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

1429
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.230
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

1430
01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Threat is threat of punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an abstract form of,</v>

1431
01:12:58.801 --> 01:13:00.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's an abstract representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

1432
01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:03.120
<v Speaker 1>You're anxious so that you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

1433
01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so damn anxious,</v>

1434
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have to hurt.</v>

1435
01:13:06.661 --> 01:13:10.560
<v Speaker 1>But no you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a lesser price to pay.</v>

1436
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.473
<v Speaker 1>It's a law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lesser pain to avoid a greater </v>

1437
01:13:14.071 --> 01:13:15.660
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what anxiety is.</v>

1438
01:13:15.661 --> 01:13:18.240
<v Speaker 1>So the next time you're anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be happy about that because</v>

1439
01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.113
<v Speaker 1>at least you're not pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the anxiety trying to </v>

1440
01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:23.814
<v Speaker 1>protect you from it.</v>

1441
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:27.583
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're going towards your goal and </v>

1442
01:13:29.451 --> 01:13:30.284
<v Speaker 1>one thing that could happen is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you want to have happen are </v>

1443
01:13:32.391 --> 01:13:35.390
<v Speaker 1>happening and things that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have appear are appearing.</v>

1444
01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:39.020
<v Speaker 1>And so you get a little dopamine kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the hypothalamus and that makes you</v>

1445
01:13:39.021 --> 01:13:41.090
<v Speaker 1>feel like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1446
01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.300
<v Speaker 1>on the right track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly how it makes you feel.</v>

1447
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.943
<v Speaker 1>Because we're trajectory oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and just like an anti missile </v>

1448
01:13:50.661 --> 01:13:51.494
<v Speaker 1>missile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always trying to hit a moving </v>

1449
01:13:52.371 --> 01:13:53.204
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're on the right </v>

1450
01:13:54.261 --> 01:13:56.360
<v Speaker 1>trajectory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everything,</v>

1451
01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:01.040
<v Speaker 1>everything about the way you organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain at that moment is functional.</v>

1452
01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And so your brain pumps up a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of neuro chemical to make those areas of</v>

1453
01:14:06.291 --> 01:14:07.124
<v Speaker 1>the brain that are involved in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive activity grow a little bit </v>

1454
01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:10.910
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1455
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:13.930
<v Speaker 1>are going pretty good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty cool.</v>

1456
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Now here's another thing that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1457
01:14:16.991 --> 01:14:17.711
<v Speaker 1>So we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1458
01:14:17.711 --> 01:14:18.544
<v Speaker 1>the peanut butter isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well first you're going to be surprised </v>

1459
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:24.400
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically,</v>

1460
01:14:24.401 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 1>if to the degree that you thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be there.</v>

1461
01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.573
<v Speaker 1>And so that's gonna make you anxious </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that can </v>

1462
01:14:30.701 --> 01:14:35.701
<v Speaker 1>happen when you're on the way to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you want is that something you</v>

1463
01:14:35.741 --> 01:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>don't expect will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's novelty,</v>

1464
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.053
<v Speaker 1>that's novelty or a normally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally is the mismatch between the </v>

1465
01:14:45.221 --> 01:14:46.054
<v Speaker 1>structures that you're using to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the world and your actions in </v>

1466
01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:49.414
<v Speaker 1>it and the actual world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the detection of a gap between the </v>

1467
01:14:53.351 --> 01:14:56.950
<v Speaker 1>state of reality and your representation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the state of reality.</v>

1468
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger that gap,</v>

1469
01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:01.360
<v Speaker 1>the more anxious you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now then you might say,</v>

1470
01:15:01.361 --> 01:15:02.194
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you calculate how anxious you </v>

1471
01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:06.250
<v Speaker 1>should be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Gray.</v>

1472
01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Actually it doesn't talk about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>

1473
01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:09.543
<v Speaker 1>but there's a paper in there by carver </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Scheier that you'll have to read </v>

1474
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:13.480
<v Speaker 1>that's related to this.</v>

1475
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.450
<v Speaker 1>So remember the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1476
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:17.643
<v Speaker 1>You got little bitty things at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom and you've got great big things </v>

1477
01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:21.820
<v Speaker 1>at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say</v>

1478
01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.213
<v Speaker 1>you open the cupboard and the peanut </v>
<v Speaker 1>butter isn't there and you think this </v>

1479
01:15:26.861 --> 01:15:29.830
<v Speaker 1>stupid family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should go hang myself.</v>

1480
01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.053
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I I would say is not a </v>

1481
01:15:32.351 --> 01:15:35.200
<v Speaker 1>particularly adaptive response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it does solve the problem.</v>

1482
01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:36.243
<v Speaker 1>What's happening there is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>calibrating the threat as a threat to </v>

1483
01:15:39.281 --> 01:15:40.114
<v Speaker 1>the integrity of the top levels of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy that you use to orient </v>

1484
01:15:42.881 --> 01:15:46.150
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's pretty,</v>

1485
01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:48.310
<v Speaker 1>that's fuzzy thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1486
01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:49.144
<v Speaker 1>before you hang yourself about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think if there's some simpler </v>

1487
01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:55.660
<v Speaker 1>things you could do that were lower in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy and higher resolution that</v>

1488
01:15:55.661 --> 01:15:57.160
<v Speaker 1>would solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1489
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:58.383
<v Speaker 1>well you could go to the corner store </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get a jar of peanut butter and then </v>

1490
01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:01.570
<v Speaker 1>that problem would be solved.</v>

1491
01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:02.403
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you could just have something </v>

1492
01:16:03.971 --> 01:16:05.770
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't peanut butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I mean?</v>

1493
01:16:05.771 --> 01:16:08.680
<v Speaker 1>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do a shift at the low levels</v>

1494
01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:12.670
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy at high resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's less anxiety provoking.</v>

1495
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:16.210
<v Speaker 1>It's less effort and it doesn't take you</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

1496
01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.470
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a rule and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how your brain figures it out.</v>

1497
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:25.630
<v Speaker 1>The rule is make the least modification </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary to solve the emergent problem.</v>

1498
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:27.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1499
01:16:27.761 --> 01:16:29.560
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important rule.</v>

1500
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:31.930
<v Speaker 1>And if you use it when you're talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

1501
01:16:31.931 --> 01:16:34.930
<v Speaker 1>they will like you a lot better because </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>

1502
01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:38.740
<v Speaker 1>the person that's working for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do something that they said they</v>

1503
01:16:38.741 --> 01:16:40.870
<v Speaker 1>would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that puts you in trouble.</v>

1504
01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one responses,</v>

1505
01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a useless creek,</v>

1506
01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:46.900
<v Speaker 1>get the hell out of here so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fire them.</v>

1507
01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And the other is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1508
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:54.250
<v Speaker 1>tell me exactly what happened during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that you were supposed to be,</v>

1509
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outputting this,</v>

1510
01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.353
<v Speaker 1>this resource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he listened to the person detail out </v>

1511
01:17:00.521 --> 01:17:01.354
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychomotor schemes and you see where </v>

1512
01:17:03.731 --> 01:17:08.320
<v Speaker 1>you can tweak one or two so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next time that happens,</v>

1513
01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:11.270
<v Speaker 1>the next time a situation like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>arises,</v>

1514
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't get the same undesired output </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much better.</v>

1515
01:17:15.801 --> 01:17:17.180
<v Speaker 1>But it takes acuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1516
01:17:17.181 --> 01:17:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Cause you gotta turn it low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

1517
01:17:20.121 --> 01:17:25.121
<v Speaker 1>which is I'm irritated and anxious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated and hurt by your foolishness.</v>

1518
01:17:25.611 --> 01:17:26.444
<v Speaker 1>You're a parent foolishness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really easy thing to </v>

1519
01:17:28.701 --> 01:17:30.770
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize because it doesn't take </v>
<v Speaker 1>any effort.</v>

1520
01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:34.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just an expression of my automatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

1521
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Or I can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1522
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:40.640
<v Speaker 1>let's let's constrain this </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated,</v>

1523
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:45.410
<v Speaker 1>sequence it and try to figure out where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem actually lies.</v>

1524
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.393
<v Speaker 1>Now if it happens 50 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it's time not to have a </v>

1525
01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:50.060
<v Speaker 1>relationship with that person anymore.</v>

1526
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:51.223
<v Speaker 1>But to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least you want to start with the </v>

1527
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:54.163
<v Speaker 1>smallest possible correction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can really remember this when </v>

1528
01:17:56.811 --> 01:17:58.130
<v Speaker 1>you're arguing with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1529
01:17:58.131 --> 01:18:00.200
<v Speaker 1>especially with people that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with.</v>

1530
01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:01.063
<v Speaker 1>It's like save the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should get a divorce statements for </v>

1531
01:18:03.801 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 1>the serious occasions and if there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>violations,</v>

1532
01:18:07.281 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 1>like assume that they're high </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>

1533
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:12.950
<v Speaker 1>low level violations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate that.</v>

1534
01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And if that doesn't work well then jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>up one level but start low.</v>

1535
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.840
<v Speaker 1>And most of the time your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to do that.</v>

1536
01:18:20.841 --> 01:18:21.674
<v Speaker 1>For you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would like to assume that your </v>

1537
01:18:23.001 --> 01:18:23.834
<v Speaker 1>stupidity is of the rectifiable kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I want to talk to you a little bit </v>

1538
01:18:28.251 --> 01:18:29.084
<v Speaker 1>about how it makes that calculation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a very hard calculation to </v>

1539
01:18:31.551 --> 01:18:32.151
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1540
01:18:32.151 --> 01:18:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you wake up and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1541
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.280
<v Speaker 1>there's something about you that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>aching.</v>

1542
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell are you supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about that?</v>

1543
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Because the ranges from nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll go away in five minutes to hey,</v>

1544
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.153
<v Speaker 1>you know you're dead in three months and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no real way of telling what </v>

1545
01:18:50.061 --> 01:18:50.894
<v Speaker 1>level of catastrophic response you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have to the emergence of that </v>

1546
01:18:53.721 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 1>anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real big problem.</v>

1547
01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And so your brain has to estimate it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different ways.</v>

1548
01:18:59.391 --> 01:19:04.391
<v Speaker 1>And as we differentiate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate out the personality traits</v>

1549
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:08.180
<v Speaker 1>will start to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for now,</v>

1550
01:19:08.181 --> 01:19:09.014
<v Speaker 1>just remember that your your built in </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological systems are specifying the </v>

1551
01:19:13.851 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 1>goal and the framework within which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>construe that goal.</v>

1552
01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Perceptions and actions as little </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

1553
01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:21.530
<v Speaker 1>And it wants some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1554
01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:25.160
<v Speaker 1>As that little personality is going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>long towards its goal,</v>

1555
01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.340
<v Speaker 1>three things can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can make progress,</v>

1556
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:32.060
<v Speaker 1>it can get stopped in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily rectifiable.</v>

1557
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:32.953
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe there's a toy on the stairs </v>

1558
01:19:34.071 --> 01:19:36.620
<v Speaker 1>and you have to step around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's not going to bother you</v>

1559
01:19:36.621 --> 01:19:40.190
<v Speaker 1>very much because it just requires a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny transformation of your,</v>

1560
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.290
<v Speaker 1>of your Schema,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1561
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:45.800
<v Speaker 1>So little things you can rectify might </v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

1562
01:19:45.801 --> 01:19:46.634
<v Speaker 1>So those are little punishments or </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle threats or you can hit an </v>

1563
01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:50.480
<v Speaker 1>anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1564
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:54.020
<v Speaker 1>And if things are going right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's positive emotion.</v>

1565
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:56.660
<v Speaker 1>That's extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

1566
01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.330
<v Speaker 1>It's the same system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So extroverts,</v>

1567
01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.360
<v Speaker 1>they're positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're positive reward system.</v>

1568
01:20:02.361 --> 01:20:03.194
<v Speaker 1>The incentive reward system is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>active and extroverts not active and </v>

1569
01:20:06.411 --> 01:20:09.210
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in terms of neuroticism,</v>

1570
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.913
<v Speaker 1>people that are high in neuroticism tend</v>
<v Speaker 1>to react with more anxiety and pain to </v>

1571
01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:18.144
<v Speaker 1>the same amount of disruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are two of the first </v>

1572
01:20:21.751 --> 01:20:26.751
<v Speaker 1>fundamental personality traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see you Tuesday.</v>
