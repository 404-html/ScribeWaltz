1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.960
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Speaker 2>so if there's anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anybody here who's new?</v>

3
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.950
<v Speaker 1>So everybody knows where to find the</v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

4
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's good to know.</v>

5
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Someone doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is that saying?</v>

6
00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:27.754
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

7
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you are.</v>

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Just look up my name on Google and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find my website and then you can</v>

9
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 2>find the course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 2>And all the readings and so forth are</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately some of the links were</v>
<v Speaker 2>outdated and if you tried to get ahold</v>

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 2>of a Ta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably got a hold of last year's</v>

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 2>tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because I didn't update all the</v>

14
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 2>links blindly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

15
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 2>that's fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope.</v>

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 2>And with any luck the website is fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>functional.</v>

17
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

18
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:05.631
<v Speaker 2>so last time I was trying to give you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>brief introduction to,</v>

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 2>to a way of looking at symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 2>representations.</v>

20
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 2>And maybe I should tell you a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about symbolic representations.</v>

21
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:17.424
<v Speaker 2>First.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit confusing because Freud was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense the first of the modern</v>

23
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 2>psychologist to talk about symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Freud believed that symbols were</v>

24
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 2>often used by the unconscious to</v>
<v Speaker 2>represent things that the conscious mind</v>

25
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 2>did not want to become conscious of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense,</v>

26
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Freud believed that the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>repressed were things that you knew and</v>

27
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:49.071
<v Speaker 2>understood but didn't want to attend to</v>
<v Speaker 2>or believe or understand or integrate or</v>

28
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:56.361
<v Speaker 2>developer or even allowed to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the unconscious was reduced to</v>

29
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 2>using subterfuge in some sense to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>its point across.</v>

30
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a powerful argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one we're going to return to when</v>

31
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 2>we talk about Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's right.</v>

32
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

33
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I think young's explanation of symbols</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

34
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is better.</v>

35
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although there may be times when Freud's</v>

36
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 2>correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that would be a subset of</v>

37
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 2>the times when symbolism is used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

38
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 2>imagine that there are different forms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of knowledge first.</v>

39
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's important to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important to recognize that before</v>

40
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 2>you can really think about something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the use of symbolism,</v>

41
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 2>the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the use of symbolism by the unconscious.</v>

42
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

43
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 2>there's the form of knowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows as knowledge,</v>

44
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 2>which is articulated knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

45
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 2>And so articulated knowledges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often factual or it can be procedural</v>

46
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:55.191
<v Speaker 2>because you can tell someone how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something but and everyone thinks of and</v>

47
00:02:55.531 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>and then there's knowledge about facts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of various forms which which may or may</v>

48
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>not be true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's really irrelevant that and</v>

49
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>that's often this sort of knowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn in a classroom.</v>

50
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Procedural knowledge is a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue because you can learn that by</v>

51
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 2>doing or by imitating and it and even in</v>
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>

52
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a process and an an a method as</v>

53
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 2>well as a body of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in science,</v>

54
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.070
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the knowledge isn't explicit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and articulated.</v>

55
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>It's actually procedural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something Thomas Kuhn talked</v>

56
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:31.391
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

57
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 2>in his famous book on scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutions,</v>

58
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 2>which because partly when you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate student for example,</v>

59
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 2>or to a lesser degree and undergraduate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

60
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 2>it's more relevant when you actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>start practicing science.</v>

61
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the knowledge that you bring to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear on the,</v>

62
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the subject is actually implicit.</v>

63
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 2>You can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't really explain it.</v>

64
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 2>And so some examples of that might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like learning how to look through a</v>

65
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 2>microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which turns out to be a very difficult</v>

66
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

67
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 2>You have to practice for many hours</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you get good at looking through a</v>

68
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 2>microscope or maybe if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>radiologist you have to read x rays or</v>

69
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 2>fm rise of that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can build up a body of knowledge</v>

70
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 2>that makes you a perceptual expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he can't really get that kind of</v>

71
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>knowledge without practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

72
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like learning how to play</v>
<v Speaker 2>the piano,</v>

73
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or learning how to walk or,</v>

74
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.880
<v Speaker 2>or any complex act of perception or</v>
<v Speaker 2>action is seldom fully articulated.</v>

75
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's another kind of knowledge you</v>

76
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 2>might call that embodied knowledge and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a memory for them that goes</v>

77
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 2>along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is procedural memory,</v>

78
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of what you know is procedural</v>

79
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:35.164
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

80
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 2>there's another kind of knowledge which</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I suppose,</v>

81
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:44.130
<v Speaker 2>autobiographical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's often referred to as say</v>

82
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.170
<v Speaker 2>episodic memory and autobiographical</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge would be your memory of</v>

83
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 2>yourself as an actor in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

84
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:56.290
<v Speaker 2>So I suspect for many of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's find out for how many this is</v>

85
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you remember an episode in the past</v>

86
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 2>or when your mind is wandering and</v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes of the past come up,</v>

87
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 2>how would you describe the forum in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they emerge?</v>

88
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Are they like hot for how many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they?</v>

89
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Like little movies.</v>

90
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone for whom that's not</v>

91
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:14.354
<v Speaker 2>true?</v>

92
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

93
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:18.030
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you think about the past or when</v>

94
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 2>the past comes to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what form does it come to mind?</v>

95
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Stills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stills.</v>

96
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's still images.</v>

97
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Is there anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

98
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

99
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also knowledge about the past</v>

100
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:33.480
<v Speaker 2>that semantic knowledge articulated</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and that would be factual</v>

101
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:34.980
<v Speaker 2>knowledge about what you did in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

102
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:38.070
<v Speaker 2>but that seems to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be a more thoroughly</v>

103
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 2>processed form of memory because in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense what you've done,</v>

104
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.850
<v Speaker 2>if you're extracting out articulated</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge from past experiences is that</v>

105
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.350
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to pull out the gist.</v>

106
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.240
<v Speaker 2>You reduce it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.440
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like imagine that you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conversation with someone and last two</v>

108
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:56.550
<v Speaker 2>hours and someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

109
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 2>what did you about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you don't repeat the entire</v>

110
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 2>conversation verbatim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

111
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 2>You do some weird job of compressing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information into something like a</v>

112
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 2>summary and you do that more or less</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically,</v>

113
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite a remarkable process actually</v>

114
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>because you get the gist or you get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

115
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 2>whatever the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it's that easy to extract</v>

116
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 2>from a conversation and that's another</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of knowledge that you can,</v>

117
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 2>that you can formulate.</v>

118
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 2>But then there's sort of borderline</v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of knowledge,</v>

119
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are the ones that seem to be</v>

120
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 2>expressed as far as I can tell in</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's more like symbolic</v>

121
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

122
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked last time a little bit about a</v>

123
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 2>parent say apparent acting the role of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

124
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.390
<v Speaker 2>So the parent is embodying whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>father means and the child is prepared</v>

125
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 2>for that because children generally have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a father.</v>

126
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 2>And of course children are prepared to</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with men like they're prepared</v>

127
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 2>to interact with women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They understand men and they understand</v>

128
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 2>women and a lot of that knowledge comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hardwired in,</v>

129
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 2>so the child might be observing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>farther across multiple context,</v>

130
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 2>trying to understand precisely who this</v>
<v Speaker 2>creature is,</v>

131
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:09.401
<v Speaker 2>but then also learning how to embody</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in so far as she might be learning</v>

132
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 2>how to interact with males or he might</v>
<v Speaker 2>be learning how to imitate a male.</v>

133
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Of course there's some of that that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on with both genders and then a</v>

134
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 2>lot of what summarized in the in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting out in the pretending also seems</v>

135
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:26.381
<v Speaker 2>to be like just because when a child</v>
<v Speaker 2>imitates his father and is pretending to</v>

136
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:28.220
<v Speaker 2>be a father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

137
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 2>he isn't on just duplicating exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he seen,</v>

138
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some sense,</v>

139
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 2>you might think of as extracting out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commonalities of behavior across</v>

140
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 2>different contexts that the farther</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifests in order to get a handle on</v>

141
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 2>the spirit of the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's the spirit of the father</v>

142
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 2>in some sense that the child's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>embody.</v>

143
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 2>And that would be whatever makes a</v>
<v Speaker 2>father different from a man.</v>

144
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can certainly.</v>

145
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you know perfectly well when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go home to visit your parents or</v>

146
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:01.670
<v Speaker 2>when you interact with them on a day to</v>
<v Speaker 2>day basis when your father is being a</v>

147
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 2>father and when he's just being a man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be voice tone and,</v>

148
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:05.954
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

149
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.000
<v Speaker 2>and stance and gays and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all sorts of like articulated</v>

150
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:14.510
<v Speaker 2>phrases that you're familiar with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are part of the role of father and you</v>

151
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:19.511
<v Speaker 2>could see other people's fathers acting</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fathers to now it seems to be that</v>

152
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 2>a lot of symbolic representation has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with the extraction of the just.</v>

153
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like exactly what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a categorization process is exactly</v>

154
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.420
<v Speaker 2>what it is that these various behaviors</v>
<v Speaker 2>have in common and what they have,</v>

155
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 2>if they're embodied behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they have in common is something</v>

156
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 2>like a spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was hegel who talked about</v>

157
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 2>the spirit of the times and you knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

158
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:47.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at photographs that are like</v>

159
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 2>20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden they're dated,</v>

160
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for awhile,</v>

161
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 2>photographs look like they're current.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden,</v>

162
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:53.001
<v Speaker 2>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dated.</v>

163
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how in the world did people think they</v>

164
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 2>were normal when they were dressed like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

165
00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there there are are frequently</v>

166
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 2>occurrences in culture where there's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>emergence of a style that seems</v>

167
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:07.900
<v Speaker 2>consistent across the entire culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the art deco movement was like</v>

168
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what seems to be the case in those</v>

169
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 2>situations is that there are novel ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>being generated,</v>

170
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 2>but everyone is imitating everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 2>as rapidly as they possibly can because</v>

171
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 2>they're communicating in an articulated</v>
<v Speaker 2>way in.</v>

172
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 2>They're copying each other and out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you get something like a spirit or</v>

173
00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 2>ethos of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of what symbolism is trying</v>

174
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 2>to do is to extract out commonalities</v>
<v Speaker 2>across context and often commonalities</v>

175
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 2>that you really don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their categories.</v>

176
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're almost like pre categories or</v>

177
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.360
<v Speaker 2>their levels of representation that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to represent something that's</v>

178
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 2>actually too complex for you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate.</v>

179
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of you will act out being a mother,</v>

180
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:50.580
<v Speaker 2>being a father when you have children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't necessarily mean that</v>

181
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 2>you could fully articulate the knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have about what it is to be a</v>

182
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 2>mother or father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have the knowledge because</v>

183
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 2>you can act it out and it's somewhat it</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

184
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 2>you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some form of representation of</v>

185
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge too because you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that when it happens,</v>

186
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't necessarily mean that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fully articulate it.</v>

187
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Speaker 2>So you could say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have an image of what a mother</v>

188
00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 2>is and the image wouldn't be just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>still,</v>

189
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 2>it would be maybe a sequence of stills</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>

190
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's more like a pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

191
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 2>your image of the pattern of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>that characterizes a given role.</v>

192
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a good way to think about</v>

193
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:29.671
<v Speaker 2>symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

194
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 2>And that was sort of the union way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about them.</v>

195
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:36.681
<v Speaker 2>You unbelief that assemble was nature's</v>
<v Speaker 2>attempt nature within,</v>

196
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:41.691
<v Speaker 2>you say nature's attempt to express a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively unknown idea in the clearest</v>

197
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:45.420
<v Speaker 2>possible manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though that wasn't necessarily</v>

198
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 2>clear and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we use symbols all the time for that</v>

199
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 2>sort of purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see them all the time when you go to</v>

200
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

201
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 2>movies are full of symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just interpreting the dream of one</v>

202
00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 2>of my clients the other day and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreamt that he was following a spirit</v>

203
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:05.970
<v Speaker 2>around in the basement of a house that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like a maze and the spirit kept</v>

204
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 2>disappearing and reappearing and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathered some people around him that was</v>

205
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

206
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:14.130
<v Speaker 2>a social network because he's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on developing a social network</v>

207
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>and as that social network are</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed,</v>

208
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 2>he felt more and more confident to</v>
<v Speaker 2>search out this spirit and to chase it</v>

209
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:20.514
<v Speaker 2>around the basement.</v>

210
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spirit manifested itself a ghost.</v>

211
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:26.430
<v Speaker 2>It was a blue ghost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ghostly thing.</v>

212
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 2>It came out of a box that was in one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basement rooms that had a toilet</v>

213
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 2>seat on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was like a toilet that was on a.</v>

214
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.100
<v Speaker 2>It was like a toilet that was on a box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just what I said,</v>

215
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.620
<v Speaker 2>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

216
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 2>the spirit disappeared down into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>toilet and he looked in there along with</v>

217
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:47.910
<v Speaker 2>some other people and there was a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive maze like structure of many,</v>

218
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Speaker 2>many rooms underneath and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's actually quite a common</v>

219
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 2>representation and dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but does that remind anyone of anything?</v>

220
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's not unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological.</v>

221
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the story in the second part</v>

222
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 2>of Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

223
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have morning myrtle.</v>

224
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.900
<v Speaker 2>She inhabits the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's always diving into toilets and</v>

225
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 2>don't they find the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the understructure of hogwarts by going</v>

226
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 2>through that bathroom in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the,</v>

227
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 2>into the subterranean elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

228
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a good that,</v>

229
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:26.190
<v Speaker 2>that realm of symbolism is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like underneath this is exactly what the</v>

230
00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 2>case is with the second Harry Potter</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories that underneath the edifice of</v>

231
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that would be hard word sit.</v>

232
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 2>In that particular story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a subterranean realm,</v>

233
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 2>and in that subterranean realm learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that can paralyze you.</v>

234
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:43.470
<v Speaker 2>If you look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the [inaudible].</v>

235
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think happens if a rabbit</v>

236
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:49.180
<v Speaker 2>sees a Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it do?</v>

237
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 2>It phrases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why</v>

238
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.520
<v Speaker 2>are absolutely right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had rabbit assumes that it's</v>

239
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.940
<v Speaker 2>camouflaged and so as long as it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>move,</v>

240
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 2>then maybe there's some chance that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator won't see it,</v>

241
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.880
<v Speaker 2>and so the idea that you turned to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stone,</v>

242
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 2>when you look at something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory and Reptilian,</v>

243
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an old idea.</v>

244
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows how old that is.</v>

245
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.500
<v Speaker 2>It's probably about as old as mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect it's something in the</v>

246
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:21.190
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood of 60 million years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even older than that because it</v>

247
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:25.450
<v Speaker 2>was at that point that our primitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestors were living in trees and being</v>

248
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.540
<v Speaker 2>preyed upon by by snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly because our ancestors back six,</v>

249
00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 2>2 billion years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got eaten by snakes quite a lot.</v>

250
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.770
<v Speaker 2>They seem to have coevolved with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

251
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Speaker 2>there's some evidence from a woman named</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lynn Isabelle,</v>

252
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:42.520
<v Speaker 2>who's quite an interesting scholar that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that we can see so well is</v>

253
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:47.170
<v Speaker 2>actually because we learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we developed our vision to detect</v>

254
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 2>predatory reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most particularly snakes,</v>

255
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:50.450
<v Speaker 2>and the way she found that out.</v>

256
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.540
<v Speaker 2>It was by because human beings have</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing eyes.</v>

257
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see like no other animal except</v>

258
00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 2>for raptors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for birds of prey.</v>

259
00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:00.700
<v Speaker 2>They can see better than us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as primates go,</v>

260
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:02.050
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knock it out of the park.</v>

261
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 2>And mammals too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got amazing vision and what</v>

262
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Isabelle did was look around the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see,</v>

263
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what predicted,</v>

264
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:13.960
<v Speaker 2>how accurate the eyesight of primates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in different locales.</v>

265
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 2>And what she found was there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful relationship with the presence</v>

266
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:20.450
<v Speaker 2>of predatory snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an extraordinarily cool thing.</v>

267
00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:21.670
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives you some,</v>

268
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.590
<v Speaker 2>it gives you some insight into the level</v>
<v Speaker 2>of depth that might be involved in the</v>

269
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 2>analysis of the symbolic realm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Harry Potter,</v>

271
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 2>the Harry Potter story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second,</v>

272
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.690
<v Speaker 2>the second story is almost a precise</v>
<v Speaker 2>duplicate of the story of St George.</v>

273
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And if you look up St George on the net,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you Google St George,</v>

274
00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:44.020
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that St George is usually on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a horse.</v>

275
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 2>And what he's doing is slaying a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's not a very big dragon</v>

276
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:49.270
<v Speaker 2>usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's bigger than his horse.</v>

277
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:54.271
<v Speaker 2>But it's particularly nasty looking and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes out of a cave and he frees a</v>

278
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Speaker 2>virgin from its grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what happens in Harry</v>

279
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:58.551
<v Speaker 2>Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

280
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Because it's jenny that's down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And remember Harry gets eaten by the are</v>

281
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 2>bitten by the bass list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

282
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

283
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 2>And so he's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens?</v>

284
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix comes.</v>

285
00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 2>And so what's a phoenix?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

286
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a symbol of death and rebirth.</v>

287
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

288
00:15:18.881 --> 00:15:23.881
<v Speaker 2>And so what the story that Harry Potter</v>
<v Speaker 2>story says is that if you're fighting a</v>

289
00:15:24.221 --> 00:15:25.540
<v Speaker 2>dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a snake,</v>

290
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.330
<v Speaker 2>something terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that will paralyze you if you</v>

291
00:15:28.331 --> 00:15:32.920
<v Speaker 2>look at it and you're doing that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to redeem something that redeemed</v>

292
00:15:32.921 --> 00:15:36.640
<v Speaker 2>something from that encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you often learn things when you</v>

293
00:15:36.641 --> 00:15:38.470
<v Speaker 2>do something that you're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

294
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.140
<v Speaker 2>almost all learning occurs in spite of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>

295
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because to,</v>

296
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.970
<v Speaker 2>to learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to explore something new and</v>

297
00:15:45.971 --> 00:15:47.530
<v Speaker 2>that's usually something that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>frightening.</v>

298
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.560
<v Speaker 2>And so what that means is that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to face something that's</v>

299
00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:52.990
<v Speaker 2>frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can garner something of value.</v>

300
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Now I'd also meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also may well mean in the context of</v>

301
00:15:57.731 --> 00:16:01.120
<v Speaker 2>that story and you see this in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>romance that underlies the first part of</v>

302
00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Harry Potter is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man who's capable of standing up to</v>

303
00:16:05.351 --> 00:16:09.130
<v Speaker 2>predatory reptiles is also the one who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is most likely to attract women.</v>

304
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.910
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's been a truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>since God only knows when to.</v>

305
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.240
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but human beings are definitely hunters,</v>

306
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And men are bigger than women.</v>

307
00:16:18.131 --> 00:16:21.160
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that that suggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you know,</v>

308
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.910
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the predatory like activities</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are characteristic human beings</v>

309
00:16:24.911 --> 00:16:27.640
<v Speaker 2>were undertaken by males and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually males that hunt.</v>

310
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.870
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>

311
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.960
<v Speaker 2>We can put all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can put all that aside.</v>

312
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Harry gets bitten by this Basler can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason that this story shows</v>

313
00:16:36.941 --> 00:16:40.420
<v Speaker 2>that is because it wants to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story wants to tell you,</v>

314
00:16:40.421 --> 00:16:44.200
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the danger that you faced when you</v>

315
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.940
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily confront something you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of in order to learn is actually</v>

316
00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:50.650
<v Speaker 2>a danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real.</v>

317
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.560
<v Speaker 2>You see it in example like that too in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the avengers.</v>

318
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the guy's name.</v>

319
00:16:56.321 --> 00:16:58.390
<v Speaker 2>He's the black guy with the patch over</v>
<v Speaker 2>his eye.</v>

320
00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.853
<v Speaker 2>Who is that?</v>

321
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

322
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

323
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.653
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

324
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.980
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the representation of the,</v>

325
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.610
<v Speaker 2>of the one eyed hero is also quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>common.</v>

326
00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:11.960
<v Speaker 2>And you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

327
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 2>in ancient Egyptian mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a god named horace who all</v>

328
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:16.310
<v Speaker 2>talked to you about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

329
00:17:16.311 --> 00:17:17.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a picture of horace,</v>

330
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:21.620
<v Speaker 2>actually horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The God on the left there on the picture</v>

331
00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:23.540
<v Speaker 2>of the left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a face like a,</v>

332
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:25.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a falcon.</v>

333
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's because Falcons can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason the Egyptians turned</v>

334
00:17:29.811 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 2>horse into a falcon is because horace is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eye.</v>

335
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.490
<v Speaker 2>You've seen all seen the famous Egyptian</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

336
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.140
<v Speaker 2>horace can see one of the things he sees</v>
<v Speaker 2>is evil and that actually he has an</v>

337
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 2>encounter with evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a consequence,</v>

338
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 2>one of his eyes gets torn out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An idea there is that,</v>

339
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to face evil.</v>

340
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.190
<v Speaker 2>It will just like you have to confront</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

341
00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:50.970
<v Speaker 2>It's fear can paralyze you in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the things that make you afraid can</v>

342
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:53.340
<v Speaker 2>kill you and in a confrontation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>

343
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:57.600
<v Speaker 2>the same thing can happen is that it can</v>
<v Speaker 2>be so overpowering and traumatic that it</v>

344
00:17:57.601 --> 00:18:00.420
<v Speaker 2>damages your consciousness and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things are,</v>

345
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 2>these things are real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are real.</v>

346
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened to a,</v>

347
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.850
<v Speaker 2>what's the general's name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Canadian general who was there during</v>

348
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 2>the Rwandan massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He developed post traumatic stress</v>

349
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 2>disorder and he entitled the book he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote about the development of his</v>

350
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic stress disorder was called</v>
<v Speaker 2>shake hands with the devil.</v>

351
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what he meant because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

352
00:18:22.451 --> 00:18:25.080
<v Speaker 2>he met one of the guys who led the</v>
<v Speaker 2>massacre,</v>

353
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anyways,</v>

354
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 2>he never really recovered from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

355
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:32.130
<v Speaker 2>And so these things are extraordinary.</v>

356
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

357
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.060
<v Speaker 2>back to the basilisk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

358
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to confront something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's dangerous enough and informative</v>

359
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:44.700
<v Speaker 2>enough to like virtually kill you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to survive,</v>

360
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that your capacity for death</v>

361
00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:52.590
<v Speaker 2>and renewal is what saves you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

362
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 2>giving you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about this.</v>

363
00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:59.181
<v Speaker 2>Partly what it means is that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you are,</v>

364
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 2>but you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

365
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you learn something,</v>

366
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 2>you're not the same as you were before</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learned it,</v>

367
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a transformation,</v>

368
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.460
<v Speaker 2>so that means you're the same as you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're still there,</v>

369
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.610
<v Speaker 2>but you're also different and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might also ask yourself,</v>

370
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:15.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you give up when you learn</v>

371
00:19:15.901 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's an interesting question</v>

372
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:23.181
<v Speaker 2>because you very seldom learn something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's completely without precedent.</v>

373
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Now if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really shocking January,</v>

374
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 2>but you generally don't.</v>

375
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 2>What happens is that you already have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>framework of evaluation that you're</v>

376
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:34.560
<v Speaker 2>using to interpret the world and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know it's good enough to get you from</v>

377
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:37.680
<v Speaker 2>place to place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not 100 percent accurate and</v>

378
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:40.860
<v Speaker 2>when you encounter something you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>expect or something that's frightening</v>

379
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 2>so that you have to transform your</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

380
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Generally what happens is you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose some of what you already presumed</v>

381
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 2>before you can learn something new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

382
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 2>it's like a prejudice or an</v>
<v Speaker 2>oversimplification or an element of your</v>

383
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:57.930
<v Speaker 2>ignorance has to be allowed to die</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you can incorporate the</v>

384
00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:00.480
<v Speaker 2>information and then grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>

385
00:20:00.481 --> 00:20:02.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death is the precondition for learning</v>

386
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 2>at least symbolically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly what the Phoenix is</v>

387
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 2>attempting to represent in the Harry</v>
<v Speaker 2>Potter story.</v>

388
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:12.480
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who owns the Phoenix Dumbledore,</v>

389
00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:14.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's sort of God of hogwarts,</v>

390
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

391
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.953
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

392
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.150
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Phoenix stands in the same</v>

393
00:20:18.151 --> 00:20:22.560
<v Speaker 2>relationship to Dumbledore that Christ</v>
<v Speaker 2>stands in relationship to God,</v>

394
00:20:22.561 --> 00:20:25.860
<v Speaker 2>the father in Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same kind of idea.</v>

395
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 2>While it's not exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

396
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:31.110
<v Speaker 2>but the underlying structure of the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very similar.</v>

397
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.830
<v Speaker 2>And if you remember maybe what happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Harry Potter at the very end of the,</v>

398
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.100
<v Speaker 2>of the series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

399
00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:39.210
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what process does he have to go through?</v>

400
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.670
<v Speaker 2>He dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

401
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:43.500
<v Speaker 2>And then he comes back to life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

402
00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:47.010
<v Speaker 2>And he has to die and come back to life</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to defeat.</v>

403
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty funny because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people especially</v>

404
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:54.700
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist in the US where all over</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harry Potter for it's hypothetically</v>

405
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Antichristian oh cultism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

406
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.700
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say it's Christian exactly</v>

407
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 2>because it's actually older than</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity itself,</v>

408
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.820
<v Speaker 2>but the main themes in Harry Potter are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Christian symbolism in the main</v>

409
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:11.440
<v Speaker 2>themes to a great degree.</v>

410
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's funny because most of the time</v>

411
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:16.240
<v Speaker 2>when you go see this sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of you watched all the Harry</v>

412
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Potter movies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

413
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Like what the hell's up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

414
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 2>this woman got people reading 700 page</v>
<v Speaker 2>books and when they were 10 years old,</v>

415
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:25.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect a lot of you were those</v>

416
00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:27.100
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

417
00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 2>so why were you so interested in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff?</v>

418
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.270
<v Speaker 2>God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about a magic orphan.</v>

419
00:21:31.271 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with you people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 2>magic orphans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

421
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason why an orphan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well superman's an orphan to.</v>

422
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.450
<v Speaker 2>And if you go on Wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of an interesting thing to do.</v>

423
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Look up superhero orphans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 500 of them,</v>

424
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.090
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

425
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a very comp goes along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also goes along with the idea of</v>

426
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 2>having two sets of parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also characteristic both of</v>

427
00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:58.780
<v Speaker 2>superman and of Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

428
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Because Harry has his daily day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

429
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:06.610
<v Speaker 2>parents that aren't as real parents and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he has his heavenly parents who are</v>

430
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:10.510
<v Speaker 2>as magic parents and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this representation here that I've got</v>

431
00:22:10.511 --> 00:22:13.780
<v Speaker 2>up in front of you and I was telling you</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit about that in the last</v>

432
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:17.920
<v Speaker 2>lecture you could say in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are representations of your magic</v>

433
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.440
<v Speaker 2>parents and so you can think about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>

434
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:24.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have a mother and a father</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are your local mothers and</v>

435
00:22:24.641 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 2>fathers and whether or not you get along</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them or whether or not they were</v>

436
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:31.120
<v Speaker 2>any good for you or whether you</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand them or anything like that in</v>

437
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:34.390
<v Speaker 2>some sense is irrelevant because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>not your real parents,</v>

438
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 2>your real parents or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More like nature biology,</v>

439
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 2>the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

440
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.080
<v Speaker 2>And culture.</v>

441
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 2>We kind of think of that as nature and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nurture,</v>

442
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:45.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also a symbolic idea,</v>

443
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.420
<v Speaker 2>and so one of the things that young</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought Freud thought you couldn't be a</v>

444
00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:53.500
<v Speaker 2>man until your father died suddenly kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of an interesting idea and young said,</v>

445
00:22:53.501 --> 00:22:55.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the death could be symbolic,</v>

446
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.410
<v Speaker 2>and partly what he meant by that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know in so far as you're still</v>

447
00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 2>the son of your father or the daughter</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your father or the son of your mother</v>

448
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 2>or the daughter of your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still haven't grown up.</v>

449
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.830
<v Speaker 2>You haven't taken the projections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those will be Friday and projections</v>

450
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 2>that make you subordinate to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents because you might ask yourself,</v>

451
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 2>why the hell do you care what your</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents think?</v>

452
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't care what any random set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>

453
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.800
<v Speaker 2>60 year old people think about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you care what your parents think?</v>

454
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason for that I would say is</v>

455
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:32.041
<v Speaker 2>because you're suffering or benefiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of a projection.</v>

456
00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 2>You project something onto your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a quasi identity status and</v>

457
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.640
<v Speaker 2>they're the people who know what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and they're,</v>

458
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're entitled to evaluate you and</v>

459
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're working to achieve things</v>
<v Speaker 2>to impress them and make them happy.</v>

460
00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:47.031
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

461
00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:49.100
<v Speaker 2>why them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why them?</v>

462
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.620
<v Speaker 2>You don't care what their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends think.</v>

463
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't imagine you probably don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really care what the parents of your</v>

464
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 2>friends think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why do you care what your parents</v>

465
00:23:57.621 --> 00:23:59.120
<v Speaker 2>think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

466
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.380
<v Speaker 2>understanding that is part of coming to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the dynamics.</v>

467
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Freud would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the personal unconscious because your</v>

468
00:24:06.621 --> 00:24:10.760
<v Speaker 2>relationship with your parents as part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your personal unconscious and young's</v>

469
00:24:10.761 --> 00:24:11.511
<v Speaker 2>idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

470
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 2>you have to replace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because Freud thought</v>

471
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.540
<v Speaker 2>that the reason there were patriarchal</v>
<v Speaker 2>religions was because people projected</v>

472
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:23.180
<v Speaker 2>the figure of their father onto the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmos in some sense.</v>

473
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.300
<v Speaker 2>They sort of personified the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

474
00:24:25.301 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like God is an old man with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>beard,</v>

475
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:30.560
<v Speaker 2>which by the way isn't a stupid theory</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it sounds like.</v>

476
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.480
<v Speaker 2>But anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

477
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freud thought that religion sort of</v>

478
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:38.660
<v Speaker 2>emerged out of the familial dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but young thought that that wasn't</v>

479
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 2>exactly right because the religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbols like say the one on the right</v>

480
00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:45.680
<v Speaker 2>there where you have God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the father was representing something</v>

481
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 2>like a metta father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the sum total of all fathers,</v>

482
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:52.580
<v Speaker 2>which would be something like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patriarchy and you need a representation</v>

483
00:24:52.581 --> 00:24:56.690
<v Speaker 2>of that because you are a child of</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and if you're not a child of</v>

484
00:24:56.691 --> 00:24:59.480
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're an incomplete being and you</v>

485
00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 2>also don't want to confuse your parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your father.</v>

486
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's masculine and feminine</v>

487
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:07.580
<v Speaker 2>elements in both parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the sake of simplification,</v>

488
00:25:07.581 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lay it out the way I am</v>
<v Speaker 2>laying.</v>

489
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:11.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to confuse your father</v>

490
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:15.530
<v Speaker 2>with culture or history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives the embodiment of both those</v>

491
00:25:15.531 --> 00:25:17.240
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he certainly doesn't embody it in</v>

492
00:25:17.241 --> 00:25:20.270
<v Speaker 2>total and your primary relationship in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense,</v>

493
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:22.070
<v Speaker 2>your personal relationship is to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>

494
00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:26.420
<v Speaker 2>but your primary existential</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship is actually to culture</v>

495
00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:27.254
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

496
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.963
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

497
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I can give you an example of that to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick example.</v>

498
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.600
<v Speaker 2>How many have you Seen Poor Pinocchio?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

499
00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:41.690
<v Speaker 2>so anybody not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you,</v>

500
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.940
<v Speaker 2>you should watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great movie.</v>

501
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit dated and in some of its bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>preachy,</v>

502
00:25:48.301 --> 00:25:51.060
<v Speaker 2>but fundamentally they knocked it out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the park.</v>

503
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.760
<v Speaker 2>So Pinocchio is this fake thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

504
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.010
<v Speaker 2>He's like this artificial boys made by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

505
00:25:56.011 --> 00:25:58.800
<v Speaker 2>who's was a pretty good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's Pinocchio trying to do?</v>

506
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:00.991
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

507
00:26:00.991 --> 00:26:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Well hopefully that's part of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to do and hopefully that's</v>

508
00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:06.900
<v Speaker 2>a process that this class could</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceivably further.</v>

509
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:12.210
<v Speaker 2>So what is Pinocchio have to do in</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to his father in order to</v>

510
00:26:12.211 --> 00:26:13.050
<v Speaker 2>become real?</v>

511
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.480
<v Speaker 2>He rescues him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

512
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.490
<v Speaker 2>What does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes down to the bottom of the ocean.</v>

513
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Was He fine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a whale.</v>

514
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Weirdly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really weirdly enough,</v>

515
00:26:22.141 --> 00:26:23.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what a puppet is doing on</v>

516
00:26:23.761 --> 00:26:25.350
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of the ocean looking for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whale,</v>

517
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.370
<v Speaker 2>but apparently it swallowed his father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which also none of that makes any sense</v>

518
00:26:29.371 --> 00:26:31.350
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You realize it makes no sense,</v>

519
00:26:31.351 --> 00:26:34.470
<v Speaker 2>but of course you're in there like</v>
<v Speaker 2>following it and thinking,</v>

520
00:26:34.471 --> 00:26:35.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can.</v>

521
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:38.520
<v Speaker 2>You know I can suspend disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

522
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.510
<v Speaker 2>it's just a puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't pop it and it's looking for his</v>

523
00:26:42.511 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 2>father at bottom of the ocean in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whale.</v>

524
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Oil makes it doesn't make any sense at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

525
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:48.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes no sense whatsoever,</v>

526
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's a mythological motif and part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that motif.</v>

527
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a death and rebirth motif that</v>
<v Speaker 2>going down to the bottom of the ocean</v>

528
00:26:55.251 --> 00:26:57.300
<v Speaker 2>and being devoured by something and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back up,</v>

529
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.300
<v Speaker 2>so that's a death and rebirth Motif,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even more importantly,</v>

530
00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:05.301
<v Speaker 2>the motif there suggests that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop being a puppet Marionette,</v>

531
00:27:05.881 --> 00:27:07.650
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's pulling your strings.</v>

532
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Something else is pulling your</v>
<v Speaker 2>strengths.</v>

533
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 2>You're a Marionette till you rescue your</v>
<v Speaker 2>father from the bottom of the ocean,</v>

534
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.270
<v Speaker 2>and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

535
00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:18.930
<v Speaker 2>it means that you're a puppet of forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not understand probably</v>

536
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:22.470
<v Speaker 2>prevailing political attitudes or</v>
<v Speaker 2>radiologists or something pathetic like</v>

537
00:27:22.471 --> 00:27:27.471
<v Speaker 2>that until you make the attempt to dive</v>
<v Speaker 2>down into the depths and reclaim your</v>

538
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 2>identity with history as a phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

539
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 2>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why should you study history?</v>

540
00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:34.914
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

541
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 2>history is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:39.900
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not studying history with the</v>

543
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:41.670
<v Speaker 2>understanding that you're studying</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

544
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:45.360
<v Speaker 2>then you don't know what the hell you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing and you can't be a complete person</v>

545
00:27:45.361 --> 00:27:49.320
<v Speaker 2>because we're culture where cultural</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were cultural creatures.</v>

546
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.800
<v Speaker 2>You can't be a full person until you</v>
<v Speaker 2>catalyze your identity with your culture</v>

547
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.140
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like an existential obligation.</v>

548
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't do it then you're going</v>

549
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:04.440
<v Speaker 2>to feel all nihilistic and weak or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be old totalitarian and</v>

550
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.720
<v Speaker 2>self righteous and oppressive and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

551
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>maybe genocidal and deadly.</v>

552
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that you can just</v>

553
00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:11.670
<v Speaker 2>brush off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do it.</v>

554
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.220
<v Speaker 2>It's part of an initiation motif by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

555
00:28:14.221 --> 00:28:16.710
<v Speaker 2>which we're also going to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

556
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 2>So that's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to talk about symbolism and</v>

557
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:23.940
<v Speaker 2>you'll notice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the first part of the</v>

558
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.180
<v Speaker 2>lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that my lectures are,</v>

559
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to think about them as</v>

560
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:31.180
<v Speaker 2>impressionist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a reason for this.</v>

561
00:28:31.181 --> 00:28:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Like I started reading young about 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

562
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:35.790
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I pretty much read everything he</v>

563
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:38.520
<v Speaker 2>wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an awful lot and it's very</v>

564
00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:43.410
<v Speaker 2>difficult to read you because there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not precisely a linear narrative,</v>

565
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 2>but the reason for that is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to construct a linear</v>

566
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:53.031
<v Speaker 2>narrative about information that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily transmitted in images and so</v>

567
00:28:53.401 --> 00:28:58.120
<v Speaker 2>in order to to impart the knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to give people like some</v>

568
00:28:58.121 --> 00:28:59.790
<v Speaker 2>pictures of the whole picture.</v>

569
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.350
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like like laying them out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>space in a sense and so that if you get</v>

570
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:07.650
<v Speaker 2>enough of those little sub pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing will click into focus</v>

571
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:08.484
<v Speaker 2>and you'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aha,</v>

572
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wandering through it in a linear</v>

573
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:14.310
<v Speaker 2>manner is extraordinarily difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

574
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:17.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that's why the kind of</v>

575
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:22.701
<v Speaker 2>information that's embodied in symbols</v>
<v Speaker 2>is generally not transmitted as linear</v>

576
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:25.200
<v Speaker 2>articulated knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't transmit it that way.</v>

577
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:30.710
<v Speaker 2>And so it remains in forums like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at those pictures,</v>

578
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:33.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so think about those pictures for a</v>

579
00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:34.830
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

580
00:29:34.831 --> 00:29:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Is the picture on the left?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's ancient Egypt,</v>

581
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.840
<v Speaker 2>ancient Egypt law lasted for longer than</v>
<v Speaker 2>Western,</v>

582
00:29:40.841 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 2>said if you don't include Egypt as part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Western civilization,</v>

583
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly lasted longer than what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we generally consider Western</v>

584
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It lasted for thousands and thousands of</v>

585
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

586
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those images are representations of</v>

587
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:57.340
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental assumptions of Egyptian</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

588
00:29:57.341 --> 00:30:01.240
<v Speaker 2>And so those images had foundational</v>
<v Speaker 2>power for eons,</v>

589
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 2>for thousands and thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

590
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.690
<v Speaker 2>when you can just look at them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens to you,</v>

591
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.610
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 2>you look at them like they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>photographs or,</v>

593
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 2>or blow our flat images,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had the kind of motive power</v>

594
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 2>that drove an entire culture for</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands of years.</v>

595
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:19.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had more motive power than</v>

596
00:30:19.961 --> 00:30:24.310
<v Speaker 2>communist ideology for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which only managed to motivate people</v>

597
00:30:24.311 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 2>for about 50 years and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's certainly possible that they</v>

598
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:31.990
<v Speaker 2>had more motive power than Christian</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas which have only been around for</v>

599
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 2>roughly 2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

600
00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:36.610
<v Speaker 2>So when you're looking at something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

601
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at something with power</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that you know that that</v>

602
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.530
<v Speaker 2>symbolic representations or religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>represented representations are,</v>

603
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 2>what do you call a unsophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 2>empirical theories,</v>

604
00:30:48.851 --> 00:30:51.010
<v Speaker 2>like that's an idiotic theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

605
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:52.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that anybody who's</v>

606
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:57.040
<v Speaker 2>educated should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be proposing such a thing after</v>

607
00:30:57.041 --> 00:31:01.210
<v Speaker 2>more than 100 years of psychoanalytic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anthropological investigation.</v>

608
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.570
<v Speaker 2>It's just not a tenable theory anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

609
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.970
<v Speaker 2>So what are the other people up to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

610
00:31:06.971 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 2>let's look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at the left hand side.</v>

611
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you a little bit about what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptians were trying to figure out.</v>

612
00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:14.530
<v Speaker 2>So on the right hand side of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture,</v>

613
00:31:14.531 --> 00:31:16.180
<v Speaker 2>you have isis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

614
00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:19.990
<v Speaker 2>And now isis is goddess of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>underworld and she's also a goddess of</v>

615
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:23.080
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she's the goddess of the place</v>

616
00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 2>that you go when things fall apart</v>
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>

617
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 2>And it's worthwhile thinking of that as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a domain.</v>

618
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:30.310
<v Speaker 2>And you know what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

619
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.400
<v Speaker 2>so a dream falls apart or revision falls</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>

620
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:36.970
<v Speaker 2>or you get dumped by someone you love or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get betrayed or you fail.</v>

621
00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you just have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

622
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.980
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

623
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe you have clinical depression or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hyper anxious,</v>

624
00:31:43.781 --> 00:31:45.370
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some negative emotion</v>

625
00:31:45.371 --> 00:31:46.630
<v Speaker 2>pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

626
00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:51.040
<v Speaker 2>that's a state of being right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think about it as a place and</v>

627
00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:54.100
<v Speaker 2>that place is the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The underworld is where you go when</v>

628
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:57.880
<v Speaker 2>things fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the representation for the Egyptians</v>

629
00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:03.030
<v Speaker 2>of the underworld was primarily isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was the persona find figure that</v>

630
00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:08.971
<v Speaker 2>represented the domain that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath normative knowledge and the</v>

631
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:12.330
<v Speaker 2>reason she was female.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very complicated and I'd really,</v>

632
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:14.680
<v Speaker 2>like I said last time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't have time to explain it</v>

633
00:32:14.681 --> 00:32:17.200
<v Speaker 2>in depth unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but part of the reason that the</v>

634
00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 2>underworld is given feminine qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

635
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.210
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of them is,</v>

636
00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:26.440
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of the defining feature of the</v>

637
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:29.410
<v Speaker 2>feminine is that from which new forms</v>
<v Speaker 2>emerge,</v>

638
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.440
<v Speaker 2>that's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's almost like there's other ways of</v>

639
00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:34.120
<v Speaker 2>defining female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's our feminine.</v>

640
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 2>But that's a pretty good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty universal one.</v>

641
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.330
<v Speaker 2>And the unknown is feminine because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown is the place from which all new</v>

642
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:43.220
<v Speaker 2>forms emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

643
00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:46.040
<v Speaker 2>So when you interact with the unknown on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a voluntary basis,</v>

644
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.420
<v Speaker 2>which can be symbolized sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which often happened with Freud's</v>

645
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:54.260
<v Speaker 2>thinking and with his clients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bring forth something new and so</v>

646
00:32:54.261 --> 00:32:59.120
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrifying place to descend into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be hellish because hale is</v>

647
00:32:59.121 --> 00:33:03.860
<v Speaker 2>actually like the worst suburb of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown and I'm sure some of you have</v>

648
00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 2>been there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

649
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.780
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you're there now or maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

650
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:11.390
<v Speaker 2>people who were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very,</v>

651
00:33:11.391 --> 00:33:14.570
<v Speaker 2>very rough place to visit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you do it accidentally,</v>

652
00:33:14.571 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go there,</v>

653
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:19.130
<v Speaker 2>especially accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might never come out.</v>

654
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 2>But if you do come out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you've learned something,</v>

655
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're new in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another reason in some sense</v>

656
00:33:28.311 --> 00:33:32.540
<v Speaker 2>why the feminine is a symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the unknown because</v>

657
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:34.940
<v Speaker 2>there is a death and rebirth motif</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

658
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.610
<v Speaker 2>And birth has always associated with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminine.</v>

659
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

660
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.260
<v Speaker 2>can I remember the word?</v>

661
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.073
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

662
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.060
<v Speaker 2>The Baptismal Fountain Inn in Christian</v>
<v Speaker 2>ceremony.</v>

663
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:55.061
<v Speaker 2>So baptism ceremonies has a Latin word</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is basically equivalent to uterus.</v>

664
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.390
<v Speaker 2>So you can look that up if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

665
00:33:57.391 --> 00:33:59.350
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't exactly remember the word,</v>

666
00:33:59.351 --> 00:34:01.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's the same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're being plunged back into</v>

667
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:07.360
<v Speaker 2>the feminine underpinnings of everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then pulled back up and.</v>

668
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what a baptism is supposed to be.</v>

669
00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.910
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be born into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit instead of into matter.</v>

670
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.840
<v Speaker 2>And that means that you've emerged as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

671
00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulated being that isn't merely a</v>

672
00:34:19.061 --> 00:34:21.370
<v Speaker 2>biological product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

673
00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

674
00:34:22.781 --> 00:34:24.370
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's isis.</v>

675
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.590
<v Speaker 2>And Isis is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wife of Ho of ocirus or Cyrus who's</v>

676
00:34:29.591 --> 00:34:31.090
<v Speaker 2>in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing on a pillar there.</v>

677
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:35.650
<v Speaker 2>He's the father and he's a pillar</v>
<v Speaker 2>because culture is like the pillars that</v>

678
00:34:35.651 --> 00:34:39.310
<v Speaker 2>hold things up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in the Egyptian story or Cyrus</v>

679
00:34:39.311 --> 00:34:42.070
<v Speaker 2>was an old king and he was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>willfully blind.</v>

680
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:45.310
<v Speaker 2>He didn't really know what was going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore and he didn't pay sufficient</v>

681
00:34:45.311 --> 00:34:47.320
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had an evil brother by the way,</v>

682
00:34:47.321 --> 00:34:50.620
<v Speaker 2>whose name was seth and seth average</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually chops them up,</v>

683
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.300
<v Speaker 2>wants to take over the kingdom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>scattered them all over the kingdom.</v>

684
00:34:55.301 --> 00:34:58.720
<v Speaker 2>He can't kill him because he's a god and</v>
<v Speaker 2>isis comes up from the underworld and</v>

685
00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:00.940
<v Speaker 2>fines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those Cyrus's salice and makes herself</v>

686
00:35:00.941 --> 00:35:05.710
<v Speaker 2>pregnant and she gives birth to horace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's the guy on the left and horace is</v>

687
00:35:05.711 --> 00:35:08.710
<v Speaker 2>sort of like King Arthur were any number</v>
<v Speaker 2>of orphans.</v>

688
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.940
<v Speaker 2>He grows up or or like a lion and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lion king,</v>

689
00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Simba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simba grows up basically outside of the</v>

690
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.610
<v Speaker 2>damage kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

691
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.760
<v Speaker 2>It's taken over by scar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same story.</v>

692
00:35:21.761 --> 00:35:25.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same story and</v>

693
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.650
<v Speaker 2>horace grows up outside the kingdom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he grows up,</v>

694
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.110
<v Speaker 2>he can really see horus.</v>

695
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.170
<v Speaker 2>That's why the symbol is the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes back and he can see evil.</v>

696
00:35:35.171 --> 00:35:38.910
<v Speaker 2>He's not blind like his father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the difference between you guys</v>

697
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 2>and dead culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

698
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.630
<v Speaker 2>So your cultural organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not dead.</v>

699
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 2>You can see and you can update yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're like the living embodiments of</v>

700
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:51.330
<v Speaker 2>history and the living embodiments of</v>
<v Speaker 2>history have to know what history is and</v>

701
00:35:51.331 --> 00:35:55.250
<v Speaker 2>incorporated into themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also be awake enough to alternate</v>

702
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.040
<v Speaker 2>where that alteration is necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're doing that to</v>

703
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:04.230
<v Speaker 2>further their knowledge of the unknown</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also to triumph over evil.</v>

704
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horace grows up outside,</v>

705
00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:10.800
<v Speaker 2>but like he can see he's different than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

706
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly because he's young and he knows</v>

707
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:16.860
<v Speaker 2>that his uncle is evil and he goes back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and has a terrible fight with them.</v>

708
00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:19.890
<v Speaker 2>And during the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seth,</v>

709
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:23.610
<v Speaker 2>his uncle terrorists out one of his eyes</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's no joke to confront evil.</v>

710
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.980
<v Speaker 2>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can damage your consciousness.</v>

711
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse wins and he gets his id back and</v>

712
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 2>then he banishes seth to the Nether</v>
<v Speaker 2>regions of the kingdom because he can't</v>

713
00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:36.370
<v Speaker 2>get rid of him either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't kill him.</v>

714
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:41.420
<v Speaker 2>He's the potential for corruption in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>institution is always there.</v>

715
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:44.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's no permanently get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only controlling it from time to</v>

716
00:36:44.941 --> 00:36:49.560
<v Speaker 2>time anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he gets his id back and then instead</v>

717
00:36:49.561 --> 00:36:51.570
<v Speaker 2>of putting it back in his head and be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>

718
00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:55.080
<v Speaker 2>which you'd expect them to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes back down to the underworld and</v>

719
00:36:55.081 --> 00:36:58.740
<v Speaker 2>he finds his father there because his</v>
<v Speaker 2>father chopped up is also a spirit who</v>

720
00:36:58.741 --> 00:37:03.720
<v Speaker 2>inhabits the underworld and he gives his</v>
<v Speaker 2>father the eye</v>

721
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.280
<v Speaker 2>and then the two of them go back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rule the kingdom together.</v>

722
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the world's most brilliant</v>

723
00:37:10.171 --> 00:37:12.960
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a staggeringly brilliant story</v>

724
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.430
<v Speaker 2>because it says</v>

725
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.780
<v Speaker 2>the act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that act of youth should be the guiding</v>

726
00:37:19.781 --> 00:37:23.010
<v Speaker 2>property of the state because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horace.</v>

727
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.850
<v Speaker 2>So Cyrus combination was actually what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Pharaoh imitated when he was being a</v>

728
00:37:27.851 --> 00:37:30.970
<v Speaker 2>good feral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dynamic vision.</v>

729
00:37:30.971 --> 00:37:33.070
<v Speaker 2>That should be the guiding principle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state,</v>

730
00:37:33.071 --> 00:37:36.670
<v Speaker 2>but it should be allied with tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliant.</v>

731
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that the radical</v>

732
00:37:39.311 --> 00:37:42.160
<v Speaker 2>revolutionaries of the 19 sixties never</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out.</v>

733
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:43.331
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

734
00:37:43.331 --> 00:37:46.540
<v Speaker 2>don't trust anybody over 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a really stupid idea,</v>

735
00:37:46.541 --> 00:37:51.100
<v Speaker 2>especially since you're going to spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>half two thirds of your life over 30 the</v>

736
00:37:51.101 --> 00:37:52.060
<v Speaker 2>hell good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

737
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.210
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>embody your tradition,</v>

738
00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:58.060
<v Speaker 2>men be awake at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if you do that,</v>

739
00:37:58.061 --> 00:37:59.890
<v Speaker 2>then you'd be a good ruler of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

740
00:37:59.891 --> 00:38:01.750
<v Speaker 2>of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your little family,</v>

741
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.780
<v Speaker 2>and if you have an opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond that then of whatever</v>

742
00:38:04.781 --> 00:38:07.060
<v Speaker 2>organizations you have to be happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be involved in,</v>

743
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.000
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what should be happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you university.</v>

744
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.250
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole point of going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

745
00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a trade school.</v>

746
00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that there's anything wrong with</v>

747
00:38:15.701 --> 00:38:17.740
<v Speaker 2>trade schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite the contrary,</v>

748
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:22.150
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what university is for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to turn you into creatures that</v>

749
00:38:22.151 --> 00:38:25.210
<v Speaker 2>aren't marionettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to do that you have to follow a</v>

750
00:38:25.211 --> 00:38:28.420
<v Speaker 2>mythological path or you can be chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and random.</v>

751
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Those are or sub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

752
00:38:31.331 --> 00:38:33.820
<v Speaker 2>subject to so many idiotic totalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology.</v>

753
00:38:33.821 --> 00:38:36.850
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't it either of those paths</v>

754
00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:39.190
<v Speaker 2>because they're not going to get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>very far for very long.</v>

755
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 2>So that's the Egyptians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant.</v>

756
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:46.930
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like they understood that</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

757
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.350
<v Speaker 2>They told it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>

758
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:51.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you think,</v>

759
00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you tell something you don't</v>

760
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:55.510
<v Speaker 2>understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like you can watch Harry</v>

761
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Potter and not have a clue what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

762
00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.820
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of it is,</v>

763
00:38:59.821 --> 00:39:04.240
<v Speaker 2>is that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have levels of understanding that</v>

764
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.960
<v Speaker 2>make you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't simultaneously understand.</v>

765
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.950
<v Speaker 2>You can't articulate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're a multi levered,</v>

766
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:15.940
<v Speaker 2>multilevel creature and the part of you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's conscious and articulate is</v>

767
00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 2>floating on a massive substructure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's neither conscious nor articulate,</v>

768
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in some sense striving to become</v>

769
00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:27.490
<v Speaker 2>conscious and articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that can never be completely either</v>

770
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 2>of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's part of the pain of being half</v>

771
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:33.460
<v Speaker 2>spirit and half matter.</v>

772
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:34.923
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

773
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.490
<v Speaker 2>so then on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

774
00:39:37.491 --> 00:39:39.800
<v Speaker 2>you have another set of symbols which</v>
<v Speaker 2>are quite similar.</v>

775
00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although,</v>

776
00:39:41.961 --> 00:39:43.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come about the story in a</v>

777
00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:46.040
<v Speaker 2>completely different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I told you a little bit about them</v>

778
00:39:46.041 --> 00:39:49.270
<v Speaker 2>before you have Mary at the top and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's regardless,</v>

779
00:39:49.271 --> 00:39:51.800
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's represented here is that which</v>

780
00:39:51.801 --> 00:39:54.020
<v Speaker 2>encloses everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

781
00:39:54.021 --> 00:39:55.580
<v Speaker 2>And so in that representation,</v>

782
00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.550
<v Speaker 2>culture is the child of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at the</v>

783
00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:03.430
<v Speaker 2>statute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are many ways of looking at this</v>

784
00:40:03.431 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 2>statue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing that's strange</v>

785
00:40:05.411 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 2>about symbolic representations because</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some sense you can't exhaust them</v>

786
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 2>with words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always something more you can</v>

787
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:15.690
<v Speaker 2>say about them and that's partly because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

788
00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:19.510
<v Speaker 2>they're associated with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if something is associated with</v>

789
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:22.870
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can talk about it forever and</v>

790
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:25.660
<v Speaker 2>you'll never run out of things to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are inexhaustible.</v>

791
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.740
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have God the father who we</v>

792
00:40:28.741 --> 00:40:31.090
<v Speaker 2>already talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you notice in that image,</v>

793
00:40:31.091 --> 00:40:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I hope you can see that the figure is</v>
<v Speaker 2>open and there's a crowd of people</v>

794
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:36.250
<v Speaker 2>gathered around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

795
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.100
<v Speaker 2>And they're all looking at the central</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbol,</v>

796
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 2>which is the crucifix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

797
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:42.600
<v Speaker 2>you might be thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

798
00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:47.440
<v Speaker 2>billions of people over the last 2000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years have spent a substantial amount of</v>

799
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:50.230
<v Speaker 2>time doing nothing but gazing at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crucifix.</v>

800
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like why,</v>

801
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one answer as well,</v>

802
00:40:54.331 --> 00:40:57.150
<v Speaker 2>those people are all superstitious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe in stupid things like,</v>

803
00:40:57.151 --> 00:40:59.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death and resurrection and you know the</v>

804
00:40:59.371 --> 00:41:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Virgin birth and all those things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>make no empirical sense.</v>

805
00:41:02.011 --> 00:41:03.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

806
00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.070
<v Speaker 2>well think again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

807
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.850
<v Speaker 2>it's not a matter of simplistic belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of belief structures that</v>

808
00:41:08.851 --> 00:41:11.130
<v Speaker 2>are so profound that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate them.</v>

809
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.090
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what they mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so to gaze on the figure of the</v>

810
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:20.510
<v Speaker 2>dying and resurrecting hero is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that a huge part of what</v>

811
00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:24.570
<v Speaker 2>redeems you in life from evil and from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that terrify you is your</v>

812
00:41:24.571 --> 00:41:29.571
<v Speaker 2>capacity to let go of things that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>outmoded in dad and to revitalize them</v>

813
00:41:31.231 --> 00:41:34.430
<v Speaker 2>as a consequence of new learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the very soul.</v>

814
00:41:34.431 --> 00:41:36.070
<v Speaker 2>It's your very soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very.</v>

815
00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.270
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the living part of you.</v>

816
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's the part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's so interesting about</v>

817
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:45.230
<v Speaker 2>this is according to the wisdom</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions of mankind,</v>

818
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:50.150
<v Speaker 2>that's the part of your spirit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>protects you against fear and pain.</v>

819
00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

820
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:52.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want fear,</v>

821
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't want pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should build a big wall around</v>

822
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:58.400
<v Speaker 2>yourself and wrap yourself up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Styrofoam and sit right in the middle</v>

823
00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.460
<v Speaker 2>where nothing bad is ever going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to you,</v>

824
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

825
00:42:02.931 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously ridiculous and second</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all,</v>

826
00:42:04.821 --> 00:42:07.850
<v Speaker 2>you die of boredom in no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you did that,</v>

827
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 2>you cannot be protected from the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that frighten you and hurt you.</v>

828
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.090
<v Speaker 2>But if you identify with the part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your being that has the capacity for</v>

829
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 2>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're always.</v>

830
00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:22.580
<v Speaker 2>You're always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always the equal of what it is</v>

831
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 2>that's opposing you or maybe more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the equal of it so you can either depend</v>

832
00:42:27.201 --> 00:42:29.330
<v Speaker 2>on the walls that protect you from</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

833
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:34.160
<v Speaker 2>And so those could be like actual walls</v>
<v Speaker 2>or cultural walls or totalitarian</v>

834
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 2>beliefs are rigid thought patterns or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

835
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Or you can rely instead on the part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you that's voluntarily able to confront</v>

836
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:46.100
<v Speaker 2>things that are frightening and painful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and triumph.</v>

837
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And the deepest story of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of humankind is that that's the part of</v>

838
00:42:52.161 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 2>us that's the most powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

839
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.700
<v Speaker 2>weak as we are and subject as we are to</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of terrible things.</v>

840
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.210
<v Speaker 2>What do you need for protection?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you need.</v>

841
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:07.160
<v Speaker 2>You have to be willing to let go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back and let go and come back and</v>

842
00:43:07.161 --> 00:43:11.630
<v Speaker 2>then you can stay dynamic through your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the ups and downs of your life</v>

843
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.020
<v Speaker 2>and makes you incredibly strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

844
00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you could think</v>

845
00:43:16.971 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 2>about in relationship to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll talk about this more when we</v>

846
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 2>talk about Carl Rogers.</v>

847
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Rogers talked a lot about the importance</v>
<v Speaker 2>of listening.</v>

848
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said most people can't listen because</v>

849
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:30.260
<v Speaker 2>what they want to do instead is imposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>their viewpoint on the other person.</v>

850
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Because if you listen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to tell you all sorts of</v>

851
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 2>weird nonsense about their own lives and</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what they think.</v>

852
00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:36.770
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it's gonna be.</v>

853
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.400
<v Speaker 2>It'll say it'll set you back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to hear that.</v>

854
00:43:40.401 --> 00:43:43.490
<v Speaker 2>People have gone through that until I</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually understand their opinions.</v>

855
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:48.740
<v Speaker 2>If you can listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you can open up an exchange of</v>

856
00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>information and that can transform both</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you and Rogers regarded that as an</v>

857
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:55.970
<v Speaker 2>absolute necessity in the therapeutic</v>
<v Speaker 2>context and even in the context of</v>

858
00:43:55.971 --> 00:43:58.040
<v Speaker 2>profound relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he said,</v>

859
00:43:58.041 --> 00:43:59.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people won't do that because they</v>

860
00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:01.310
<v Speaker 2>want to cling to what they already have.</v>

861
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.830
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things you can think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

862
00:44:03.831 --> 00:44:06.140
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is worth thinking about for five</v>

863
00:44:06.141 --> 00:44:07.940
<v Speaker 2>years here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's something to think about.</v>

864
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.800
<v Speaker 2>What's your friend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things you know or the things you</v>

865
00:44:12.801 --> 00:44:15.410
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

866
00:44:15.411 --> 00:44:17.270
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot more things you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

867
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.530
<v Speaker 2>And second the things you don't know are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bar is the birthplace of all your</v>

868
00:44:21.531 --> 00:44:24.530
<v Speaker 2>new knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you make the things you don't</v>

869
00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:27.470
<v Speaker 2>know your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the things that you know,</v>

870
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.740
<v Speaker 2>well then you're always on a quest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a sense,</v>

871
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.810
<v Speaker 2>you're always looking for new</v>
<v Speaker 2>information on the off chance that</v>

872
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 2>somebody that doesn't agree with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>will tell you something.</v>

873
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:39.510
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't figure it out on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely different way of</v>

874
00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:44.160
<v Speaker 2>looking at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's the antithesis of opinionated,</v>

875
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.110
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

876
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.470
<v Speaker 2>so</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's some</v>

877
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.720
<v Speaker 2>you can think of these terms.</v>

878
00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just reading this research</v>

879
00:44:58.771 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 2>paper by one of the people in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>department and he was looking at.</v>

880
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.760
<v Speaker 2>He's found out that people are better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than chance at determining sexual</v>

881
00:45:07.891 --> 00:45:12.891
<v Speaker 2>orientation when they look at cropped</v>
<v Speaker 2>faces that are gray scaled with no hair</v>

882
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.730
<v Speaker 2>for 50 to 100 milliseconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty fast a,</v>

883
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:20.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're not thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that speed.</v>

884
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 2>It takes you half a second to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about something maybe a little less,</v>

885
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 2>but 50 milliseconds to 100 milliseconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

886
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.610
<v Speaker 2>that's automatic processing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

887
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 2>so he found that if you show people</v>
<v Speaker 2>faces,</v>

888
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:37.191
<v Speaker 2>then they can predict with better than</v>
<v Speaker 2>chance levels of accurately accuracy</v>

889
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:39.630
<v Speaker 2>what the sexual orientation of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>person next.</v>

890
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Now we don't know exactly how they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

891
00:45:41.941 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing he found is that if</v>

892
00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:51.171
<v Speaker 2>you're exposed to say to a face that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>judge as a homosexual,</v>

893
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:53.970
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're given a bunch of</v>

894
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:58.971
<v Speaker 2>cognitive tasks where if you stare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you use the articulated stereotypes</v>

895
00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:04.380
<v Speaker 2>of homosexual people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll perform better that you do</v>

896
00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:07.980
<v Speaker 2>perform better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you see a face that you instantly</v>

897
00:46:07.981 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 2>categorize as homosexual.</v>

898
00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Then you're given a cognitive test that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do better at.</v>

899
00:46:12.151 --> 00:46:16.140
<v Speaker 2>If you rely on cognitive stereotypes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do do better on it.</v>

900
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.560
<v Speaker 2>So what that means is the brief</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptual exposure activates a whole</v>

901
00:46:22.471 --> 00:46:27.471
<v Speaker 2>complex of associated ideas and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly obvious why those things are</v>

902
00:46:28.021 --> 00:46:29.580
<v Speaker 2>associated it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

903
00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:32.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to be gay or for that</v>

904
00:46:32.821 --> 00:46:34.260
<v Speaker 2>matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean to be straight?</v>

905
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means a whole bunch of things and you</v>

906
00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:38.460
<v Speaker 2>probably couldn't tell me all of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that it means in some of the.</v>

907
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive rather than fake.</v>

908
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:45.630
<v Speaker 2>No matter when you're exposed to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular image.</v>

909
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 2>That entire complex of associations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a map,</v>

910
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 2>the mapping of a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

911
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Because to be gay is to be a personality</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a certain sort.</v>

912
00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:00.030
<v Speaker 2>It's to embody a certain mode of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have a picture of that</v>

913
00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:03.690
<v Speaker 2>personality that's partly made out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all your cognitive assumptions and that</v>

914
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:08.691
<v Speaker 2>can be activated at 50 milliseconds by</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposure to just a black and white</v>

915
00:47:08.881 --> 00:47:09.714
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

916
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's like a complex.</v>

917
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll hear about the idea of complex</v>

918
00:47:14.101 --> 00:47:17.280
<v Speaker 2>when you read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you read you and a complex is a set</v>

919
00:47:17.281 --> 00:47:22.281
<v Speaker 2>of associated ideas that tend to take on</v>
<v Speaker 2>embodied form and you might ask,</v>

920
00:47:22.891 --> 00:47:26.700
<v Speaker 2>well why would ideas tend to take on</v>
<v Speaker 2>embodied form?</v>

921
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:30.700
<v Speaker 2>And then answer to that is what the hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>is an idea if it doesn't take on</v>

922
00:47:30.701 --> 00:47:35.701
<v Speaker 2>embodied form your embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to say that it ideas useful and you</v>

923
00:47:36.401 --> 00:47:37.810
<v Speaker 2>make that judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

924
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:41.770
<v Speaker 2>when you find an idea interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like why is it interesting?</v>

925
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is also something that's really</v>

926
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 2>worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

927
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Because to be interested in something is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in the grip of a particular mode</v>

928
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:52.450
<v Speaker 2>of being and you don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary control over that.</v>

929
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Some things you find interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some things you don't and you know,</v>

930
00:47:56.861 --> 00:47:59.020
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to concentrate on this</v>

931
00:47:59.021 --> 00:48:01.660
<v Speaker 2>boring thing as hard as I can because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to master it.</v>

932
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe after passing an exam or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

933
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:07.720
<v Speaker 2>it's like good luck trying to get your</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious to cooperate because usually</v>

934
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:08.411
<v Speaker 2>it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

935
00:48:08.411 --> 00:48:10.990
<v Speaker 2>you'll be thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh God only knows what you'll be</v>

936
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:14.470
<v Speaker 2>thinking about doing the dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vacuuming up under the bed,</v>

937
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 2>like anything not to concentrate on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular boring piece of information.</v>

938
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:24.840
<v Speaker 2>So back to the back to the complex and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that ideas are embodied.</v>

939
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:30.280
<v Speaker 2>If an idea can't be embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to ask yourself if it has any</v>

940
00:48:30.281 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 2>utility because there's a trillion</v>
<v Speaker 2>facts,</v>

941
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could go,</v>

942
00:48:34.331 --> 00:48:35.980
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go on Google and write down</v>

943
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:39.910
<v Speaker 2>facts until you died and then you still</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have got anywhere near the</v>

944
00:48:39.911 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 2>whole number of facts there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might ask,</v>

945
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what good are Fox?</v>

946
00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:47.200
<v Speaker 2>If there's an infinite number of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the answered that is there actually</v>

947
00:48:47.201 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 2>not much good at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you have a purpose for them and</v>

948
00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:54.220
<v Speaker 2>if you have a purpose for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the fact becomes embodied because</v>

949
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:57.730
<v Speaker 2>you either use it to change your</v>
<v Speaker 2>perception or you use it to guide your</v>

950
00:48:57.731 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 2>actions and that's when it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>

951
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.630
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say in part that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex is the tendency of a group of</v>

952
00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:09.280
<v Speaker 2>associated ideas to manifest themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>in something approximating a</v>

953
00:49:09.281 --> 00:49:12.220
<v Speaker 2>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that also gives you a real key</v>

954
00:49:12.221 --> 00:49:15.400
<v Speaker 2>to what the psychoanalysts were up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>because as far as they're concerned,</v>

955
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.920
<v Speaker 2>you're just chalked full of complexes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

956
00:49:18.921 --> 00:49:19.391
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

957
00:49:19.391 --> 00:49:23.560
<v Speaker 2>you think about yourself is one thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is foolish because you know,</v>

958
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:27.190
<v Speaker 2>you're obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of like a loose collection</v>

959
00:49:27.191 --> 00:49:29.050
<v Speaker 2>of microorganisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

960
00:49:29.051 --> 00:49:31.750
<v Speaker 2>And there's a certain amount of unity</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he moved the same way.</v>

961
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:32.680
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

962
00:49:32.681 --> 00:49:37.600
<v Speaker 2>there's continuity of memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the representational space that you</v>

963
00:49:37.601 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 2>occupy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

964
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:41.150
<v Speaker 2>what you can do with your body and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine,</v>

965
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:43.000
<v Speaker 2>what you can think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very,</v>

966
00:49:43.001 --> 00:49:47.620
<v Speaker 2>very large and it's not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>coherent or consistent and it switches</v>

967
00:49:47.621 --> 00:49:49.850
<v Speaker 2>from moment to moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

968
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 2>so you'll know that some of you</v>
<v Speaker 2>undoubtedly have already experienced</v>

969
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 2>what it's like to be possessed by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly stupid idea.</v>

970
00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you've grown out of one or two</v>

971
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:03.580
<v Speaker 2>of the stupid ideas that possessed you</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you're possessed by an</v>

972
00:50:03.581 --> 00:50:06.700
<v Speaker 2>attraction to someone you can't control</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can't control your eating</v>

973
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:08.110
<v Speaker 2>behavior or you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

974
00:50:08.111 --> 00:50:10.860
<v Speaker 2>you're a pushover when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpersonal interactions because</v>

975
00:50:10.861 --> 00:50:14.560
<v Speaker 2>you're too agreeable or you fly off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>handle and fight and you know,</v>

976
00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:16.660
<v Speaker 2>none of this is really under your</v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

977
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:23.450
<v Speaker 2>And so all of those things that manifest</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves not only in your behaviors</v>

978
00:50:23.711 --> 00:50:27.070
<v Speaker 2>but in your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your perceptions of themselves,</v>

979
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to take on embodied form and</v>

980
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:31.880
<v Speaker 2>use you as the vehicle for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

981
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're thinking about something</v>

982
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:38.990
<v Speaker 2>like anger for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how it works because it's</v>

983
00:50:38.991 --> 00:50:43.991
<v Speaker 2>quite peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What must someone generally do?</v>

984
00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:49.590
<v Speaker 2>How much someone generally act if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be angry at them,</v>

985
00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:54.790
<v Speaker 2>they have to be irritating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

986
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:57.410
<v Speaker 2>You know they have to provoke you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some way.</v>

987
00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mere fact that you perceive what</v>

988
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:01.490
<v Speaker 2>they're doing is irritating or</v>
<v Speaker 2>provoking,</v>

989
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:05.310
<v Speaker 2>doesn't ensure that anyone else would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have thought about it as irritating,</v>

990
00:51:05.311 --> 00:51:09.680
<v Speaker 2>are provoking or that that's what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant or that that's what's happening.</v>

991
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.910
<v Speaker 2>And my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point is it's very important to think</v>

992
00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:17.390
<v Speaker 2>about these complexes of ideas as</v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonalities because otherwise you</v>

993
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 2>really don't get what they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're angry,</v>

994
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:23.300
<v Speaker 2>if you have a proclivity towards anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's an unthinking</v>

995
00:51:23.301 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 2>proclivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that someone says might</v>

996
00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:30.650
<v Speaker 2>irritate you and it isn't like they say</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and you think about it and</v>

997
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:34.070
<v Speaker 2>then you get irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you perceive the person as</v>

998
00:51:34.071 --> 00:51:35.480
<v Speaker 2>irritating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

999
00:51:35.481 --> 00:51:38.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just the way they hold their</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth or something,</v>

1000
00:51:38.031 --> 00:51:38.520
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1001
00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.100
<v Speaker 2>It can be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very subtle.</v>

1002
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:41.241
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1003
00:51:41.241 --> 00:51:41.750
<v Speaker 2>it's not me.</v>

1004
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:44.510
<v Speaker 2>It's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I'm irritated by you,</v>

1005
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.620
<v Speaker 2>it's the you're irritating and that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that's a very difficult thing to</v>

1006
00:51:48.621 --> 00:51:52.640
<v Speaker 2>settle because the reality is somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the subjective and the</v>

1007
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:53.580
<v Speaker 2>objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1008
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:57.140
<v Speaker 2>A lot of arguments that you'll have with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people throughout your life are about</v>

1009
00:51:57.141 --> 00:51:59.000
<v Speaker 2>exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I,</v>

1010
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 2>are you irritating or am I over</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitive?</v>

1011
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.731
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1012
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:03.230
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to hash that out for a good</v>

1013
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:06.160
<v Speaker 2>long time before we figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is is that if you're</v>

1014
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Speaker 2>possessed by an emotional state or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational state or an idea or some</v>

1015
00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:13.490
<v Speaker 2>kind of complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see the world through its eyes</v>

1016
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:18.940
<v Speaker 2>and then the facts reveal themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you through the lens of that particular</v>

1017
00:52:18.951 --> 00:52:22.490
<v Speaker 2>set of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very frightening idea because</v>

1018
00:52:22.491 --> 00:52:24.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like to think of ourselves as masters</v>

1019
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:26.540
<v Speaker 2>of our own house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is completely clueless because</v>

1020
00:52:26.541 --> 00:52:30.620
<v Speaker 2>it's obvious if you watch yourself for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a month that you hardly ever do</v>

1021
00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.890
<v Speaker 2>what you tell yourself to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're liable to do all sorts of</v>

1022
00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 2>other things that you don't even want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1023
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:36.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you say,</v>

1024
00:52:36.921 --> 00:52:38.450
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to the gym three times a</v>

1025
00:52:38.451 --> 00:52:41.330
<v Speaker 2>week and I'm not going to drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:44.210
<v Speaker 2>and maybe there's this person I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to associate with and then you</v>

1027
00:52:44.211 --> 00:52:46.970
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't go to the gym and you find</v>

1028
00:52:46.971 --> 00:52:49.160
<v Speaker 2>that person and you go out and drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them and you think,</v>

1029
00:52:49.161 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1030
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.691
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1031
00:52:51.691 --> 00:52:52.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you,</v>

1032
00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:55.310
<v Speaker 2>you're not the sort of person that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what you say.</v>

1033
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.520
<v Speaker 2>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sort of person are you?</v>

1034
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a psychoanalytic question and</v>

1035
00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a deep one because you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>peculiar thing and there's parts of you</v>

1036
00:53:05.361 --> 00:53:06.260
<v Speaker 2>that are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1037
00:53:06.261 --> 00:53:09.590
<v Speaker 2>really old and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of naive view,</v>

1038
00:53:09.591 --> 00:53:13.670
<v Speaker 2>the naive young you that you think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself as is like a little piece of</v>

1039
00:53:13.671 --> 00:53:16.520
<v Speaker 2>flotsam in an ocean of complexity.</v>

1040
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:21.720
<v Speaker 2>And the ocean of complexity is you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of diving down into the depths</v>

1041
00:53:21.721 --> 00:53:25.000
<v Speaker 2>is to start to understand what it means</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be human and all right,</v>

1042
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:28.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the one thing you can say about it</v>

1043
00:53:28.351 --> 00:53:33.351
<v Speaker 2>for sure is that it's bloody peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here are some associations have ideas</v>

1044
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:36.450
<v Speaker 2>that go along with these symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 2>representations that I was describing.</v>

1045
00:53:36.451 --> 00:53:40.710
<v Speaker 2>So the feminine is off the nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's some associations.</v>

1046
00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:44.910
<v Speaker 2>They're not necessary associations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are common associations,</v>

1047
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.900
<v Speaker 2>so if you see these sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would make a narrative sense.</v>

1048
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see an old and somewhat evil</v>

1049
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:56.430
<v Speaker 2>woman in an animated movie and she lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the swamp,</v>

1050
00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:58.440
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1051
00:53:58.441 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 2>why does it make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1052
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I can't explain that at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1053
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly because of the swamp is</v>

1054
00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:10.850
<v Speaker 2>outside of the standard boat borders of</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization and it's also a place of</v>

1055
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.710
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decay and rebirth.</v>

1056
00:54:13.711 --> 00:54:15.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

1057
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Some associations nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the is the unconscious.</v>

1058
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Why is the unconscious nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1059
00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:24.420
<v Speaker 2>because you can't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just manifests itself within you.</v>

1060
00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the Friday and the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like dreams.</v>

1061
00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.850
<v Speaker 2>They happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what they mean.</v>

1062
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:33.240
<v Speaker 2>They just happen and so that's nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>operating inside of you.</v>

1063
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:35.880
<v Speaker 2>The terrors of the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1064
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember when you were a little kid,</v>

1065
00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:41.400
<v Speaker 2>you're three and you're afraid of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark because kids at three are afraid of</v>

1066
00:54:41.401 --> 00:54:43.170
<v Speaker 2>the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's in the dark?</v>

1067
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.840
<v Speaker 2>What are you looking for in your closet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monsters,</v>

1068
00:54:49.841 --> 00:54:52.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are the monsters?</v>

1069
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not in your closet.</v>

1070
00:54:55.921 --> 00:54:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not to say that there</v>

1071
00:54:59.101 --> 00:55:02.850
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be a monster in your closet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also not to say that when you look</v>

1072
00:55:02.851 --> 00:55:04.620
<v Speaker 2>at your closet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're a little kid that you're</v>

1073
00:55:04.621 --> 00:55:09.150
<v Speaker 2>looking at your closet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're looking at the darkness and</v>

1074
00:55:09.151 --> 00:55:11.790
<v Speaker 2>then the question of whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are monsters in the darkness gets</v>

1075
00:55:11.791 --> 00:55:16.170
<v Speaker 2>a lot more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a client once who was agoraphobic</v>

1076
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 2>and she didn't like to take elevators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite a common phenomena for</v>

1077
00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:23.040
<v Speaker 2>people who are agoraphobic and so I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing standard exposure which is</v>

1078
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:27.780
<v Speaker 2>voluntary exposure to the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a prime curative process in</v>

1079
00:55:27.781 --> 00:55:30.900
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like find out what you're afraid</v>

1080
00:55:30.901 --> 00:55:32.550
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interfering with your movement</v>

1081
00:55:32.551 --> 00:55:36.180
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Break it into small pieces and expose</v>

1082
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:37.740
<v Speaker 2>yourself to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That works.</v>

1083
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:41.520
<v Speaker 2>So we go to the elevator and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

1084
00:55:41.521 --> 00:55:44.040
<v Speaker 2>well how close can you get to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>elevator without being nervous?</v>

1085
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.630
<v Speaker 2>So she stands like 10 feet away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1086
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:48.210
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well stand there until your board and</v>

1087
00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:51.740
<v Speaker 2>then go three steps forward so she could</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that and you know,</v>

1088
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.250
<v Speaker 2>made her a little nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I said,</v>

1089
00:55:53.251 --> 00:55:55.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll stand there until your board and</v>

1090
00:55:55.891 --> 00:55:59.490
<v Speaker 2>make sure you're looking at the elevator</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not avoiding it and then take</v>

1091
00:55:59.491 --> 00:56:02.960
<v Speaker 2>another three steps forward and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we keep doing that until she's like at</v>

1092
00:56:02.961 --> 00:56:05.220
<v Speaker 2>the elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I say,</v>

1093
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:08.700
<v Speaker 2>well here's the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to let the elevator</v>

1094
00:56:08.701 --> 00:56:11.330
<v Speaker 2>doors open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to get on.</v>

1095
00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:13.700
<v Speaker 2>We'll let them close and then that's it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1096
00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:15.660
<v Speaker 2>for today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1097
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.630
<v Speaker 2>And I always tell people when I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing that I'm not going to</v>

1098
00:56:18.631 --> 00:56:19.351
<v Speaker 2>trick them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:56:19.351 --> 00:56:21.210
<v Speaker 2>there's no tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't have to do anything</v>

1100
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:23.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to do and I'm not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play any games on you.</v>

1101
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.170
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the door's open and she goes,</v>

1102
00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:28.930
<v Speaker 2>that's a tube and then it closes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>

1103
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that an elevator or a tube?</v>

1104
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:35.740
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well obviously it's an elevator.</v>

1105
00:56:35.741 --> 00:56:39.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like things are not so obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1106
00:56:39.851 --> 00:56:43.900
<v Speaker 2>because there are many ways of</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceiving something and a given entity</v>

1107
00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:47.200
<v Speaker 2>can be a member of multiple categories</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time and you say,</v>

1108
00:56:47.201 --> 00:56:48.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

1109
00:56:48.131 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 2>the elevator's not a tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an enclosed dark place that</v>

1110
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:56.740
<v Speaker 2>contains the unknown and when you see an</v>
<v Speaker 2>elevator you just see like a conveyance</v>

1111
00:56:56.741 --> 00:56:58.930
<v Speaker 2>that moves you up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't what she saw.</v>

1112
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:02.200
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what she saw is wrong.</v>

1113
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:04.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like not exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not functional,</v>

1114
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:06.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decide if you want to take an elevator</v>

1115
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:11.380
<v Speaker 2>then perceiving it as your tomb is</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably inappropriate,</v>

1116
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:16.200
<v Speaker 2>but the point is is that it has a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>associations like it's.</v>

1117
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:21.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a place of constriction and</v>
<v Speaker 2>privation and isolation and separation.</v>

1118
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:26.640
<v Speaker 2>And so it has elements of their elements</v>
<v Speaker 2>of its being that overlap with other</v>

1119
00:57:27.221 --> 00:57:30.940
<v Speaker 2>things that are frightening and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>agoraphobic are often afraid to have.</v>

1120
00:57:30.941 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Being in a subway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a crowded in the subway,</v>

1121
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.560
<v Speaker 2>it's partly because they can't get out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make it to the hospital.</v>

1122
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:39.870
<v Speaker 2>So when closed places are crowded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>places are places where they encountered</v>

1123
00:57:39.871 --> 00:57:42.850
<v Speaker 2>their mortality because they get afraid</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to die and then they can't</v>

1124
00:57:42.851 --> 00:57:45.840
<v Speaker 2>get to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1125
00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.340
<v Speaker 2>they come into a room like this and sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the middle and they,</v>

1126
00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:49.181
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

1127
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd of students,</v>

1128
00:57:50.141 --> 00:57:50.860
<v Speaker 2>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1129
00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.110
<v Speaker 2>place of death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1130
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.891
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

1131
00:57:53.891 --> 00:57:55.600
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a crowd of students.</v>

1132
00:57:55.601 --> 00:57:56.590
<v Speaker 2>And I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1133
00:57:56.591 --> 00:57:58.390
<v Speaker 2>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come you're so damn sure.</v>

1134
00:57:58.391 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not a place of death.</v>

1135
00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Like generally it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but any of you could drop dead of a</v>

1136
00:58:02.471 --> 00:58:06.550
<v Speaker 2>heart attack in the next five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why aren't you terrified out of your</v>

1137
00:58:06.551 --> 00:58:07.750
<v Speaker 2>skulls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of that?</v>

1138
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:12.870
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the answer because as far as I've</v>

1139
00:58:13.871 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 2>been able to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the things agoraphobic or afraid</v>

1140
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:21.490
<v Speaker 2>of like that they might die at any</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment actually happens to be true.</v>

1141
00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:23.560
<v Speaker 2>And so the fact that they're afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1142
00:58:23.561 --> 00:58:24.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1143
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:26.770
<v Speaker 2>no kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're afraid of that.</v>

1144
00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:30.730
<v Speaker 2>How are other people not afraid of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>while that?</v>

1145
00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:34.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's nature.</v>

1146
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.880
<v Speaker 2>That's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you another reason.</v>

1147
00:58:36.881 --> 00:58:41.630
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the feminine is nature.</v>

1148
00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you guys think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1149
00:58:43.131 --> 00:58:46.640
<v Speaker 2>but I was pretty happy when I thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>this up and it took me a long time.</v>

1150
00:58:46.641 --> 00:58:51.641
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about the world in</v>

1151
00:58:52.311 --> 00:58:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Darwinian terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1152
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:57.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a struggle for survival and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduction,</v>

1153
00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.560
<v Speaker 2>which are basically the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Survival is you,</v>

1154
00:59:00.561 --> 00:59:02.840
<v Speaker 2>but reproduction is the survival of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes.</v>

1155
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:05.240
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a survival issue over very long</v>

1156
00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:06.800
<v Speaker 2>spans of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1157
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:11.140
<v Speaker 2>What do we call the selection mechanism,</v>

1158
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Natural selection,</v>

1159
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:15.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nature.</v>

1160
00:59:15.541 --> 00:59:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Who does the selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1161
00:59:17.671 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 2>So let me tell you something that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>female humans different than female</v>

1162
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:23.840
<v Speaker 2>chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1163
00:59:23.841 --> 00:59:25.570
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of things that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1164
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:28.310
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here,</v>

1165
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:33.310
<v Speaker 2>here's an important one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at which male and a female</v>

1166
00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:37.160
<v Speaker 2>in a chimp troop fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the offspring,</v>

1167
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:41.060
<v Speaker 2>it's the dominant male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reason for that isn't because</v>

1168
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:43.970
<v Speaker 2>the female chimps sort of flock around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dominant male.</v>

1169
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Now that happens in other species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't happen with chimps.</v>

1170
00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:51.920
<v Speaker 2>What happens is the dominant male chases</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the subordinate males away and will</v>

1171
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:54.530
<v Speaker 2>interfere with any sexual behavior they</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest.</v>

1172
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:57.800
<v Speaker 2>They'll chase them away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The females though are perfectly happy</v>

1173
00:59:57.801 --> 01:00:00.800
<v Speaker 2>to meet with a subordinate male if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in heat and they get the</v>

1174
01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they go into heat,</v>

1175
01:00:02.631 --> 01:00:05.000
<v Speaker 2>which is something that doesn't happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>with female humans.</v>

1176
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 2>And they really don't care who they meet</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

1177
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Female humans are much different than</v>

1178
01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're picky.</v>

1179
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.120
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are really,</v>

1180
01:00:14.121 --> 01:00:15.800
<v Speaker 2>they're choosy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal.</v>

1181
01:00:15.801 --> 01:00:19.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal that they're choosing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this famous psychology</v>

1182
01:00:19.071 --> 01:00:22.910
<v Speaker 2>experiments you've probably heard about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were undergraduate mail goes out</v>

1183
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:25.460
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asks random women if they'll go home and</v>

1184
01:00:25.461 --> 01:00:27.530
<v Speaker 2>sleep with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have sex with him,</v>

1185
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.730
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they,</v>

1186
01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.330
<v Speaker 2>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean generally they say get away from</v>

1187
01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:33.680
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creep or something like that.</v>

1188
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they certainly indicate no,</v>

1189
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:40.460
<v Speaker 2>but then they do the reverse experiment</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they have a female undergraduate</v>

1190
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:41.294
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1191
01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 2>proposition essentially males and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1192
01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.410
<v Speaker 2>what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1193
01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.590
<v Speaker 2>the males say yes much more often than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the females to.</v>

1194
01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that doesn't come as a surprise</v>

1195
01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 2>to any of you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason for that,</v>

1196
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:57.523
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

1197
01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:01.010
<v Speaker 2>But part of the reason is that sex is</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more dangerous proposition for</v>

1198
01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:04.490
<v Speaker 2>women than it is for men because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to bear the consequences.</v>

1199
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Literally if something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the logically appropriate thing</v>

1200
01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:11.060
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is they get pregnant.</v>

1201
01:01:11.061 --> 01:01:14.390
<v Speaker 2>So at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women recognize that and you know,</v>

1202
01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:17.300
<v Speaker 2>they're a bit more cautious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although there's more to it too because</v>

1203
01:01:17.301 --> 01:01:20.690
<v Speaker 2>women also seem to evaluate men for</v>
<v Speaker 2>their fitness.</v>

1204
01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So lots of men have no sexual partners</v>

1205
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:29.030
<v Speaker 2>and they have no children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the case with women.</v>

1206
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Almost all women have one child or more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a rare woman indeed who cannot</v>

1207
01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.230
<v Speaker 2>find a sexual partner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1208
01:01:36.231 --> 01:01:38.720
<v Speaker 2>Roy balmeister indicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to have to think this</v>

1209
01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 2>through because it doesn't make sense on</v>
<v Speaker 2>first encounter.</v>

1210
01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:45.110
<v Speaker 2>You have twice as many female ancestors</v>
<v Speaker 2>as male ancestors,</v>

1211
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.520
<v Speaker 2>so what that essentially means is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the success rate,</v>

1212
01:01:49.521 --> 01:01:53.270
<v Speaker 2>the average success rate for propagation</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the typical woman is very high,</v>

1213
01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:58.220
<v Speaker 2>and the average success rate for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>typical man is very low,</v>

1214
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.850
<v Speaker 2>but some men are hyper procreative.</v>

1215
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So men are subject to selection pressure</v>

1216
01:02:05.571 --> 01:02:07.180
<v Speaker 2>and many of them fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a,</v>

1217
01:02:07.181 --> 01:02:11.320
<v Speaker 2>here's an interesting statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this came from Dataclysm,</v>

1218
01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>which is a book that was recently</v>
<v Speaker 2>written about one of those online dating</v>

1219
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:16.630
<v Speaker 2>sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1220
01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 2>the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't remember its name,</v>

1221
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>but he was looking at things like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>the typical woman on the dating site</v>

1222
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:28.830
<v Speaker 2>rates the typical man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty funny because women are men</v>

1223
01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:31.320
<v Speaker 2>actually rate women on a normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution.</v>

1224
01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.640
<v Speaker 2>So the typical woman's scores at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>50th percentile and half of them are</v>

1225
01:02:35.641 --> 01:02:37.500
<v Speaker 2>above average and half of them are</v>
<v Speaker 2>below.</v>

1226
01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:40.710
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the equivalent is for</v>
<v Speaker 2>women rating men?</v>

1227
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.350
<v Speaker 2>And everyone laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the women.</v>

1228
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:46.610
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 85,</v>

1229
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:50.250
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>85 percent of men are below average.</v>

1230
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's annoying.</v>

1231
01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you happen to be one of the 15</v>

1232
01:02:56.341 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 2>percent who isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
01:02:57.991 --> 01:03:00.750
<v Speaker 2>and those are the 15 percent of the guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are having all these sexual</v>

1234
01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:03.660
<v Speaker 2>encounters in a relatively sexually</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberated environment to,</v>

1235
01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.460
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why am I telling you all this?</v>

1236
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Women select men that makes them nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nature is what select.</v>

1237
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:16.700
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

1238
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:18.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only symbolic that women are</v>

1239
01:03:18.681 --> 01:03:19.461
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1240
01:03:19.461 --> 01:03:20.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just symbolic.</v>

1241
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:23.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not just symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1242
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:28.870
<v Speaker 2>when the woman in some senses the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gatekeeper to rep is not in some sense</v>

1243
01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:32.970
<v Speaker 2>is the gatekeeper to reproductive</v>
<v Speaker 2>success and you can't get more like</v>

1244
01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:34.650
<v Speaker 2>nature than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1245
01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 2>it's the very definition of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as I said,</v>

1246
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:42.750
<v Speaker 2>there are lots of reasons why these</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolic representations are setup the</v>

1247
01:03:42.751 --> 01:03:44.340
<v Speaker 2>way they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

1248
01:03:44.341 --> 01:03:47.970
<v Speaker 2>So that's the great mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Queen,</v>

1249
01:03:47.971 --> 01:03:50.310
<v Speaker 2>the Matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Matrix is something from which all</v>

1250
01:03:50.311 --> 01:03:53.370
<v Speaker 2>things form same root word as matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>

1251
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:55.410
<v Speaker 2>all the same root word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the matriarch,</v>

1252
01:03:55.411 --> 01:03:56.910
<v Speaker 2>the container,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cornucopia,</v>

1253
01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:59.790
<v Speaker 2>the object to be fertilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the source of all things,</v>

1254
01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:01.020
<v Speaker 2>the on the pregnant,</v>

1255
01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.500
<v Speaker 2>there are more parts of the association</v>
<v Speaker 2>network,</v>

1256
01:04:06.501 --> 01:04:08.300
<v Speaker 2>the strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emotional,</v>

1257
01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:11.000
<v Speaker 2>the foreigner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place of returning and rest,</v>

1258
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:12.320
<v Speaker 2>the deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the valley,</v>

1259
01:04:12.321 --> 01:04:15.770
<v Speaker 2>the Clef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cave hell death and the grave,</v>

1260
01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.360
<v Speaker 2>the moon ruler of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mysterious dark and matter in</v>

1261
01:04:20.361 --> 01:04:23.840
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those aren't necessarily associated</v>

1262
01:04:23.841 --> 01:04:26.990
<v Speaker 2>with femininity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're typically associated with</v>

1263
01:04:26.991 --> 01:04:29.810
<v Speaker 2>femininity from a symbolic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1264
01:04:29.811 --> 01:04:33.170
<v Speaker 2>so like generally like a witch and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie doesn't come riding out of the</v>

1265
01:04:33.171 --> 01:04:35.030
<v Speaker 2>full bright sun at noon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1266
01:04:35.031 --> 01:04:37.160
<v Speaker 2>That just doesn't happen because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make sense.</v>

1267
01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:41.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a dark thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you saw that occurring in the</v>

1268
01:04:41.091 --> 01:04:42.320
<v Speaker 2>light and a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd think,</v>

1269
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is going on here?</v>

1270
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:48.920
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason it doesn't make sense</v>

1271
01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.790
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it violates the,</v>

1272
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:53.580
<v Speaker 2>it violates the complex and the symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex.</v>

1273
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:58.570
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is there sort of.</v>

1274
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Those are sort of female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are female denizens of the</v>

1275
01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:03.880
<v Speaker 2>underworld and hell very pleasant</v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures.</v>

1276
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like Medusa with the head of</v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes,</v>

1277
01:05:05.981 --> 01:05:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you might,</v>

1278
01:05:07.151 --> 01:05:12.151
<v Speaker 2>if you ask why would a woman have a head</v>
<v Speaker 2>of snakes in reference to a man?</v>

1279
01:05:12.291 --> 01:05:14.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet there are men here who knew the</v>

1280
01:05:14.771 --> 01:05:15.604
<v Speaker 2>answer to that.</v>

1281
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Come on Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

1282
01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.860
<v Speaker 2>What emotion do you feel when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to approach someone you're very</v>

1283
01:05:25.861 --> 01:05:30.180
<v Speaker 2>attracted to and there's an extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>high probability that she's going to</v>

1284
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:33.900
<v Speaker 2>tell you to disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1285
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1286
01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a real judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1287
01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.920
<v Speaker 2>We're going to see a movie called crumb</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you'll see this in great detail,</v>

1288
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's a real judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the best judgment is,</v>

1289
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:45.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind your physical presence,</v>

1290
01:05:45.721 --> 01:05:49.650
<v Speaker 2>but your genes should definitely not</v>
<v Speaker 2>survive another generation.</v>

1291
01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:52.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's sort of generally translated</v>

1292
01:05:52.531 --> 01:05:54.750
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should just be friends,</v>

1293
01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you can blow that off and</v>

1294
01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:02.130
<v Speaker 2>people do and you have to because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of being polite and civilized,</v>

1295
01:06:02.131 --> 01:06:04.710
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's make no mistake about it.</v>

1296
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:08.340
<v Speaker 2>There is no more fundamental judgment</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that,</v>

1297
01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:12.330
<v Speaker 2>so paralysis and there's no shortage of</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1298
01:06:12.331 --> 01:06:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are absolutely terrified of women.</v>

1299
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:16.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had many of them in my practice.</v>

1300
01:06:16.981 --> 01:06:18.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one guy,</v>

1301
01:06:18.361 --> 01:06:20.670
<v Speaker 2>he was so terrified of women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't even talk to them on the</v>

1302
01:06:20.671 --> 01:06:24.420
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more common than you think so,</v>

1303
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's generally manifested by men who</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

1304
01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.460
<v Speaker 2>who no one cares about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's generally irrelevant.</v>

1305
01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.860
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1306
01:06:31.861 --> 01:06:34.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the guts of the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is the case.</v>

1307
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're low status man.</v>

1308
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people that are generally</v>

1309
01:06:38.611 --> 01:06:43.080
<v Speaker 2>regarded as losers and there isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who really gives a damn about</v>

1310
01:06:43.081 --> 01:06:45.690
<v Speaker 2>what happens to them one way or another</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot more men in that</v>

1311
01:06:45.691 --> 01:06:46.890
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there are women.</v>

1312
01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Women are in all sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1313
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:51.810
<v Speaker 2>social categories that caused the misery</v>
<v Speaker 2>in distress.</v>

1314
01:06:51.811 --> 01:06:54.930
<v Speaker 2>But that one seems to be predominantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>male.</v>

1315
01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.050
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I'm going to do when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about Freud is I'm going to show</v>

1316
01:06:58.051 --> 01:07:00.290
<v Speaker 2>you this movie crumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just told you about and hitch.</v>

1317
01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:03.180
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very rare thing because it shows</v>

1318
01:07:03.181 --> 01:07:07.920
<v Speaker 2>you the world from the perspective of</v>
<v Speaker 2>very intelligent mail losers and that's</v>

1319
01:07:07.921 --> 01:07:11.550
<v Speaker 2>just not a perspective you ever see</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's the winners that tell the</v>

1320
01:07:11.551 --> 01:07:13.260
<v Speaker 2>stories about their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1321
01:07:13.261 --> 01:07:15.000
<v Speaker 2>who the hell cares about the life of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>loser?</v>

1322
01:07:15.001 --> 01:07:19.140
<v Speaker 2>But this movie is about a loser who</v>
<v Speaker 2>became a winner and you know,</v>

1323
01:07:19.141 --> 01:07:23.610
<v Speaker 2>almost as an act of revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's great.</v>

1324
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:24.541
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

1325
01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:27.060
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thai examination of the eatable complex.</v>

1326
01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1327
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:35.500
<v Speaker 2>those are Hindu representations of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelly.</v>

1328
01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you a little bit about Kelly</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the middle.</v>

1329
01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Representational use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1330
01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:43.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has eight legs,</v>

1331
01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 2>spider spiders spin a web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The web is fate,</v>

1332
01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.470
<v Speaker 2>the web of fate traps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The unwary nature does that.</v>

1333
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:57.010
<v Speaker 2>She's in a web of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1334
01:07:57.011 --> 01:08:01.270
<v Speaker 2>a little fire arch there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is Amanda Carrillo.</v>

1335
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:04.300
<v Speaker 2>You can look that up if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is also made out of skulls.</v>

1336
01:08:04.301 --> 01:08:08.260
<v Speaker 2>That's what's on the inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's skulls on fire,</v>

1337
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.080
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1338
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.700
<v Speaker 2>her hair is on fire and she has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>headdress of skulls.</v>

1339
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy she's standing on,</v>

1340
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:20.090
<v Speaker 2>she just gave birth to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why her belly is hollow and</v>

1341
01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:23.600
<v Speaker 2>she's eating his intestines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1342
01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a daddy.</v>

1343
01:08:25.031 --> 01:08:25.581
<v Speaker 2>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1344
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:27.290
<v Speaker 2>why would something like that be a day</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1345
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:32.291
<v Speaker 2>And it's something like a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the sum total of all fears and you</v>

1346
01:08:32.381 --> 01:08:33.011
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>

1347
01:08:33.011 --> 01:08:34.420
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't believe in that sort of thing.</v>

1348
01:08:34.421 --> 01:08:34.931
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1349
01:08:34.931 --> 01:08:36.190
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just don't know.</v>

1350
01:08:36.191 --> 01:08:38.050
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you do.</v>

1351
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:41.350
<v Speaker 2>You can't not believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1352
01:08:41.351 --> 01:08:45.880
<v Speaker 2>you're the manner in which you allow it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be represented and what you do with</v>

1353
01:08:45.881 --> 01:08:48.190
<v Speaker 2>those representations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole different matter.</v>

1354
01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:50.830
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not watching vampire movies for</v>

1355
01:08:50.831 --> 01:08:52.540
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1356
01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:53.171
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1357
01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:54.730
<v Speaker 2>you don't believe in vampires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1358
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>that's actually not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe in them enough to go watch</v>

1359
01:09:00.271 --> 01:09:02.770
<v Speaker 2>them on movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like w,</v>

1360
01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.620
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you going to define belief?</v>

1361
01:09:04.621 --> 01:09:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone comes up to you and says,</v>

1362
01:09:06.571 --> 01:09:08.490
<v Speaker 2>do you believe in vampires?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1363
01:09:08.491 --> 01:09:09.720
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no.</v>

1364
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:11.520
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1365
01:09:11.521 --> 01:09:14.520
<v Speaker 2>would you spend like two hours this</v>
<v Speaker 2>month watching them?</v>

1366
01:09:14.610 --> 01:09:16.980
<v Speaker 2>And the answer would be yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might think,</v>

1367
01:09:16.981 --> 01:09:18.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the better indicator of what</v>

1368
01:09:18.601 --> 01:09:21.060
<v Speaker 2>you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you know about what you're</v>

1369
01:09:21.061 --> 01:09:23.040
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares about your statements about</v>

1370
01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:24.630
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1371
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.940
<v Speaker 2>you think you have privileged access to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're like.</v>

1372
01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:29.310
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've only been around for 18 years.</v>

1373
01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:34.380
<v Speaker 2>You know when you inhabit this body</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been built up over 400 million</v>

1374
01:09:34.381 --> 01:09:36.600
<v Speaker 2>years of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1375
01:09:36.601 --> 01:09:39.090
<v Speaker 2>It might be longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is longer.</v>

1376
01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:43.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's when crustaceans emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life itself is much older than that.</v>

1377
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:46.620
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who made this representation</v>

1378
01:09:46.621 --> 01:09:48.630
<v Speaker 2>of Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming they made it,</v>

1379
01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:52.260
<v Speaker 2>which they really didn't cause it</v>
<v Speaker 2>manifested itself in their imagination,</v>

1380
01:09:52.261 --> 01:09:55.710
<v Speaker 2>which is a completely different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to come to terms with</v>

1381
01:09:55.711 --> 01:09:58.980
<v Speaker 2>something pretty awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you might say they're trying to come</v>

1382
01:09:58.981 --> 01:10:02.520
<v Speaker 2>to terms with the category of all awful</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1383
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Or You could even be more sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

1384
01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:09.300
<v Speaker 2>And you could say they're trying to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>to terms with the category of all awful</v>

1385
01:10:09.301 --> 01:10:14.301
<v Speaker 2>things that also reveals new life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a terribly paradoxical thing</v>

1386
01:10:14.641 --> 01:10:17.220
<v Speaker 2>because Kelly can be transformed into</v>
<v Speaker 2>something positive.</v>

1387
01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:18.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1388
01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:21.120
<v Speaker 2>logical people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1389
01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:24.870
<v Speaker 2>something can either be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be a and not a at the same time.</v>

1390
01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fundamental logical</v>

1391
01:10:27.751 --> 01:10:29.640
<v Speaker 2>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

1392
01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.790
<v Speaker 2>so let's say you have a boyfriend or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend,</v>

1393
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:34.950
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't hate them and love them at the</v>

1394
01:10:34.951 --> 01:10:38.310
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean half your life or three quarters</v>

1395
01:10:38.311 --> 01:10:40.110
<v Speaker 2>of your life will be in that state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1396
01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.430
<v Speaker 2>families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1397
01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:45.880
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty slash 50 love and hate.</v>

1398
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:50.080
<v Speaker 2>What defines a familiar relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be intensity rather than,</v>

1399
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's love or hate,</v>

1400
01:10:51.941 --> 01:10:54.520
<v Speaker 2>it's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can certainly have a</v>

1401
01:10:54.521 --> 01:10:57.730
<v Speaker 2>completely paradoxical relationship to</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself or to another person.</v>

1402
01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.350
<v Speaker 2>And so part of what happens with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolic representations is that there</v>

1403
01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:09.210
<v Speaker 2>they're more accurate than mere logic</v>
<v Speaker 2>because life is one of those life is</v>

1404
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:16.290
<v Speaker 2>composed of oppositions in conjunction</v>
<v Speaker 2>and oppositions in conjunction</v>

1405
01:11:17.281 --> 01:11:19.950
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's very little about it.</v>

1406
01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:22.050
<v Speaker 2>It's logical at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't matter because you</v>

1407
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:24.390
<v Speaker 2>still have to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to deal with at a very</v>

1408
01:11:24.391 --> 01:11:26.460
<v Speaker 2>fundamental level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1409
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.210
<v Speaker 2>you could think of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that representation there as</v>

1410
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:36.740
<v Speaker 2>walk through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1411
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.320
<v Speaker 2>let's take about things you should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of.</v>

1412
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1413
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:48.720
<v Speaker 2>an animal wouldn't really have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>category of things to be afraid of.</v>

1414
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.870
<v Speaker 2>What an animal would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his specific things they're afraid of.</v>

1415
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then the animal would have to</v>

1416
01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:58.590
<v Speaker 2>learn what do you do in the face of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>those specific things that you're afraid</v>

1417
01:11:58.591 --> 01:11:59.880
<v Speaker 2>of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1418
01:11:59.881 --> 01:12:01.020
<v Speaker 2>maybe you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know you,</v>

1419
01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.770
<v Speaker 2>you climb a tree if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a monkey on it to Jaguar maybe</v>

1420
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:08.340
<v Speaker 2>and you go under the underbrush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a monkey on it's a predatory</v>

1421
01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.450
<v Speaker 2>hawk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1422
01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 2>You've got these individual escape</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms that are tied to the specific</v>

1423
01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:15.150
<v Speaker 2>stimulus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's human beings who are</v>

1424
01:12:15.151 --> 01:12:17.760
<v Speaker 2>capable of abstraction and so you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1425
01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a class of things to be afraid</v>

1426
01:12:21.061 --> 01:12:23.340
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's those things that you should be</v>

1427
01:12:23.341 --> 01:12:23.760
<v Speaker 2>afraid of.</v>

1428
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Those are the things that go bump in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

1429
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always exposed to them when you</v>

1430
01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:30.270
<v Speaker 2>go to horror movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're not the Gore type</v>

1431
01:12:30.271 --> 01:12:32.700
<v Speaker 2>of horror movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always hinting at something</v>

1432
01:12:32.701 --> 01:12:37.560
<v Speaker 2>going on outside of your perceptual</v>
<v Speaker 2>sphere and they frighten you because you</v>

1433
01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:41.100
<v Speaker 2>don't know what's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the Blair witch project was a</v>

1434
01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:43.680
<v Speaker 2>really good example of that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing ever happens in that movie,</v>

1435
01:12:43.681 --> 01:12:44.341
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1436
01:12:44.341 --> 01:12:44.890
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1437
01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:46.780
<v Speaker 2>it's frightening and not gory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1438
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of an interesting horror</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

1439
01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:53.690
<v Speaker 2>It plays upon the fact that you do have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a category of those things to which you</v>

1440
01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:58.650
<v Speaker 2>should be those things about which you</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be afraid.</v>

1441
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:03.660
<v Speaker 2>So it's a category frightening things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then and only something capable of</v>

1442
01:13:03.661 --> 01:13:07.020
<v Speaker 2>abstraction could come up with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>category of frightening things.</v>

1443
01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:11.100
<v Speaker 2>And so Kelly is like an embodied</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the category of</v>

1444
01:13:11.101 --> 01:13:12.090
<v Speaker 2>frightening things.</v>

1445
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:15.030
<v Speaker 2>And then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1446
01:13:15.031 --> 01:13:19.020
<v Speaker 2>once you come up with the concept of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>category of frightening things,</v>

1447
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could come up with the concept</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what to do in the face of frightening</v>

1448
01:13:23.101 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not the same as what do you do</v>

1449
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:29.490
<v Speaker 2>when you encounter a lion or what do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do when you encounter someone angry?</v>

1450
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a medical question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1451
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:35.670
<v Speaker 2>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may encounter a frightening thing.</v>

1452
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.370
<v Speaker 2>What's the thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you should do,</v>

1453
01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.140
<v Speaker 2>what should you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you could say,</v>

1454
01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:44.310
<v Speaker 2>at a philosophical level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will encounter elements of the</v>

1455
01:13:44.311 --> 01:13:48.570
<v Speaker 2>category of all those things that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>frighten and undermine you during your</v>

1456
01:13:48.571 --> 01:13:51.660
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there something that you can do as a</v>

1457
01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:55.890
<v Speaker 2>category that would help you deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1458
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is yeah,</v>

1459
01:13:57.901 --> 01:14:00.720
<v Speaker 2>there there are in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a lot of what religious</v>

1460
01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:05.160
<v Speaker 2>stories and symbolic stories are trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to propose to you is the solution to</v>

1461
01:14:05.161 --> 01:14:06.060
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is</v>

1462
01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:10.290
<v Speaker 2>approach it voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>

1463
01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.360
<v Speaker 2>but voluntarily don't freeze and runaway</v>
<v Speaker 2>explore.</v>

1464
01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you expose yourself to risk,</v>

1465
01:14:16.271 --> 01:14:19.600
<v Speaker 2>but you gain knowledge and you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a cortex that you know is</v>

1466
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:25.120
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously disproportionate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If as a species we hadn't decided that</v>

1467
01:14:25.121 --> 01:14:27.430
<v Speaker 2>exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's escape or freezing,</v>

1468
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:31.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like we explore that can make you</v>
<v Speaker 2>the master of the situation so you can</v>

1469
01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:34.960
<v Speaker 2>be the master of something like fire</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of just being terrified about.</v>

1470
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 2>So in one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely phenomenally fascinating,</v>

1471
01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:45.220
<v Speaker 2>I think is that one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hindus do in relationship to Kelly</v>

1472
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.440
<v Speaker 2>is offer sacrifices.</v>

1473
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.161
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1474
01:14:49.161 --> 01:14:51.710
<v Speaker 2>why would you offer sacrifice to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid of?</v>

1475
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because that is what you do.</v>

1476
01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:58.550
<v Speaker 2>That's always what you do is you offer</v>
<v Speaker 2>up sacrifices to the unknown in the hope</v>

1477
01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:01.310
<v Speaker 2>that good things will happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense,</v>

1478
01:15:01.311 --> 01:15:02.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're faced with something terrible.</v>

1479
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:07.580
<v Speaker 2>The uncertain future that faces all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you write something you're afraid of.</v>

1480
01:15:07.581 --> 01:15:08.510
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1481
01:15:08.511 --> 01:15:10.220
<v Speaker 2>how many of you are worried about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>future?</v>

1482
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1483
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:14.330
<v Speaker 2>You're all young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're smart.</v>

1484
01:15:14.331 --> 01:15:16.100
<v Speaker 2>You're relatively good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1485
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.850
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are you worried for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you worried about?</v>

1486
01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in this classroom,</v>

1487
01:15:26.781 --> 01:15:28.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe you're worried about what</v>

1488
01:15:28.551 --> 01:15:31.200
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do or who you're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>marry or what your job's going to be,</v>

1489
01:15:31.201 --> 01:15:33.530
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your health or your family or there's a</v>

1490
01:15:33.531 --> 01:15:35.390
<v Speaker 2>whole category of things to be worried</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1491
01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.490
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1492
01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.570
<v Speaker 2>you're worried about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what are you doing in university?</v>

1493
01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say you're sacrificing your free</v>

1494
01:15:46.531 --> 01:15:50.160
<v Speaker 2>time in the present to the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1495
01:15:50.161 --> 01:15:52.890
<v Speaker 2>in the hope that if you offer up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice properly,</v>

1496
01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.810
<v Speaker 2>the future will smile on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another fundamental discovery</v>

1497
01:15:57.811 --> 01:15:59.280
<v Speaker 2>of the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal.</v>

1498
01:15:59.281 --> 01:16:00.270
<v Speaker 2>That discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1499
01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:04.260
<v Speaker 2>think about it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by changing what you cling to in the</v>

1500
01:16:04.261 --> 01:16:06.960
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can alter the future.</v>

1501
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1502
01:16:08.881 --> 01:16:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when we discovered that</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe when we first started to store</v>

1503
01:16:11.731 --> 01:16:14.370
<v Speaker 2>food or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a mind boggling.</v>

1504
01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:17.580
<v Speaker 2>It's mind boggling discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1505
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:19.230
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>

1506
01:16:19.231 --> 01:16:21.330
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the prime discoveries of</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

1507
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:25.490
<v Speaker 2>So you represent the thing you're afraid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1508
01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:26.691
<v Speaker 2>then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1509
01:16:26.691 --> 01:16:29.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a class of things that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of that are unknown.</v>

1510
01:16:29.121 --> 01:16:32.120
<v Speaker 2>What can I do about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a really good question.</v>

1511
01:16:32.121 --> 01:16:35.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a sophisticated and complicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>question and we do know the answer to</v>

1512
01:16:35.871 --> 01:16:38.300
<v Speaker 2>some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like approach cautiously,</v>

1513
01:16:38.301 --> 01:16:40.580
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily when necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't run.</v>

1514
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Especially if the thing that's in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1515
01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:47.210
<v Speaker 2>if the thing that frightens you is</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposing your movement towards a valued</v>

1516
01:16:47.211 --> 01:16:50.270
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do not freeze and runaway because the</v>

1517
01:16:50.271 --> 01:16:53.120
<v Speaker 2>thing will grow if you do that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll shrink.</v>

1518
01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:55.730
<v Speaker 2>So that's a bad strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1519
01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I'll just give you a bit of a preview</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what I'm going to talk to you</v>

1520
01:17:12.521 --> 01:17:16.970
<v Speaker 2>about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next time we meet.</v>

1521
01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to you a little bit about</v>

1522
01:17:34.531 --> 01:17:39.030
<v Speaker 2>initiation rites and I touched on them</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a little bit today when I was talking</v>

1523
01:17:39.031 --> 01:17:41.970
<v Speaker 2>about things like rescuing the father</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the depths.</v>

1524
01:17:41.971 --> 01:17:43.920
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Pinocchio does is essentially an</v>

1525
01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:44.880
<v Speaker 2>initiation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1526
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:48.330
<v Speaker 2>And there are elements of that that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>also embedded in the Harry Potter</v>

1527
01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:51.990
<v Speaker 2>stories because for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his descent into the unknown underneath</v>

1528
01:17:51.991 --> 01:17:56.991
<v Speaker 2>the school and his encounter with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix are all parts of a very complex</v>

1529
01:17:58.621 --> 01:17:59.540
<v Speaker 2>initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1530
01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he basically,</v>

1531
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:06.100
<v Speaker 2>his adventures set him on a path that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes him the savior of his kingdom.</v>

1532
01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:08.890
<v Speaker 2>That's fundamentally the entire story of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harry Potter.</v>

1533
01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:11.963
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

1534
01:18:13.770 --> 01:18:18.390
<v Speaker 2>there are ways of catalyzing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity and some of them have to do</v>

1535
01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:22.020
<v Speaker 2>with the fact that you're a multilevel</v>
<v Speaker 2>creature.</v>

1536
01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.690
<v Speaker 2>So this is a tough thing to grasp too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1537
01:18:24.691 --> 01:18:27.060
<v Speaker 2>when you look at someone you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's what they look like,</v>

1538
01:18:27.061 --> 01:18:29.500
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really not the case in,</v>

1539
01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:34.020
<v Speaker 2>in very many important ways because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have molecular and micro sub structures</v>

1540
01:18:34.021 --> 01:18:36.320
<v Speaker 2>that you can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see the back of them,</v>

1541
01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:38.870
<v Speaker 2>you don't see their family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see the political systems that</v>

1542
01:18:38.871 --> 01:18:41.430
<v Speaker 2>are embedded in and you don't see them</v>
<v Speaker 2>across time.</v>

1543
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that's there is way more</v>

1544
01:18:44.071 --> 01:18:49.071
<v Speaker 2>complicated than the thing you see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways of starting to pull</v>

1545
01:18:49.171 --> 01:18:53.910
<v Speaker 2>your pull your conceptions past your</v>
<v Speaker 2>senses is to understand that human being</v>

1546
01:18:53.911 --> 01:18:58.830
<v Speaker 2>exists at multiple levels simultaneously</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that part of psychologically</v>

1547
01:18:58.831 --> 01:19:02.850
<v Speaker 2>expansion of psychological knowledge is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to become aware of those levels and to</v>

1548
01:19:02.851 --> 01:19:06.420
<v Speaker 2>in some sense of move up and down them</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you become conscious of them.</v>

1549
01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:11.610
<v Speaker 2>And I would say in part the initiations</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to talk about</v>

1550
01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.970
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are</v>

1551
01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:18.480
<v Speaker 2>embodied dramatizations of the process</v>
<v Speaker 2>and move of moving up and down the</v>

1552
01:19:18.481 --> 01:19:21.330
<v Speaker 2>multiple levels of being a human being</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists upon.</v>

1553
01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:26.630
<v Speaker 2>And that the psychoanalytic process is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>subset of that process.</v>

1554
01:19:26.731 --> 01:19:29.300
<v Speaker 2>So the Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ian's the unions,</v>

1555
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:32.280
<v Speaker 2>the people who are interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolism and the unconscious and depth</v>

1556
01:19:32.281 --> 01:19:35.490
<v Speaker 2>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're interested in expanding your</v>

1557
01:19:35.491 --> 01:19:39.960
<v Speaker 2>conception of who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond what you can articulate.</v>

1558
01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.880
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1559
01:19:41.881 --> 01:19:44.490
<v Speaker 2>do you believe that there's more to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>than what you can articulate?</v>

1560
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:46.920
<v Speaker 2>And if the answer to that is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you might think,</v>

1561
01:19:46.921 --> 01:19:48.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that worth exploring?</v>

1562
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:52.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really what we're doing for the</v>

1563
01:19:52.051 --> 01:19:57.051
<v Speaker 2>next five lectures or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see you next Tuesday.</v>

1564
01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.090
<v Speaker 2>No Thursday.</v>
