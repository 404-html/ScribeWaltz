1
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.753
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well start by writing down </v>

2
00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:09.044
<v Speaker 1>that url.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show it to you again at the end of </v>

3
00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the syllabus is.</v>

4
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.443
<v Speaker 1>The syllabus will tell you pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you need to know about the </v>

5
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.400
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>It consists of readings from a larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>text.</v>

8
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.763
<v Speaker 1>I use it because it's old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the theorists that we're </v>

9
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>are also old.</v>

10
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.493
<v Speaker 1>And so I found this particular text </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate and many of the people that </v>

11
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very,</v>

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sophisticated views of personality.</v>

13
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.383
<v Speaker 1>And I think that it does you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disservice unless you read something </v>

14
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:09.641
<v Speaker 1>that's sufficiently sophisticated so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you actually understand at least to</v>

15
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:14.510
<v Speaker 1>some degree what the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to study,</v>

16
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might as well start,</v>

17
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I suppose with a definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

18
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to define something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>that general because</v>

19
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.503
<v Speaker 1>when you're speaking about human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple to figure out what </v>

20
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>constitutes personality and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes something else.</v>

21
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.143
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to hit at it from a couple </v>

22
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.304
<v Speaker 1>of different perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while I'm doing so I would like you </v>

23
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:51.670
<v Speaker 1>also to consider</v>

24
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>the nature of what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

25
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Human personality is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfathomable.</v>

26
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.383
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and and we're nested in </v>

27
00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>systems that are also unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

28
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 1>There are more patterns of connections </v>
<v Speaker 1>between neurons in your brain.</v>

29
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Then there are sub atomic particles in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe by a substantial margin.</v>

30
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 1>You can look up Gerald Edelman if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to find out about that.</v>

31
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.543
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not unreasonable to point </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that you're the most complicated </v>

32
00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:31.144
<v Speaker 1>thing we know of by many orders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude and the probability that you </v>

33
00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:38.344
<v Speaker 1>can understand yourself in anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching totality is extraordinarily </v>

34
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:44.014
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this makes the study of personality </v>

35
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:53.091
<v Speaker 1>something very</v>
<v Speaker 1>daring and hopeless and complicated.</v>

36
00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Now we're to cycle through a</v>

37
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v Speaker 2>very large number of theorists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you'll find is that although </v>

38
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 2>there are commonalities between them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are market differences.</v>

39
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

40
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 2>what's the point of studying this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequence of theorists and ideas?</v>

41
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 2>If there's no point of agreement between</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

42
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.313
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say first there are points of </v>

43
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.394
<v Speaker 2>agreement between them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although personality hasn't advanced to </v>

44
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.614
<v Speaker 2>the point where I would say that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a homogenous theory that's free of </v>

45
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 2>internal contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say that</v>

46
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>personality is a hybrid discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly science</v>

47
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.563
<v Speaker 1>but it's partly engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clinical element of it I would say </v>

48
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.174
<v Speaker 1>is more like engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what engineers do is try to do </v>

49
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.114
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to make something happen and </v>

50
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:04.324
<v Speaker 1>they are informed by theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is still to build </v>

51
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:08.344
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're working as a clinical </v>

52
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:11.644
<v Speaker 1>psychologist and most of the initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists that we'll discuss for the </v>

53
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>first little more than a third to a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the chorus or clinical theorists,</v>

54
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to build something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with very,</v>

55
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual problems because</v>

56
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.623
<v Speaker 1>they're either trying to cure mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorders or maybe even unhappiness and </v>

57
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:37.264
<v Speaker 1>trying to bring about health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that it's </v>

58
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:43.024
<v Speaker 1>not a straight forward thing to define a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental disorder from a scientific </v>

59
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:51.751
<v Speaker 1>perspective because what's healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally and what's not is partly social</v>

60
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:59.401
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly socially constructed and</v>

61
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:00.484
<v Speaker 1>it partly has to do with norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it partly has to do with ideals </v>

62
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>because you might also say that to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy is to be normal,</v>

63
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>but you could also say that to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy is to be ideal.</v>

64
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.983
<v Speaker 1>And then of course you run into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of having to conceptualize an </v>

65
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:22.471
<v Speaker 1>ideal and it isn't self evident that </v>
<v Speaker 1>science is capable of conceptualizing an</v>

66
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:30.691
<v Speaker 1>ideal because ideals tend to fall into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the domain of moral judgments,</v>

67
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.773
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or philosophical judgements rather than </v>

68
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>scientific judgements per se.</v>

69
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.003
<v Speaker 1>So what I would say to you is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be worthwhile to approach this </v>

70
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:51.150
<v Speaker 1>course as if you were an engineer of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human spirit,</v>

71
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.350
<v Speaker 1>an engineer of your own spirit to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

72
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>but also an engineer of the spirits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

73
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Because as you interact with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

74
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>you inevitably tell them what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you don't want.</v>

75
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>When they give you what you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you admire,</v>

76
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>you respond positively to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay attention to them,</v>

77
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you smile at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you focus,</v>

78
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>you focus your thoughts on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you interact with them.</v>

79
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Then you reward them for acting in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular manner.</v>

80
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And when they don't respond the way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

81
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.743
<v Speaker 1>then you punish them with a lock or by </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning away or by rejecting their </v>

82
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 1>friendship or when were a child by </v>
<v Speaker 1>refusing to play for them,</v>

83
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.953
<v Speaker 1>play with them and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're engaged in the co creation of </v>

84
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.493
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own and others and that also brings </v>

85
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:55.124
<v Speaker 1>up the same question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that we are all collectively </v>

86
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to create?</v>

87
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.973
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that you all have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of falling short of the </v>

88
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:11.564
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ideal that you hold for yourself or </v>

89
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:19.691
<v Speaker 1>an ideal that other people hold for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that you all feel the negative</v>

90
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 1>consequences of falling short of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>

91
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.233
<v Speaker 1>Freud would conceptualize that as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>superego imposing its judgment on the </v>

92
00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you being ego,</v>

93
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.370
<v Speaker 1>the superego being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hybrid I suppose of</v>

94
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.123
<v Speaker 1>external external forces and also your </v>
<v Speaker 1>internalization of those judgments and </v>

95
00:07:49.481 --> 00:07:54.481
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now personality per se I would say</v>

96
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.203
<v Speaker 1>has these elements of ideal and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>structural elements of oil as well and </v>

97
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.700
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about those more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second half of the class.</v>

98
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.390
<v Speaker 1>The structural elements can be lined up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and outlined more scientifically.</v>

99
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.140
<v Speaker 1>The second half of the cow class </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrates more on</v>

100
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.713
<v Speaker 1>physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain physiology and on statistical </v>

101
00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:27.330
<v Speaker 1>approaches to the description of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

102
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:28.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you might say that that </v>

103
00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 1>outlines the territory.</v>

104
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.590
<v Speaker 1>The course is called personality and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations because</v>

105
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.820
<v Speaker 1>we have personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's who you are now.</v>

106
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.450
<v Speaker 1>But our personalities are also capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of transformation of change.</v>

107
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously we think about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

108
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.943
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that might be regarded as </v>

109
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.950
<v Speaker 1>factual learning and some of it might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded as learning how to perceive and</v>

110
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:03.624
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that the clinical </v>

111
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>psychologists that will cover to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with</v>

112
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.003
<v Speaker 1>are much more concerned with the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the implicit structures that shape </v>

113
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:24.231
<v Speaker 1>your perceptions and also the implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that shape your behaviors and</v>

114
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:31.851
<v Speaker 1>how they're integrated in relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your negative emotion,</v>

115
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.623
<v Speaker 1>health and wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the thinkers in the second half </v>

116
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.203
<v Speaker 1>are more concerned about laying out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structural elements of those features </v>

117
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 1>and relating them to underlying say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanistic phenomena,</v>

118
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>making the assumption which seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>warranted,</v>

119
00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 1>that there's some relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality and the manner in which</v>

120
00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 1>your brain functions.</v>

121
00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.723
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to provide you with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Meta narrative that will help you unite </v>

122
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:07.014
<v Speaker 1>these different theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've often found it useful when I'm </v>

123
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 1>trying to remember something to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story to hang the fact on.</v>

124
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.323
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're faced with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity of doing nothing but </v>

125
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:18.234
<v Speaker 1>memorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious to me that </v>

126
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 1>memorization actually constitutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

127
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.993
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes knowledge is that </v>

128
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.993
<v Speaker 1>generation of a cognitive structure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>enables you to conduct yourself more </v>

129
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.373
<v Speaker 1>appropriately in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I suppose you might say that of </v>

130
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 1>course in psychology you could argue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that of course in psychology,</v>

131
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 1>especially in personality is of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>in applied wisdom as well.</v>

132
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.243
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that wisdom is in part your </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to understand yourselves so </v>

133
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 1>that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't present too much of an</v>

134
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:57.174
<v Speaker 1>intolerable mystery to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also to understand others so that </v>

135
00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:06.951
<v Speaker 1>you can predict their behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand their motivations,</v>

136
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 1>and negotiate with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to them and formulate joint games</v>

137
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:15.264
<v Speaker 1>with them so that you can integrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself reasonably well with another </v>

138
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:23.670
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a family and in society.</v>

139
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the structural elements of personality </v>

140
00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:30.814
<v Speaker 1>might be regarded as the implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures that govern your perception </v>

141
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.360
<v Speaker 1>and that tilt you towards certain kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of behaviors.</v>

142
00:11:40.361 --> 00:11:41.194
<v Speaker 1>I can give you some examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about the big five model </v>

143
00:11:44.411 --> 00:11:45.244
<v Speaker 1>just briefly.</v>

144
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.780
<v Speaker 1>The big five personality model is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical model,</v>

145
00:11:49.781 --> 00:11:54.781
<v Speaker 1>which we'll cover in detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained by trait there partly during the</v>

146
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:55.684
<v Speaker 1>second half of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that the big five was generated </v>

147
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:00.304
<v Speaker 1>was that it's stretton being generated </v>
<v Speaker 1>over about 50 years that personality </v>

148
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:06.544
<v Speaker 1>psychologists gathered together </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives within the English language </v>

149
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.104
<v Speaker 1>first that were used to describe human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings as many adjectives as they could </v>

150
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>collect and then subjected them to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>process called factor analysis.</v>

151
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:22.024
<v Speaker 1>And what factor analysis does is enable </v>
<v Speaker 1>you statistically to determine in some </v>

152
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:28.750
<v Speaker 1>sense how similar adjectives are to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

153
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

154
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.323
<v Speaker 1>if you gave a thousand people a list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives to describe themselves with </v>

155
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 1>and one of the adjectives was happy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>another of the adjectives was social,</v>

156
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:48.030
<v Speaker 1>you'd find that those who rated </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves high on happy would also rate</v>

157
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:49.264
<v Speaker 1>themselves high on social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those who rated themselves low on </v>

158
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 1>happy would also rate themselves low on </v>
<v Speaker 1>social.</v>

159
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>And by looking at those patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Covariation,</v>

160
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 1>you can determine what the essential </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions are of human personality.</v>

161
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 1>One of the dimensions is roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

162
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 1>That's extroversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another dimension is neuroticism.</v>

163
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:18.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a negative emotion dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you ask someone if they're anxious</v>

164
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 1>and they score high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say on a scale of one to seven,</v>

165
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.710
<v Speaker 1>they're also likely to score high on </v>
<v Speaker 1>another item that says that they're sad.</v>

166
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that negative emotions </v>
<v Speaker 1>clump together.</v>

167
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:31.563
<v Speaker 1>And so that people who experience more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of one negative emotion have a </v>

168
00:13:34.931 --> 00:13:37.360
<v Speaker 1>propensity to experience more of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

169
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.840
<v Speaker 1>There's another dimension called </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness.</v>

170
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 1>And agreeable people are self </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificing,</v>

171
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.113
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're dealing with an agreeable </v>

172
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like conflict,</v>

173
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.140
<v Speaker 1>they care for other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

174
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.070
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with an agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

175
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 1>they're likely to put your concerns </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of theirs.</v>

176
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.610
<v Speaker 1>They are non competitive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperative.</v>

177
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.433
<v Speaker 1>It's a dimension where women are women </v>
<v Speaker 1>score more highly than men on </v>

178
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.473
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness across cultures including </v>
<v Speaker 1>those cultures where the largest steps </v>

179
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:15.784
<v Speaker 1>have been taken towards producing an </v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian social circumstance like </v>

180
00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:19.714
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually the gender differences in </v>

181
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:24.220
<v Speaker 1>personality there are larger than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are anywhere else.</v>

182
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another trait is conscientiousness.</v>

183
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness is an excellent trait </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do well in,</v>

184
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:33.903
<v Speaker 1>in school and in work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a manager and </v>

185
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:36.903
<v Speaker 1>administrator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say we understand a lot about </v>

186
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it,</v>

187
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.633
<v Speaker 1>it reliably emerges from factor analytic</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies of adjective groups across </v>

188
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:49.030
<v Speaker 1>different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conscientious people are diligent,</v>

189
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:49.923
<v Speaker 1>industrious and orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their orderliness tilts them towards </v>

190
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:53.864
<v Speaker 1>political conservatism by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it turns out that your inbuilt </v>

191
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.850
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your inbuilt personality,</v>

192
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.073
<v Speaker 1>which constitutes a set of filters </v>
<v Speaker 1>through which you view the world also </v>

193
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.563
<v Speaker 1>alters the manner in which you process </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and influences the way that </v>

194
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>

195
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.913
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we've been doing a lot of research </v>

196
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 1>on this as of late.</v>

197
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.710
<v Speaker 1>The more accurate a measure you take of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's political beliefs,</v>

198
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.280
<v Speaker 1>the more you find that personality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's predicting them.</v>

199
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a reasonable thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about because you know,</v>

200
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.913
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out ways of </v>

201
00:15:33.271 --> 00:15:34.740
<v Speaker 1>simplifying the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

202
00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Because you just can't do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people are specialized,</v>

203
00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:41.820
<v Speaker 1>they have specialized niches that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy and you could think about them as</v>

204
00:15:41.821 --> 00:15:44.850
<v Speaker 1>social niches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A niche is a place where your particular</v>

205
00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:49.440
<v Speaker 1>skills would serve to maintain you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're extroverted,</v>

206
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you're going to look for a social niche </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you like to be around people.</v>

207
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.383
<v Speaker 1>And if you're introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to spend much more time on </v>

208
00:15:55.861 --> 00:15:57.840
<v Speaker 1>your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're an introverted person,</v>

209
00:15:57.841 --> 00:15:58.674
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want a job where you're </v>

210
00:16:01.651 --> 00:16:02.484
<v Speaker 1>not selling and where you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by groups of people who are </v>

211
00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:07.590
<v Speaker 1>making social demands on you all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because it will wear you out.</v>

212
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just exactly what you want.</v>

213
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.413
<v Speaker 1>And so the extrovert sees the world as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place of social opportunity and the </v>

214
00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:20.370
<v Speaker 1>introverts sees the world as a place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat from and spend time alone.</v>

215
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.710
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that both of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>modes of being are valid.</v>

216
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.750
<v Speaker 1>The issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree,</v>

217
00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:28.584
<v Speaker 1>is whether or not you're fortunate </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to match your temperament with </v>

218
00:16:32.401 --> 00:16:33.234
<v Speaker 1>the demands of the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose also whether you're </v>

219
00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:36.024
<v Speaker 1>fortunate enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate enough so that you're born in </v>

220
00:16:38.611 --> 00:16:39.444
<v Speaker 1>an era where there actually is a niche </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your particular temperament because </v>

221
00:16:42.661 --> 00:16:45.630
<v Speaker 1>it isn't necessarily the case that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be the case.</v>

222
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.793
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that all of these temperamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions very because of evolutionary </v>

223
00:16:51.571 --> 00:16:52.680
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

224
00:16:52.681 --> 00:16:54.630
<v Speaker 1>So there's a distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

225
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.480
<v Speaker 1>a normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are somewhere in the middle.</v>

226
00:16:57.481 --> 00:16:59.730
<v Speaker 1>And then as you go out towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes,</v>

227
00:16:59.731 --> 00:17:00.564
<v Speaker 1>there are fewer and fewer people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that on average </v>

228
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.213
<v Speaker 1>across large spans of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been environments that match </v>

229
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.870
<v Speaker 1>every single position on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution with most,</v>

230
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.060
<v Speaker 1>most of the environments matching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

231
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:15.923
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise we wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved that way and so sometimes being </v>

232
00:17:19.081 --> 00:17:22.860
<v Speaker 1>really extroverted is going to work well</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you in a minority of environments,</v>

233
00:17:22.861 --> 00:17:26.130
<v Speaker 1>a minority of niches and sometimes it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just going to be a catastrophe.</v>

234
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I suspect for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you live in a tyrannical society</v>

235
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.360
<v Speaker 1>where any sign of</v>

236
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.740
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

237
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.723
<v Speaker 3>of</v>

238
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.720
<v Speaker 1>personally oriented activity is likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get you in trouble,</v>

239
00:17:39.721 --> 00:17:44.190
<v Speaker 1>that being extroverted and low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism wouldn't be a very good idea</v>

240
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.053
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to be mouthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and saying a lot of things unable </v>

241
00:17:48.331 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 1>to keep your thoughts yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be relatively fearless.</v>

242
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.493
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know that for sure because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't done the studies that </v>

243
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:59.070
<v Speaker 1>precisely match temperamental proclivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to environmental demand,</v>

244
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but you get what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so conscientious people anyways,</v>

245
00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:09.090
<v Speaker 1>conscientious people are industrious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly.</v>

246
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:09.983
<v Speaker 1>We know a little bit about orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be associated strangely </v>

247
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 1>enough with disgust sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose isn't that surprising.</v>

248
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:18.264
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take an orderly person and you </v>

249
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:20.784
<v Speaker 1>put them in a messy kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they respond with disgust and want </v>

250
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.780
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than to straighten it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and organize it and clean it.</v>

251
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 1>And there's tremendous variability in </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness.</v>

252
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as I said,</v>

253
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>orderliness predicts political </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism.</v>

254
00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:37.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly one of the things.</v>

255
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.443
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

256
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.530
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and grades,</v>

257
00:18:45.531 --> 00:18:49.310
<v Speaker 1>it's about 0.4.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 16% of the variance.</v>

258
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.383
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the second best predictor of </v>

259
00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:55.310
<v Speaker 1>university grades after intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about intelligence during</v>

260
00:18:55.311 --> 00:18:59.870
<v Speaker 1>this course to intelligence is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>a relatively straightforward concept.</v>

261
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'll get into it today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but conscientious people,</v>

262
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.993
<v Speaker 1>their industriousness and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderliness makes them schedule their </v>

263
00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:09.650
<v Speaker 1>time so they make efficient use of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

264
00:19:09.651 --> 00:19:11.390
<v Speaker 1>They use schedules and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

265
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.800
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been able to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about the underlying biology or</v>

266
00:19:15.801 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 1>psychology of industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

267
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.793
<v Speaker 1>we've tried really dozens and dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests attempting to find a laboratory </v>

268
00:19:24.861 --> 00:19:27.260
<v Speaker 1>measure on which industrious people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

269
00:19:27.261 --> 00:19:28.094
<v Speaker 1>And we failed completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no animal models of </v>

270
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:30.914
<v Speaker 1>industriousness either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say it's great mystery </v>

271
00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:35.720
<v Speaker 1>that remains at the heart of trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

272
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.093
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's a human specific </v>

273
00:19:38.631 --> 00:19:39.560
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:40.394
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of sled dogs maybe of </v>

275
00:19:41.901 --> 00:19:42.734
<v Speaker 1>being industrious and maybe and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep dogs and animals that work like </v>

276
00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:46.574
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course they've been trained by </v>

277
00:19:47.181 --> 00:19:47.870
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

278
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:48.703
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't obvious that animals are </v>

279
00:19:51.561 --> 00:19:53.900
<v Speaker 1>industrious the same way we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

280
00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:57.980
<v Speaker 1>industriousness involves sacrificing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present for the future,</v>

281
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.760
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like you have to be able to</v>

282
00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:05.540
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize time in order to sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 1>the present for the future.</v>

283
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.910
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I would recommend</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do as students,</v>

284
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this course and maybe in every course</v>

285
00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:18.730
<v Speaker 1>speaking of industriousness is come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a plan of attack for the course and</v>

286
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 1>use a scheduler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

287
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:24.230
<v Speaker 1>if you treat your university career like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a full time job,</v>

288
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.573
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you keep up on the readings and </v>

289
00:20:28.941 --> 00:20:32.480
<v Speaker 1>you keep up on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the essays and all of that,</v>

290
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:33.703
<v Speaker 1>then you're much less likely as well to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into despair when you get too far </v>

291
00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:38.804
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using a google calendar or something </v>

292
00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:41.564
<v Speaker 1>like that to organize a schedule for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire semester at the beginning of the </v>

293
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:46.454
<v Speaker 1>semester can be invaluable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're not very </v>

294
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:52.270
<v Speaker 1>industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very industrious because it can keep you</v>

295
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:52.900
<v Speaker 1>on track.</v>

296
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrious people is that they are very</v>

297
00:20:56.381 --> 00:21:00.190
<v Speaker 1>good at using schedules and it planning </v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of their time.</v>

298
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And so I would like to say that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should all be smarter,</v>

299
00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:05.710
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know how you could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter.</v>

300
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve intelligence.</v>

301
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:09.694
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose we don't really know </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about how to improve </v>

302
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:12.724
<v Speaker 1>industriousness either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you that people who are </v>

303
00:21:15.131 --> 00:21:20.131
<v Speaker 1>industrious come up with a strategy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>solving the problem that's ahead of them</v>

304
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.260
<v Speaker 1>and then they do whatever they can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to the strategy.</v>

305
00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:24.094
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sat down today or tomorrow for a </v>

306
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.523
<v Speaker 1>couple of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours and you filled in a google </v>

307
00:21:31.301 --> 00:21:32.134
<v Speaker 1>calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you happen to use with a </v>

308
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.713
<v Speaker 1>strategy for studying and a list of when</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your assignments are due and all of </v>

309
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:39.574
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're going to sit down and </v>

310
00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:42.004
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you won't be in a position where </v>

311
00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:44.764
<v Speaker 1>you have to cram for 10 hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopelessly right before you know an </v>

312
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:49.840
<v Speaker 1>important exam.</v>

313
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 1>It's also a very ineffective way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying.</v>

314
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being,</v>

315
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who cram for 10 hours say they're</v>

316
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:58.300
<v Speaker 1>studying for 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they rarely are because,</v>

317
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't study for 10 hours.</v>

318
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the power of concentration </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would enable me to do that for that</v>

319
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:07.234
<v Speaker 1>prolonged period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can manage about three hours of </v>

320
00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:10.354
<v Speaker 1>intense intellectual activity before I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty done and it's also the case that </v>

321
00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:15.724
<v Speaker 1>if you study and then sleep and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>study and then sleep and then study and </v>

322
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 1>then sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you space it out,</v>

323
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.090
<v Speaker 1>then you're much more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

324
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.613
<v Speaker 1>It's also much more likely that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to remember if you try </v>

325
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:27.334
<v Speaker 1>to recall the material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so highlighting in that sort of </v>

326
00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:31.900
<v Speaker 1>thing isn't very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But reading,</v>

327
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.913
<v Speaker 1>closing the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>summarizing what you've read without </v>

328
00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 1>opening the damn book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's useful.</v>

329
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.423
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing remembering and that's what </v>

330
00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:45.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're practicing memorization,</v>

331
00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:46.504
<v Speaker 1>you have to practice remembering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just go over the thing over </v>

332
00:22:49.481 --> 00:22:50.314
<v Speaker 1>and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll help you with recognition </v>

333
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:53.170
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some,</v>

334
00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 1>but it won't help you with recall </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

335
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last trade is openness.</v>

336
00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.133
<v Speaker 1>Openness is a creativity trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also associated with intelligence </v>

337
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:05.500
<v Speaker 1>in that intelligent people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm speaking technically of Iq,</v>

338
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.370
<v Speaker 1>tend to be higher in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be more creative,</v>

339
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:10.263
<v Speaker 1>which is hardly surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creative people are more likely to be </v>

340
00:23:13.901 --> 00:23:16.210
<v Speaker 1>liberal politically by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

341
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.210
<v Speaker 1>they like novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like aesthetics,</v>

342
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 1>they like fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like movies,</v>

343
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they like poetry?</v>

344
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.750
<v Speaker 1>There's something about them that grants</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

345
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Anesthetic sensitivity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

346
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:33.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an inbuilt trait and it's not the</v>

347
00:23:33.611 --> 00:23:35.500
<v Speaker 1>case by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone's creative.</v>

348
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.620
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from it.</v>

349
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.493
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've used the creative achievement </v>

350
00:23:38.561 --> 00:23:42.100
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire to you measure people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

351
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you about that later in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

352
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.243
<v Speaker 1>And the creative achievement </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire takes 13 dimensions of </v>

353
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

354
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.170
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing,</v>

355
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 1>acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific investigation,</v>

356
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural activity,</v>

357
00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.060
<v Speaker 1>cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

358
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a handful of others,</v>

359
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.810
<v Speaker 1>singing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

360
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of things that you would </v>

361
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 1>assume that people could be creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

362
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:07.394
<v Speaker 1>And then it asks people to rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves on a scale from one to 10 on </v>

363
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 1>their level of achievement with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to all those creative domains.</v>

364
00:24:16.071 --> 00:24:16.904
<v Speaker 1>With zero being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no training or proficiency in </v>

365
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:20.834
<v Speaker 1>this area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 70% of people score zero across the </v>

366
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 1>entire creative achievement </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire.</v>

367
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.480
<v Speaker 1>A tiny proportion of people are outliers</v>
<v Speaker 1>way out.</v>

368
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.443
<v Speaker 1>They're creative in many dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and exceptionally </v>

369
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:36.020
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out as you'll find out that</v>

370
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:38.360
<v Speaker 1>that pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called a prieto distribution,</v>

371
00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:39.194
<v Speaker 1>where most people stack up at zero and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few people are way out on the creative </v>

372
00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:44.204
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes all sorts of </v>

373
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 1>distributions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the distribution of money,</v>

374
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.913
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why 1% of the people have the </v>

375
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming majority of the money.</v>

376
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a different 1% across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It he'd like it churns,</v>

377
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.960
<v Speaker 1>and you're much more likely to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>1% if you're older,</v>

378
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.513
<v Speaker 1>logically enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you do as you </v>

379
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 1>age is you trade youth for money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're fortunate,</v>

380
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the trade is really worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

381
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:16.490
<v Speaker 1>but that's the best you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

382
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:17.983
<v Speaker 1>those particular traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of those as ways that you </v>

383
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:22.400
<v Speaker 1>simplify the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

384
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:23.563
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different places that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can act in the world and there's </v>

385
00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:29.390
<v Speaker 1>lots of different ways you can look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and survive.</v>

386
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:32.870
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can be a plumber and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyer and an engineer,</v>

387
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.490
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those all work,</v>

388
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they're very different modes</v>

389
00:25:36.441 --> 00:25:37.274
<v Speaker 1>of being and you can have different </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and survive as long as </v>

390
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:42.314
<v Speaker 1>you're capable of finding the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where your particular filters and </v>

391
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:50.660
<v Speaker 1>behavioral proclivities match the demand</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the environment.</v>

392
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 1>And a huge part I would say of </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful adaptation is precisely that.</v>

393
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Are there other elements of personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>too?</v>

394
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.130
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've been struck </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

395
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.023
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticisms I have of the psychoanalysts </v>

396
00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:05.954
<v Speaker 1>and the clinicians in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I have great admiration for </v>

397
00:26:08.391 --> 00:26:09.224
<v Speaker 1>them and would say that what they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say is very much worth listening to </v>

398
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.180
<v Speaker 1>is that it's not obvious that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality is inside you.</v>

399
00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.293
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you know a human being is a </v>

400
00:26:21.631 --> 00:26:25.040
<v Speaker 1>strange multilevel thing and you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>

401
00:26:25.041 --> 00:26:27.020
<v Speaker 1>well for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

402
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:32.230
<v Speaker 1>is your mother more a part of you then </v>
<v Speaker 1>your arm or maybe even more precisely,</v>

403
00:26:32.781 --> 00:26:36.020
<v Speaker 1>is your child more a part of you then </v>
<v Speaker 1>your arm?</v>

404
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.423
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly people will do </v>
<v Speaker 1>drastically self sacrificing things to </v>

405
00:26:41.301 --> 00:26:44.490
<v Speaker 1>maintain the lives of their children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>

406
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you're a person and you're made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sub,</v>

407
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.110
<v Speaker 1>sort of subcomponents of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a person,</v>

408
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:51.390
<v Speaker 1>none of which you can see when you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a person,</v>

409
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.930
<v Speaker 1>all the complicated machinery inside you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you who you are.</v>

410
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.763
<v Speaker 1>And then outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course he are nested in all sorts of </v>

411
00:26:59.101 --> 00:27:01.830
<v Speaker 1>complex systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're part of a family and,</v>

412
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.590
<v Speaker 1>and you're part of a community and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of a province.</v>

413
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:05.424
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of a state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of an international </v>

414
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:10.500
<v Speaker 1>consortium of states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of an ecosystem.</v>

415
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:15.501
<v Speaker 1>And how you make a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and the systems that you're embedded</v>

416
00:27:18.061 --> 00:27:20.900
<v Speaker 1>in is also an extraordinary difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

417
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.113
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in one of the things that you have </v>

418
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:24.960
<v Speaker 1>to do as a clinical psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

419
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:27.090
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to diagnose someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>with depression,</v>

420
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.680
<v Speaker 1>is that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

421
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.200
<v Speaker 1>this person's dreadfully unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

422
00:27:31.201 --> 00:27:35.340
<v Speaker 1>you can think about that as a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their psychological adjustment.</v>

423
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:36.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that they're learning,</v>

424
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:37.483
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the epidemiological </v>

425
00:27:41.581 --> 00:27:42.840
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

426
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.320
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you find is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>very many people have a first depressive</v>

427
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:52.290
<v Speaker 1>episode after something genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible has happened to them,</v>

428
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.573
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've lost someone or they've become </v>

429
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:59.160
<v Speaker 1>injured or or they've become unemployed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because unemployment is a terrible shock</v>

430
00:27:59.161 --> 00:27:59.994
<v Speaker 1>to people and it's not precisely self </v>
<v Speaker 1>evident that you can consider someone </v>

431
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:09.030
<v Speaker 1>who's unhappy and desperate because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer have a job depressed.</v>

432
00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.630
<v Speaker 1>They're certainly sad and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing very well,</v>

433
00:28:13.631 --> 00:28:14.464
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they no longer have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>income is actually something with </v>

434
00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.623
<v Speaker 1>dramatic practical consequences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>treating that as if it's a mental </v>

435
00:28:23.681 --> 00:28:28.681
<v Speaker 1>disorder seems to be counter productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case for example,</v>

436
00:28:29.291 --> 00:28:32.620
<v Speaker 1>that if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes into you to talk to you</v>

437
00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.640
<v Speaker 1>and they're very upset and they may </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest the signs of say,</v>

438
00:28:36.641 --> 00:28:37.474
<v Speaker 1>an anxiety disorder or again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression or or other other clinical </v>

439
00:28:40.931 --> 00:28:41.764
<v Speaker 1>features for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do a careful analysis of </v>

440
00:28:45.161 --> 00:28:47.860
<v Speaker 1>their manner in which they're embedded </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their family.</v>

441
00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:48.694
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that we'll talk </v>

442
00:28:50.171 --> 00:28:51.004
<v Speaker 1>about quite</v>

443
00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.270
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly when we come to discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>

444
00:28:55.271 --> 00:28:56.230
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

445
00:28:56.231 --> 00:28:57.064
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like everybody's families are </v>

446
00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:00.700
<v Speaker 1>necessarily particularly happy places to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

447
00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.773
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

448
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.733
<v Speaker 1>human beings are very dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a very long period of </v>

449
00:29:05.111 --> 00:29:08.710
<v Speaker 1>dependency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because we're so cortically hyper</v>

450
00:29:08.711 --> 00:29:09.544
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a very long time to program us </v>

451
00:29:11.411 --> 00:29:16.411
<v Speaker 1>into something that's vaguely capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuvering on its own and that produces</v>

452
00:29:16.931 --> 00:29:19.720
<v Speaker 1>of course the very tight familial bonds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all,</v>

453
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.580
<v Speaker 1>that we all desperately require because </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to be alone in the world?</v>

454
00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:29.790
<v Speaker 1>But it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also exposes us to the probability of</v>

455
00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:34.801
<v Speaker 1>becoming entangled into even </v>
<v Speaker 1>multigenerational family pathology.</v>

456
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:36.303
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious always and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly hasn't been to me when I've </v>

457
00:29:39.581 --> 00:29:43.660
<v Speaker 1>seen my clients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fundamental problem with the client</v>

458
00:29:43.661 --> 00:29:46.900
<v Speaker 1>is the client.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the fundamental problem is</v>

459
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.063
<v Speaker 1>is the family</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and perhaps that person has been </v>

460
00:29:54.151 --> 00:29:54.984
<v Speaker 1>identified as the problem person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rather convenient for everyone who </v>

461
00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.273
<v Speaker 1>involved to make that presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case that this is the </v>

462
00:30:04.381 --> 00:30:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Friday and idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

463
00:30:05.881 --> 00:30:10.470
<v Speaker 1>this is the depaul idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's very easy for people to become</v>

464
00:30:10.471 --> 00:30:14.310
<v Speaker 1>over dependent on their parents and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parents to facilitate that.</v>

465
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.700
<v Speaker 1>And then for the primary developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem for the individual,</v>

466
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.413
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become free of the interfering </v>

467
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:30.290
<v Speaker 1>elements of the family so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist as independent individuals.</v>

468
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course there are cultural </v>

469
00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:37.680
<v Speaker 1>variations in that that make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition complex,</v>

470
00:30:37.681 --> 00:30:41.670
<v Speaker 1>but that's a fundamental tenant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a Freudian psychology.</v>

471
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:47.150
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the clinical psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of whom that we're going to study,</v>

472
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.313
<v Speaker 1>have a pronounced Western orientation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the fundamental presuppositions </v>

473
00:30:53.461 --> 00:30:54.294
<v Speaker 1>is that part of the hallmark of positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological development is the </v>

474
00:30:59.431 --> 00:31:03.270
<v Speaker 1>creation of an individual that's capable</v>
<v Speaker 1>of acting independently.</v>

475
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

476
00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:06.054
<v Speaker 1>an implicit ideal that lurks at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the clinical presuppositions </v>

477
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:14.430
<v Speaker 1>of all the theorists that are classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>

478
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.540
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's a very old picture.</v>

479
00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

480
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.230
<v Speaker 1>It's Jonah emerging from the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a variant of a myth.</v>

481
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:29.893
<v Speaker 1>The Myth is the dragon myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the Dragon Myth is that </v>

482
00:31:34.191 --> 00:31:38.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a dragon that lives under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground that's eternal.</v>

483
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:44.740
<v Speaker 1>And now and then it rises out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground to threaten the state and someone</v>

484
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:51.490
<v Speaker 1>within the state determines to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront the dragon voluntarily and does</v>

485
00:31:52.731 --> 00:31:55.730
<v Speaker 1>so and then brings back something of </v>
<v Speaker 1>great value.</v>

486
00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the hero is generally male,</v>

487
00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:06.470
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the thing of great value is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>female that the dragon has kidnapped.</v>

488
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a St George Story and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gold and other treasure,</v>

489
00:32:10.851 --> 00:32:12.530
<v Speaker 1>like in the story of the Hobbit and</v>

490
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.610
<v Speaker 1>story that you all know very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a classic hero story.</v>

491
00:32:17.611 --> 00:32:18.444
<v Speaker 1>And the hero's story is another </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental element of the clinical </v>

492
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:24.024
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's predicated on the idea </v>

493
00:32:26.371 --> 00:32:31.371
<v Speaker 1>that you learn through voluntary contact</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that that frightens or disgusts you</v>

494
00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's a hallmark of psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

495
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.063
<v Speaker 1>Young Carl Young who will discuss in </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail said his primary dictum was in </v>

496
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.193
<v Speaker 1>steer Colinas invented tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure I'm massacring because </v>

497
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:49.904
<v Speaker 1>it's Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it meant in filth that will be </v>

498
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:55.160
<v Speaker 1>found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the hallmarks of the clinical</v>

499
00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:59.930
<v Speaker 1>theories is that within the confines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's experience,</v>

500
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:00.973
<v Speaker 1>and you could think about this as </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience out in the world or </v>

501
00:33:03.471 --> 00:33:07.340
<v Speaker 1>experience in the unconscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are</v>

502
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:13.990
<v Speaker 1>dirty little secrets let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and skeletons and</v>

503
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.553
<v Speaker 1>dreadful old fears and remnants of abuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and memories of pathological behavior </v>

504
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:24.254
<v Speaker 1>and failures of courage that you leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>you undeveloped perhaps out of </v>

505
00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:31.004
<v Speaker 1>avoidance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the psychoanalytic process is </v>

506
00:33:34.311 --> 00:33:35.144
<v Speaker 1>precisely the careful encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those forgotten and and repressed </v>

507
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:46.991
<v Speaker 1>elements of the self in the hope that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear encounter will redeem them,</v>

508
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:49.873
<v Speaker 1>unite them with the remainder of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and make you make you </v>

509
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 1>stronger in consequence.</v>

510
00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.343
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variant of the manner in which human </v>

511
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:01.034
<v Speaker 1>beings learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about this more in </v>

512
00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:07.310
<v Speaker 1>relationship to piaget because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always learn when you're wrong,</v>

513
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.463
<v Speaker 1>which is very annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you learn when you're </v>

514
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:14.120
<v Speaker 1>correct you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're walking in the world,</v>

515
00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:14.954
<v Speaker 1>you're operating in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a sense of what you want to </v>

516
00:34:18.021 --> 00:34:18.854
<v Speaker 1>have happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always looking at the world </v>

517
00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:23.120
<v Speaker 1>through this sense of what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happen.</v>

518
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:27.530
<v Speaker 1>You're acting so that what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happen will happen.</v>

519
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.400
<v Speaker 1>And when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're happy because,</v>

520
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.520
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what you want and that's good.</v>

521
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:35.443
<v Speaker 1>Maybe depending on what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also good because if you get </v>

522
00:34:39.111 --> 00:34:42.740
<v Speaker 1>what you want when you act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it turns out that your model of how</v>

523
00:34:42.741 --> 00:34:44.980
<v Speaker 1>to act is valid right now.</v>

524
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.823
<v Speaker 1>Outcome that you get what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates no error on the part of your </v>

525
00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:50.594
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very frequently the case that </v>

526
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.470
<v Speaker 1>when you act to get what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get what you want.</v>

527
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:02.150
<v Speaker 1>And then that's unpleasant because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get what you want.</v>

528
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.433
<v Speaker 1>But it's even more unpleasant because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings with it the hint of a suggestion </v>

529
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:07.723
<v Speaker 1>that the manner in which you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>construing the world is incorrect at </v>

530
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:15.350
<v Speaker 1>some indeterminant level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

531
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.240
<v Speaker 1>if you tell a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell a joke at a party,</v>

532
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 1>you presume that people will attend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they hear the joke,</v>

533
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:25.783
<v Speaker 1>they will laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you tell the joke and it </v>

534
00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 1>goes flat or even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusts and offends people,</v>

535
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.793
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be taken aback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because you get what </v>

536
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you want and that's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

537
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's more because there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with the way you conceptualize the</v>

538
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:47.790
<v Speaker 1>situation and then you're faced with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

539
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.840
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is the emergence of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain of the unknown.</v>

540
00:35:51.841 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what kind of mistake did you make?</v>

541
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're not as funny as you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

542
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be a big problem.</v>

543
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're not around people that who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the way you think they are.</v>

544
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't like you as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they liked you.</v>

545
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:07.524
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential for various paranoid </v>

546
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:11.994
<v Speaker 1>thoughts of increasing severity to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>welling up at you in a situation where </v>

547
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:17.334
<v Speaker 1>you make a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a trivial social mistake is quite </v>

548
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:23.010
<v Speaker 1>broad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you make an error of that sort,</v>

549
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.593
<v Speaker 1>you have to face it and sort through all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibilities so that you can find </v>

550
00:36:28.201 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 1>out what it was that you did wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to retool it.</v>

551
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:35.130
<v Speaker 1>So that in the future you don't make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same mistake.</v>

552
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.380
<v Speaker 1>And that requires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

553
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:38.214
<v Speaker 1>that requires in some sense what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might describe as a journey into the </v>

554
00:36:40.561 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 1>belly of the beast.</v>

555
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:42.383
<v Speaker 1>The beast being that place where things </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fallen apart and where you're </v>

556
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:49.240
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed with negative emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and confusion.</v>

557
00:36:49.241 --> 00:36:50.074
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of the journey to the </v>

558
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:55.530
<v Speaker 1>underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hero is the person who makes the</v>

559
00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:56.364
<v Speaker 1>voluntary journey to the underworld to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collect what's been languishing down </v>

560
00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:00.984
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the basic motif of </v>

561
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:06.960
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's the basic motif in some</v>

562
00:37:06.961 --> 00:37:11.961
<v Speaker 1>sense of clinical practice because one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that you do as a clinician</v>

563
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.820
<v Speaker 1>is find out what people are afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they're avoiding.</v>

564
00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And that can be in their past or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their present or in their future.</v>

565
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.243
<v Speaker 1>Break it down into smaller pieces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>help them devise strategies of approach </v>

566
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:28.974
<v Speaker 1>and mastery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that improves the quality of their </v>

567
00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:33.024
<v Speaker 1>personality and helps develop them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who won't make the same mistakes </v>

568
00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:39.930
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>

569
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:42.870
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

570
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why these,</v>

571
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.900
<v Speaker 1>this plethora of tools?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

572
00:37:48.901 --> 00:37:53.901
<v Speaker 1>I said in some sense being a personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist is like being an engineer.</v>

573
00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:00.870
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to build better people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say that if you're a carpenter</v>

574
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.513
<v Speaker 1>or a mechanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your ability to fix a vehicle or </v>

575
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:12.270
<v Speaker 1>build a house is dependent on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>proficiency with regards to the use of a</v>

576
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 1>multitude of tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might say,</v>

577
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:16.224
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more tools you have at your </v>

578
00:38:16.801 --> 00:38:17.634
<v Speaker 1>disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is that you're going </v>

579
00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:25.611
<v Speaker 1>to manage things properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I would like to offer you is</v>

580
00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:29.190
<v Speaker 1>the possibility that what you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to encounter in this course</v>

581
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:31.583
<v Speaker 1>is a series of sophisticated conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools that will help you understand </v>

582
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>yourself better and therefore better </v>
<v Speaker 1>orient yourself in the world.</v>

583
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:41.943
<v Speaker 1>I regard this course is intensely </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical and that's because I believe </v>

584
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:51.451
<v Speaker 1>that you have nothing to rely on in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that's more crucial to your success</v>

585
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.073
<v Speaker 1>as you move through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your character and your </v>

586
00:38:57.821 --> 00:38:58.654
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you bring to every </v>

587
00:39:00.551 --> 00:39:01.390
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

588
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:07.230
<v Speaker 1>And the more sophisticated you are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to yourself and others,</v>

589
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.673
<v Speaker 1>the more you understand people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deeper you understand the nature of </v>

590
00:39:12.281 --> 00:39:13.114
<v Speaker 1>your own being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is that you're going </v>

591
00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:16.714
<v Speaker 1>to proceed through your life in a manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will make you pleased to exist </v>

592
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.463
<v Speaker 1>rather than displeased to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've collected the writings of people </v>

593
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 1>that I regard as of in comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>

594
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.930
<v Speaker 1>They're difficult to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their concepts are complex,</v>

595
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:38.973
<v Speaker 1>but it's not surprising because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject matter is complex and vital and </v>

596
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:48.730
<v Speaker 1>so it requires work and I would say try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep up on the readings if you would.</v>

597
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.030
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make the course much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>much richer for you.</v>

598
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 1>And I would say because people often ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

599
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should I read for this course?</v>

600
00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's a lot of reading and </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer is read as if it matters.</v>

601
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.323
<v Speaker 1>That's the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be thinking about how it's going </v>

602
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:07.594
<v Speaker 1>to be tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do the readings and you come to </v>

603
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:09.694
<v Speaker 1>the lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the tests aren't particularly </v>

604
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:12.993
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you should read the readings as if </v>

605
00:40:16.481 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 1>the person is writing about you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should try to understand what the person</v>

606
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:23.560
<v Speaker 1>says because it's another tool for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use.</v>

607
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.860
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well with my clients,</v>

608
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.023
<v Speaker 1>you know I use the approaches of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorist for one client and the </v>

609
00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:32.470
<v Speaker 1>approaches of another theorist for </v>
<v Speaker 1>another client.</v>

610
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.543
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to depend to some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually on the temperament of the </v>

611
00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:37.054
<v Speaker 1>client.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found for example that people who are </v>

612
00:40:39.251 --> 00:40:42.310
<v Speaker 1>very high in openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the creativity dimension,</v>

613
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:46.000
<v Speaker 1>are quite amenable to a young Ian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Approach.</v>

614
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Whereas people who are more practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>

615
00:40:49.091 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 1>low and openness are much more amenable </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a behaviorist approach.</v>

616
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:54.063
<v Speaker 1>We don't really know enough about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology yet to match treatment to </v>

617
00:40:58.511 --> 00:40:59.344
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are the some of the things </v>

618
00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:04.090
<v Speaker 1>that I've experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

619
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:04.924
<v Speaker 1>Practicalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a website I gave you the </v>

620
00:41:10.181 --> 00:41:11.014
<v Speaker 1>url,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it up again at the end of </v>

621
00:41:11.771 --> 00:41:12.604
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Url lists all the readings that </v>

622
00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 1>aren't in the textbook and so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>textbook contains the classic readings,</v>

623
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.990
<v Speaker 1>readings from people like young and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>

624
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.770
<v Speaker 1>piaget and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers.</v>

625
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.593
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked that particular textbook </v>

626
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:30.634
<v Speaker 1>because I believe that the author did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very credible job of summarizing what's </v>

627
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:35.924
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to summarize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then also on the website there </v>

628
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:41.114
<v Speaker 1>are links to papers because much of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more modern material that pertains say </v>

629
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 1>to neuroscience and also to trait </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

630
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:50.503
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better just to read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original papers and all detail them out </v>

631
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:53.804
<v Speaker 1>with you as we go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'll also give you some </v>

632
00:41:56.151 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 1>familiarity with original psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>

633
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.640
<v Speaker 1>which are again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

634
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.840
<v Speaker 1>there's an idiom that you have to master</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to understand them,</v>

635
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.123
<v Speaker 1>but you might as well practice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're interested in </v>

636
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:15.071
<v Speaker 1>continuing with psychology in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>educational practice or as a career.</v>

637
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.430
<v Speaker 1>It's good to get accustomed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

638
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:26.920
<v Speaker 1>there again is the url for the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Jordan B.</v>

639
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Peterson Dotcom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't too hard to remember,</v>

640
00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:34.090
<v Speaker 1>assuming you can remember my name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then classes are listed on the left hand</v>

641
00:42:34.091 --> 00:42:36.820
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just find the syllabus there.</v>

642
00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:38.723
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

643
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:41.480
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what we're going to cover.</v>

644
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:43.933
<v Speaker 1>Well today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously this is the introduction and </v>

645
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:46.214
<v Speaker 1>overview class is a little strange this </v>
<v Speaker 1>year because one day it's an hour and </v>

646
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:49.784
<v Speaker 1>the next day it's two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so not exactly sure how we're going to </v>

647
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.770
<v Speaker 1>negotiate our way through that but we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>

648
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Historical perspectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological representations.</v>

649
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:02.084
<v Speaker 1>Well I told you that I would try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide you with a Meta narrative that </v>

650
00:43:05.511 --> 00:43:10.160
<v Speaker 1>might enable you to link the theories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to talk about together.</v>

651
00:43:10.161 --> 00:43:10.994
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to describe to you what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might regard as a conceptual language </v>

652
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 1>and as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the imagine,</v>

653
00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:18.943
<v Speaker 1>imagine that there are two kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you need to know and I </v>

654
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.880
<v Speaker 1>believe this to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that you need to know what the</v>

655
00:43:25.881 --> 00:43:29.660
<v Speaker 1>world is made of and I suppose that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper domain of science,</v>

656
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.033
<v Speaker 1>but then you need to know how to act and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole different thing and you </v>

657
00:43:35.121 --> 00:43:37.070
<v Speaker 1>need to know how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

658
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:39.320
<v Speaker 1>You need to know most of anything of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

659
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Because of course you're a living </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>

660
00:43:41.381 --> 00:43:45.830
<v Speaker 1>And action in relationship to desired </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals is,</v>

661
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.240
<v Speaker 1>is everything to you.</v>

662
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.000
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about that from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian perspective.</v>

663
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:52.580
<v Speaker 1>You have to act at least so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive,</v>

664
00:43:52.581 --> 00:43:56.210
<v Speaker 1>at least so that you can find a partner </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

665
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 1>that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the question is,</v>

666
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does the world look?</v>

667
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.040
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it as a place to act?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer isn't a place of value.</v>

668
00:44:07.551 --> 00:44:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Free objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what the world looks like.</v>

669
00:44:10.761 --> 00:44:11.594
<v Speaker 1>And you can't act in a world of value </v>
<v Speaker 1>free objects because there's no way of </v>

670
00:44:15.171 --> 00:44:19.130
<v Speaker 1>choosing between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If everything has zero value,</v>

671
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 1>why would you choose one thing over </v>
<v Speaker 1>another?</v>

672
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:26.980
<v Speaker 1>You live in a world where things present</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to you as of different value.</v>

673
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:30.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly a consequence of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>

674
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.370
<v Speaker 1>although it's consequence of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

675
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:37.850
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm going to try to do is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide you with a Schema that describes</v>

676
00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:41.910
<v Speaker 1>the world of morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

677
00:44:41.911 --> 00:44:42.744
<v Speaker 1>which is how to act and tell you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about what I think the </v>

678
00:44:45.961 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think was derived from Darwinian</v>

679
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.830
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>

680
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.053
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that it's within that </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that the clinical theories </v>

681
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:57.570
<v Speaker 1>logically nest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that'll give you a way of linking</v>

682
00:44:57.571 --> 00:44:58.404
<v Speaker 1>one theory to another from a conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective without having to rely so </v>

683
00:45:03.091 --> 00:45:03.924
<v Speaker 1>much on sheer memorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll talk about heroic and </v>

684
00:45:06.741 --> 00:45:09.450
<v Speaker 1>shamanic initiations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we're going to do that is</v>

685
00:45:09.451 --> 00:45:10.410
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

686
00:45:10.411 --> 00:45:11.244
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people use [inaudible] initiations for </v>

687
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:17.100
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of years all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and they have a particular kind of</v>

688
00:45:17.101 --> 00:45:20.280
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The paper by Murcia Ellie Outta which is</v>

689
00:45:20.281 --> 00:45:21.114
<v Speaker 1>linked on the site is a very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in details out some of these </v>

690
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:25.700
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

691
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.693
<v Speaker 1>there have been intelligent commentators</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on [inaudible] or j who wrote the </v>

692
00:45:30.601 --> 00:45:33.510
<v Speaker 1>discovery of the unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an outstanding book,</v>

693
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.290
<v Speaker 1>who linked the processes that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts,</v>

694
00:45:37.291 --> 00:45:38.124
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts uncovered in the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the 19th century and early part </v>

695
00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:46.860
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to these more primordial rituals of</v>

696
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:48.420
<v Speaker 1>personality transformation.</v>

697
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:53.420
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to situate ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense in deep history,</v>

698
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:59.070
<v Speaker 1>talking first about the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological landscape,</v>

699
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.910
<v Speaker 1>then talking about archaic modes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

700
00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:03.744
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization and transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then moving from there into </v>

701
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:10.800
<v Speaker 1>constructivism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to concentrate mostly on</v>

702
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:13.320
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget who has a developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

703
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Constructivists believe that you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself out of the information that you</v>

704
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:21.030
<v Speaker 1>gather in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're an exploring creature.</v>

705
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.133
<v Speaker 1>You explore specifically when the maps </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're using in the world are no </v>

706
00:46:25.381 --> 00:46:28.500
<v Speaker 1>longer orienting yourself properly when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're producing errors.</v>

707
00:46:28.501 --> 00:46:29.334
<v Speaker 1>You'd go out and gather information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>assemble yourself from the information </v>

708
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:34.910
<v Speaker 1>that you discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the depths,</v>

709
00:46:34.911 --> 00:46:36.870
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young and Freud,</v>

710
00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:38.123
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to with young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk you through some </v>

711
00:46:42.991 --> 00:46:46.170
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to use the films per se.</v>

712
00:46:46.171 --> 00:46:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use clips stills from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

713
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:50.580
<v Speaker 1>but in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

714
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:51.090
<v Speaker 1>the film.</v>

715
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:53.130
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in chronological order,</v>

716
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:54.503
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to try to explain to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you might use union presuppositions </v>

717
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.210
<v Speaker 1>to understand what the films are about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

718
00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:05.580
<v Speaker 1>if you think about a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say like the Lion King,</v>

719
00:47:05.581 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 1>which was an extraordinarily popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

720
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange phenomena that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and watch it,</v>

721
00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:12.121
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

722
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:12.954
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's drawings of animated animals that </v>

723
00:47:16.771 --> 00:47:21.180
<v Speaker 1>in some sense represent you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very low resolution,</v>

724
00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:22.014
<v Speaker 1>but you perceive them immediately as </v>
<v Speaker 1>living things and you attribute to the </v>

725
00:47:26.851 --> 00:47:28.470
<v Speaker 1>motivation and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

726
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:29.763
<v Speaker 1>and motive power and understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do it automatically without even </v>

727
00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:33.034
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a classic plot that lies </v>

728
00:47:35.531 --> 00:47:38.140
<v Speaker 1>underneath those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the plots are very,</v>

729
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:38.861
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

730
00:47:38.861 --> 00:47:42.130
<v Speaker 1>very old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you can understand them.</v>

731
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:45.490
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you can understand them </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because life has a plot,</v>

732
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.340
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it has a couple of plots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a multitude of plots,</v>

733
00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:49.980
<v Speaker 1>but life has applaud.</v>

734
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:50.853
<v Speaker 1>And if it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be able to understand each </v>

735
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:52.714
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'd like to illustrate that for </v>

736
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:57.520
<v Speaker 1>you by an analysis of some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>

737
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best way to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone as sophisticated as young who is</v>

738
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to get a handle on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>

739
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:06.603
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I am going to show you a film </v>

740
00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:09.334
<v Speaker 1>with Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you a film called </v>

741
00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:11.134
<v Speaker 1>Crumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a documentary and it's about a </v>

742
00:48:14.621 --> 00:48:19.210
<v Speaker 1>very badly in meshed family and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts of the family members too,</v>

743
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.940
<v Speaker 1>I suppose escape it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you about Freud.</v>

744
00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:22.774
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should give you a sense of Friday </v>

745
00:48:24.231 --> 00:48:25.064
<v Speaker 1>and psychopathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very difficult thing </v>

746
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.460
<v Speaker 1>otherwise to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a midterm.</v>

747
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Midterm is multiple choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll do it in class.</v>

748
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have lots of time to finish it.</v>

749
00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.670
<v Speaker 1>It'll cover the material that we took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We studied up to that point.</v>

750
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Then we're going to talk about Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers who was a humanist.</v>

751
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:46.503
<v Speaker 1>Rogers has a body centered philosophy I </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppose and he's interested as well in </v>

752
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:51.663
<v Speaker 1>optimal personal development and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>role that interpersonal communication </v>

753
00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:57.520
<v Speaker 1>plays in that Rogers hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

754
00:48:57.521 --> 00:49:01.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very interesting one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that honest communication between two</v>

755
00:49:01.961 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 1>people can produce personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

756
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.460
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

757
00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:07.294
<v Speaker 1>well you kind of know that already </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's something very engaging </v>

758
00:49:10.361 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 1>about a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest conversation where you're able to</v>

759
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:15.970
<v Speaker 1>say things that you wouldn't normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

760
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.373
<v Speaker 1>where you're being listened to by </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's actually listening to you </v>

761
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:20.554
<v Speaker 1>and you're listening to them and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation you're moving both of you </v>

762
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:24.663
<v Speaker 1>further to a different point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's different than a conversation </v>

763
00:49:27.371 --> 00:49:28.204
<v Speaker 1>where you're right and you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>convince me or I'm right and I'm trying </v>

764
00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:31.864
<v Speaker 1>to convince you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would say is the typical </v>

765
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:33.874
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

766
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:36.850
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the healing conversation is more,</v>

767
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with you?</v>

768
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:39.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing?</v>

769
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.930
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's your life going?</v>

770
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of problems are you facing?</v>

771
00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.593
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about those problems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you conceptualize what a solution </v>

772
00:49:46.571 --> 00:49:47.404
<v Speaker 1>might be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way we could figure out how </v>

773
00:49:48.521 --> 00:49:49.900
<v Speaker 1>to get there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

774
00:49:49.901 --> 00:49:50.291
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

775
00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:51.124
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem solving conversation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on the presupposition </v>

776
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:58.270
<v Speaker 1>that the person that you're conversing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with has the capacity to grow.</v>

777
00:49:58.271 --> 00:50:00.580
<v Speaker 1>In a positive direction if they so </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose.</v>

778
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fundamental presupposition of</v>

779
00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Rogerian psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May and Frankl are also humanists</v>

780
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.373
<v Speaker 1>all finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell you what the rest of the rest of </v>

781
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:14.680
<v Speaker 1>the material is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next time that we meet,</v>

782
00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I should show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let you know a little bit more about the</v>

783
00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:20.980
<v Speaker 1>structure of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second midterm is March 14th,</v>

784
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.720
<v Speaker 1>the and there's a final at the end as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

785
00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:28.090
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

786
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:28.923
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multiple choice tests are graded in </v>

787
00:50:30.791 --> 00:50:35.080
<v Speaker 1>that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>25% 25% in 27.5%.</v>

788
00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:36.243
<v Speaker 1>They're not cumulative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each test only covers what you covered </v>

789
00:50:39.821 --> 00:50:41.650
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the last test,</v>

790
00:50:41.651 --> 00:50:42.484
<v Speaker 1>including the final,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be required to write an essay of </v>

791
00:50:44.951 --> 00:50:47.590
<v Speaker 1>15%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a thousand words,</v>

792
00:50:47.591 --> 00:50:49.510
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not 750 words.</v>

793
00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.710
<v Speaker 1>And you'll also do an online exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a personality analysis,</v>

794
00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pass fail.</v>

795
00:50:56.621 --> 00:50:59.440
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is complete it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>show proof of completion.</v>

796
00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:04.300
<v Speaker 1>It helps you do a modified big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis of your own personality,</v>

797
00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.540
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on your virtues and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>faults.</v>

798
00:51:07.541 --> 00:51:09.460
<v Speaker 1>So that so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's uh,</v>

799
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:10.743
<v Speaker 1>it's an active exercise in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>application of personality theory to </v>

800
00:51:14.741 --> 00:51:17.560
<v Speaker 1>personal development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the,</v>

801
00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:20.470
<v Speaker 1>that's the structure of the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

802
00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you</v>

803
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:28.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a signup sheet on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the syllabus.</v>

804
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:30.583
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've broken the essays down into </v>

805
00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:33.800
<v Speaker 1>multiple types across the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>semester.</v>

806
00:51:33.801 --> 00:51:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I would highly recommend that you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and sign up.</v>

807
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:40.670
<v Speaker 1>There are limited slots for each topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

808
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:41.773
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my ta to have to grade 200 </v>

809
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:43.994
<v Speaker 1>essays the last week of classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to spread them out across the </v>

810
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.533
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So figure out a topic and sign up </v>

811
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:51.523
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And please do that sooner rather than </v>

812
00:51:52.851 --> 00:51:53.660
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

813
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:57.530
<v Speaker 1>it's an industrious thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll help you organize yourself.</v>

814
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll post something that's quite useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to write,</v>

815
00:52:01.191 --> 00:52:02.024
<v Speaker 1>especially a thousand word essay and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll close the essays are due one day </v>

816
00:52:07.161 --> 00:52:08.510
<v Speaker 1>before class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

817
00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:09.740
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

818
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:13.280
<v Speaker 1>by telling you who shouldn't take this </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

819
00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

820
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:19.730
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't like this lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then don't take this course because this</v>

821
00:52:19.731 --> 00:52:21.440
<v Speaker 1>is what the lectures are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

822
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not for everybody.</v>

823
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:25.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use a lot of loose associations and </v>

824
00:52:27.921 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 1>try to gather them back in and I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wander around that way.</v>

825
00:52:32.121 --> 00:52:34.430
<v Speaker 1>I can talk directly to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I liked doing,</v>

826
00:52:34.431 --> 00:52:37.340
<v Speaker 1>but I sacrifice a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization for that.</v>

827
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.790
<v Speaker 1>But my stance is that it's worth the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>

828
00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:46.180
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading a lot and a lot of it is,</v>

829
00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say a lot of it's hard science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last half in particular,</v>

830
00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:55.040
<v Speaker 1>but the first half of a lot of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical in nature,</v>

831
00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:56.030
<v Speaker 1>philosophical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slash,</v>

832
00:52:56.031 --> 00:52:59.960
<v Speaker 1>psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not interested in that,</v>

833
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.033
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a pure science type and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not interested in the clinical </v>

834
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:06.104
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say have personality and in the end in </v>

835
00:53:08.501 --> 00:53:09.334
<v Speaker 1>investigating the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>underpinnings of those clinical </v>

836
00:53:11.961 --> 00:53:12.794
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would say this isn't the course </v>

837
00:53:13.791 --> 00:53:14.624
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you should take that seriously </v>

838
00:53:16.731 --> 00:53:17.564
<v Speaker 1>because the readings are hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of work involved in this </v>

839
00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:20.384
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be better if you took a </v>

840
00:53:22.101 --> 00:53:25.250
<v Speaker 1>course that you actually wanted to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

841
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.633
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to psychology to 30 and we'll </v>

842
00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:29.334
<v Speaker 1>see you in a bit.</v>
