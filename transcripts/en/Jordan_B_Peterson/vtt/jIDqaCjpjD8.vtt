1
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Kennedy,</v>

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>this is ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war and violence have always been with</v>

3
00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first murder took place between the</v>

4
00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.580
<v Speaker 1>first humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel,</v>

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.710
<v Speaker 1>in that legacy of destroying ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and each other has come down to us from</v>

6
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>the very beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The creation story reminds us as much</v>

7
00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:25.300
<v Speaker 1>about our tragic weakness as it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>about our infinite potential.</v>

8
00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 1>As humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Che loss is transformed into order by</v>

9
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:33.340
<v Speaker 1>the word and you are all speakers of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

10
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.820
<v Speaker 1>and if you want chaos to be transformed</v>
<v Speaker 1>into hell,</v>

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.570
<v Speaker 1>then lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want chaos to be transformed into</v>

12
00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:45.571
<v Speaker 1>heaven and tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to look at violence and war as</v>

13
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:49.570
<v Speaker 1>anomalies of human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's clearly something else going</v>

14
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the meaning of the Columbine and</v>

15
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Sandy Hook school massacres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bus bombings in Jerusalem,</v>

16
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>the Charlie Hebdo killings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we think politics can explain</v>

17
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:06.481
<v Speaker 1>these things or a kind of madness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what else might be behind such</v>

18
00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:11.701
<v Speaker 1>senseless acts acts that achieve no goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the universal sadness of what the</v>

19
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>human condition you can sweep underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bed.</v>

20
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go out and wave a</v>
<v Speaker 1>placard around.</v>

21
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm against poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

22
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>who's for poverty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you want to fix the world 65.</v>

23
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot harder than you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 1>It says in the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to rule yourself than to</v>

25
00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>rule the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>

26
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out you're more complicated</v>

27
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>than a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also turns out that you're more</v>

28
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>important in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city,</v>

29
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson is a professor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology at the University of Toronto</v>

30
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.210
<v Speaker 1>and a clinical psychologist at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stratford Festival.</v>

31
00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:50.530
<v Speaker 1>He explored some of these questions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in today's program we'll hear the talk</v>

32
00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 1>he gave and the conversation I had with</v>
<v Speaker 1>him afterwards.</v>

33
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's a history of violence.</v>

34
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>If you do a genuine psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of the human thirst for war,</v>

35
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 2>you can't entertain a more brutal topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of the reason that people don't</v>

36
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 2>understand it is because you really</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to understand it.</v>

37
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 2>So despite that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to use a case history today.</v>

38
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to illustrate the state of mind that you</v>

39
00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:37.191
<v Speaker 2>have to occupy in order to be willing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ready to commit any atrocity that</v>

40
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 2>might be demanded of you under any</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances whatsoever.</v>

41
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 2>The best way to think about the human</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirst for war,</v>

42
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 2>at least at the level of analysis that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm capable of,</v>

43
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 2>is to think about it as a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of the states of mind that</v>

44
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 2>possesses us can be reasonably thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>of as a personality,</v>

45
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 2>so if you're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

46
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 2>you can think of yourself as possessed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by aries or Mars' who's the god of war,</v>

47
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 2>or if you're hopelessly in love with</v>
<v Speaker 2>making a fool of yourself,</v>

48
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>well then you're possessed by arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir cupid or Venus,</v>

49
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 2>and that really is how archaic people</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre scientific people viewed the</v>

50
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 2>proclivity of people to occupy states of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind that were quite different than</v>

51
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 2>those that were characteristic of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal personality.</v>

52
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Freud really capitalized on that idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>and modernized it in some sense because</v>

53
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Freud viewed the human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as in some sense,</v>

54
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>a loosely united collection of</v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonalities.</v>

55
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 2>We don't tend to conceptualize states of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind anymore</v>

56
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>as personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in the scientific literature,</v>

57
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 2>but we do all the time in literature and</v>
<v Speaker 2>drama and movies</v>

58
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of representation is</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily compelling,</v>

59
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll pay to watch it and it is very</v>

60
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 2>strange if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if the specter of pure</v>

61
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 2>destructiveness is laid out in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you on a stage,</v>

62
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 2>there is no logical reason to assume</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would voluntarily expose</v>

63
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 2>yourself to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that and pay for the privilege of</v>

64
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 2>doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do and the reason for that.</v>

65
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.830
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons for that is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to know what that personality is,</v>

66
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 2>partly so you can recognize elements of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it if they manifest themselves in front</v>

67
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:51.841
<v Speaker 2>of you or within you and partly because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really can't understand good</v>

68
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 2>until you understand evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you're ever wondering why</v>

69
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 2>white good itself seems to be such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited resource.</v>

70
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.590
<v Speaker 2>It's worthwhile remembering that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get there without going somewhere.</v>

71
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's where we're going to go</v>

72
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start with a shakespearian</v>

73
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 2>quote seems appropriate from Titus</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andronicus,</v>

74
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 2>which is a very violent play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It play that's essentially about</v>

75
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 2>vengeance and one of Shakespeare's</v>
<v Speaker 2>characters says,</v>

76
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.710
<v Speaker 2>why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am no baby.</v>

77
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 2>I that with base prayers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should repent the evils.</v>

78
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I have done 10,000 worst that ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet I did.</v>

79
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Would I perform if I might have my will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if one good deed in all my life I did.</v>

80
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I do repent it from my very soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the sort of thing that you want</v>

81
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 2>to hear someone say to you.</v>

82
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.770
<v Speaker 2>We look for reasons why people might be</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated to commit atrocious acts and</v>

83
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 2>given our cultural standpoint at</v>
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>

84
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 2>we're often looking for sociological</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

85
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which does not read violence by the way,</v>

86
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 2>relative poverty which does lack of</v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

87
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We very seldom consider intent or</v>

88
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:40.661
<v Speaker 2>voluntary intent because the idea is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people could voluntarily and</v>

89
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 2>consciously intend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Destructiveness is a very frightening</v>

90
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you realize that if</v>

91
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 2>people could do that to the degree that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a person,</v>

92
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.620
<v Speaker 2>you could also do that and understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people could do that and that you</v>

93
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 2>could means that you might be morally</v>
<v Speaker 2>obliged</v>

94
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 2>to undertake a very thorough examination</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the motives for your own behavior.</v>

95
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 2>The personality that I want to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about today,</v>

96
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.490
<v Speaker 2>it's composed of a downward spiral and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's why people,</v>

97
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 2>people have always envisioned hail in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense as a bottomless pit of hell</v>

98
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 2>is a bottomless pit because no matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>how bad it is,</v>

99
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.640
<v Speaker 2>there's some stupid thing you can do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it worse and so the spiraling is</v>

100
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 2>indicative of a positive feedback loop</v>
<v Speaker 2>where a causes B and b causes c and then</v>

101
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 2>c causes a and everything moves out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

102
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.380
<v Speaker 2>The case study that I want to present to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you today is one of the more literate of</v>

103
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 2>the columbine killers whose name was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric Harris.</v>

104
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 2>People wonder why the mass shooters do</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do,</v>

105
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 2>which in some sense it's quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprising to me because if you read</v>

106
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 2>what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell you why they do what they do.</v>

107
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why people don't believe that is not</v>

108
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 2>clear to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except that I think that if you do take</v>

109
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 2>them at their word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raises all sorts of specters that we</v>

110
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:26.111
<v Speaker 2>would rather have hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric Harris became possessed,</v>

111
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of just own free choice by a personality</v>

112
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>that was composed of ideological</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigidity,</v>

113
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 2>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment,</v>

114
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 2>deception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vengefulness.</v>

115
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to read you some of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>comments about government systems.</v>

116
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Here's Harris's comments with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological rigidity like the early Nazi</v>

117
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brain is like a sponge,</v>

118
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:59.490
<v Speaker 2>sucking up everything that sounds cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>and leaving out all that is worthless.</v>

119
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>That's how nazi-ism was formed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I will be to Hitler and his</v>

120
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boys messed up a few times and it costs</v>

121
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 2>him the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love their beliefs and who they</v>

122
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they did and what they wanted.</v>

123
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I love the Nazis too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

124
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I can't get enough of the swastika,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the SS and the Iron Cross.</v>

125
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not that he didn't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis.</v>

126
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 2>He understood them perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever else you might say about Eric</v>

127
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.763
<v Speaker 2>Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't stupid.</v>

128
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Pride people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>

129
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 2>cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God teachers telling me what to do.</v>

130
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.621
<v Speaker 2>Think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

131
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 2>act and everything else just makes me</v>
<v Speaker 2>not want to do it.</v>

132
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.940
<v Speaker 2>That's why my nickname is rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rab Actually no one is worthy of</v>

133
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 2>anything unless I say they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like God,</v>

134
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was having everyone being</v>
<v Speaker 2>officially lower than me already know</v>

135
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:55.410
<v Speaker 2>that I'm higher than almost anyone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world in terms of universal</v>

136
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel ever more confident,</v>

137
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:02.010
<v Speaker 2>stronger and more godlike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I have confidence in my ability to</v>

138
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 2>see people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have thought too much,</v>

139
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 2>relies too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>found out too much,</v>

140
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.990
<v Speaker 2>and I'm too self aware to just stop what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am thinking and go back to society</v>

141
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.110
<v Speaker 2>because what I do and think isn't right</v>
<v Speaker 2>or morally accepted.</v>

142
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

143
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.110
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would sooner die than betrayed my own</v>

144
00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 2>thoughts before I leave this worthless</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

145
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I will kill whoever I deemed unfit for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything at all.</v>

146
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.060
<v Speaker 2>This is from paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lost</v>

147
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.370
<v Speaker 2>the great poem by John Milton.</v>

148
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 2>These are the words that he puts into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mouth of Satan after he's flung from</v>

149
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:47.640
<v Speaker 2>heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for daring to oppose and attempt to</v>

150
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:52.641
<v Speaker 2>transcend the most high as his desire</v>
<v Speaker 2>was not only to be light God,</v>

151
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:57.891
<v Speaker 2>but to be superior to God and in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense he's assembled in some very</v>

152
00:10:58.051 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 2>important sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a symbol or a representation you</v>

153
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:05.511
<v Speaker 2>could say which is more accurate of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate intellectual pride which says</v>

154
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 2>everything I know is sufficient and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing transcendent beyond</v>

155
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:15.390
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milton has Satan say farewell,</v>

156
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:20.160
<v Speaker 2>happy fields where joy forever dwells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hail horrors,</v>

157
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.180
<v Speaker 2>hail infernal world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Thou profoundest.</v>

158
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Hail received the I knew possessor,</v>

159
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.960
<v Speaker 2>one who brings a mind not to be changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by place or time</v>

160
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.820
<v Speaker 2>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed in my clinical practice</v>

161
00:11:38.821 --> 00:11:43.821
<v Speaker 2>that there are two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three character logical elements that</v>

162
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.620
<v Speaker 2>really do people in and weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not really listed in the</v>

163
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric list of diagnosis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're often also not discussed as</v>

164
00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 2>causal elements in the genesis of mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>illness and suffering.</v>

165
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Even though in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually the primary causes</v>

166
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.630
<v Speaker 2>arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I already know enough</v>

167
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 2>deceit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I can twist the fabric of</v>

168
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:17.341
<v Speaker 2>reality in my favor for my individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants and I can get away with it,</v>

169
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 2>which goes along with pride and</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrogance and then resentment,</v>

170
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 2>which is the world is tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is of course true.</v>

171
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 2>The world is unjust and tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more debatable and the</v>

172
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:38.131
<v Speaker 2>injustice and tragedy of the world is</v>
<v Speaker 2>aimed at me specifically and unfairly.</v>

173
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just not true at all.</v>

174
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate you people for leaving me out of</v>

175
00:12:45.011 --> 00:12:47.530
<v Speaker 2>so many fun things and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't say,</v>

176
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your fault because if it isn't</v>

177
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.920
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People had my phone number and I asked</v>

178
00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:54.581
<v Speaker 2>and all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

179
00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:55.414
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

180
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Don't let the weird looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric kid come along.</v>

181
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you people could have shown more</v>

182
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:03.250
<v Speaker 2>respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treated me better,</v>

183
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:08.230
<v Speaker 2>asked for my knowledge or guidance more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Treated me more like a senior and maybe</v>

184
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have been as ready to carry</v>
<v Speaker 2>your heads off.</v>

185
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Milton again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paradise Lost Has Satan say.</v>

186
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 2>The more I see pleasures about me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much more,</v>

187
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:24.400
<v Speaker 2>I feel torment within me as from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hateful siege of contraries.</v>

188
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.770
<v Speaker 2>All good to me becomes Bain and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven,</v>

189
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 2>much worse would be my state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but neither here seek.</v>

190
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I Know Norton Heaven to dwell and less</v>
<v Speaker 2>by mastering is heaven supreme,</v>

191
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:43.650
<v Speaker 2>nor hope to be myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less miserable by what I seek,</v>

192
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.950
<v Speaker 2>but others to make such as I though</v>
<v Speaker 2>thereby worse to me.</v>

193
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Redound for only in destroying do I find</v>
<v Speaker 2>ease to my relentless thoughts.</v>

194
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Eric Harris again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then again,</v>

195
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I have always hated how I looked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make fun of people who look like me</v>

196
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:04.240
<v Speaker 2>sometimes without even thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes just because I want to rip on</v>

197
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:07.090
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where a lot of hate grows from.</v>

198
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.010
<v Speaker 2>This is Richard three from Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard,</v>

199
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.310
<v Speaker 2>the third eye shall despair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no creature,</v>

200
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:17.290
<v Speaker 2>loves me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if I die,</v>

201
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:19.650
<v Speaker 2>no soul will pity me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Name,</v>

202
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 2>wherefore should they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since that I myself find in myself,</v>

203
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.300
<v Speaker 2>no pity to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deception.</v>

204
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what I feel like telling about</v>
<v Speaker 2>lies.</v>

205
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I lie a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost constantly and to everybody just</v>

206
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 2>to keep my own ass out of the water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

207
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:41.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm doing this for</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention as some people may think.</v>

208
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are some big lies I've told?</v>

209
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped smoking.</v>

210
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry for doing it.</v>

211
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Not for getting caught.</v>

212
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been making more bombs.</v>

213
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that,</v>

214
00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>and of course countless other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

215
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 2>I know that I hate liars and I am one</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

216
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's okay if I'm a hypocrite,</v>

217
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.870
<v Speaker 2>but no one else because I'm higher than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you people.</v>

218
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 2>No matter what you say and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>disagree,</v>

219
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.970
<v Speaker 2>I would shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take the personality elements</v>

220
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:20.210
<v Speaker 2>that we've already discussed and you mix</v>
<v Speaker 2>them up and you let them run as a</v>

221
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the positive feedback loop that</v>

222
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I was describing earlier and it goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like this and I learned this</v>

223
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:32.240
<v Speaker 2>in part from the analysis of the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Cain and Abel in Genesis.</v>

224
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 2>The first story about real human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the story about Cain and Abel because</v>

225
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Adam and eve were made by God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

226
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 2>So you know you can't really call them</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal humans.</v>

227
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Cain and Abel are the first humans and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain is very resentful and deceitful and</v>

228
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.370
<v Speaker 2>vengeful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that,</v>

229
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 2>which it's clearly explained in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

230
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:59.330
<v Speaker 2>is that cane sacrifices aren't accepted</v>
<v Speaker 2>by God.</v>

231
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Now it's hard for modern people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what a sacrifice is because</v>

232
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:07.850
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you offer up to God some</v>

233
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:13.130
<v Speaker 2>remnant of an animal for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know people along while back</v>

234
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:17.750
<v Speaker 2>acted things out before they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand them and they had a more</v>

235
00:16:17.751 --> 00:16:20.870
<v Speaker 2>concrete view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they assume God was in the cosmos</v>

236
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 2>because if you look up in the night sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's dark,</v>

237
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:26.360
<v Speaker 2>it overwhelms you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the transcendent and the</v>

238
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 2>infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's the sensation and experience</v>

239
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:34.781
<v Speaker 2>of that that allows for the attributes</v>
<v Speaker 2>of God and his dwelling place to the</v>

240
00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 2>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's not so ridiculous because you</v>

241
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:40.220
<v Speaker 2>do see the infinite when you're out</v>
<v Speaker 2>under this guy at night in the dark,</v>

242
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.550
<v Speaker 2>and if God's up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since smoke rises,</v>

243
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.050
<v Speaker 2>if you burn something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

244
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:48.410
<v Speaker 2>God can tell if what you're offering is</v>
<v Speaker 2>of quality or not.</v>

245
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Now we have the psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent,</v>

246
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked my students,</v>

247
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:58.760
<v Speaker 2>what sacrifices did your parents make so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could go to university and of</v>

248
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:03.761
<v Speaker 2>course they can answer that in no time</v>
<v Speaker 2>flat and whether that sacrifice work</v>

249
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.590
<v Speaker 2>depends on how well the child does at</v>
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>

250
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.670
<v Speaker 2>but what that essentially means is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sacrifice of the parents found</v>

251
00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:13.070
<v Speaker 2>favor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well with reality,</v>

252
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:18.160
<v Speaker 2>but you can substitute God for that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>no loss of meaning and so modern people</v>

253
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.380
<v Speaker 2>obviously believe that if you sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

254
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.150
<v Speaker 2>then reality will shine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's benevolent face on you.</v>

255
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise we wouldn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're not so different from those</v>

256
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 2>archaic people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

257
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Cain make sacrifices and God doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like them.</v>

258
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Now the story's a bit in bivalent about</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it might just be the gods arbitrary.</v>

259
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no shortage of arbitrary ness on</v>

260
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>the part of God.</v>

261
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.450
<v Speaker 2>In the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the reason that people</v>

262
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:50.580
<v Speaker 2>have modern people have with that book</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they say,</v>

263
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:53.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could never believe in a god who's</v>

264
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:58.450
<v Speaker 2>that arbitrary or even cruel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ancient Israelites weren't that</v>

265
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:02.160
<v Speaker 2>foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew that life could be that</v>

266
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:04.350
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary and cruel no matter what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe,</v>

267
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.800
<v Speaker 2>so they took me that God just has it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>for cane or it could be the cane is just</v>

268
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.240
<v Speaker 2>not really offering up the best quality</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifices and so he's trying to pull</v>

269
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:17.970
<v Speaker 2>one over on God and everyone else and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>

270
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 2>that is what God accuses him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you read the story very carefully,</v>

271
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Cain is mad because ables getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and everyone loves able.</v>

272
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Lots of crops is flocks are flourishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the girls love him.</v>

273
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Plus he's a really good guy so you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even hate him with good conscience,</v>

274
00:18:37.531 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 2>which is extremely annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially to cane.</v>

275
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.460
<v Speaker 2>So king goes and has a chat with God and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

276
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.740
<v Speaker 2>what kind of stupid place if you made</v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

277
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.120
<v Speaker 2>It means reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like working myself to the bone and</v>

278
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I get is the dregs and then there's</v>

279
00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 2>old able out there and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything he touches turns to gold.</v>

280
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.600
<v Speaker 2>What's up with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of arrogant if you think</v>

281
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:04.111
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

282
00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Because he is talking to God after all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't clear that cane understands</v>

283
00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:11.970
<v Speaker 2>everything about being and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>always the possibility that it's keynes.</v>

284
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could not gods,</v>

285
00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:18.381
<v Speaker 2>but that isn't a hypothesis that Kayden</v>
<v Speaker 2>is willing to entertain.</v>

286
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:24.710
<v Speaker 2>So God says to him basically sin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means to miss the Bullseye by the</v>

287
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:28.970
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crouches at your doorstep like a</v>

288
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.980
<v Speaker 2>predatory and sexually aroused hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>cat and you invited in and let it have</v>

289
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:41.751
<v Speaker 2>its way with you by which he means not</v>
<v Speaker 2>only is cain attacked by sin,</v>

290
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.340
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a creative union sort of</v>

291
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sin Comes in and Caine plays with it,</v>

292
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.760
<v Speaker 2>develops it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and puts his own twist on it,</v>

293
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.570
<v Speaker 2>produces something new out of it.</v>

294
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.510
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious decay and that God isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to take responsibility for the</v>

295
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 2>terrible state of being as a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this accusation and that makes them</v>

296
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 2>extremely mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely mad,</v>

297
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:13.070
<v Speaker 2>and he kills Abel and then if you follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story closely,</v>

298
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:17.790
<v Speaker 2>you can see that God tells everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 2>to leave cane alone,</v>

299
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:18.601
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't kill him,</v>

300
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:22.290
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a propensity for that kind of vengeful</v>

301
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:25.650
<v Speaker 2>killing to expand exponentially out into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the community,</v>

302
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 2>which in fact is what happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story of Cain and Abel and the end,</v>

303
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last one of canes,</v>

304
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:36.561
<v Speaker 2>descendance named is actually to bull</v>
<v Speaker 2>cane and he is by tradition the first</v>

305
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:41.970
<v Speaker 2>person who makes weapons of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that individual</v>

306
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:47.030
<v Speaker 2>resentment manifested as homicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rage is the precondition for the spread</v>

307
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 3>of that mode of being into the broader</v>
<v Speaker 3>community and the danger there is that</v>

308
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 3>will degenerate into</v>

309
00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.990
<v Speaker 2>everyone against everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris</v>

310
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.170
<v Speaker 3>moral is just another word and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

311
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.380
<v Speaker 3>I think we are all a waste of natural</v>
<v Speaker 3>resources and should be killed off and</v>

312
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.910
<v Speaker 3>since humans have the ability to choose</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm human,</v>

313
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.870
<v Speaker 3>I think I will choose to kill and damage</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as nature allows me,</v>

314
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.280
<v Speaker 3>so take that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat Napalm and lead someone's bound to</v>

315
00:21:17.281 --> 00:21:18.960
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were they thinking when we go</v>

316
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.810
<v Speaker 3>natural born killers or when we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>planning it,</v>

317
00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:25.980
<v Speaker 3>so this is what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a goal to destroy as much as</v>

318
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.890
<v Speaker 3>possible so I must not be sidetracked by</v>
<v Speaker 3>my feelings of sympathy,</v>

319
00:21:28.891 --> 00:21:30.000
<v Speaker 3>mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or any of that.</v>

320
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Keep this in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to burn the world</v>

321
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.190
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason that Cain killed Abel</v>

322
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.900
<v Speaker 2>because Abel is favored by God</v>

323
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.480
<v Speaker 3>and so Kane is actually not only taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>revenge against Abel and against his own</v>

324
00:21:44.641 --> 00:21:49.620
<v Speaker 3>insufficiency and to get suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's actually taking revenge against God</v>

325
00:21:49.621 --> 00:21:53.460
<v Speaker 3>and being itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's actually what he wants to do.</v>

326
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm full of hate and I love it.</v>

327
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.690
<v Speaker 3>I want to grab some weak little freshmen</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tear them apart like a wolf.</v>

328
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.030
<v Speaker 3>Show them who's God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strangled them,</v>

329
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.670
<v Speaker 3>squash their head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bite their temples into the skull,</v>

330
00:22:05.671 --> 00:22:08.140
<v Speaker 3>rip off their jaw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rip off their collarbones,</v>

331
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.240
<v Speaker 3>break their arms in half and twist them</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the lovely sounds of bones</v>

332
00:22:12.241 --> 00:22:16.530
<v Speaker 3>cracking and flesh ripping so much to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so little chance.</v>

333
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.380
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a torch and level everything in</v>

334
00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:22.170
<v Speaker 3>this whole area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but bonds of that size are hard to make</v>

335
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.950
<v Speaker 3>and plus I would need a fully loaded</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

336
00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:27.660
<v Speaker 3>10 to get every store on Wadsworth and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the buildings downtown.</v>

337
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Picture half of Denver on fire just for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and vodka.</v>

338
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Who was his partner?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Napalm on sides of skyscrapers and car</v>

339
00:22:35.941 --> 00:22:38.310
<v Speaker 3>garages blowing up from exploded gas</v>
<v Speaker 3>tanks.</v>

340
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be beautiful.</v>

341
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The human race is still indeed doomed.</v>

342
00:22:44.251 --> 00:22:46.260
<v Speaker 3>It just needs a few kickstarters like</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

343
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.020
<v Speaker 3>If I can tell you a few cities off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>map,</v>

344
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.290
<v Speaker 2>then great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you recall your history,</v>

345
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.280
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis came up with a final solution</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Jewish problem.</v>

346
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Killed them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

347
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.530
<v Speaker 2>in case you haven't figured it out yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say kill mankind.</v>

348
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.740
<v Speaker 2>No one should survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll close this briefcase history</v>

349
00:23:10.531 --> 00:23:15.531
<v Speaker 2>with a quote from Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Faust and faust.</v>

350
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.900
<v Speaker 2>The figure of Satan is played by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mephistopheles and Memphis coffees in</v>

351
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.770
<v Speaker 2>girth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This formulation is a very arrogant</v>

352
00:23:28.771 --> 00:23:33.771
<v Speaker 2>intellect and he has a credo which is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the articulated formulation of the</v>

353
00:23:37.261 --> 00:23:42.261
<v Speaker 2>values that he lives by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spirit I that endlessly denies and</v>

354
00:23:45.111 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 2>rightly to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all that comes to birth,</v>

355
00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:51.190
<v Speaker 2>is fit for overthrow as nothing worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherefore.</v>

356
00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:56.220
<v Speaker 2>The world were better sterilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all that's here is evil,</v>

357
00:23:57.321 --> 00:24:02.321
<v Speaker 2>recognized is gained to me and downfall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rude and sin.</v>

358
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.890
<v Speaker 2>The very element type prosper in</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can see in that the actuality,</v>

359
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.370
<v Speaker 2>the actuality is not only what Harris</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote and meant,</v>

360
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:19.540
<v Speaker 2>but also what he did and what he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>planning to do,</v>

361
00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:22.660
<v Speaker 2>which was much more destructive than</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he actually managed.</v>

362
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:29.100
<v Speaker 2>You see his state of possession by a set</v>
<v Speaker 2>of infinitely destructive desires and</v>

363
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.500
<v Speaker 2>wishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you see the continual representation</v>

364
00:24:35.501 --> 00:24:40.501
<v Speaker 2>of that pattern of action and thought in</v>
<v Speaker 2>literature that's evil versus good.</v>

365
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Classically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the world is.</v>

366
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what the cosmos is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a place where evil and good</v>

367
00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:54.921
<v Speaker 2>continually battle eternally battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and although we don't believe in such</v>

368
00:24:55.591 --> 00:24:59.520
<v Speaker 2>things anymore or more accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what we believe,</v>

369
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:05.180
<v Speaker 2>we still are inclined to watch that</v>
<v Speaker 2>drama present itself on stage in endless</v>

370
00:25:06.301 --> 00:25:11.301
<v Speaker 2>variations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is that it's</v>

371
00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:17.831
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't understand the human capacity</v>

372
00:25:18.871 --> 00:25:23.871
<v Speaker 2>and desire for atrocity without viewing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it through a metaphysical lens.</v>

373
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:31.150
<v Speaker 2>You can't understand someone like Eric</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris or the countless others who are</v>

374
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:32.870
<v Speaker 2>possessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

375
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:37.871
<v Speaker 2>in exactly the manner that he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>without using dramatic or religious</v>

376
00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:43.751
<v Speaker 2>language because you cannot formulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>either the question or the answer with</v>

377
00:25:44.961 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 2>enough profundity without that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

378
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that the motives that</v>

379
00:25:52.941 --> 00:25:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I've discussed constitute the only</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons for the human thirst for war,</v>

380
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you that you'll never</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the desire for atrocity</v>

381
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.410
<v Speaker 2>without coming to grips with the problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>of evil.</v>

382
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.063
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

383
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

384
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Your listening to ideas in Canada on CBC</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>

385
00:26:20.491 --> 00:26:25.491
<v Speaker 1>one on Sirius xm across North America</v>
<v Speaker 1>and around the world on CBC dot Ca.</v>

386
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm Paul Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that drives us to violence?</v>

387
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Murder and war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are some of the most puzzling</v>

388
00:26:34.411 --> 00:26:38.730
<v Speaker 1>corners of the human personality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the help of William Shakespeare and</v>

389
00:26:38.731 --> 00:26:42.420
<v Speaker 1>John Milton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist Jordan Peterson has been</v>

390
00:26:42.421 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 1>exploring mind of murder,</v>

391
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 5>specifically the mind of columbine</v>
<v Speaker 5>killer,</v>

392
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 5>Eric Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a history of violence in time</v>

393
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 5>now for my conversation with Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peterson and for some audience</v>

394
00:26:55.891 --> 00:26:58.620
<v Speaker 5>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to begin,</v>

395
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.710
<v Speaker 5>I guess sort of where you began and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd never heard the words of Eric Harris</v>

396
00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 5>before and I have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I found them chilling.</v>

397
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.823
<v Speaker 5>Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 5>frightening.</v>

398
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.590
<v Speaker 5>It was interesting though to then here</v>
<v Speaker 5>you quote and it had the,</v>

399
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.190
<v Speaker 5>the quotations so opposite and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>perfect.</v>

400
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.660
<v Speaker 5>Matching a quoting from Milton and</v>
<v Speaker 5>quoting from paradise lost,</v>

401
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.840
<v Speaker 5>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

402
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 5>my undergraduate memory of studying that</v>
<v Speaker 5>masterpiece.</v>

403
00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>

404
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 5>and I think this is a school of critical</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought as well.</v>

405
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.020
<v Speaker 5>Milton apparently liked to Satan more</v>
<v Speaker 5>than he liked any of the other</v>

406
00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:36.220
<v Speaker 5>characters in that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that word,</v>

407
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 5>the modern interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would that be modern and what do you</v>

408
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:40.420
<v Speaker 5>mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

409
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.253
<v Speaker 5>because</v>

410
00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Milton was a genius and the way he</v>
<v Speaker 3>represented Satan in paradise lost was</v>

411
00:27:47.091 --> 00:27:52.091
<v Speaker 3>as at a rebel and he didn't paint them</v>
<v Speaker 3>in black and white,</v>

412
00:27:54.081 --> 00:27:56.420
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave him all the attributes than an</v>

413
00:27:56.421 --> 00:28:01.421
<v Speaker 3>admirable rebel would have and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy identifying with the figure of the</v>

414
00:28:02.571 --> 00:28:06.740
<v Speaker 3>admirable rebel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's what Satan was rebelling</v>

415
00:28:06.741 --> 00:28:09.740
<v Speaker 3>against,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't what an admirable rebel would</v>

416
00:28:09.741 --> 00:28:12.320
<v Speaker 3>rebel against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't rebelling the way Christ say.</v>

417
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Rick rebelled in his time against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>increasing tendency of the religious</v>

418
00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:22.940
<v Speaker 3>state to become dogmatic and tyrannical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Satan was rebelling against the idea</v>

419
00:28:22.941 --> 00:28:27.080
<v Speaker 3>that there was something that exceeded</v>
<v Speaker 3>his power and that was transcendent.</v>

420
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings do that all the time,</v>

421
00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:32.810
<v Speaker 3>especially modern human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that that Satan's and</v>

422
00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:36.440
<v Speaker 3>admirable character I think can't be</v>
<v Speaker 3>placed at Milton Street.</v>

423
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.340
<v Speaker 3>He opened the door to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation and that's a good thing</v>

424
00:28:40.341 --> 00:28:42.080
<v Speaker 3>because part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

425
00:28:42.081 --> 00:28:46.760
<v Speaker 3>the reason that these modes of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so powerful and compelling to</v>

426
00:28:46.761 --> 00:28:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Harris was that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

427
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:53.680
<v Speaker 3>they allowed him the possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 3>construing himself as an admirable</v>

428
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.680
<v Speaker 3>rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though what he was was</v>

429
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:03.710
<v Speaker 3>a momentary embodiment of the eternal</v>
<v Speaker 3>desire to obliterate everything,</v>

430
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.820
<v Speaker 5>and those are characters that exist to</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eric Harris,</v>

431
00:29:07.821 --> 00:29:09.450
<v Speaker 5>his little lone pair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he had to.</v>

432
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.100
<v Speaker 5>He had partners in Columbine.</v>

433
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:16.340
<v Speaker 3>He has admiral admires on the web of no</v>
<v Speaker 3>small number and not only does he exist</v>

434
00:29:17.241 --> 00:29:19.670
<v Speaker 3>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he also exists in here,</v>

435
00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:24.470
<v Speaker 3>like the thing that he represents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that he embodied is not.</v>

436
00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.900
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a permanent element of the human</v>

437
00:29:26.901 --> 00:29:29.930
<v Speaker 3>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in a radical,</v>

438
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:32.240
<v Speaker 3>it's eternal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's architectural,</v>

439
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.200
<v Speaker 3>it's structural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and why it's structural.</v>

440
00:29:36.201 --> 00:29:38.300
<v Speaker 3>It's Harris does a good job of</v>
<v Speaker 3>explaining.</v>

441
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knows that life is and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows that to exist is to suffer and one</v>

442
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 3>logical and appropriate response to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to be grateful in spite of your</v>

443
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 3>suffering and attempt to make the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it and perhaps to alleviate that</v>

444
00:29:56.981 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 3>where you can and another is to take the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective of Mephistopheles and to say</v>

445
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:02.561
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

446
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:04.360
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is flawed right from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>

447
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:10.080
<v Speaker 3>If this much suffering is the price of</v>
<v Speaker 3>being than we should just eradicate the</v>

448
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:15.661
<v Speaker 3>whole mess and people think like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

449
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you worked literally as an academic</v>

450
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.570
<v Speaker 3>professor of psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also have a practice here.</v>

451
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a clinical practice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any possible use for these</v>

452
00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 3>great icons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of Western or eastern?</v>

453
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:34.300
<v Speaker 3>Any literature which all have in them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

454
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:38.860
<v Speaker 3>the sort of balance or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or opposition of good and evil.</v>

455
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there any possible clinical use for</v>

456
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:42.430
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

457
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.350
<v Speaker 3>if you see people who are really in</v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble,</v>

458
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 3>like really in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't address their problems without</v>

459
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.090
<v Speaker 3>using architectural language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not possible.</v>

460
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.990
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a client who lived in a web of</v>

461
00:30:55.991 --> 00:31:00.991
<v Speaker 3>lies that was pretty much infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried for years to get to the bottom</v>

462
00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:02.410
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Familial lies.</v>

463
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.870
<v Speaker 3>The lie was we love you and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping you.</v>

464
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.390
<v Speaker 3>When the truth was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have been born a boy and</v>

465
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.260
<v Speaker 3>we've hated you ever since you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>born.</v>

466
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.470
<v Speaker 3>But we're not going to tell you that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not gonna.</v>

467
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Let anyone else know that because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>need a facade of benevolence now and for</v>

468
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:20.950
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person to even begin to understand</v>

469
00:31:20.951 --> 00:31:25.060
<v Speaker 3>what was going on in her family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no escaping archetipal</v>

470
00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:27.430
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was hellish.</v>

471
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.820
<v Speaker 3>People died in that house and I made</v>
<v Speaker 3>very little headway.</v>

472
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Every time I go to the bottom of some</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely horrendous betrayal,</v>

473
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.820
<v Speaker 3>betrayers we're in Dante's inferno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were right in the center of hell,</v>

474
00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:44.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were the worst of the criminals,</v>

475
00:31:44.391 --> 00:31:47.710
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd get to the bottom of some God awful</v>

476
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.380
<v Speaker 3>decades long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliantly played betrayal,</v>

477
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.490
<v Speaker 3>and there'd be another one at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

478
00:31:55.570 --> 00:32:00.570
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering specifically whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd actually used text in conversation</v>

479
00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.690
<v Speaker 3>with patients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would talk about foster,</v>

480
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of my patients have come from</v>

481
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:07.390
<v Speaker 3>religious backgrounds.</v>

482
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of them was a relatively</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsuccessful chaplain who was suddenly</v>

483
00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:17.050
<v Speaker 3>fired from her job and then was hit by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>

484
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Speaker 3>So that wasn't a good day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all in one day.</v>

485
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

486
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 3>And there was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no escaping the religious</v>

487
00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:27.220
<v Speaker 3>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

488
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:29.800
<v Speaker 3>the thing about religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the religious dimension sits at the</v>

489
00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:32.350
<v Speaker 3>bottom of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many people don't understand that.</v>

490
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 3>They think it's a set of superstitions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's not a set of</v>

491
00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:37.030
<v Speaker 3>superstitions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or if it is,</v>

492
00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:38.100
<v Speaker 3>then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

493
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:42.770
<v Speaker 3>why do you continue to go see it played</v>
<v Speaker 3>out time and time again on stage?</v>

494
00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 3>What are you just entertaining yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're not.</v>

495
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Whether you know it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're educating yourself.</v>

496
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.330
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing near archetipal</v>
<v Speaker 3>representations of the structural</v>

497
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:58.331
<v Speaker 3>elements of human behavior laid out for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you by geniuses dramatically and part of</v>

498
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:04.160
<v Speaker 3>the reason that you get the information</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way is that you're not smart enough</v>

499
00:33:04.161 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 3>to understand it abstractly and neither</v>
<v Speaker 3>is anyone else.</v>

500
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:13.930
<v Speaker 3>It's so complicated that even now all we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can really do is see it played out.</v>

501
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult for us to transform</v>
<v Speaker 3>that into fully articulated philosophy.</v>

502
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:23.830
<v Speaker 3>Like it took me 15 years of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three hours a day to develop the ideas</v>

503
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 3>that and really like that was every day</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about this obsessively</v>

504
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:33.910
<v Speaker 3>for for decades and it took me that long</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reach the level of articulation where</v>

505
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:41.111
<v Speaker 3>I could tell the story I told today it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's complicated material and so</v>

506
00:33:41.511 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 3>it's also predicated on the idea which</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I believe to be true is that</v>

507
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.920
<v Speaker 3>reality itself is a forum for action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a place of objective things and</v>

508
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also believe that if you're a true</v>

509
00:33:55.521 --> 00:33:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Darwinian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to believe that because Darwin</v>

510
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 3>believe that we are selected for</v>
<v Speaker 3>survival as a consequence of our</v>

511
00:34:03.411 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 3>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so our actions are what actually</v>

512
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:08.360
<v Speaker 3>constitute the fundamental truth.</v>

513
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 3>You live or die by your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While actions have patterns,</v>

514
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.990
<v Speaker 3>we have character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a nature.</v>

515
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 3>That's why you can well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why dramatic representations can</v>

516
00:34:18.561 --> 00:34:23.150
<v Speaker 3>be distributed worldwide and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>understands them and we understand them</v>

517
00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:26.180
<v Speaker 3>in some sense innately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're drawn to them.</v>

518
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:30.470
<v Speaker 3>I Remember I showed Pinocchio to my son</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was about four.</v>

519
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:36.100
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio is a story about confronting</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos and rescuing history in order to</v>

520
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:41.660
<v Speaker 3>become a genuine human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Pinocchio goes to the bottom of</v>

521
00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:45.680
<v Speaker 3>the ocean to confront chaos in the form</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a whale and he rescues his father and</v>

522
00:34:45.681 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 3>that makes him a fully developed human</v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

523
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.800
<v Speaker 3>That's a story that the Egyptians tooled</v>
<v Speaker 3>for thousand years ago.</v>

524
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:56.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a very old story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My son must've watched that 30 times.</v>

525
00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was really in some sense obsessed</v>

526
00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

527
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.500
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pinocchio has so much information and</v>

528
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.330
<v Speaker 3>you can barely begin to calculate it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

529
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:10.490
<v Speaker 3>you could tell that by watching its</v>
<v Speaker 3>effect on someone whose mind was just</v>

530
00:35:10.491 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 3>starting to develop and he was terrified</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that whale,</v>

531
00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.050
<v Speaker 3>but he wouldn't stop watching it.</v>

532
00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:16.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to tell them,</v>

533
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.390
<v Speaker 3>keep your eye on the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

534
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

535
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.240
<v Speaker 3>should you show your children</v>
<v Speaker 3>frightening things?</v>

536
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Well the world is frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to shelter them from that.</v>

537
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.510
<v Speaker 3>Then all you do is launch them out into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world like,</v>

538
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.010
<v Speaker 3>like edible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pray.</v>

539
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

540
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to tell the children what to do</v>

541
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:44.340
<v Speaker 3>and that's to keep your eye on the hero</v>
<v Speaker 3>because despite the fact that it's</v>

542
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:46.650
<v Speaker 3>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he prevails.</v>

543
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.280
<v Speaker 3>That's the story of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not while the heroes,</v>

544
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quivering at the back of the cave,</v>

545
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting for someone else to do the dirty</v>

546
00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm wondering how we might take</v>

547
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 3>the archetypes you're talking about in</v>
<v Speaker 3>literature and theater in art and</v>

548
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:05.290
<v Speaker 3>creative world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

549
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:10.430
<v Speaker 3>and somehow connect them with the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of world we're watching all the</v>

550
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:12.000
<v Speaker 3>time on television.</v>

551
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 3>As you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

552
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:16.680
<v Speaker 3>we are in a world where many of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things are being acted out,</v>

553
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right before our eyes.</v>

554
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 3>And it's horrifying to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is horrifying to watch television</v>

555
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.340
<v Speaker 3>for me these days anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it would be to read Eric Harris</v>

556
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 3>journals and how can I connect what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>might learn if you,</v>

557
00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.140
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

558
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I tried to take apart the reasons for</v>
<v Speaker 3>atrocity in warfare particularly.</v>

559
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:38.910
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to understand how the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>could have come to the point in about</v>

560
00:36:38.911 --> 00:36:43.911
<v Speaker 3>1984 where we were locked in mad mutual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assured destruction mode.</v>

561
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:50.430
<v Speaker 3>How in the world is that the world that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could have constituted the world so</v>

562
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:55.431
<v Speaker 3>that we're aiming at each other's mutual</v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction with a weapon capacity that</v>

563
00:36:57.961 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 3>was exponentially beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like a mystery and I tried</v>

564
00:37:02.851 --> 00:37:04.310
<v Speaker 3>different levels of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

565
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 3>because my first degree was political</v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

566
00:37:06.481 --> 00:37:11.481
<v Speaker 3>so I tried political and economic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sociological and until I got to the</v>

567
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:14.700
<v Speaker 3>psychological and then to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychodynamic,</v>

568
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.810
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really have much luck because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see what I was trying to understand.</v>

569
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.680
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't so much territorial war,</v>

570
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can kinda understand.</v>

571
00:37:24.481 --> 00:37:28.350
<v Speaker 3>You have something I wanted so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll push you out of the way animals do</v>

572
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:29.940
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not,</v>

573
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.530
<v Speaker 3>it's by no means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

574
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.010
<v Speaker 3>But it's understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are,</v>

575
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 3>there are endless stories say about</v>
<v Speaker 3>occurrences in the 20th century,</v>

576
00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:43.050
<v Speaker 3>some of them that you can't even read</v>
<v Speaker 3>without developing posttraumatic stress</v>

577
00:37:43.051 --> 00:37:48.051
<v Speaker 3>disorder of gratuitous violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one example,</v>

578
00:37:48.691 --> 00:37:52.760
<v Speaker 3>it's always haunted me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an example from Auschwitz was that</v>

579
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.780
<v Speaker 3>game that the guards used to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were,</v>

580
00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:57.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the people that were being</v>

581
00:37:57.541 --> 00:38:01.980
<v Speaker 3>incarcerated would arrive at the camps</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course they're already terrorized</v>

582
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:06.981
<v Speaker 3>and half dead or completely dead and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ripped out of their lives and thrown in</v>

583
00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:12.720
<v Speaker 3>with people they don't understand and</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose language they don't speak and</v>

584
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.220
<v Speaker 3>demolished in multiple ways and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

585
00:38:17.221 --> 00:38:22.221
<v Speaker 3>they'd have them carry wet socks of salt</v>
<v Speaker 3>on their backs from one side of the</v>

586
00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:27.990
<v Speaker 3>compound to the other and back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

587
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:30.420
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just exactly.</v>

588
00:38:30.421 --> 00:38:33.150
<v Speaker 3>Why do you want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

589
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.500
<v Speaker 3>that's a messy question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

590
00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.910
<v Speaker 3>when I don't think you can understand it</v>
<v Speaker 3>until you understand,</v>

591
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.360
<v Speaker 3>understand the part of you that could do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

592
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 3>And one of the horrifying things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this line of investigation is that</v>

593
00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.820
<v Speaker 3>that part exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could understand that,</v>

594
00:38:52.821 --> 00:38:55.250
<v Speaker 3>but you probably won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's no bloody wonder.</v>

595
00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started the psychological</v>

596
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:04.860
<v Speaker 3>investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read a lot of mythology,</v>

597
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.810
<v Speaker 3>lot of work on comparative religion and</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the,</v>

598
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.400
<v Speaker 3>the religious stories are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental narratives.</v>

599
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of,</v>

600
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:17.660
<v Speaker 3>if you think of behavior or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or drama as having a grammar,</v>

601
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:25.190
<v Speaker 3>the grammar of behavior and drama is</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious and the reason it's really</v>

602
00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.400
<v Speaker 3>it's religious because it's the grammar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

603
00:39:29.401 --> 00:39:32.120
<v Speaker 3>you can't go any deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how things are.</v>

604
00:39:32.121 --> 00:39:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Like the human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the archetypical human being is a hero,</v>

605
00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.750
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily confronting the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we are and if we're not that</v>

606
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.390
<v Speaker 3>we're something else and that is not a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good thing.</v>

607
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.890
<v Speaker 5>It's also something that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think this is what's really</v>

608
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 5>interesting about what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would would say,</v>

609
00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 5>and I may be mischaracterizing</v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization or 20th and 21st century</v>

610
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.830
<v Speaker 5>political reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but many people I think given the fact</v>

611
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.710
<v Speaker 5>when you say it's a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think it is grounded in something</v>

612
00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:06.400
<v Speaker 5>really archetipal and perhaps religious</v>
<v Speaker 5>really basic DNA,</v>

613
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 5>there's evil and there's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people would want to say,</v>

614
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:12.910
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's work on getting rid of evil.</v>

615
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.210
<v Speaker 3>And I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you were saying no,</v>

616
00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.860
<v Speaker 3>that's not what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

617
00:40:18.861 --> 00:40:21.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that is what you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't do it by getting rid of</v>

618
00:40:21.921 --> 00:40:24.140
<v Speaker 3>other people's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>

619
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:27.170
<v Speaker 3>you do it by getting rid of your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can tell you an experiment.</v>

620
00:40:27.171 --> 00:40:29.030
<v Speaker 3>You can try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a great experiment.</v>

621
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Try not to say anything that isn't true</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a month.</v>

622
00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:34.521
<v Speaker 3>You know when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

623
00:40:34.521 --> 00:40:36.170
<v Speaker 3>what about white lies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

624
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:37.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

625
00:40:37.611 --> 00:40:39.710
<v Speaker 3>that's your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see if you can figure out how to.</v>

626
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.060
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might say,</v>

627
00:40:41.061 --> 00:40:43.340
<v Speaker 3>your wife says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I look in this dress?</v>

628
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.710
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't think she looks very good and</v>

629
00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:47.300
<v Speaker 3>so you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you look great honey,</v>

630
00:40:47.301 --> 00:40:49.730
<v Speaker 3>and that's real good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't the right answer.</v>

631
00:40:49.731 --> 00:40:53.420
<v Speaker 3>The right answer is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't ask me manipulative questions.</v>

632
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:59.150
<v Speaker 3>I know that's a little book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little harsh and I wouldn't</v>

633
00:40:59.151 --> 00:41:01.190
<v Speaker 3>actually formulated that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

634
00:41:01.191 --> 00:41:01.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

635
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't answer questions like that or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

636
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.530
<v Speaker 3>So the truth wouldn't be that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

637
00:41:06.531 --> 00:41:09.140
<v Speaker 3>you look hideous in that dress and only</v>
<v Speaker 3>a moron would wear it.</v>

638
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.420
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not the truth.</v>

639
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.500
<v Speaker 3>The truth is more sophisticated than</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and you know,</v>

640
00:41:15.501 --> 00:41:18.890
<v Speaker 3>people are telling lies all the time to</v>
<v Speaker 3>spare other people's feelings and they</v>

641
00:41:18.891 --> 00:41:22.730
<v Speaker 3>have all sorts of good reasons for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there are no good reasons for</v>

642
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:26.900
<v Speaker 3>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pollute your speech by lying,</v>

643
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:30.800
<v Speaker 3>and one of the most fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 3>presuppositions of western culture,</v>

644
00:41:30.801 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 3>and this is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most perhaps the most brilliant</v>

645
00:41:34.341 --> 00:41:39.341
<v Speaker 3>discovery human beings ever made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that chaos is transformed into order</v>

646
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:45.310
<v Speaker 3>by the word</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you are all speakers of the word,</v>

647
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 3>and if you want chaos to be transformed</v>
<v Speaker 3>into hell,</v>

648
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.360
<v Speaker 3>then lie.</v>

649
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Speaker 3>If you want chaos to be transformed into</v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven,</v>

650
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:57.440
<v Speaker 3>then tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fighting evil does matter,</v>

651
00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:02.570
<v Speaker 3>but it's not corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are evil,</v>

652
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them aren't.</v>

653
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not corporations,</v>

654
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not sociopolitical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's none of those things.</v>

655
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:14.621
<v Speaker 3>It's like fix up your speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fix up your family,</v>

656
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 3>and then if you could manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very difficult,</v>

657
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:24.101
<v Speaker 3>then maybe you could dare to start</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about something more complex</v>

658
00:42:24.171 --> 00:42:26.660
<v Speaker 3>than the family level of organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

659
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I see students all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose lives are there are God awful</v>

660
00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:31.940
<v Speaker 3>mess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when they're out protesting</v>

661
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:33.770
<v Speaker 3>about something that's destroying the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

662
00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

663
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:39.911
<v Speaker 3>if we put you in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you have to decide what you're up</v>

664
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.990
<v Speaker 3>to</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're either trying to make things</v>

665
00:42:44.991 --> 00:42:47.270
<v Speaker 3>better or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

666
00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Those are the options and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make them worse,</v>

667
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 3>there's reason and if you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make them better,</v>

668
00:42:53.181 --> 00:42:58.181
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason and so in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>you decide which side you're on and then</v>

669
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.090
<v Speaker 3>then you decide how much you're on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

670
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:07.880
<v Speaker 3>and a huge part of being on that side is</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

671
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.750
<v Speaker 3>It's the fundamental virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without truth,</v>

672
00:43:11.751 --> 00:43:14.180
<v Speaker 3>you don't know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what you're doing,</v>

673
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 3>you don't know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the only reason you think you can</v>

674
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:19.520
<v Speaker 3>get away with anything is pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

675
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:23.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm smart enough to twist the fabric of</v>

676
00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:25.210
<v Speaker 3>reality in my favor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like crack.</v>

677
00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

678
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.140
<v Speaker 3>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the outcome will not be</v>

679
00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:32.450
<v Speaker 3>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you get what you want doing</v>

680
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:34.910
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find out that it doesn't do for</v>

681
00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:38.720
<v Speaker 3>you what you thought it would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know it's a fool's victory.</v>

682
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:45.380
<v Speaker 3>First question from the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do people tend to take from plays views</v>

683
00:43:45.381 --> 00:43:48.980
<v Speaker 3>that reinforce their own position even</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the play expresses a country?</v>

684
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.581
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good.</v>

685
00:43:49.581 --> 00:43:53.250
<v Speaker 3>That's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Art and literature truly subversive in</v>

686
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:54.143
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

687
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because first of all,</v>

688
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:59.930
<v Speaker 3>if it's art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not propaganda because if it's</v>

689
00:43:59.931 --> 00:44:04.850
<v Speaker 3>propaganda then that's a conscious</v>
<v Speaker 3>attempt to change the way you think or</v>

690
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:05.090
<v Speaker 3>look.</v>

691
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:07.910
<v Speaker 3>But if it's art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what's happening is the artist is</v>

692
00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:09.620
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure something out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

693
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:14.650
<v Speaker 3>he or she is engaged in the act of</v>
<v Speaker 3>artistic production and then the art</v>

694
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:21.490
<v Speaker 3>object is the result of that exploratory</v>
<v Speaker 3>attempt and the thing about exploring</v>

695
00:44:22.461 --> 00:44:26.030
<v Speaker 3>with art is you're always exploring</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you don't know because</v>

696
00:44:26.031 --> 00:44:29.930
<v Speaker 3>otherwise why would you be exploring?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so part of the reason that art is</v>

697
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:34.931
<v Speaker 3>subversive is because it exists on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>border between articulated knowledge and</v>

698
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 3>the unknown itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's the place where articulated</v>

699
00:44:38.251 --> 00:44:42.780
<v Speaker 3>knowledge is born and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to criticize art,</v>

700
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can say,</v>

701
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:46.860
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one paintings better than another,</v>

702
00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:51.861
<v Speaker 3>but like what I mean by that is even</v>
<v Speaker 3>nihilistic punk rockers like music write</v>

703
00:44:52.831 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 3>music seeps in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like music helps them celebrate</v>

704
00:44:56.341 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 3>life to the degree that nihilistic punk</v>
<v Speaker 3>rockers are capable of doing that and</v>

705
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:02.550
<v Speaker 3>they will criticize the music.</v>

706
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe they don't like the lyrics or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

707
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:08.790
<v Speaker 3>but you're just an idiot if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticize music as a phenomenal logical</v>

708
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:13.080
<v Speaker 3>entity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like dance is the same way these things</v>

709
00:45:13.081 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some sense they're beyond criticism</v>

710
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.980
<v Speaker 3>because you actually don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're about.</v>

711
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.820
<v Speaker 3>So Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>art is really subversive or</v>

712
00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:22.480
<v Speaker 3>transformative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

713
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.680
<v Speaker 3>But that's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a question that brings us right</v>

714
00:45:28.171 --> 00:45:32.340
<v Speaker 3>up to the prison peer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suppose what should be done in Gaza?</v>

715
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.360
<v Speaker 3>How do we look at that currently</v>
<v Speaker 3>properly?</v>

716
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:40.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't have an answer for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything I can do</v>

717
00:45:40.621 --> 00:45:45.621
<v Speaker 3>about Gasa or alternatively I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything I can about gas or by talking</v>

718
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:50.420
<v Speaker 3>to you here today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my conclusion was,</v>

719
00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.060
<v Speaker 3>as I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was trying to figure out what</v>

720
00:45:54.061 --> 00:45:58.830
<v Speaker 3>level of analysis was appropriate to</v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualize the greatest of moral</v>

721
00:45:58.831 --> 00:46:00.770
<v Speaker 3>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Gaza situations,</v>

722
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.950
<v Speaker 3>a good example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always ended up at the individual</v>

723
00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

724
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:09.510
<v Speaker 3>So I would say if you want to help the</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation in Gaza,</v>

725
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.380
<v Speaker 3>be more truthful with your spouse and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would think,</v>

726
00:46:13.381 --> 00:46:14.910
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can that be connected?</v>

727
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.220
<v Speaker 3>But I can tell you how it's connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

728
00:46:17.221 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 3>you're more connected to other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>than you think.</v>

729
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:20.790
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

730
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.730
<v Speaker 3>we don't live in linear relationships</v>
<v Speaker 3>with one another.</v>

731
00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:27.450
<v Speaker 3>We live in network relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So each of you is connected,</v>

732
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:29.790
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty directly to about a thousand</v>

733
00:46:29.791 --> 00:46:32.370
<v Speaker 3>people over the course of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousand people.</v>

734
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:34.920
<v Speaker 3>It's more than that probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you think,</v>

735
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:37.350
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of those thousand are connected to</v>

736
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:39.690
<v Speaker 3>a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a million.</v>

737
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:44.810
<v Speaker 3>So you're one person away from a million</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and then those thousand thousand</v>

738
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.090
<v Speaker 3>noah thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're two people away from a</v>

739
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:50.190
<v Speaker 3>billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

740
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:53.610
<v Speaker 3>the thing that's interesting about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>network is that it has as many centers</v>

741
00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:56.010
<v Speaker 3>as there are nodes and one of the.</v>

742
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 3>This is something Solzhenitsyn made</v>
<v Speaker 3>explicit,</v>

743
00:46:58.321 --> 00:47:03.321
<v Speaker 3>but one of the implicit presuppositions</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Judeo Christian tradition is that</v>

744
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:07.170
<v Speaker 3>each soul is a center of the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>

745
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:08.130
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can that be true?</v>

746
00:47:08.131 --> 00:47:12.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like God only knows what's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we know about consciousness you</v>

747
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:16.200
<v Speaker 3>could put in a thimble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know nothing about consciousness.</v>

748
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.470
<v Speaker 3>We haven't advanced in our understanding</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact.</v>

749
00:47:19.471 --> 00:47:22.130
<v Speaker 3>We may have gone backwards over the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>400 years.</v>

750
00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean we know nothing about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship of the brain to conscious</v>

751
00:47:26.101 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>awareness or virtually nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bits and pieces here and consciousness</v>

752
00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 3>is an absolute mystery and God only</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows where it came from or what it's up</v>

753
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:34.841
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

754
00:47:34.841 --> 00:47:38.710
<v Speaker 3>we know some things about human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are fundamentally explorers of the</v>

755
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 3>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how we're built.</v>

756
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:46.270
<v Speaker 3>We take things apart and put them</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and communicate the results of</v>

757
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:47.920
<v Speaker 3>that and we find pleasure in that.</v>

758
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:53.110
<v Speaker 3>But don't underestimate the utility of</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting your life together.</v>

759
00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>besides,</v>

760
00:47:55.601 --> 00:47:57.250
<v Speaker 3>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Besides,</v>

761
00:47:57.251 --> 00:47:58.630
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to hurt anyone if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

762
00:47:58.631 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 3>You'll just make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus,</v>

763
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of humble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can sweep underneath your</v>

764
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:05.080
<v Speaker 3>bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

765
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to go out and wave a</v>
<v Speaker 3>placard around.</v>

766
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm against poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like who's for poverty?</v>

767
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:16.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think you want to fix the world,</v>

768
00:48:16.781 --> 00:48:19.630
<v Speaker 3>fix your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot harder than you think,</v>

769
00:48:19.631 --> 00:48:20.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says in the New Testament,</v>

770
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.080
<v Speaker 3>it's harder to rule yourself than to</v>
<v Speaker 3>rule the city,</v>

771
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.060
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

772
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 3>it turns out you're more complicated</v>
<v Speaker 3>than a city.</v>

773
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.640
<v Speaker 3>It also turns out that you're more</v>
<v Speaker 3>important in some sense than a city,</v>

774
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.940
<v Speaker 3>and it also turns out to matter what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do with your life,</v>

775
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.820
<v Speaker 3>not it matters for you and it matters</v>
<v Speaker 3>for everyone else.</v>

776
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 3>And it probably matters for the destiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being mean.</v>

777
00:48:40.571 --> 00:48:43.420
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means in some sense to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>made in God's image.</v>

778
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:44.771
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

779
00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:46.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't take that stuff very seriously.</v>

780
00:48:46.661 --> 00:48:49.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like your whole legal system is</v>
<v Speaker 3>predicated on that idea.</v>

781
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 3>So don't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't take it seriously.</v>

782
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:52.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

783
00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 3>you presume that you have intrinsic</v>
<v Speaker 3>value,</v>

784
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 3>it's a presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

785
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is intrinsic value need?</v>

786
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.800
<v Speaker 3>It's grounded in something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's transcendent value.</v>

787
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:06.610
<v Speaker 3>And even if you don't believe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you act it out and you'll be very</v>

788
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:09.760
<v Speaker 3>annoyed if anybody interferes with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent value.</v>

789
00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 3>So who cares what you say you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you know about yourself?</v>

790
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have psychology if we were</v>

791
00:49:16.841 --> 00:49:19.660
<v Speaker 3>transparent to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't have drama,</v>

792
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:22.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because you believe something about</v>

793
00:49:22.901 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 3>who you are doesn't make it true.</v>

794
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:30.250
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is back to Michael or to Eric</v>

795
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:31.383
<v Speaker 3>Harris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

796
00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.670
<v Speaker 3>what parenting or educational practices</v>
<v Speaker 3>help to develop such extreme arrogance</v>

797
00:49:36.671 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 3>is displayed by somebody like Eric</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harris.</v>

798
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.600
<v Speaker 3>It's not self evident that it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>parenting per se that produced Harris,</v>

799
00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I would hesitate to lay</v>

800
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:55.510
<v Speaker 3>responsibility at his parents' feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People make choices,</v>

801
00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.110
<v Speaker 3>and this is a rough one because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the science for that because the</v>

802
00:49:59.111 --> 00:49:59.921
<v Speaker 3>science says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

803
00:49:59.921 --> 00:50:03.550
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be causal in some factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you look at sociological economic</v>

804
00:50:03.551 --> 00:50:08.551
<v Speaker 3>causes and you know there's all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>deterministic events on the social side</v>

805
00:50:08.971 --> 00:50:11.290
<v Speaker 3>and on the natural side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature and nurture,</v>

806
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.150
<v Speaker 3>that's all you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is nature and nurture.</v>

807
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

808
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:18.820
<v Speaker 3>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're also actually nature,</v>

809
00:50:18.821 --> 00:50:23.680
<v Speaker 3>nurture and consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness seems to be able to make</v>

810
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.500
<v Speaker 3>choices and the choices seem to matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

811
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:34.160
<v Speaker 3>you can come from a pretty wretched</v>
<v Speaker 3>family and a pretty wretched social</v>

812
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:39.161
<v Speaker 3>circumstance where absolutely everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>is stacked against you and come out</v>

813
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:41.810
<v Speaker 3>pretty damn good.</v>

814
00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Most people who abuse their children</v>
<v Speaker 3>were abused as children.</v>

815
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:48.740
<v Speaker 3>Causal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

816
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:49.603
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

817
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Most people who were abused as children</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't abuse their children.</v>

818
00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.150
<v Speaker 3>The causality only works when you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the abuse back.</v>

819
00:50:59.151 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the pool of abused people is high.</v>

820
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 3>Most of them don't abuse their children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at child abusers,</v>

821
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.330
<v Speaker 3>small pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them were abused,</v>

822
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:10.250
<v Speaker 3>but you're not talking about the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>continuum.</v>

823
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Most people who are abused don't abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you know that,</v>

824
00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:17.240
<v Speaker 3>because if they did think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they did,</v>

825
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:21.800
<v Speaker 3>it would spread exponentially and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone would be being raised by</v>

826
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.890
<v Speaker 3>seriously violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abusive parents and would take no time</v>

827
00:51:24.891 --> 00:51:27.050
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can take a few generations and poof,</v>

828
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.280
<v Speaker 3>everyone would be a violent abuser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

829
00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:32.150
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So weirdly enough,</v>

830
00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:37.180
<v Speaker 3>the horrors of history don't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulate and become transferred.</v>

831
00:51:37.971 --> 00:51:40.940
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen this in my own practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have one client who,</v>

832
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:44.750
<v Speaker 3>she had a pretty nasty upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her mother pretty much did everything</v>

833
00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:46.940
<v Speaker 3>she possibly could to make sure that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>had</v>

834
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.780
<v Speaker 3>no real self confidence.</v>

835
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what she learned from that was not to do</v>

836
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:59.030
<v Speaker 3>that to her son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she raised an excellent son.</v>

837
00:51:59.031 --> 00:52:01.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like she had every reason to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

838
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.420
<v Speaker 3>perpetuate her misery as a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 3>of resentment.</v>

839
00:52:05.421 --> 00:52:07.490
<v Speaker 3>And she has some resentment and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>surprising,</v>

840
00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:08.690
<v Speaker 3>but she swore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

841
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm going not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do this to my son.</v>

842
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.100
<v Speaker 3>And she did a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

843
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.630
<v Speaker 3>I know her quite well and he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't overprotect him.</v>

844
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.990
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tells the truth.</v>

845
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.610
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on a career,</v>

846
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:23.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

847
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:26.480
<v Speaker 3>he's got his career going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a straightforward young guy and he</v>

848
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:27.800
<v Speaker 3>likes his mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

849
00:52:27.801 --> 00:52:31.090
<v Speaker 3>so good deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but count for that causally.</v>

850
00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:33.770
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is something you observed a</v>

851
00:52:33.771 --> 00:52:38.771
<v Speaker 3>long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any event can produce multiple causal</v>

852
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.870
<v Speaker 3>pathways while not any event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

853
00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:48.080
<v Speaker 3>any complex event so determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the world's too complicated to</v>

854
00:52:49.411 --> 00:52:51.960
<v Speaker 3>be deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

855
00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.280
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been listening to a history of</v>

856
00:53:01.281 --> 00:53:06.281
<v Speaker 1>violence and exploration by psychologist</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson into the human lust for</v>

857
00:53:07.281 --> 00:53:11.630
<v Speaker 1>violence and killing on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find many of his talks that</v>

858
