1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.480
<v Speaker 2>so last week I told you I offered you an</v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of foundational stories,</v>

3
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>More than two,</v>

4
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 2>but roughly speaking to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 2>the creation stories because there's two</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them in genesis and then also the </v>

6
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.311
<v Speaker 2>story of the Buddha and I was presenting</v>
<v Speaker 2>you with a proposition and it's a multi </v>

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 2>layered proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The proposition is that the archetypal </v>

8
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 2>story structure that we've already been </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing is reflected in detail in </v>

9
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.711
<v Speaker 2>those stories and the archetypal story </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure is something like the </v>

10
00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:58.551
<v Speaker 2>existence of a preexisting state where </v>
<v Speaker 2>things are roughly functional so that </v>

11
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:03.681
<v Speaker 2>you might think of that as the state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things going well and that's the state </v>

12
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:08.121
<v Speaker 2>where your perceptions and your plans </v>
<v Speaker 2>are sufficiently developed so that when </v>

13
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 2>you act them out in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only do you get what you desire,</v>

14
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 2>but the story itself validates itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>through your actions.</v>

15
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:24.051
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what happens when you act </v>

16
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:24.051
<v Speaker 2>something out and you get what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>intend.</v>

17
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Just like when you use a map and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're going.</v>

18
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Not only does that get you to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going,</v>

19
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 2>but it also validates the plan or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>map.</v>

20
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

21
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a definition of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a pragmatic definition of truth.</v>

22
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.961
<v Speaker 2>This is the sort of thing that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to have a discussion with about </v>

23
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the idea is that we have to </v>

24
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 2>orient ourselves in a world where our </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge has always insufficient.</v>

25
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 2>We never know everything about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the question then is how can you </v>

26
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.791
<v Speaker 2>ever make a judgment about whether or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not you're correct and the answer to </v>

27
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:55.791
<v Speaker 2>that is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

28
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 2>you lay out a plan and you can think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it this way.</v>

29
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 2>If this is actually an answer to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernist problem of how is it that </v>

30
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 2>you determined whether or not your </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of the world is.</v>

31
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 2>We won't say correct because that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly right,</v>

32
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:14.421
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the postmodernists subject say with </v>

33
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:16.791
<v Speaker 2>regards to the interpretation of a text </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a very large number of </v>

34
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.361
<v Speaker 2>variations of ways in which that texts </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be interpreted and that's actually </v>

35
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 2>true and need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same.</v>

36
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a reflection of a deeper </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim,</v>

37
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>which they always often sometimes also </v>
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

38
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

39
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 2>if that's true for a text which isn't as</v>
<v Speaker 2>complex as everything,</v>

40
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 2>although it's complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's even more true for everything,</v>

41
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 2>which is to say the world lays itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in a very complex manner and you can</v>

42
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 2>interpret that in a very large number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

43
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 2>So who's to say which interpretation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

44
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>

45
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Which a reasonable objection and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tied in with even a deeper problem,</v>

46
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:55.731
<v Speaker 2>which is the problem of perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself because if the world is laid out </v>

47
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 2>in a manner that's exceptionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>

48
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 2>then how is it that you can even</v>

49
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.180
<v Speaker 3>perceive it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

50
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.220
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's partly the question that we're </v>

51
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.051
<v Speaker 3>trying to answer and the answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is what you have evolved perceptual </v>

52
00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:14.041
<v Speaker 3>structures and they're actually oriented</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards specific goals and your </v>

53
00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 3>embodied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

54
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.620
<v Speaker 3>your embodiment as a goal directed </v>
<v Speaker 3>entity is part of the solution to the </v>

55
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 3>problem of perception.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's more complicated than that.</v>

56
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 3>So we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

57
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 3>you come equipped and this was constant </v>
<v Speaker 3>objection to pure reason essentially,</v>

58
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

59
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is,</v>

60
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 3>is the facts don't speak for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's too many facts for them to speak</v>

61
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:41.161
<v Speaker 3>for themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have to overlay on top of them </v>

62
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:41.161
<v Speaker 3>and interpretive framework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

63
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 3>where does the interpretive framework </v>
<v Speaker 3>come from?</v>

64
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right answer to that is something </v>

65
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.920
<v Speaker 3>like it evolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

66
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 3>It's taken three and a half billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>years for your perceptual structure.</v>

67
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 3>You're a body perceptual structure to </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve and it's done that.</v>

68
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.720
<v Speaker 3>I roughly in a trial and error process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that exhausts what's </v>

69
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 3>happened over the course of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a good enough shorthand for the</v>

70
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:04.141
<v Speaker 3>time being so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's the constraints imposed on </v>

71
00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 3>your perceptual structures by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessity of survival and reproduction,</v>

72
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 3>but there's other constraints imposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

73
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.010
<v Speaker 3>You might regard to subsets of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that because you exist in a </v>

74
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 3>cooperative and competitive landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the perceptual structures and plans that</v>

75
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 3>you lay out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll say the maps that you lay out have</v>

76
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 3>to be negotiated with other people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that put stringent constraints on the</v>

77
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 3>number of interpretations that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to apply.</v>

78
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 3>So you can think about this in a pig and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

79
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.870
<v Speaker 3>That is if there are children in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>playground and they're trying to </v>

80
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.971
<v Speaker 3>organize themselves to play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to agree on a game and the </v>

81
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:42.811
<v Speaker 3>game is of course a perceptual structure</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a goal directed structure and a </v>

82
00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:47.041
<v Speaker 3>structure that delimits action and </v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions and so they at least have </v>

83
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:51.751
<v Speaker 3>to settle on a game and so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>constrains the set of possible actions </v>

84
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:55.651
<v Speaker 3>and perceptions in the environment to </v>
<v Speaker 3>those that are deemed socially </v>

85
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:55.651
<v Speaker 3>acceptable.</v>

86
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 3>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

87
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 3>what are there further constraints?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the constraints might be,</v>

88
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:03.571
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's play the game and see if it's any </v>

89
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that means that you have to take the</v>

90
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:09.211
<v Speaker 3>plan that you've organized consensually </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then lay it out in the actual world </v>

91
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:10.020
<v Speaker 3>and see if when you lay it out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

92
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 3>it does what it's supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In some sense,</v>

93
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:17.221
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is testing a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that the range of </v>

94
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 3>interpretations is infinite and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconstrained turns out to be incorrect </v>

95
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 3>and now it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

96
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean it's easy to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out how they're constrained,</v>

97
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 3>but the technical suggested that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

98
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:35.161
<v Speaker 3>there's an infinite number of equally </v>
<v Speaker 3>valid interpretations is just not </v>

99
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not correct and it's not correct on</v>

100
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 3>biological evolutionary grounds and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

101
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.310
<v Speaker 3>It's also not correct on sociocultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>grounds because it has to be negotiated </v>

102
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.331
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>piaget put a further constraint on that </v>

103
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:48.331
<v Speaker 3>essentially by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

104
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 3>not only does it have to be a game and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>game that attains its hands,</v>

105
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.210
<v Speaker 3>but it has to be a game that people want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to play.</v>

106
00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.420
<v Speaker 3>So it also has to satisfy some element </v>
<v Speaker 3>of subjective desire as well.</v>

107
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 3>So that's three levels of constraint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

108
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.440
<v Speaker 3>It has to be a game you want to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be a game that you can play </v>

109
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 3>with other people and it has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>game that if you play with other people,</v>

110
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 3>actually works in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

111
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 3>well so much for an infinite array of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of options.</v>

112
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a very constrained array of </v>
<v Speaker 3>options.</v>

113
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that the idea that I've been</v>

114
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:25.151
<v Speaker 3>proposing to you is that what evolved </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythology does these representations </v>

115
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 3>that we've been dealing with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>archetypal representations is sketch out</v>

116
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 3>that landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the landscape of playable games?</v>

117
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's.</v>

118
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.830
<v Speaker 3>It sets out a landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sends out a description of the </v>

119
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.351
<v Speaker 3>landscape in which the game is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be played as well as a description of </v>

120
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 3>the lens of of the game itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the landscape is roughly that.</v>

121
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 3>The core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the core archetype seems to be something</v>

122
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:56.951
<v Speaker 3>like it's it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like the interplay </v>

123
00:06:56.951 --> 00:07:00.731
<v Speaker 3>between chaos and order and chaos is </v>
<v Speaker 3>represented by the Serpentine Predator </v>

124
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.670
<v Speaker 3>because we use our Predator detection </v>
<v Speaker 3>circuits to conceptualize the unknown </v>

125
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.351
<v Speaker 3>because what else would we do it that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that seems,</v>

126
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 3>given that we're prey animals and given </v>
<v Speaker 3>our evolutionary history,</v>

127
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.430
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to understand what </v>
<v Speaker 3>else we could possibly do because the </v>

128
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 3>critical issue about venturing into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown is that you might die or perhaps</v>

129
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 3>a slight variant of that is something </v>
<v Speaker 3>might kill you,</v>

130
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 3>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are close enough.</v>

131
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:33.341
<v Speaker 3>To the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so chaos is what causes your </v>

132
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 3>deterioration and death and there's lots</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ways to conceptualize that,</v>

133
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:39.851
<v Speaker 3>but but a reptilian Predator </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire-breathing reptilian Predator isn't </v>

134
00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 3>a bad way to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the question is,</v>

135
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do in the face of that?</v>

136
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.970
<v Speaker 3>And one answer is you build </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumscribed enclosures that's order </v>

137
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.330
<v Speaker 3>and then also you act as the builder of </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumscribed enclosure.</v>

138
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's partly the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the hero is also though that's not </v>

139
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 3>good enough because the circumscribed </v>
<v Speaker 3>enclosure isn't impermeable.</v>

140
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.120
<v Speaker 3>It can be invaded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will inevitably be invaded either </v>

141
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 3>from outside or from within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

142
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 3>And so we've been conceptualizing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Predator,</v>

143
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:16.211
<v Speaker 3>the malevolent Predator at multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels of analysis throughout our </v>

144
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary history say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also in our symbolic history,</v>

145
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 3>trying to understand the nature of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>which invades the enclosure,</v>

146
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we can say,</v>

147
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:24.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's partly external threat,</v>

148
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 3>it's partly social threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also partly the threat that </v>

149
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 3>each individual brings to bear on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>social structure because of our,</v>

150
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 3>let's say our intrinsic malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that would be the snakes within.</v>

151
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:42.070
<v Speaker 3>And so that accounts for the analogy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Christian analogy between the </v>

152
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 3>serpent in the garden of Eden and Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a very,</v>

153
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 3>very strange analogy.</v>

154
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not obvious at all why those two </v>
<v Speaker 3>things would stack on top of one </v>

155
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.501
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially given that when the creation </v>

156
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:56.621
<v Speaker 3>story originally emerged in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the forum I talked to you about last </v>

157
00:08:56.621 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the story of Adam and Eve,</v>

158
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.330
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the serpent in the garden </v>
<v Speaker 3>was also something that was associated </v>

159
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.261
<v Speaker 3>with the adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't an implicit part of the story </v>

160
00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 3>that God laid on afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

161
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the worst possible snake?</v>

162
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a reasonable question.</v>

163
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 3>And then a better question is what do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do about the worst possible snake?</v>

164
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:19.670
<v Speaker 3>And one answer is you face it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's other answers to like you </v>

165
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 3>make sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

166
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 3>And that's how you stave off the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 3>of temporal chaos.</v>

167
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:28.851
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you learn to conceptualize the </v>

168
00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:32.001
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the future as a realm of </v>

169
00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:34.371
<v Speaker 3>potential threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you learn to give things up in </v>

170
00:09:34.371 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 3>the present and somehow that satisfies </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>

171
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:40.670
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe you're offering sacrifices to </v>

172
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.670
<v Speaker 3>God and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

173
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.121
<v Speaker 3>why does that will take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to think about that </v>

174
00:09:44.121 --> 00:09:44.121
<v Speaker 3>psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does that work?</v>

175
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could think about the spirit of God,</v>

176
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:51.681
<v Speaker 3>the father as an image istick </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation of the collective spirit </v>

177
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:57.591
<v Speaker 3>of the group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll call it the patriarchy if you </v>

178
00:09:57.591 --> 00:09:57.591
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

179
00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 3>It's the thing that's common across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>group as a spirit,</v>

180
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 3>as a psychological force across time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you make sacrifices to that?</v>

181
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 3>That is what you do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right now.</v>

182
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:12.921
<v Speaker 3>You're sacrificing your time to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>spirit of the great father because your </v>

183
00:10:12.921 --> 00:10:16.461
<v Speaker 3>assumption is is that if you do what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>diligent so you're not chasing impulsive</v>

184
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:22.371
<v Speaker 3>pleasure at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're pathologically interested </v>

185
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:23.550
<v Speaker 3>in this class or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not chasing impulsive interest.</v>

186
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.480
<v Speaker 3>You're sacrificing your impulsive </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest to satisfy the spirit of social</v>

187
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:32.481
<v Speaker 3>requirement and so you're offering a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice to that spirit in the hope </v>

188
00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:36.921
<v Speaker 3>that you can make a bargain with it so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it will reward you in the future </v>

189
00:10:36.921 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 3>and that reward will be part of partly </v>
<v Speaker 3>the staving off of insecurity,</v>

190
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.930
<v Speaker 3>which is no more than to say that part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the reason that you're getting your </v>

191
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.681
<v Speaker 3>degree is because you believe that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>will aid you in finding employment and </v>

192
00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:51.840
<v Speaker 3>status and all the other things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>will stave off the dragon of chaos.</v>

193
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.260
<v Speaker 3>So now those things were as as we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been at pains to point out is those </v>

194
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:03.651
<v Speaker 3>things were acted out and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>represented an image and story long </v>

195
00:11:03.651 --> 00:11:07.071
<v Speaker 3>before they could be fully articulated </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're building our knowledge of </v>

196
00:11:07.071 --> 00:11:10.710
<v Speaker 3>ourselves and also our social structures</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also the world from the bottom up as</v>

197
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:15.711
<v Speaker 3>well as from the top down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an interplay between the two </v>

198
00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:15.711
<v Speaker 3>levels of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

199
00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:18.120
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's partly,</v>

200
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:23.660
<v Speaker 3>that's partly the archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 3>underpinning and then with regards to </v>

201
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 3>the stories themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

202
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 3>you're in a map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

203
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 3>You're using a map and with any luck </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's detailed enough so that you can use</v>

204
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 3>it to get to the place that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go and sometimes you don't,</v>

205
00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:37.720
<v Speaker 3>and that means that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recalibrate your,</v>

206
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.810
<v Speaker 3>your journey along the map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way is exactly what gps </v>

207
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 3>systems do when you go off the pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

208
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.760
<v Speaker 3>They stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an anxiety response from the GPS </v>

209
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:49.760
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stop,</v>

210
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.920
<v Speaker 3>they recalibrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they readjust the map now and then </v>

211
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 3>if you're unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this very rarely happens anymore.</v>

212
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.080
<v Speaker 3>You'll be on a road that isn't mapped </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the GPS system doesn't know </v>

213
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 3>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While that happens in real life too,</v>

214
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:07.321
<v Speaker 3>I mean those are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm using gps for a very specific </v>

215
00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:09.601
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are intelligent systems as far as </v>

216
00:12:09.601 --> 00:12:11.881
<v Speaker 3>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the closest things we ever </v>

217
00:12:11.881 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 3>designed to intelligence systems because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can actually orient,</v>

218
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:17.370
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they oriented in real time and they're </v>

219
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:17.370
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably sophisticated systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

220
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Because they required a huge satellite </v>
<v Speaker 3>network and and so on,</v>

221
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:22.060
<v Speaker 3>and they're cybernetic systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Technically speaking,</v>

222
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.430
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they respond very much like the way that</v>

223
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 3>we respond.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

224
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 3>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're in,</v>

225
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 3>you inhabit a map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you try to adjust the resolution of the </v>

226
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.581
<v Speaker 3>map so that it's more complex than it </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs to be to get you from point a to </v>

227
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:38.581
<v Speaker 3>point b.</v>

228
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want minimal resolution because that</v>

229
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 3>enables efficient cognitive processing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't overload you too much.</v>

230
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.970
<v Speaker 3>Like when I'm looking at this room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I look,</v>

231
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.280
<v Speaker 3>say I want to walk down this pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically what my mind does,</v>

232
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.260
<v Speaker 3>my perceptual field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can detect this,</v>

233
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 3>if I look straight ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could barely see you.</v>

234
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:57.790
<v Speaker 3>People on the periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're more like,</v>

235
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.590
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of like blurs you too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell that you have heads,</v>

236
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 3>but that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you move,</v>

237
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 3>I can see your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can probably see your eyes,</v>

238
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:12.211
<v Speaker 3>but barely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're all very low resolution and </v>

239
00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 3>even though I can't detect it at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>very periphery of my vision,</v>

240
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:17.581
<v Speaker 3>you guys are black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my color vision disappears at the </v>

241
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:18.220
<v Speaker 3>periphery even though I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't actually perceived that.</v>

242
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is if I want to walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>down here,</v>

243
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.500
<v Speaker 3>this pathway becomes high resolution.</v>

244
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.650
<v Speaker 3>It becomes marked with positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of this turns into low resolution </v>

245
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.850
<v Speaker 3>back here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even represented and then I </v>

246
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:32.850
<v Speaker 3>find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

247
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.031
<v Speaker 3>am I doing this properly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is while I walk forward </v>

248
00:13:36.031 --> 00:13:39.190
<v Speaker 3>and if I get to the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I've done it properly enough and if</v>

249
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.440
<v Speaker 3>one of you stand up and get in my way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'm going to focus on you and </v>

250
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.580
<v Speaker 3>assume instantly that I haven't mapped </v>
<v Speaker 3>you properly,</v>

251
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

252
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 3>I put you in the category of irrelevant </v>
<v Speaker 3>entity when in fact you have to be in </v>

253
00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:56.701
<v Speaker 3>the category of strange object,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that object and so well.</v>

254
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 3>So then we inhabit those structures all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

255
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 3>We're in a structure like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a perceptual structure,</v>

256
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.890
<v Speaker 3>and if it's working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's got the archetipal quality of </v>

257
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.740
<v Speaker 3>paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>

258
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:13.741
<v Speaker 3>because it's axioms are correct and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>functional and then now and then </v>

259
00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 3>something comes along and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the snake is.</v>

260
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:20.100
<v Speaker 3>The eternal snake in the garden that </v>
<v Speaker 3>pops up inside a structure and it turns </v>

261
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.541
<v Speaker 3>out that the things that you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>attending to are the most important </v>

262
00:14:24.541 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 3>things rather than the least important </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and that what does that do?</v>

263
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 3>It blows the map into pieces and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can happen at different levels of </v>

264
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.610
<v Speaker 3>severity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the ultimate level of severity,</v>

265
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.770
<v Speaker 3>it's apocalyptic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

266
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.040
<v Speaker 3>Everything goes and that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a traumatic intrusion and </v>

267
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.001
<v Speaker 3>essentially the story of the Garden of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Eden is the story of a traumatic </v>

268
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 3>intrusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it is,</v>

269
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 3>and so what happens is that Adam Eve are</v>
<v Speaker 3>living in unconscious blasts,</v>

270
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's fine.</v>

271
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 3>They're in their walled garden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there in a paradise will state.</v>

272
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 3>They're not aware of their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability or nakedness,</v>

273
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:01.690
<v Speaker 3>so they they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

274
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 3>they're not suffering from negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion.</v>

275
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Something pops up that radically expands</v>
<v Speaker 3>their vision and all of a sudden now </v>

276
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 3>they can apprehend all sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that exist as threats,</v>

277
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.920
<v Speaker 3>so that's their own nakedness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability and temporality itself </v>

278
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.731
<v Speaker 3>because they become aware of the future </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bang that state of being in that </v>

279
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 3>paradise is forever gone.</v>

280
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:28.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the strange thing about human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings is this is what happened to us,</v>

281
00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:33.401
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that our perceptions developed to </v>

282
00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:36.431
<v Speaker 3>such a degree that we could no longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignore what was irrelevant.</v>

283
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.580
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't do it because we discovered </v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

284
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.510
<v Speaker 3>once we discovered our finite </v>
<v Speaker 3>limitations in time and space,</v>

285
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 3>we discovered that we were surrounded by</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite threat always,</v>

286
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.370
<v Speaker 3>and maybe that's why people are so hyper</v>
<v Speaker 3>awake because threat wakes you up while </v>

287
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 3>we're in a constant state of existential</v>
<v Speaker 3>threat.</v>

288
00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 3>Now the advantage to that is that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>

289
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.580
<v Speaker 3>we take arms up against a sea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>troubles constantly.</v>

290
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

291
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 3>And We build enclosures and we take </v>
<v Speaker 3>precautions for the future and we live a</v>

292
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:15.101
<v Speaker 3>very long time and we generally live </v>
<v Speaker 3>quite safe lives compared to the lives </v>

293
00:16:15.101 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 3>we could live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we've traded pain for anxiety.</v>

294
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

295
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.280
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still a pretty rough trade,</v>

296
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because who wants to be nervous all the </v>

297
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.801
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're alive and awake when you're </v>

298
00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:32.081
<v Speaker 3>nervous and it is a form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness elevating activation.</v>

299
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:37.450
<v Speaker 3>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the story of Adam and Eve is the </v>

300
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.850
<v Speaker 3>story of the eternal fall that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is.</v>

301
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.710
<v Speaker 3>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

302
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.980
<v Speaker 3>you exist in these walled enclosures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something that lurks that </v>

303
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 3>will always knock you off your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the question is what is that?</v>

304
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:52.870
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>formulated over very long periods of </v>

305
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.380
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Partly it's the probability of predation</v>

306
00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:55.790
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the snake,</v>

307
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:58.790
<v Speaker 3>the thing that can come in subtly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>undermine you.</v>

308
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then that's,</v>

309
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.680
<v Speaker 3>that's what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expanded upward to include the abstract </v>

310
00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:13.481
<v Speaker 3>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that thing that can undermine </v>

311
00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:13.481
<v Speaker 3>your conceptual schemes.</v>

312
00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:17.230
<v Speaker 3>So you have your actual territory and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have your abstract to our </v>

313
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.260
<v Speaker 3>territory and in your actual territory </v>
<v Speaker 3>there are actual snakes and in your </v>

314
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.130
<v Speaker 3>abstract territory there are abstract </v>
<v Speaker 3>snakes,</v>

315
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:27.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the worst snake of all his </v>

316
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:27.310
<v Speaker 3>malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

317
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 3>I think that's technically correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that you view,</v>

318
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:36.671
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're looking at posttraumatic </v>

319
00:17:36.671 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 3>stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's almost always the case that</v>

320
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:39.500
<v Speaker 3>someone who suffers from post traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress disorder,</v>

321
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:44.501
<v Speaker 3>which you might think of as a real real </v>
<v Speaker 3>life re incarnation of the fall,</v>

322
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.560
<v Speaker 3>is that people encounter something </v>
<v Speaker 3>malevolent and it breaks them because </v>

323
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:53.670
<v Speaker 3>it's the worst thing to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like suffering is one thing,</v>

324
00:17:53.671 --> 00:17:54.250
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

325
00:17:54.251 --> 00:17:59.251
<v Speaker 3>that's bad enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vulnerability and suffering that's bad </v>

326
00:17:59.251 --> 00:17:59.970
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to encounter someone who wishes that</v>

327
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 3>upon you and will work to bring it </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

328
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole different category of </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

329
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 3>especially when it also reflect </v>
<v Speaker 3>something back to you about yourself.</v>

330
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Because if someone else can do that to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and they are human,</v>

331
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 3>that means that you partake of the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>essence.</v>

332
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Strangely enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually the cure to some degree </v>

333
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 3>to posttraumatic stress disorder is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've been victimized,</v>

334
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:27.741
<v Speaker 3>you're naive and you've been victimized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way out of that is to no longer be </v>

335
00:18:27.741 --> 00:18:31.401
<v Speaker 3>naive and to no longer be victimized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that means that you see this </v>

336
00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 3>reflected in the Harry Potter idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

337
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:38.031
<v Speaker 3>that the reason that Harry Potter can </v>
<v Speaker 3>withstand voldemort is because he's got </v>

338
00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:40.920
<v Speaker 3>a piece of a is being touched by it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way that you.</v>

339
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:46.340
<v Speaker 3>The way that you keep the psychopaths at</v>
<v Speaker 3>bay is to develop the inner psychopaths </v>

340
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.690
<v Speaker 3>so that you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see what right and then,</v>

341
00:18:48.691 --> 00:18:50.330
<v Speaker 3>but that's a voluntary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

342
00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:50.910
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so.</v>

343
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:52.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

344
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.500
<v Speaker 3>a set of tools that you have at your </v>
<v Speaker 3>disposal which has full knowledge of </v>

345
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 3>evil and that does.</v>

346
00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Nisha said if you look into an abyss for</v>
<v Speaker 3>too long,</v>

347
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 3>you risk having the abyss gaze back into</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

348
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that if you look at </v>

349
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.651
<v Speaker 3>something monstrous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a tendency to turn into a </v>

350
00:19:09.651 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 3>monster and people are often very afraid</v>
<v Speaker 3>of looking at monsters.</v>

351
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Things exactly for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the question is,</v>

352
00:19:14.131 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should you turn into a monster?</v>

353
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should,</v>

354
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 3>but you should do it voluntarily and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>accidentally,</v>

355
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:27.020
<v Speaker 3>and you should do it with good in mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than falling prey to it by </v>

356
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 3>possession essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's the alternative.</v>

357
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.200
<v Speaker 3>And how does it possess you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's easy.</v>

358
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:35.250
<v Speaker 3>You're suffering makes you better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bitterness makes you resentful,</v>

359
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.860
<v Speaker 3>you're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>means meat,</v>

360
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:40.650
<v Speaker 3>makes you vengeful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once you're on that road,</v>

361
00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:42.450
<v Speaker 3>you go down that a little bit farther,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

362
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Well you end up fantasizing in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>basement about shooting up the local </v>

363
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 3>high school and then killing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

364
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Because that's sort of the ultimate end </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that line of pathological reasoning </v>

365
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.400
<v Speaker 3>being should be eradicated because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>its intrinsic evil and I'm exactly the </v>

366
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.721
<v Speaker 3>person to do it and I'll cap it off with</v>
<v Speaker 3>an indication of my own lack of worth </v>

367
00:20:02.721 --> 00:20:04.140
<v Speaker 3>just to hammer the point home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

368
00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:08.340
<v Speaker 3>And if I can garner a little post post </v>
<v Speaker 3>you fame along the way,</v>

369
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 3>well that'll satisfy my primordial </v>
<v Speaker 3>primate dominance hierarchy,</v>

370
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.390
<v Speaker 3>a imaginings to at least in fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

371
00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:18.090
<v Speaker 3>it's the full package.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to go down that route and of</v>

372
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:23.091
<v Speaker 3>course people don't like to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing and it's no bloody </v>

373
00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:24.330
<v Speaker 3>wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But without the capability for mayhem,</v>

374
00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:25.160
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

375
00:20:25.161 --> 00:20:28.000
<v Speaker 3>you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a potential victim to mayhem.</v>

376
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.810
<v Speaker 3>So you need your sword.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be sheath,</v>

377
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.930
<v Speaker 3>but you need to have it and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequently the case.</v>

378
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.630
<v Speaker 3>If you treat someone with posttraumatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress disorder,</v>

379
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:42.020
<v Speaker 3>there's two things you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to help them develop a very </v>

380
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.920
<v Speaker 3>articulated philosophy of evil because </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise their brain bothers him over </v>

381
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:47.300
<v Speaker 3>and over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

382
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Why were you so deal with naive?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did you become victimized?</v>

383
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Why were you such as soccer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are good questions.</v>

384
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:55.210
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to have that happen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you again.</v>

385
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be exploited twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

386
00:20:57.491 --> 00:21:02.491
<v Speaker 3>so your eyes have to open up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know the price of that from the </v>

387
00:21:02.491 --> 00:21:02.491
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian myth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

388
00:21:02.491 --> 00:21:04.870
<v Speaker 3>You come into contact with seth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>

389
00:21:04.871 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're a god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose it.</v>

390
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:07.870
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no joke,</v>

391
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.370
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no joke,</v>

392
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:14.371
<v Speaker 3>and then the cure for that is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement down into the underworld and </v>

393
00:21:14.371 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 3>the revitalization of the father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the identification with the force</v>

394
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 3>that created culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

395
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.800
<v Speaker 3>And that then there's you and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

396
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Then you can withstand malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could withstand tragedy and </v>

397
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and then that's the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>secret,</v>

398
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:28.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what you want in life,</v>

399
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.870
<v Speaker 3>you need to be able to withstand tragedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you need to be able to withstand </v>

400
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:34.420
<v Speaker 3>malevolence because those are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces.</v>

401
00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:36.680
<v Speaker 3>They're always working against you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it's.</v>

402
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.810
<v Speaker 3>This is associated with the union idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>of incorporation of the shadow,</v>

403
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be.</v>

404
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.640
<v Speaker 3>We know this God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know how predators work with regards </v>

405
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.290
<v Speaker 3>to children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're a pedophilic Predator and</v>

406
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:53.590
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at a landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>

407
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:58.950
<v Speaker 3>the child that you're going to go after </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the one that's timid and won't fight </v>

408
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.911
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've picked your victim and predatory </v>

409
00:22:02.911 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 3>people in general are exactly like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>man there because they're predators.</v>

410
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to attack someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's who's going to fight back.</v>

411
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.770
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue is likely not to even come up.</v>

412
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.160
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be looking for someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>one way or another that cannot </v>

413
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.930
<v Speaker 3>conceptualize what they are and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>

414
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:25.010
<v Speaker 3>It's open season and it's open season,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so if you're treating someone with </v>

415
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.131
<v Speaker 3>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first they need an introduction to the </v>

416
00:22:29.131 --> 00:22:32.731
<v Speaker 3>philosophy of malevolence and second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to learn to become dangerous </v>

417
00:22:32.731 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 3>because that's the only way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the alternative?</v>

418
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:41.300
<v Speaker 3>To get these recurrent thoughts about </v>
<v Speaker 3>their vulnerability in the face of </v>

419
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 3>malevolence and their own naivety </v>
<v Speaker 3>because by definition,</v>

420
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 3>if someone's psychopathic has exploited </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

421
00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:47.990
<v Speaker 3>you're too naive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

422
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a definitional issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say,</v>

423
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's no fault of mine.</v>

424
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 3>How the hell could I be prepared?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fair enough,</v>

425
00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:58.831
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfectly reasonable objection doesn't </v>

426
00:22:58.831 --> 00:23:00.340
<v Speaker 3>solve your problem because it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an eternal problem,</v>

427
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:05.341
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The internal problem is how do you deal </v>

428
00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:05.341
<v Speaker 3>with tragedy and malevolence and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

429
00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:05.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not prepared.</v>

430
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

431
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.490
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unsurprising.</v>

432
00:23:09.491 --> 00:23:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you were over protected as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a child.</v>

433
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:17.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good idea to overprotect your</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids because the snakes are going to </v>

434
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.830
<v Speaker 3>come into the garden no matter what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

435
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.310
<v Speaker 3>and so then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of trying to keep the damn </v>

436
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.740
<v Speaker 3>snakes away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do is you are a mere child with</v>

437
00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:28.741
<v Speaker 3>something that can help them chop them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into pieces and make the world out of </v>

438
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:32.131
<v Speaker 3>them so that the trick for human </v>
<v Speaker 3>thriving in the face of suffering and </v>

439
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 3>malevolence is strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not protection.</v>

440
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a completely different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We also know this clinically.</v>

441
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.530
<v Speaker 3>We know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you treat people with exposure </v>

442
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 3>therapy for agora phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is roughly speaking,</v>

443
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 3>the fear of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say the fear of everything.</v>

444
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.720
<v Speaker 3>You don't make them less afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You make them braver.</v>

445
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same thing because with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>agoraphobic,</v>

446
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:58.871
<v Speaker 3>see what happens to them is is the fault</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never conceptualized death and </v>

447
00:23:58.881 --> 00:23:59.360
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

448
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 3>They're naive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

449
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:06.070
<v Speaker 3>It never enters their theater of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination and it's because they're </v>

450
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.500
<v Speaker 3>protected from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then something happens.</v>

451
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:11.501
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this often happens to women in their </v>

452
00:24:11.501 --> 00:24:13.211
<v Speaker 3>forties because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the people most likely to </v>

453
00:24:13.211 --> 00:24:14.070
<v Speaker 3>develop egret phobia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happens there,</v>

454
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.420
<v Speaker 3>they've been protected from chaos by </v>
<v Speaker 3>authority their entire life,</v>

455
00:24:17.421 --> 00:24:22.421
<v Speaker 3>so maybe they had an overprotective </v>
<v Speaker 3>father and then they went to an </v>

456
00:24:22.421 --> 00:24:25.660
<v Speaker 3>overprotective boyfriend and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to an over protective husband and </v>

457
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.501
<v Speaker 3>maybe they were willing to be subjugated</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all three of those because of the </v>

458
00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:29.690
<v Speaker 3>project protection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

459
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.930
<v Speaker 3>so so that's the bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stay weak and dependent and maybe </v>

460
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:39.161
<v Speaker 3>they have to because that's the only way</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can appeal to the person who's </v>

461
00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:42.461
<v Speaker 3>hyper protective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the price they pay for that is that </v>

462
00:24:42.461 --> 00:24:43.490
<v Speaker 3>they're not sufficiently competent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then something happens in their life.</v>

463
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Often in their forties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they develop heart palpitations.</v>

464
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.520
<v Speaker 3>Maybe as a consequence of menopause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their heart starts to beat a radically </v>

465
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:52.280
<v Speaker 3>and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

466
00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:53.030
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

467
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:53.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

468
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 3>who are you going to talk to about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

469
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 3>There's no protection from authority for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

470
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.880
<v Speaker 3>or maybe their friend gets divorced or </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe their sister dies or something </v>

471
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.211
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It brings up the specter of mortality </v>

472
00:25:07.211 --> 00:25:09.940
<v Speaker 3>and maybe the specter of malevolence and</v>
<v Speaker 3>mortality and it brings it up in a way </v>

473
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.170
<v Speaker 3>that authority recourse to authority </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannot solve,</v>

474
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 3>and so then they have panic attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>

475
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 3>They go out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get afraid,</v>

476
00:25:16.101 --> 00:25:21.101
<v Speaker 3>they feel their heart beating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they get afraid of their heart </v>

477
00:25:21.101 --> 00:25:21.101
<v Speaker 3>beating because they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

478
00:25:21.101 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they think,</v>

479
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.870
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to die and I'm going to make a</v>

480
00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:26.930
<v Speaker 3>fool of myself while I'm doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>attract a lot of attention.</v>

481
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:31.070
<v Speaker 3>So the two big fears come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mortality and social judgment,</v>

482
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.690
<v Speaker 3>and then they have a panic attack.</v>

483
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like fight or flights going out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>

484
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very unpleasant.</v>

485
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 3>Then they start to avoid the places </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had a panic attack.</v>

486
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Then they end up not being able to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>

487
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.970
<v Speaker 3>So then tie A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt has come back,</v>

488
00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:46.760
<v Speaker 3>write a huge monster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little victim,</v>

489
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.050
<v Speaker 3>and so what do you do with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

490
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:54.190
<v Speaker 3>there no saying no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no tire map that's done right </v>

491
00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.760
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Naivety is over.</v>

492
00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 3>They've had a direct contact with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>threat of mortality and social judgment.</v>

493
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:05.530
<v Speaker 3>They've met the terrible mother and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've met the terrible father and </v>

494
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.230
<v Speaker 3>there's no going back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no saying,</v>

495
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is safe.</v>

496
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.590
<v Speaker 3>It's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>

497
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:15.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you think it's safe means </v>

498
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.431
<v Speaker 3>that you were living in an unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>bubble that was sort of provided to you </v>

499
00:26:18.431 --> 00:26:22.450
<v Speaker 3>by your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a gift and now that's been </v>

500
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.270
<v Speaker 3>shattered and so now what do you do?</v>

501
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:28.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer is you retreat until you're </v>

502
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.870
<v Speaker 3>in your house and there's nowhere you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can go.</v>

503
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:29.600
<v Speaker 3>You're the ultimate frozen rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

504
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.150
<v Speaker 3>And your life is hell because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>function.</v>

505
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.440
<v Speaker 3>The alternative is let's take apart the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things you're afraid of.</v>

506
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Let's expose you to them carefully and </v>
<v Speaker 3>programmatically,</v>

507
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:46.320
<v Speaker 3>and then you'll learn that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're actually tougher than you think.</v>

508
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:51.830
<v Speaker 3>You never knew that and maybe you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to take on the responsibility </v>

509
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 3>because you know people play a role in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own demise,</v>

510
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:58.611
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you had opportunity to go out and </v>

511
00:26:58.611 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 3>explore or withdraw because you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid,</v>

512
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:01.650
<v Speaker 3>you chose to withdraw because you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid.</v>

513
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 3>So it's not only that you were over </v>
<v Speaker 3>protected.</v>

514
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:08.871
<v Speaker 3>Often it's that you were willing to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage of the fact that you are </v>

515
00:27:08.871 --> 00:27:11.160
<v Speaker 3>overprotected and run back there </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you had the opportunity,</v>

516
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe you're a kid in the playground,</v>

517
00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:13.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

518
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.350
<v Speaker 3>And you're having some trouble with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other kids and you know,</v>

519
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:21.351
<v Speaker 3>in the back of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should deal with deal with this </v>

520
00:27:21.351 --> 00:27:21.351
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you go and tell your mom and get her</v>

521
00:27:21.351 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 3>to intervene and you know that that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not right.</v>

522
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.860
<v Speaker 3>You know that you're breaking the social</v>
<v Speaker 3>contract,</v>

523
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.320
<v Speaker 3>but it's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what you do.</v>

524
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.220
<v Speaker 3>You run off to an authority figure and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hide behind the great father,</v>

525
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking,</v>

526
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.540
<v Speaker 3>while the problem with that is you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn how to do it yourself.</v>

527
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 3>So then you have to relearn it painfully</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're 40.</v>

528
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 3>So then you take people out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

529
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:44.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you afraid of?</v>

530
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Rank it from one to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 10 is make a list of 10 things.</v>

531
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 3>You're afraid of the least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that we're least afraid of.</v>

532
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:54.150
<v Speaker 3>We'll call number 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'll start with that.</v>

533
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

534
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:56.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid of elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

535
00:27:56.371 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 3>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's look at a picture of an elevator.</v>

536
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:01.800
<v Speaker 3>Let's have you imagine being in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>elevator.</v>

537
00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:06.801
<v Speaker 3>Let's go out to an elevator and let you </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch the terrible jaws of death open </v>

538
00:28:06.801 --> 00:28:08.910
<v Speaker 3>because that's how you're responding to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it symbolically,</v>

539
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.100
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to do that at it.</v>

540
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.170
<v Speaker 3>At the closest proximity you can manage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find out,</v>

541
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 3>you go do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works.</v>

542
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:23.090
<v Speaker 3>You're nervous as hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially from an anticipatory </v>

543
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.090
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shaking.</v>

544
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.030
<v Speaker 3>You go out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stop,</v>

545
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.580
<v Speaker 3>you watch it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he actually calmed down.</v>

546
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:28.650
<v Speaker 3>You do that 10 times and it no longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>bothers you.</v>

547
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you've learned that you didn't die,</v>

548
00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:36.141
<v Speaker 3>but more importantly than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've learned that you could withstand </v>

549
00:28:36.141 --> 00:28:40.581
<v Speaker 3>the threat of death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you've learned and then you </v>

550
00:28:40.581 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 3>move a little closer and then you move a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little closer and then you move a little</v>

551
00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:42.750
<v Speaker 3>closer and finally you're back in.</v>

552
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.020
<v Speaker 3>What's no longer the elevator from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolic perspective.</v>

553
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:47.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a tomb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

554
00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:47.670
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

555
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:51.750
<v Speaker 3>it's a place of enclosure and isolation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you learn,</v>

556
00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turns out I can withstand that,</v>

557
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.590
<v Speaker 3>and then you're much more together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more confident,</v>

558
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 3>and that's often one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>often happens in situations like that.</v>

559
00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:07.341
<v Speaker 3>I've seen this multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if you run someone through an </v>

560
00:29:07.341 --> 00:29:10.020
<v Speaker 3>exposure training process like that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>toughen them up,</v>

561
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:15.350
<v Speaker 3>they'll often start standing up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people around them in a way they never </v>

562
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.441
<v Speaker 3>did before because they wouldn't stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>up for themselves before because they </v>

563
00:29:18.441 --> 00:29:20.250
<v Speaker 3>weren't willing to undermine the </v>
<v Speaker 3>protection.</v>

564
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.380
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're protecting me,</v>

565
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I can't bother you because I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>afford to forsake your protection,</v>

566
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.130
<v Speaker 3>so if I'm going to play that game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be high hide behind you,</v>

567
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.460
<v Speaker 3>then I can't challenge you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's no good because that's </v>

568
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 3>sometimes why people.</v>

569
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:42.560
<v Speaker 3>You see this with guys very frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still deathly afraid of their </v>

570
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 3>fathers judgment when they're in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>thirties or forties.</v>

571
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

572
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:49.981
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they still want to believe that </v>

573
00:29:49.981 --> 00:29:52.681
<v Speaker 3>there's someone out there that knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they're willing to accept the </v>

574
00:29:52.681 --> 00:29:53.950
<v Speaker 3>subjugation because it doesn't force </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to challenge.</v>

575
00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:58.951
<v Speaker 3>The idea that there's someone out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>that knows because that's the advantage </v>

576
00:29:58.951 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 3>of having your father as a judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

577
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.330
<v Speaker 3>Because he knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

578
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:06.331
<v Speaker 3>what if he doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if no one knows any better than </v>

579
00:30:06.331 --> 00:30:06.331
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

580
00:30:06.331 --> 00:30:10.231
<v Speaker 3>that's a rough thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't until you realize that you're </v>

581
00:30:10.231 --> 00:30:10.231
<v Speaker 3>not an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

582
00:30:10.231 --> 00:30:14.490
<v Speaker 3>That's really technically the point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>realization of adulthood is that no one </v>

583
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 3>actually knows what you should do more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than you do.</v>

584
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a horrible realization because what</v>

585
00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:23.551
<v Speaker 3>the hell do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrible realization and people </v>

586
00:30:23.551 --> 00:30:26.641
<v Speaker 3>will often pick slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>permanent slavery to the spirit of the </v>

587
00:30:26.641 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 3>great father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say over that realization and it's</v>

588
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:33.541
<v Speaker 3>completely understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem with it is that there's </v>

589
00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:36.961
<v Speaker 3>more to you than you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so if you continue to hide behind </v>

590
00:30:36.961 --> 00:30:40.351
<v Speaker 3>that figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you never have a chance to </v>

591
00:30:40.351 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 3>understand that there's more to you than</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think far more time than you think.</v>

592
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:46.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's enough to you so that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can actually withstand the threat of </v>

593
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:52.020
<v Speaker 3>mortality without collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even withstand the threat of </v>

594
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.170
<v Speaker 3>malevolence without collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

595
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.400
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not an abstract question,</v>

596
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:02.430
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the sort of question that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you address in the psychotherapeutic </v>

597
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:07.051
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always the question that you </v>

598
00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:09.361
<v Speaker 3>address and the answer is often in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>affirmative because people can get </v>

599
00:31:09.361 --> 00:31:13.711
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably tough and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people work in emergency wards </v>

600
00:31:13.711 --> 00:31:13.960
<v Speaker 3>in hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

601
00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Or they work in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in palliative care wards or they work as</v>

602
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:22.441
<v Speaker 3>mortuary assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these people have bloody rough </v>

603
00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:22.441
<v Speaker 3>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

604
00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:24.460
<v Speaker 3>are there on the front line of police </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation into,</v>

605
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:29.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highness child abuse crimes and so </v>

606
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:30.410
<v Speaker 3>they're confronting malevolence on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular basis and you know,</v>

607
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:35.460
<v Speaker 3>those are very stressful jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people do them and some people do </v>

608
00:31:35.561 --> 00:31:38.110
<v Speaker 3>them without even being damaged by them.</v>

609
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Although that's a harder thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see horrible things,</v>

610
00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:42.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things you will never forget.</v>

611
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:48.340
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would say the story in the story of</v>

612
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Adam and Eve is a Meta story and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>metta story for two reasons.</v>

613
00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:58.290
<v Speaker 3>One is it's about how stories transform </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Adam and Eve are in this </v>

614
00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.770
<v Speaker 3>unconscious paradise and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>collapses.</v>

615
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.530
<v Speaker 3>And that happens to every potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

616
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's niches realization.</v>

617
00:32:04.661 --> 00:32:05.290
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

618
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:10.770
<v Speaker 3>imagine that you live within a belief </v>
<v Speaker 3>system and then something arises to </v>

619
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:14.341
<v Speaker 3>challenge the belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only does the belief system </v>

620
00:32:14.341 --> 00:32:15.130
<v Speaker 3>collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something worse happens.</v>

621
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Your belief in belief systems collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the road tonight.</v>

622
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.780
<v Speaker 3>Now it doesn't have to because you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>jump from one belief system to another,</v>

623
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.350
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes that doesn't work is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do a medic critique and you say,</v>

624
00:32:26.351 --> 00:32:31.351
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was living in this protective </v>

625
00:32:31.351 --> 00:32:31.351
<v Speaker 3>structure and it turned out to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>flawed.</v>

626
00:32:31.351 --> 00:32:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One alternative is jumped to another </v>

627
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.131
<v Speaker 3>protective structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find another alternative is protective </v>

628
00:32:38.131 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 3>structures themselves are not to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>trusted.</v>

629
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in chaos.</v>

630
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.560
<v Speaker 3>How the hell are you going to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

631
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.620
<v Speaker 3>That's the pathway denialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While you can,</v>

632
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can work your way through that.</v>

633
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:51.320
<v Speaker 3>That's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you can do what young would regard as</v>

634
00:32:51.321 --> 00:32:56.321
<v Speaker 3>a soul damaging move and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>sacrifice your new knowledge and re </v>

635
00:32:56.321 --> 00:32:58.520
<v Speaker 3>identify with something real rigid and </v>
<v Speaker 3>restricted,</v>

636
00:32:58.521 --> 00:33:03.260
<v Speaker 3>which is what I would say is happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>to some degree with the people in Europe</v>

637
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.380
<v Speaker 3>who are turning to a regressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>nationalism.</v>

638
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 3>As an alternative to the current state </v>
<v Speaker 3>of chaos,</v>

639
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.340
<v Speaker 3>it's like I know that that people need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to identify with local groups.</v>

640
00:33:13.341 --> 00:33:16.160
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the risk,</v>

641
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:19.640
<v Speaker 3>the danger of making the state the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate God and that's order,</v>

642
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:21.680
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a good replacement for </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

643
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.900
<v Speaker 3>It's just another kind of catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

644
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.300
<v Speaker 3>Too much order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much chaos,</v>

645
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.800
<v Speaker 3>both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catastrophes.</v>

646
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:33.250
<v Speaker 3>You want to stand in the middle somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>and mediate between the two and that's </v>

647
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:37.031
<v Speaker 3>where you have your real strength </v>
<v Speaker 3>because then it isn't that you've </v>

648
00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:40.001
<v Speaker 3>discovered a safe place because even the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloody right wingers or after a safe </v>

649
00:33:40.001 --> 00:33:40.580
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

650
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.160
<v Speaker 3>They just want it to be the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

651
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:44.270
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

652
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:49.271
<v Speaker 3>there's no safe places and the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue is do you really want a safe </v>

653
00:33:49.271 --> 00:33:49.930
<v Speaker 3>place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you want?</v>

654
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:54.140
<v Speaker 3>You want to be so weak that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be protected from threat.</v>

655
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:59.470
<v Speaker 3>What the hell kind of life is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a paralyzed rabbit in a hole </v>

656
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.330
<v Speaker 3>that's no life for a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be confronting danger and the</v>

657
00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:07.331
<v Speaker 3>unknown and mlevel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because and the reason for that to </v>

658
00:34:07.331 --> 00:34:07.610
<v Speaker 3>his pit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the weird paradox.</v>

659
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I believe this is the paradox,</v>

660
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.410
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was discovered in part by a Buddha,</v>

661
00:34:12.411 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 3>but also laid forth very clearly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity,</v>

662
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:20.141
<v Speaker 3>which is that the p,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the solution to the problem of tragedy </v>

663
00:34:21.171 --> 00:34:26.080
<v Speaker 3>and malevolence is the willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 3>face the who the hell would ever guessed</v>

664
00:34:26.081 --> 00:34:27.890
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's completely paradoxical.</v>

665
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a completely paradoxical </v>
<v Speaker 3>suggestion,</v>

666
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.180
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

667
00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 3>why does it work well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the more you confront the two of</v>

668
00:34:35.361 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you grow and maybe you can grow</v>

669
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:42.821
<v Speaker 3>so that you're actually larger than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos and malevolence itself and you </v>

670
00:34:42.821 --> 00:34:42.821
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

671
00:34:42.821 --> 00:34:44.030
<v Speaker 3>what's the evidence for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's easy.</v>

672
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.450
<v Speaker 3>That's what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is how we learn.</v>

673
00:34:47.451 --> 00:34:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Like every time you expose your child to</v>
<v Speaker 3>something new,</v>

674
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.520
<v Speaker 3>a playground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they exposed to?</v>

675
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Chaos and malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's more to it than that </v>

676
00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.000
<v Speaker 3>obviously because kids play and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

677
00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:01.700
<v Speaker 3>they promote each other and they form </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendships and all of that,</v>

678
00:35:01.701 --> 00:35:06.701
<v Speaker 3>but in the playground itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is the complexity of the social </v>

679
00:35:06.701 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 3>structure and the malevolence of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bully.</v>

680
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:11.600
<v Speaker 3>It's right there and you throw your kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>in there and you say adapt,</v>

681
00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:13.280
<v Speaker 3>and they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

682
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:16.630
<v Speaker 3>so they can do it at a small scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not trivial,</v>

683
00:35:16.631 --> 00:35:18.530
<v Speaker 3>but the playground is a complicated </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

684
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.600
<v Speaker 3>The kid can adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

685
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:25.810
<v Speaker 3>how much can you scale that up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you scale that up to from the chaos </v>

686
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:31.661
<v Speaker 3>and order and malevolence of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>playground to chaos in order and </v>

687
00:35:31.661 --> 00:35:31.970
<v Speaker 3>malevolence itself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

688
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.130
<v Speaker 3>that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

689
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any reason to </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer that in the negative,</v>

690
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:43.300
<v Speaker 3>so because we don't know the full extent</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a human being and it is the problem </v>

691
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.340
<v Speaker 3>that's worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the Buddhist story,</v>

692
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:45.960
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens after,</v>

693
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.280
<v Speaker 3>so Buddha's world collapses in the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that Adam and Eve's world collapses,</v>

694
00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:54.480
<v Speaker 3>it's a consequence of repetitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposure to mortality and death.</v>

695
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:59.510
<v Speaker 3>What happens to Buddha as he realizes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the little protected city that his </v>

696
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:01.980
<v Speaker 3>father made for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the walled garden,</v>

697
00:36:01.981 --> 00:36:05.520
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same motif that's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this Adam and Eve story is,</v>

698
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.640
<v Speaker 3>is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's what it's.</v>

699
00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:13.230
<v Speaker 3>It's fatally flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kind of protection cannot exist and</v>

700
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:15.210
<v Speaker 3>he discovered that in pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

701
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Which is exactly what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 3>children is that they go out,</v>

702
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:23.600
<v Speaker 3>they discover a limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they run back and the parents can help </v>

703
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:23.600
<v Speaker 3>them with the limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run out,</v>

704
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 3>they discover limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run back,</v>

705
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.900
<v Speaker 3>but some at some point they run out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they discover a limit.</v>

706
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:32.901
<v Speaker 3>They run back and the parents have </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to say to them because they've </v>

707
00:36:32.901 --> 00:36:33.680
<v Speaker 3>hit the same limit that the parents hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like,</v>

708
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you gonna do with your life?</v>

709
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:40.670
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to operate in this </v>

710
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.670
<v Speaker 3>architectural universe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While your parents can only say,</v>

711
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:46.070
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can say you identify with the </v>

712
00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:46.500
<v Speaker 3>proper archetipal figures they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They at least act that out for you,</v>

713
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:50.910
<v Speaker 3>but at some point it's a problem that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they cannot solve for you without making</v>

714
00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:51.630
<v Speaker 3>you weaker.</v>

715
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:57.290
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's an interesting thing that I've </v>

716
00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.921
<v Speaker 3>learned in therapy because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things you have to learn as a therapist </v>

717
00:37:00.921 --> 00:37:03.780
<v Speaker 3>is how do you not take your client's </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems home with you?</v>

718
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:09.110
<v Speaker 3>It's very common existential problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>that beginning therapists face because </v>

719
00:37:09.781 --> 00:37:14.781
<v Speaker 3>they're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like while you're dealing with </v>

720
00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:14.781
<v Speaker 3>people all the time who have serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

721
00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:16.830
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although less frequently than you think,</v>

722
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.580
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes it's just that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a good catastrophe right there.</v>

723
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Their parents have cancer or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

724
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:25.020
<v Speaker 3>or their father has Alzheimer's and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're unemployed.</v>

725
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:30.050
<v Speaker 3>They have a drug problem or they have an</v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia son or like these aren't </v>

726
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:31.470
<v Speaker 3>mental illness problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

727
00:37:31.471 --> 00:37:36.471
<v Speaker 3>Those are just catastrophes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so people are discussing those with </v>

728
00:37:36.471 --> 00:37:39.891
<v Speaker 3>you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you avoid being crushed by that </v>

729
00:37:39.891 --> 00:37:39.891
<v Speaker 3>or avoid taking it home?</v>

730
00:37:39.891 --> 00:37:41.910
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>steal the problem,</v>

731
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.750
<v Speaker 3>that that's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have some problems.</v>

732
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.560
<v Speaker 3>If you come and talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll help you figure out how to solve </v>

733
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:51.690
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will not tell you how to solve.</v>

734
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:56.990
<v Speaker 3>I won't steal your problems because what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to do in therapy is number </v>

735
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:58.050
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>solve your problem.</v>

736
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn you into a great solver of </v>

737
00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.020
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the second one is way more important</v>

738
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:07.770
<v Speaker 3>than the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you never solve someone's problem</v>

739
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.160
<v Speaker 3>by removing from them the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>solve their problem.</v>

740
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.710
<v Speaker 3>That's theft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the eatables situation.</v>

741
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 3>That's the eatables situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the over protective mother.</v>

742
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:22.210
<v Speaker 3>No father can play that role too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about architectural </v>

743
00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:23.190
<v Speaker 3>representations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all protect you at the cost of</v>

744
00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:27.390
<v Speaker 3>your ability to protect yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wrong.</v>

745
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:29.100
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a sin.</v>

746
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:32.730
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not what you do with people,</v>

747
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 3>not with your children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not with your partner,</v>

748
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.210
<v Speaker 3>not with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't do that.</v>

749
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:42.040
<v Speaker 3>That destroys people's adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 3>competence and it and it disarms them in</v>

750
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 3>the face of chaos and malevolence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a terrible,</v>

751
00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:50.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>send someone out are unarmed in a world </v>

752
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.130
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible thing to do so.</v>

753
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:53.740
<v Speaker 3>And if people aren't strong enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>manage it,</v>

754
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:58.741
<v Speaker 3>then they get resentful and then when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the downhill spiral that goes </v>

755
00:38:58.741 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 3>along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

756
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:03.330
<v Speaker 3>so the Med is story is partly you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

757
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:08.460
<v Speaker 3>you have a map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's insufficient and things will </v>

758
00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 3>come up to disrupt it and sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>disruption is catastrophic.</v>

759
00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Everything falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens to the Buddha and </v>

760
00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.761
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens to Adam and eve and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the biblical stories are </v>

761
00:39:17.761 --> 00:39:18.760
<v Speaker 3>actually an attempt to put that back </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

762
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Now that that's been assembled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

763
00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:23.950
<v Speaker 3>it's been assembled over centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

764
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got the problem.</v>

765
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:30.660
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ever present reality of the </v>

766
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.770
<v Speaker 3>apocalyptic fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem,</v>

767
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:33.970
<v Speaker 3>and so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

768
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:38.971
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the insufficiency of all potential </v>

769
00:39:38.971 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 3>conceptual schemes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

770
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Your conceptual schemes are insufficient</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deal with the complexity of the </v>

771
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:44.220
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a permanent problem.</v>

772
00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:49.410
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You stop relying on your conceptual </v>

773
00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:49.410
<v Speaker 3>schemes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the answer.</v>

774
00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:54.390
<v Speaker 3>You start relying on your instead on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your ability to actively generate </v>

775
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:59.341
<v Speaker 3>conceptual schemes in the face of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 3>and malevolence and so that makes you </v>

776
00:39:59.441 --> 00:40:03.460
<v Speaker 3>someone that identifies with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative capacity,</v>

777
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:07.570
<v Speaker 3>your creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>courageous capacity for articulation and</v>

778
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:12.571
<v Speaker 3>action in the face of the unknown rather</v>
<v Speaker 3>than some formulaic approach to the </v>

779
00:40:12.571 --> 00:40:16.921
<v Speaker 3>territory and that is not and that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea is that that elevates your </v>

780
00:40:16.921 --> 00:40:21.451
<v Speaker 3>character to the point where you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>withstand tragedy and malevolence </v>

781
00:40:21.451 --> 00:40:24.961
<v Speaker 3>without becoming corrupt and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>provides a permanent solution to the </v>

782
00:40:24.961 --> 00:40:24.961
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

783
00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Well then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cynically,</v>

784
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.640
<v Speaker 3>what's your evidence that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanent solution and answer that is </v>

785
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 3>while the evidence isn't all in yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

786
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:40.021
<v Speaker 3>because people only live that way </v>
<v Speaker 3>partially and so we haven't put the </v>

787
00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:44.341
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis to the full test and second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what our limitations are.</v>

788
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.430
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea what our limitations are</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're.</v>

789
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.090
<v Speaker 3>They're both greater and lesser than we </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagined because you know,</v>

790
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:56.110
<v Speaker 3>you have to ask yourself like if people </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped adding voluntarily to the misery</v>

791
00:40:56.741 --> 00:41:00.430
<v Speaker 3>of the world and devoted themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 3>setting things straight,</v>

792
00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:02.920
<v Speaker 3>setting themselves straight and setting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things around them straight,</v>

793
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Speaker 3>what would happen and the answer to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

794
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:11.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be a hell of a lot less </v>

795
00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.591
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary misery in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that might not be a bad place to </v>

796
00:41:13.591 --> 00:41:13.600
<v Speaker 3>start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But apart from that,</v>

797
00:41:13.601 --> 00:41:18.601
<v Speaker 3>there's very little that we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could we overcome the catastrophe of </v>

798
00:41:18.601 --> 00:41:18.601
<v Speaker 3>mortality?</v>

799
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that's beyond our capacity?</v>

800
00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Could we make the world a place where no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one was suffering anymore than necessary</v>

801
00:41:25.781 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 3>and still allow the world to exist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

802
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.810
<v Speaker 3>possibly because we don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 3>limitations of our capacity.</v>

803
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.120
<v Speaker 3>We're only running it 40 percent if </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

804
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 3>I would say if we don't make full use of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people that are in the world,</v>

805
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:43.721
<v Speaker 3>we don't have our situation set up so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the gifts that they could offer to </v>

806
00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:49.151
<v Speaker 3>everyone are fully realized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We haven't set the systems up for that </v>

807
00:41:49.151 --> 00:41:53.651
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we waste people like mad and then we </v>

808
00:41:53.651 --> 00:41:56.271
<v Speaker 3>waste ourselves like mad and so I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>say this is something also.</v>

809
00:41:56.361 --> 00:42:01.361
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about the Old Testament </v>

810
00:42:01.361 --> 00:42:01.361
<v Speaker 3>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

811
00:42:01.361 --> 00:42:05.291
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the reasons that their </v>
<v Speaker 3>book has become so central is because </v>

812
00:42:05.291 --> 00:42:09.070
<v Speaker 3>what happens in the old testament after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fall is that Israel produces a </v>

813
00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.170
<v Speaker 3>series of states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

814
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 3>Rise of state and then a fall and then a</v>
<v Speaker 3>rise of another state and then a fall.</v>

815
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:16.970
<v Speaker 3>So it's the same thing except it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening at a political level.</v>

816
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.910
<v Speaker 3>The political state rises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets corrupt,</v>

817
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 3>it falls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it rises out of the ashes again,</v>

818
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:28.060
<v Speaker 3>gets corrupt and falls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that happened six times in the </v>

819
00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.851
<v Speaker 3>old testament and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very interesting is the reaction </v>

820
00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:33.110
<v Speaker 3>of the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always say it was our fault.</v>

821
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Instead of taking the Cain and Abel </v>
<v Speaker 3>route,</v>

822
00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:38.150
<v Speaker 3>so we're not going to tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kayden enabled story right away.</v>

823
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.950
<v Speaker 3>Instead of taking the Cain and Abel </v>
<v Speaker 3>route,</v>

824
00:42:39.951 --> 00:42:42.260
<v Speaker 3>they always say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the state collapsed,</v>

825
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 3>it was because we did something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very different than saying,</v>

826
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's arbitrary fate.</v>

827
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:53.320
<v Speaker 3>It's the nature of arbitrary fate or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of reality that we're doomed </v>

828
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.821
<v Speaker 3>to collapse into chaos and that's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>indication of the corruption of being.</v>

829
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.030
<v Speaker 3>While you can take that route if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

830
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 3>it's the corruption of being well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck with that.</v>

831
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.090
<v Speaker 3>So what are you going to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's easy start.</v>

832
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 3>You'll start to work for the destruction</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being.</v>

833
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:13.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what you will do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The alternative is to say,</v>

834
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.400
<v Speaker 3>this terrible thing happened and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my fault.</v>

835
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least that really opens you up to the</v>

836
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:24.071
<v Speaker 3>pathway to doing something about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's actually the case may be </v>

837
00:43:24.071 --> 00:43:26.030
<v Speaker 3>terrible things happen because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just not who you should be.</v>

838
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:27.830
<v Speaker 3>At least it's a night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

839
00:43:27.831 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 3>That's true to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

840
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.420
<v Speaker 3>You'd know it because things happen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you all the time and you think,</v>

841
00:43:32.421 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

842
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 3>if I just would've played that game </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight,</v>

843
00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:37.670
<v Speaker 3>if I were to put this thing in order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wouldn't have happened.</v>

844
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

845
00:43:38.571 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the ultimate extent of that?</v>

846
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Dostoyevsky said at one point that every</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being was not only responsible for</v>

847
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:50.951
<v Speaker 3>everything that happened to him or her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also simultaneously responsible for </v>

848
00:43:50.951 --> 00:43:52.040
<v Speaker 3>everything that happened to everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

849
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's A.</v>

850
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.720
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's almost a hallucinogenic</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>

851
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:57.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

852
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.500
<v Speaker 3>it's a transcendent idea and it can go </v>
<v Speaker 3>very wrong.</v>

853
00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes depressed people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

854
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:07.100
<v Speaker 3>get hyper responsible for what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened and just crushes them.</v>

855
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.390
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

856
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:12.080
<v Speaker 3>it's a mode of thinking that can produce</v>
<v Speaker 3>its attendant pathologies,</v>

857
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.320
<v Speaker 3>but there's something about it that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about it that's </v>

858
00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.830
<v Speaker 3>metaphysically true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

859
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to tell you the story of </v>

860
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I really liked this story.</v>

861
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:24.610
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

862
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.810
<v Speaker 3>it's very short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only about a paragraph long,</v>

863
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:31.811
<v Speaker 3>which is very interesting because it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of these examples where it's </v>

864
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:32.850
<v Speaker 3>like a genie.</v>

865
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:38.060
<v Speaker 3>That story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much condensed into it that </v>

866
00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.620
<v Speaker 3>it's almost unbelievable and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>even ambiguity condensed into it,</v>

867
00:44:40.621 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very,</v>

868
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:46.581
<v Speaker 3>very interesting because it actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes the story more complex and </v>

869
00:44:46.581 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me tell you the story now.</v>

870
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:49.920
<v Speaker 3>The first thing I want to tell you some </v>
<v Speaker 3>things about the story first,</v>

871
00:44:49.921 --> 00:44:54.921
<v Speaker 3>so we've got the original paradisical </v>
<v Speaker 3>state and then the collapse and so now </v>

872
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:56.340
<v Speaker 3>metaphysically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in,</v>

873
00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:01.370
<v Speaker 3>we're in the collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in when we're in the post fall </v>

874
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 3>condition were still occupying a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythological landscape,</v>

875
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't history as we normally </v>

876
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.970
<v Speaker 3>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's at history,</v>

877
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:11.990
<v Speaker 3>so when we talk about Cain and Abel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cain and Abel were actually talking </v>

878
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 3>about the first two real human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>because Adam and eve,</v>

879
00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 3>they were created by God and being we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>in paradise,</v>

880
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:22.380
<v Speaker 3>and so that's not the normative </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition of human beings,</v>

881
00:45:22.381 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

882
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.390
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a special time.</v>

883
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:29.660
<v Speaker 3>That's outside of normal time and space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cane enabled by contrast there in </v>

884
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:34.311
<v Speaker 3>history because in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>history actually starts a couple of </v>

885
00:45:34.311 --> 00:45:34.311
<v Speaker 3>times in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

886
00:45:34.311 --> 00:45:39.201
<v Speaker 3>It starts with the creation of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It starts with the formation of the </v>

887
00:45:39.201 --> 00:45:39.450
<v Speaker 3>garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It starts with the fall.</v>

888
00:45:39.451 --> 00:45:42.950
<v Speaker 3>It starts with Cain and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It starts over again with Noah,</v>

889
00:45:42.951 --> 00:45:47.951
<v Speaker 3>and then it starts with Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really where what we would </v>

890
00:45:47.951 --> 00:45:48.570
<v Speaker 3>recognize more as conventional history </v>
<v Speaker 3>begins,</v>

891
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.360
<v Speaker 3>so there's a number of starts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

892
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 3>but this is one of the Cain and Abel are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first two human beings.</v>

893
00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the adversarial brothers,</v>

894
00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:00.570
<v Speaker 3>hero and adversary there types of Christ</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Satan,</v>

895
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.920
<v Speaker 3>so well known supposition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that hostile brother Motif,</v>

896
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.720
<v Speaker 3>while it's an architectural motif and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hostile brothers are the part of you</v>

897
00:46:09.721 --> 00:46:14.721
<v Speaker 3>that's striving for the light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one half and the part of you </v>

898
00:46:14.721 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 3>that's embracing the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's part of you.</v>

899
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.930
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the social structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's seth and Cyrus.</v>

900
00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.540
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the natural order in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

901
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:28.380
<v Speaker 3>That's the benevolent and destructive </v>
<v Speaker 3>elements of nature,</v>

902
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:33.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that negativity running through </v>

903
00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:36.261
<v Speaker 3>all the architectural representations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but cain and Abel are the hostile </v>

904
00:46:36.261 --> 00:46:39.831
<v Speaker 3>brothers and the Kay Kane is roughly </v>
<v Speaker 3>that part of you that says,</v>

905
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hell with it and means it right,</v>

906
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:48.050
<v Speaker 3>and that means you will work for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>own pain and destruction at the same </v>

907
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 3>time that you're working for the pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and destruction,</v>

908
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:54.680
<v Speaker 3>not only of your brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all but more particularly of the </v>

909
00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.830
<v Speaker 3>brother that you admire because that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually a lot more entertaining,</v>

910
00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:00.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're gonna become destructive and </v>

911
00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 3>you go destroy something bad that hardly</v>
<v Speaker 3>qualifies as destruction.</v>

912
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:08.190
<v Speaker 3>What you want to do is find something </v>
<v Speaker 3>great and destroyed that.</v>

913
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:10.830
<v Speaker 3>That's destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's revanche.</v>

914
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:15.510
<v Speaker 3>None of this putting punishment where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>deserves to be.</v>

915
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.720
<v Speaker 3>What you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is partly why the story of </v>

916
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Christ is archetipal and archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

917
00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 3>When you cannot push beyond what's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst possible punishment,</v>

918
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.470
<v Speaker 3>what's the worst possible punishment </v>
<v Speaker 3>meted out for the least the least,</v>

919
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 3>the most innocent person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hit an archetypical and there so you</v>

920
00:47:32.831 --> 00:47:36.080
<v Speaker 3>define most innocent person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do that anyway.</v>

921
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.210
<v Speaker 3>You want to find most innocent person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Define worst possible punishment,</v>

922
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:45.450
<v Speaker 3>conjoin the two things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get an archetypal story and the </v>

923
00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:46.120
<v Speaker 3>reason for that is you can't push beyond</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

924
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:50.320
<v Speaker 3>and so if you want to destroy something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to destroy an ideal,</v>

925
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:55.590
<v Speaker 3>not something that's flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so cain and Abel are set up exactly </v>

926
00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:58.891
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll read you the story and I'll </v>

927
00:47:58.891 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 3>interleave some interpretations along </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

928
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.020
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Adam knew eve,</v>

929
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:07.021
<v Speaker 3>his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she conceived and bore Cain and </v>

930
00:48:07.021 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have gotten demand from the Lord,</v>

931
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:11.890
<v Speaker 3>and she again bare his brother Abel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abel was a keeper of sheep,</v>

932
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 3>but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</v>

933
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so April's a shepherd and Cain is a </v>

934
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.940
<v Speaker 3>farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shepherd is a archetypal symbol </v>

935
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:27.930
<v Speaker 3>because the shepherd is the leader of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>flock and the shepherd is the heroic </v>

936
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:31.981
<v Speaker 3>leader of a flock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason this is Middle Eastern </v>

937
00:48:31.981 --> 00:48:31.981
<v Speaker 3>mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

938
00:48:31.981 --> 00:48:31.981
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were a shepherd,</v>

939
00:48:31.981 --> 00:48:36.930
<v Speaker 3>what did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You took your slingshot in your stick </v>

940
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:37.000
<v Speaker 3>and you defended your nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>juicy,</v>

941
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:39.430
<v Speaker 3>plump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious sheep against Lions,</v>

942
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was no joke,</v>

943
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:41.850
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

944
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:46.880
<v Speaker 3>you were a tough cookie if you were a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shepherd because while you were acting </v>

945
00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.821
<v Speaker 3>as the guardian of of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're acting as the Guardian against </v>

946
00:48:50.821 --> 00:48:51.490
<v Speaker 3>predation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

947
00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:53.290
<v Speaker 3>and you aren't armed very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

948
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.630
<v Speaker 3>well you can just think about it for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute.</v>

949
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.610
<v Speaker 3>It's time to think about fighting off a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lion with a,</v>

950
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.630
<v Speaker 3>with a slingshot or with a bow and Arrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>or with a spear.</v>

951
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:04.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have to have a lot of courage</v>
<v Speaker 3>to manage that,</v>

952
00:49:04.661 --> 00:49:09.661
<v Speaker 3>especially successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Abel was a keeper of sheep and Cain </v>

953
00:49:09.661 --> 00:49:11.170
<v Speaker 3>was a tiller of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't as heroic role.</v>

954
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.320
<v Speaker 3>And so right off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get this dichotomy between the two </v>

955
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.340
<v Speaker 3>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also of great interest that Cain is</v>

956
00:49:18.341 --> 00:49:20.890
<v Speaker 3>the older brother and Abel is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger brother.</v>

957
00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:25.891
<v Speaker 3>And you see that very frequently in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythology because the older brother is </v>

958
00:49:25.891 --> 00:49:26.440
<v Speaker 3>the one that's privileged by status,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

959
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:28.870
<v Speaker 3>So he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got privilege,</v>

960
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Kate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's the elder brother.</v>

961
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:35.880
<v Speaker 3>That also means that if there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>possessions to be handed down to </v>

962
00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.000
<v Speaker 3>generations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the older brother gets them.</v>

963
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interestingly enough,</v>

964
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:44.130
<v Speaker 3>pain has privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not the one that's favored by </v>

965
00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.651
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That and I think that's absolutely it's </v>

966
00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:48.370
<v Speaker 3>absolutely brilliant that it's set up </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way because it's actually able.</v>

967
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Who doesn't have the right that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first board has who actually turns into </v>

968
00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:55.990
<v Speaker 3>the person who's the proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of the ideal?</v>

969
00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:58.030
<v Speaker 3>It's because cane has things given to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

970
00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.650
<v Speaker 3>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's great.</v>

971
00:49:59.651 --> 00:50:02.020
<v Speaker 3>He's privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a wonderful thing for cane.</v>

972
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:07.260
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't be so sure about that and partly </v>

973
00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.650
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>find because of many of you will be well</v>

974
00:50:08.651 --> 00:50:13.651
<v Speaker 3>off when you have children is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with being reasonably wealthy </v>

975
00:50:13.651 --> 00:50:18.031
<v Speaker 3>when you have children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that you deprive them of privation </v>

976
00:50:18.031 --> 00:50:22.440
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of what makes people </v>
<v Speaker 3>mature is necessity and if you have,</v>

977
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:27.690
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have more money than you know </v>

978
00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:29.551
<v Speaker 3>what to do with roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to say no to your </v>

979
00:50:29.551 --> 00:50:32.150
<v Speaker 3>children when they want something </v>
<v Speaker 3>because why are you going to say no?</v>

980
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.740
<v Speaker 3>You can just provide it.</v>

981
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes you think that that's what </v>

982
00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:39.250
<v Speaker 3>you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can have anything you want.</v>

983
00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens?</v>

984
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:43.790
<v Speaker 3>You devalue what you want and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>desires continued to grow.</v>

985
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not very helpful,</v>

986
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:50.000
<v Speaker 3>so it's not obvious at all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>providing people with an excess,</v>

987
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:55.030
<v Speaker 3>let's say a privilege is something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good for them from a </v>

988
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:57.971
<v Speaker 3>psychological perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to hit the proper limitations </v>

989
00:50:57.971 --> 00:51:02.740
<v Speaker 3>and if you're a fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes very difficult to deprive </v>

990
00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:05.480
<v Speaker 3>your children properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you'll,</v>

991
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:10.540
<v Speaker 3>you'll fight with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big problem and that's what </v>

992
00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:10.540
<v Speaker 3>happens when you get spoiled children </v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>

993
00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get every.</v>

994
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:13.910
<v Speaker 3>They get everything by doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

995
00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 3>that's not a good lesson because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't work in the world.</v>

996
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.890
<v Speaker 3>It'll work very counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee,</v>

997
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:24.440
<v Speaker 3>and in process of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it came to pass that cain brought of the</v>

998
00:51:24.441 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 3>fruit of the ground and offering unto </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lord and Abel.</v>

999
00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.560
<v Speaker 3>He also brought of the firstlings of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>flock and of the fat thereof,</v>

1000
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:33.500
<v Speaker 3>and the Lord had respect unto Abel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>his offering,</v>

1001
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.740
<v Speaker 3>but unto Cain and his offering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had no respect and Cain was very </v>

1002
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.000
<v Speaker 3>wroth angry and his countenance fell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1003
00:51:41.001 --> 00:51:46.001
<v Speaker 3>so again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a tremendous amount packed into </v>

1004
00:51:46.001 --> 00:51:48.431
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the first time that we see the </v>

1005
00:51:48.431 --> 00:51:48.431
<v Speaker 3>motif of sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1006
00:51:48.431 --> 00:51:53.231
<v Speaker 3>And so I mentioned to you before how </v>
<v Speaker 3>these archaic people conceptualize the </v>

1007
00:51:53.231 --> 00:51:53.450
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1008
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:58.451
<v Speaker 3>It's a dome with a disk of land and </v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath that a disc of water fresh </v>

1009
00:52:00.141 --> 00:52:01.700
<v Speaker 3>and underneath that a disc of salt </v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

1010
00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:05.180
<v Speaker 3>So that's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then up in the heavens,</v>

1011
00:52:05.181 --> 00:52:07.850
<v Speaker 3>that's where God is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so God's up in the sky.</v>

1012
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:10.850
<v Speaker 3>And we talked about why that might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>and part of that is,</v>

1013
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the night sky,</v>

1014
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:17.770
<v Speaker 3>you look at what transcends your current</v>
<v Speaker 3>reality and you look at what inspires </v>

1015
00:52:17.781 --> 00:52:18.380
<v Speaker 3>our.</v>

1016
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:22.580
<v Speaker 3>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God exists where all is experienced,</v>

1017
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a perfectly reasonable.</v>

1018
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:29.950
<v Speaker 3>That's a perfectly reasonable hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think that what you're trying </v>

1019
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:30.950
<v Speaker 3>to do is formulate what constitutes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent.</v>

1020
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Because if you exist within a conceptual</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure and you encountered that which</v>

1021
00:52:35.691 --> 00:52:40.691
<v Speaker 3>is outside the conceptual structure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will feel all and that's a </v>

1022
00:52:40.691 --> 00:52:42.320
<v Speaker 3>combination of fear paralysis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1023
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:46.700
<v Speaker 3>And the combination of overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility and you can experience that.</v>

1024
00:52:46.701 --> 00:52:48.920
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to a great piece of music,</v>

1025
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:51.860
<v Speaker 3>what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hair on the back of your neck stands</v>

1026
00:52:51.861 --> 00:52:53.180
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1027
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Because you're a prey animal and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just puffed up to look bigger.</v>

1028
00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.800
<v Speaker 3>That's why you have that experience is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pilot erection and it's part of all.</v>

1029
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.970
<v Speaker 3>So when you see a cat puff up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a big dog is in front of it,</v>

1030
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.770
<v Speaker 3>that's what the cats feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1031
00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.780
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puff.</v>

1032
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you encountered that,</v>

1033
00:53:11.451 --> 00:53:15.050
<v Speaker 3>which transcends your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your limited sphere of apprehension than</v>

1034
00:53:15.051 --> 00:53:16.880
<v Speaker 3>you experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or you look at the night sky,</v>

1035
00:53:16.881 --> 00:53:18.860
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Music can do that.</v>

1036
00:53:18.861 --> 00:53:22.160
<v Speaker 3>And all sorts of things that we do can </v>
<v Speaker 3>evoke that sense.</v>

1037
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:27.520
<v Speaker 3>And so they located the transcendent </v>
<v Speaker 3>value in that which inspired off fight </v>

1038
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:34.040
<v Speaker 3>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you can argue about the utility of </v>

1039
00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.950
<v Speaker 3>the personification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1040
00:53:34.951 --> 00:53:39.951
<v Speaker 3>Because God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the father was personified in human </v>

1041
00:53:39.951 --> 00:53:39.951
<v Speaker 3>form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a very sophisticated idea too</v>

1042
00:53:39.951 --> 00:53:42.510
<v Speaker 3>because as we already found in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 3>Testament,</v>

1043
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:47.890
<v Speaker 3>there is an association between whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is Yahuah or below him and and </v>

1044
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:54.411
<v Speaker 3>creating order out of chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about each individual human </v>

1045
00:53:54.411 --> 00:53:57.360
<v Speaker 3>being and so I don't believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>personification of God,</v>

1046
00:53:57.361 --> 00:54:01.800
<v Speaker 3>the father in the Old Testament is </v>
<v Speaker 3>archaic and primitive at all.</v>

1047
00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.920
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated things that people ever </v>

1048
00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:06.920
<v Speaker 3>developed.</v>

1049
00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.280
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent value is the capacity to </v>

1050
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.230
<v Speaker 3>generate order out of chaos using </v>
<v Speaker 3>linguistic ability,</v>

1051
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:18.260
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that each person has that as an </v>

1052
00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:21.201
<v Speaker 3>essential element of their being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like argue with fat far you get </v>

1053
00:54:21.201 --> 00:54:25.160
<v Speaker 3>that is one hell of a vicious </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptualization and I would also say </v>

1054
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.940
<v Speaker 3>it's the bedrock upon which our legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>system rests so you don't move that </v>

1055
00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:33.470
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You move that and many things fall and </v>

1056
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.470
<v Speaker 3>there are things that you may say you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't believe,</v>

1057
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:35.550
<v Speaker 3>but you act them out all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1058
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:38.940
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't act them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people would set you straight very,</v>

1059
00:54:38.941 --> 00:54:42.480
<v Speaker 3>very rapidly because basically what </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people want from you,</v>

1060
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.850
<v Speaker 3>even though they don't conceptualize it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in this terms,</v>

1061
00:54:44.851 --> 00:54:49.290
<v Speaker 3>is that you accord them the respect due </v>
<v Speaker 3>the the incarnation of the logos.</v>

1062
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.620
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it means to interact</v>
<v Speaker 3>with someone properly.</v>

1063
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.220
<v Speaker 3>So it's you can say what you want about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you believe.</v>

1064
00:54:56.221 --> 00:54:58.500
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter what matters is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you act out.</v>

1065
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.840
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1066
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.900
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now we have this conceptualization of</v>

1067
00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:08.901
<v Speaker 3>what's transcendent that's emerged as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>part partially perhaps as emotional </v>

1068
00:55:08.901 --> 00:55:11.880
<v Speaker 3>contagion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that which inspires awe is that which is</v>

1069
00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:16.881
<v Speaker 3>transcendent and it's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>these underlying ideas about the </v>

1070
00:55:16.881 --> 00:55:20.691
<v Speaker 3>creation of order out of chaos and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantiation of that spirit in human </v>

1071
00:55:20.691 --> 00:55:21.600
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all lurking in the background,</v>

1072
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:24.900
<v Speaker 3>and then we have this other idea which </v>
<v Speaker 3>we already talked about,</v>

1073
00:55:24.901 --> 00:55:29.901
<v Speaker 3>which is that there is a patriarchal or </v>
<v Speaker 3>paternal spirit that represents the </v>

1074
00:55:29.901 --> 00:55:31.860
<v Speaker 3>community at large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stretched across time.</v>

1075
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.440
<v Speaker 3>You can think about that as the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ancestors,</v>

1076
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 3>so it's the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the president,</v>

1077
00:55:36.361 --> 00:55:38.190
<v Speaker 3>but that's also projected into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1078
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:43.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bargain with four year life in the </v>

1079
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:46.671
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sacrifice myself to get a </v>

1080
00:55:46.671 --> 00:55:46.671
<v Speaker 3>degree.</v>

1081
00:55:46.671 --> 00:55:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the spirit of my culture will </v>

1082
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 3>reward me in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the sacrifice.</v>

1083
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.810
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1084
00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were chimpanzees for God's sake.</v>

1085
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:57.330
<v Speaker 3>It took us a long time to figure this </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1086
00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:02.570
<v Speaker 3>Chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't sacrifice the present for the </v>

1087
00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:02.570
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1088
00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:06.201
<v Speaker 3>you gotta ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long did it take human beings to </v>

1089
00:56:06.201 --> 00:56:08.190
<v Speaker 3>figure out that there was a future and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then what to do about it?</v>

1090
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:13.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't something we didn't go from </v>

1091
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.670
<v Speaker 3>chimpanzees to fully articulated human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in one,</v>

1092
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:18.440
<v Speaker 3>in one step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was created knowledge in that was </v>

1093
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.690
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did we learn from observation?</v>

1094
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:26.680
<v Speaker 3>Something like storing up goods for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future helps us live.</v>

1095
00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Imagine how difficult that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1096
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:31.120
<v Speaker 3>marriage and that you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a farmer.</v>

1097
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Back when it was an extraordinarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are barely scraping out a living </v>

1098
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:36.580
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

1099
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.590
<v Speaker 3>It was hand to mouth at best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1100
00:56:38.591 --> 00:56:41.470
<v Speaker 3>so now it's winter and you've got your </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn seeds in your cellar,</v>

1101
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do?</v>

1102
00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:44.680
<v Speaker 3>You're starving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eat them,</v>

1103
00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:50.420
<v Speaker 3>or are you going to wait and plant them </v>
<v Speaker 3>again in the spring because that's your </v>

1104
00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.341
<v Speaker 3>damn choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the people who decided to eat </v>

1105
00:56:53.341 --> 00:56:55.510
<v Speaker 3>them while some of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to save them died,</v>

1106
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:58.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say more of the people who decided</v>

1107
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:03.091
<v Speaker 3>to eat them died and so this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge was was gathered in </v>

1108
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable agony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get what what you have what </v>

1109
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.601
<v Speaker 3>you want right now for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing because you're very much </v>

1110
00:57:12.601 --> 00:57:13.060
<v Speaker 3>accustomed to getting what you want all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time right now,</v>

1111
00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:16.720
<v Speaker 3>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to people who live from hand to</v>

1112
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:20.110
<v Speaker 3>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but back when things were much rougher,</v>

1113
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:24.490
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you had to sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 3>something of value now to be paid off in</v>

1114
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:24.940
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>

1115
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a rough thing to accept.</v>

1116
00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what happened?</v>

1117
00:57:28.131 --> 00:57:33.131
<v Speaker 3>So people figured this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somehow they figured out that you could </v>

1118
00:57:33.131 --> 00:57:36.421
<v Speaker 3>make an offering of something you valued</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that might help set the world </v>

1119
00:57:36.421 --> 00:57:37.930
<v Speaker 3>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they conceptualize that?</v>

1120
00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:41.830
<v Speaker 3>While they conceptualized it ritually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were acting it out to begin with.</v>

1121
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Piagetian idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when I,</v>

1122
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:50.410
<v Speaker 3>when I look at that top part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking is this right?</v>

1123
00:57:50.411 --> 00:57:55.411
<v Speaker 3>It's the adjustment of my body to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>shape of the Cup as part of my </v>

1124
00:57:55.411 --> 00:57:55.420
<v Speaker 3>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1125
00:57:55.421 --> 00:58:00.421
<v Speaker 3>Piaget's PA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one IMPINJ's great observations is that </v>

1126
00:58:00.421 --> 00:58:04.440
<v Speaker 3>we use our bodies to represent things </v>
<v Speaker 3>long before we understand what it is </v>

1127
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:08.941
<v Speaker 3>that we're representing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say no more than we act </v>

1128
00:58:08.941 --> 00:58:10.000
<v Speaker 3>things out were dramatic creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1129
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:15.030
<v Speaker 3>We use drama and the the sacrificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>ritual is a drama that points to a </v>

1130
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:21.301
<v Speaker 3>higher psychological truth and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher psychological truth is let go of </v>

1131
00:58:21.301 --> 00:58:25.441
<v Speaker 3>what's him let go of what you value now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and perhaps that will pay off multi </v>

1132
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.370
<v Speaker 3>manifold in the future.</v>

1133
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:29.470
<v Speaker 3>You're making a bargain and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might say,</v>

1134
00:58:29.471 --> 00:58:31.120
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are you making a bargain with?</v>

1135
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.310
<v Speaker 3>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well nature,</v>

1136
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 3>but that's not exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not exactly right because let's say</v>

1137
00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:43.261
<v Speaker 3>I have something of value in the social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the social organization and I'm going</v>

1138
00:58:44.591 --> 00:58:46.650
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to let it go because I'm.</v>

1139
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:50.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm relying on a corresponding reward or</v>
<v Speaker 3>a greater reward in the future.</v>

1140
00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a contractual relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

1141
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:57.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not a relationship with nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that we've organized ourselves into</v>

1142
00:58:57.521 --> 00:59:02.521
<v Speaker 3>a social structure and we're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintain the integrity of the social </v>

1143
00:59:02.521 --> 00:59:06.340
<v Speaker 3>structure across time so that if I give </v>
<v Speaker 3>up something now,</v>

1144
00:59:06.341 --> 00:59:11.341
<v Speaker 3>I can be paid for it in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the rule of the deal is that we're </v>

1145
00:59:11.341 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 3>going to try to keep the future the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the president so that those contracts</v>

1146
00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 3>can be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can be met in the future.</v>

1147
00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:19.750
<v Speaker 3>That's money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what money is,</v>

1148
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:21.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's some money.</v>

1149
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.930
<v Speaker 3>You've made a sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you get the money.</v>

1150
00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:29.050
<v Speaker 3>What is the money signify?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a promise from the community that </v>

1151
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:34.690
<v Speaker 3>the Labor that you invested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can be stored and then brought </v>

1152
00:59:36.081 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 3>forward for your own purposes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1153
00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:40.730
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually part of the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>contract.</v>

1154
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:45.731
<v Speaker 3>So the thing you're sacrificing to is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the spirit of society that produces the </v>

1155
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:51.161
<v Speaker 3>social contract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's conceptualized as God the </v>

1156
00:59:51.161 --> 00:59:51.161
<v Speaker 3>father.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1157
00:59:51.161 --> 00:59:53.450
<v Speaker 3>how else would you conceptualize it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1158
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.150
<v Speaker 3>it's the spirit of the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy.</v>

1159
00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:58.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the right way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the.</v>

1160
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
<v Speaker 3>It's what's common across all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>members of the dominance hierarchy </v>

1161
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.000
<v Speaker 3>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1162
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.260
<v Speaker 3>it's something you can negotiate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>true or not,</v>

1163
01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:08.660
<v Speaker 3>but what the hell do you think you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing when you make a contract?</v>

1164
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.670
<v Speaker 3>What's the law?</v>

1165
01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:15.700
<v Speaker 3>It's all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the manifestation of that </v>

1166
01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:16.220
<v Speaker 3>patriarchal spirit across time and space</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what do you do?</v>

1167
01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:17.840
<v Speaker 3>You sacrifice to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1168
01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:20.300
<v Speaker 3>so back 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1169
01:00:20.301 --> 01:00:21.350
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1170
01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.780
<v Speaker 3>however old the story as it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>older than that,</v>

1171
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:29.080
<v Speaker 3>this is the best people could do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>regards to realization and they go to </v>

1172
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.990
<v Speaker 3>quite right because they also noted that</v>
<v Speaker 3>God was happier if you actually </v>

1173
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:37.331
<v Speaker 3>sacrificed something of value and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a tremendous complexity and not </v>

1174
01:00:38.091 --> 01:00:39.800
<v Speaker 3>idea because one of the things I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1175
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:41.180
<v Speaker 3>and this is something you've pointed </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1176
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.180
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're miserable and unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1177
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:49.460
<v Speaker 3>here's a cure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find what's valuable and let it go.</v>

1178
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.680
<v Speaker 3>So we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1179
01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:56.681
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's a relationship that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's relationship with your </v>

1180
01:00:56.681 --> 01:00:56.681
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1181
01:00:56.681 --> 01:00:58.880
<v Speaker 3>And the relationship is pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're locked into it.</v>

1182
01:00:58.881 --> 01:01:03.881
<v Speaker 3>You value it and no wonder because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a relationship with your parents and </v>

1183
01:01:03.881 --> 01:01:04.100
<v Speaker 3>your suffering terribly because of it.</v>

1184
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>

1185
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a sacrifice and the idea is that,</v>

1186
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:11.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll clear the future for you.</v>

1187
01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:17.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very frequently when people are </v>

1188
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.761
<v Speaker 3>suffering terribly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not always because sometimes you just </v>

1189
01:01:18.761 --> 01:01:19.940
<v Speaker 3>suffer stupidly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blindly and without recourse,</v>

1190
01:01:19.941 --> 01:01:22.250
<v Speaker 3>you know you get cancer and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>die,</v>

1191
01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.530
<v Speaker 3>so we have no idea how to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1192
01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:29.830
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes the reason that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering is because you just won't let </v>

1193
01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:30.680
<v Speaker 3>go of the thing that's biting you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think,</v>

1194
01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:35.681
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't let go of on and I've had </v>

1195
01:01:35.681 --> 01:01:37.301
<v Speaker 3>clients like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't stop communicating with my </v>

1196
01:01:37.301 --> 01:01:39.461
<v Speaker 3>mother who phones me three times a day </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday of my life and never says </v>

1197
01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:40.310
<v Speaker 3>anything that isn't unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>critical and demeaning.</v>

1198
01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.350
<v Speaker 3>I can't let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1199
01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.250
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1200
01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.890
<v Speaker 3>that's not such a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The funny thing too,</v>

1201
01:01:47.891 --> 01:01:49.960
<v Speaker 3>often when people let something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that go,</v>

1202
01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.440
<v Speaker 3>it goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts itself out and then comes back so </v>

1203
01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.161
<v Speaker 3>they don't even end up losing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unless they're willing to let it go </v>

1204
01:01:59.161 --> 01:01:59.980
<v Speaker 3>to sacrifice that they make no headway </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>

1205
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.400
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the rules is if people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>impeding your development,</v>

1206
01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.080
<v Speaker 3>you sacrifice your relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1207
01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:09.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

1208
01:02:09.731 --> 01:02:10.900
<v Speaker 3>very rough rule.</v>

1209
01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:11.910
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

1210
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:21.010
<v Speaker 3>in process of time it came to pass that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cain brought of the fruit of the ground </v>

1211
01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 3>and offering unto the Lord and Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also brought of the firstlings of his</v>

1212
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:25.160
<v Speaker 3>flock and of the fat thereof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's interesting.</v>

1213
01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where a close reading matters,</v>

1214
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:30.320
<v Speaker 3>so we don't know what Kane's offering </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1215
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:35.390
<v Speaker 3>It's not much described,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we do know something about ables </v>

1216
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 3>offering and what we know is that by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>standards of the time,</v>

1217
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:42.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a high quality offering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the firstborn and it's the fat </v>

1218
01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:42.450
<v Speaker 3>high calorie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1219
01:02:42.451 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1220
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.580
<v Speaker 3>we think of fat as a dietary danger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're hungry,</v>

1221
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:49.380
<v Speaker 3>that's really wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1222
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Because fat is unbelievably high </v>
<v Speaker 3>calorie,</v>

1223
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:56.570
<v Speaker 3>and so what's happening is the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>points out quite clearly that what able </v>

1224
01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:57.330
<v Speaker 3>decides to offer to God is of high </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality.</v>

1225
01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.890
<v Speaker 3>So it's the real thing.</v>

1226
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 3>It's the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1227
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:02.220
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's paying a price.</v>

1228
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then it's burned.</v>

1229
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.420
<v Speaker 3>While why is it burned?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1230
01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:12.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is back again thinking from an </v>

1231
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:12.060
<v Speaker 3>archaic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1232
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.201
<v Speaker 3>gods in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't throw your lamb up into the </v>

1233
01:03:15.201 --> 01:03:15.660
<v Speaker 3>sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll just fall back down and so,</v>

1234
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:20.810
<v Speaker 3>but people knew because they've mastered</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire that smoke and savor rose and so </v>

1235
01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:25.020
<v Speaker 3>you can detect the quality of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>offering as a consequence of burning.</v>

1236
01:03:25.021 --> 01:03:30.021
<v Speaker 3>And then that would go up in the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the fire would go up to the sky and </v>

1237
01:03:30.021 --> 01:03:32.970
<v Speaker 3>God could detect whether or not you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>offering was of reasonable quality.</v>

1238
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:35.340
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's concretized obviously,</v>

1239
01:03:35.341 --> 01:03:40.341
<v Speaker 3>but you don't want to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumption that the people who were our </v>

1240
01:03:40.341 --> 01:03:43.460
<v Speaker 3>forebears were stupid just because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought using metaphors that aren't the </v>

1241
01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:47.961
<v Speaker 3>same as our metaphors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were still mapping out the damn </v>

1242
01:03:47.961 --> 01:03:47.961
<v Speaker 3>territory.</v>

1243
01:03:47.961 --> 01:03:47.961
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1244
01:03:47.961 --> 01:03:49.020
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you look,</v>

1245
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:54.021
<v Speaker 3>you can read a book like you're above </v>
<v Speaker 3>the authors of the book or you can read </v>

1246
01:03:54.021 --> 01:03:55.860
<v Speaker 3>a book as if it might have something to </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach you.</v>

1247
01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:01.580
<v Speaker 3>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well sometimes the book isn't worth </v>

1248
01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.130
<v Speaker 3>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if a book has been around for a very</v>

1249
01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:07.131
<v Speaker 3>long period of time and a very large </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of people have thought that </v>

1250
01:04:07.131 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 3>perhaps there's something in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they're right.</v>

1251
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:14.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a tricky thing and it might </v>

1252
01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:16.851
<v Speaker 3>also depend on how you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've found that this sort of </v>

1253
01:04:16.851 --> 01:04:20.421
<v Speaker 3>investigation was a lot more useful if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>started from the presupposition that </v>

1254
01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 3>maybe there was something I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of,</v>

1255
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:23.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so funny.</v>

1256
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:28.791
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I taught a first year course about 10 </v>

1257
01:04:28.791 --> 01:04:31.701
<v Speaker 3>years ago on the psychology of religion </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was so interesting dealing with </v>

1258
01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:35.271
<v Speaker 3>the 18 year old students because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are completely dismissive of religious </v>

1259
01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:35.310
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

1260
01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:36.480
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1261
01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:38.760
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know anything yet.</v>

1262
01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:43.890
<v Speaker 3>You have this specific kind of blindness</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a set of very intelligent social </v>

1263
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 3>psychologists also identified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was blindness blindness.</v>

1264
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Because it actually turns out that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>least,</v>

1265
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:53.850
<v Speaker 3>the less you know about a topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you'll overestimate the quality</v>

1266
01:04:53.851 --> 01:04:55.740
<v Speaker 3>of your knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I thought,</v>

1267
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:55.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1268
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000
<v Speaker 3>we're in this situation where kids who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who don't even know how to act in the </v>

1269
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:01.650
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know anything,</v>

1270
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.800
<v Speaker 3>will come to university and start off </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a proposition that they're astute </v>

1271
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.580
<v Speaker 3>critics of Judeo Christian culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which of which they know nothing.</v>

1272
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:11.130
<v Speaker 3>They know nothing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They knew nothing about history.</v>

1273
01:05:11.131 --> 01:05:13.650
<v Speaker 3>They know nothing about philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing about literature,</v>

1274
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:18.830
<v Speaker 3>but they're absolutely certain that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're correct there in the criticisms </v>

1275
01:05:18.830 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 3>that they're bringing forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely unbelievable.</v>

1276
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:27.300
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not helpful because then you </v>

1277
01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.260
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to learn and you want.</v>

1278
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:34.950
<v Speaker 3>Well she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what happens if you don't </v>

1279
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.950
<v Speaker 3>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1280
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:36.040
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it looks like ables doing a good job.</v>

1281
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:41.670
<v Speaker 3>That's the implication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The story doesn't say Abel is doing a </v>

1282
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:44.770
<v Speaker 3>really good job with his sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just hints at it.</v>

1283
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.890
<v Speaker 3>And I liked that because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it leaves that ambiguity.</v>

1284
01:05:47.891 --> 01:05:52.891
<v Speaker 3>It's like maybe you're working really </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard and your brother's working really </v>

1285
01:05:52.891 --> 01:05:56.941
<v Speaker 3>hard and you really can't tell the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between your quality of work </v>

1286
01:05:56.941 --> 01:06:00.331
<v Speaker 3>and his quality of work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for some reason he succeeding like </v>

1287
01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:00.490
<v Speaker 3>map that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1288
01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Because there's an arbitrary element to </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1289
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.800
<v Speaker 3>And so the story he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the Lord has respect unto Abel and </v>

1290
01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:11.380
<v Speaker 3>his offering and there's an implication </v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe the reason for that is that,</v>

1291
01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:16.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>canes offerings are a little second </v>

1292
01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:18.781
<v Speaker 3>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the story doesn't come over and out </v>

1293
01:06:18.781 --> 01:06:18.781
<v Speaker 3>and club you over the head with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>

1294
01:06:18.781 --> 01:06:20.560
<v Speaker 3>It just leaves it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as an ambiguous possibility.</v>

1295
01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:25.561
<v Speaker 3>And the reason for that is sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sacrifices and maybe they're even </v>

1296
01:06:25.561 --> 01:06:27.250
<v Speaker 3>real ones and they don't pay off or they</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay off for someone better.</v>

1297
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:32.550
<v Speaker 3>And so there is this arbitrary nature of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the transcendent that you're </v>

1298
01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:37.501
<v Speaker 3>attempting to deal with it rewards and </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't reward more or less of its own </v>

1299
01:06:37.501 --> 01:06:42.061
<v Speaker 3>accord or there's an element of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's ambiguous in the text even </v>

1300
01:06:42.061 --> 01:06:45.250
<v Speaker 3>though there's a hint that perhaps Abel </v>
<v Speaker 3>is doing a better job than kate.</v>

1301
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.160
<v Speaker 3>So I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very sophisticated.</v>

1302
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:51.010
<v Speaker 3>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1303
01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Kane makes his offerings and God isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy with them.</v>

1304
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Now we don't know how cain figures out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that God isn't happy with his offerings.</v>

1305
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:03.630
<v Speaker 3>We get some hints of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the story does tell us that's what </v>

1306
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:07.141
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then we get the psychological </v>

1307
01:07:07.141 --> 01:07:07.141
<v Speaker 3>response on the part of cane.</v>

1308
01:07:07.141 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 3>Now one response could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

1309
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:11.440
<v Speaker 3>I must be doing something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I better straighten myself out,</v>

1310
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I better come up with a better quality </v>

1311
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.170
<v Speaker 3>offering and try that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That isn't what happens.</v>

1312
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:22.440
<v Speaker 3>What happens instead is that cane </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes angry wroth and his countenance </v>

1313
01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.170
<v Speaker 3>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what does that mean?</v>

1314
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:24.750
<v Speaker 3>It means this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1315
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:29.470
<v Speaker 3>It means he is not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's angry and out for revenge.</v>

1316
01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.680
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about this a lot </v>

1317
01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.951
<v Speaker 3>lately with regards to the literature on</v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality because there's a very good </v>

1318
01:07:37.951 --> 01:07:39.040
<v Speaker 3>literature that shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1319
01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:40.390
<v Speaker 3>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1320
01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:45.480
<v Speaker 3>there's a measure called the Gini </v>
<v Speaker 3>Coefficient and the Gini Coefficient is </v>

1321
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.980
<v Speaker 3>a numerical index of the relative </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality of a geographical locale.</v>

1322
01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:53.340
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you went to Newfoundland where </v>

1323
01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:53.340
<v Speaker 3>everyone is roughly not very rich or </v>
<v Speaker 3>North Dakota,</v>

1324
01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:57.160
<v Speaker 3>say almost everyone there is say lower </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle class,</v>

1325
01:07:57.161 --> 01:07:58.930
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or upper working class,</v>

1326
01:07:58.931 --> 01:07:59.560
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1327
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:02.800
<v Speaker 3>Very little variability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low Gini Coefficient,</v>

1328
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:05.320
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go to Miami Beach,</v>

1329
01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:07.870
<v Speaker 3>say where everyone's rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low gini coefficient,</v>

1330
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:12.220
<v Speaker 3>because it isn't an index of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealth or absolute poverty,</v>

1331
01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:15.710
<v Speaker 3>it's an index of relative poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if everyone's rich,</v>

1332
01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:18.050
<v Speaker 3>the relative poverty is low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if everyone's poor,</v>

1333
01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:23.140
<v Speaker 3>the relative poverty is low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now one question is where's the crime?</v>

1334
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:24.860
<v Speaker 3>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1335
01:08:24.861 --> 01:08:28.520
<v Speaker 3>the crime is where the absolute poverty </v>
<v Speaker 3>is high,</v>

1336
01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or the absolute wealth is low.</v>

1337
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:32.360
<v Speaker 3>That's where the crime is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong.</v>

1338
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:38.470
<v Speaker 3>If it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If things are relatively distributed in </v>

1339
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.400
<v Speaker 3>an egalitarian manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the male on male crime,</v>

1340
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 3>especially homicide is low and it's also</v>
<v Speaker 3>the case where everyone is rich.</v>

1341
01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.890
<v Speaker 3>But if you go into places where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>some rich people but not very many,</v>

1342
01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:53.980
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparatively poor than the male </v>

1343
01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:57.041
<v Speaker 3>homicide rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rates and violent crime rates amp up </v>

1344
01:08:57.041 --> 01:08:57.041
<v Speaker 3>substantially.</v>

1345
01:08:57.041 --> 01:08:58.700
<v Speaker 3>And it's a consequence of male on male </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition,</v>

1346
01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:04.180
<v Speaker 3>and so what you could derive from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe even reasonably is that you </v>

1347
01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:08.501
<v Speaker 3>should flatten out the damn income into </v>
<v Speaker 3>distribution because you're </v>

1348
01:09:08.501 --> 01:09:10.760
<v Speaker 3>destabilizing the society by </v>
<v Speaker 3>facilitating male criminal aggression.</v>

1349
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.920
<v Speaker 3>You can make a good case for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1350
01:09:12.921 --> 01:09:17.921
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in places like Columbia where the Gini </v>

1351
01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Coefficient got unbelievably extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>society got so violent that it could </v>

1352
01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:21.530
<v Speaker 3>barely hold itself together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1353
01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.800
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make a conservative argument for</v>

1354
01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:29.801
<v Speaker 3>redistribution of income using the </v>
<v Speaker 3>observation that if the income </v>

1355
01:09:29.801 --> 01:09:33.341
<v Speaker 3>distribution gets too extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole bloody thing starts to </v>

1356
01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:33.341
<v Speaker 3>destabilize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might fall,</v>

1357
01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:34.880
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you also might say,</v>

1358
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:40.110
<v Speaker 3>well wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it any quality that's driving the </v>

1359
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:43.310
<v Speaker 3>violence or is it resentment of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality that's driving the violence?</v>

1360
01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough question because you </v>

1361
01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:49.240
<v Speaker 3>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1362
01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:49.910
<v Speaker 3>what if the game is rigged and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no way of moving up the power hierarchy?</v>

1363
01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Well then maybe anger and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the desire for revolution is the </v>

1364
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:58.361
<v Speaker 3>appropriate response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't really mean to me that </v>

1365
01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:01.780
<v Speaker 3>the response should be that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that you see in hygienic </v>

1366
01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.170
<v Speaker 3>coefficient neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is interracial,</v>

1367
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:08.240
<v Speaker 3>intra racial violence between men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

1368
01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:10.490
<v Speaker 3>in neighborhoods where there's high </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder rates,</v>

1369
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:15.110
<v Speaker 3>the murders are always between young men</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're always within race.</v>

1370
01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:20.860
<v Speaker 3>And so that doesn't seem to me to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly a politically revolutionary </v>

1371
01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:20.860
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1372
01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:24.070
<v Speaker 3>It's more like it's more like a violent </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition for the sake of,</v>

1373
01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of attaining status.</v>

1374
01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.650
<v Speaker 3>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's reasonable,</v>

1375
01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:32.651
<v Speaker 3>but because the inequality is there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>men need to find status because it's </v>

1376
01:10:32.651 --> 01:10:37.091
<v Speaker 3>part of what drives them forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of what makes them attractive </v>

1377
01:10:37.091 --> 01:10:37.091
<v Speaker 3>to women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a necessity.</v>

1378
01:10:37.091 --> 01:10:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question is,</v>

1379
01:10:37.551 --> 01:10:41.660
<v Speaker 3>do you attain status through destruction</v>
<v Speaker 3>or do you start making your offerings,</v>

1380
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:43.100
<v Speaker 3>putting your offerings in order?</v>

1381
01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:48.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's something we really need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out because that's a fundamental </v>

1382
01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:48.770
<v Speaker 3>political question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fundamental political question.</v>

1383
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens in this story is that cane </v>

1384
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:56.921
<v Speaker 3>decides that the fact that God isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>accepting his offerings means that he's </v>

1385
01:10:56.921 --> 01:10:59.810
<v Speaker 3>entitled to become angry and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1386
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.960
<v Speaker 3>and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's those two things or both put </v>

1387
01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:04.960
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1388
01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.300
<v Speaker 3>He's raw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's angry,</v>

1389
01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.510
<v Speaker 3>and he's also depressed and so he's in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>state of mind that,</v>

1390
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.600
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the best characterization for </v>

1391
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:13.770
<v Speaker 3>that is hostile resentment because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfair.</v>

1392
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:14.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1393
01:11:14.821 --> 01:11:16.710
<v Speaker 3>it's unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what going to do about it?</v>

1394
01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Can you get destructive about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are going to change your approach?</v>

1395
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kane,</v>

1396
01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:25.470
<v Speaker 3>he does the ultimate thing and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what people do when they do the ultimate</v>

1397
01:11:25.471 --> 01:11:30.471
<v Speaker 3>thing because that kind of hostile </v>
<v Speaker 3>resentment has an architectural end </v>

1398
01:11:30.471 --> 01:11:34.901
<v Speaker 3>point and the architectural end point is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point that you get when you're </v>

1399
01:11:34.901 --> 01:11:38.631
<v Speaker 3>hostile and resentful because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't been successful and then you go </v>

1400
01:11:38.631 --> 01:11:42.051
<v Speaker 3>sit in your mother's basement for about </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years and then you start imagining </v>

1401
01:11:42.051 --> 01:11:45.681
<v Speaker 3>just how nice it would be if you shut up</v>
<v Speaker 3>the local high school so that everybody </v>

1402
01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:48.771
<v Speaker 3>knew your name and what happens is you </v>
<v Speaker 3>go from I'm irritated because things </v>

1403
01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:50.220
<v Speaker 3>aren't working out for me very well too.</v>

1404
01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine and a hate.</v>

1405
01:11:51.631 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Those people for whom things are working</v>
<v Speaker 3>out well too.</v>

1406
01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm irritated and I hate the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is set up so that this has </v>

1407
01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.651
<v Speaker 3>happened to me and then you go to well </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm irritated and hate the </v>

1408
01:12:03.651 --> 01:12:04.020
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do whatever I can that will</v>

1409
01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:08.700
<v Speaker 3>destroy most rapidly and with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the highest possible amount of pain</v>

1410
01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:13.701
<v Speaker 3>and suffering conceivable and at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>point then you don't just go shoot up </v>

1411
01:12:13.701 --> 01:12:18.141
<v Speaker 3>the high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go up and shoot up the elementary </v>

1412
01:12:18.141 --> 01:12:20.211
<v Speaker 3>school and so if you're wondering what </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of pathway people walk down to get </v>

1413
01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:24.531
<v Speaker 3>to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the pathway and the ultimate cap </v>

1414
01:12:24.531 --> 01:12:24.531
<v Speaker 3>of that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1415
01:12:24.531 --> 01:12:24.740
<v Speaker 3>I'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1416
01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:29.850
<v Speaker 3>I'll kill the kids because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we already know that killing the </v>

1417
01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:33.021
<v Speaker 3>innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot more effective than </v>

1418
01:12:33.021 --> 01:12:33.021
<v Speaker 3>killing the guilty and then just to cap </v>
<v Speaker 3>it off,</v>

1419
01:12:33.021 --> 01:12:36.381
<v Speaker 3>I'll blow my head off at the end just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>show you just how God damn pointless it </v>

1420
01:12:36.381 --> 01:12:36.381
<v Speaker 3>all is.</v>

1421
01:12:36.381 --> 01:12:40.020
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the logical extension of </v>
<v Speaker 3>keynes attitude and you might think,</v>

1422
01:12:40.021 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 3>well that's a bit of an overriding and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>will say it's not an overriding and all.</v>

1423
01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:47.700
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly what happens in the text.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's exactly what follows it so far.</v>

1424
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.180
<v Speaker 3>So Kane is not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so who was he not happy with?</v>

1425
01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not happy with God.</v>

1426
01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.880
<v Speaker 3>And so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1427
01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:01.970
<v Speaker 3>we've already unpacked this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not happy with the social contract </v>

1428
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:03.300
<v Speaker 3>because that's part of the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the patriarchal spirit,</v>

1429
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:08.301
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's more to it than that </v>

1430
01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:09.210
<v Speaker 3>because we already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've already analyzed what God,</v>

1431
01:13:09.211 --> 01:13:11.730
<v Speaker 3>the idea of God might represent in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background of this story.</v>

1432
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:16.850
<v Speaker 3>He's not happy with the transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not happy with the idea of the </v>

1433
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.850
<v Speaker 3>logos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

1434
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:22.220
<v Speaker 3>No faith in the transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing but he does nothing but despise </v>

1435
01:13:22.241 --> 01:13:27.241
<v Speaker 3>the social contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's got no faith whatsoever in the </v>

1436
01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:30.780
<v Speaker 3>logo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's say the word that brings chaos </v>

1437
01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.291
<v Speaker 3>out of order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's all got nothing but contempt for </v>

1438
01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:33.291
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1439
01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:33.630
<v Speaker 3>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1440
01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:35.580
<v Speaker 3>people like that and if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1441
01:13:35.581 --> 01:13:40.581
<v Speaker 3>you just go on youtube and read the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments and you'll see all sorts of </v>

1442
01:13:40.581 --> 01:13:40.581
<v Speaker 3>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1443
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:44.310
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so God has a little chat with him and he</v>

1444
01:13:44.311 --> 01:13:44.680
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1445
01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:47.970
<v Speaker 3>W W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you angry and and why?</v>

1446
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Why are you upset?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And cain says,</v>

1447
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.250
<v Speaker 3>and God says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do well,</v>

1448
01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:56.250
<v Speaker 3>won't you be accepted?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't do well,</v>

1449
01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.400
<v Speaker 3>sin lies at your door and unto thee </v>
<v Speaker 3>shall be his desire and thou shalt rule </v>

1450
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:01.590
<v Speaker 3>over him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1451
01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a very mangled translation I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would say.</v>

1452
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:10.100
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to take it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what God says is while you're angry </v>

1453
01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:10.110
<v Speaker 3>and you're upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1454
01:14:10.111 --> 01:14:11.650
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your problem?</v>

1455
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:16.090
<v Speaker 3>And then God tells kate if you did </v>
<v Speaker 3>things properly,</v>

1456
01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 3>they would work out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1457
01:14:17.651 --> 01:14:22.651
<v Speaker 3>it's the last thing he wants to hear it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what cain wants to believe is </v>

1458
01:14:22.651 --> 01:14:25.801
<v Speaker 3>that the reason he's not doing very well</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because there's no sense having any </v>

1459
01:14:25.801 --> 01:14:26.770
<v Speaker 3>faith in the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The transcendent is,</v>

1460
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:31.890
<v Speaker 3>is evil and aimed exactly against him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the entire social contract is </v>

1461
01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:32.980
<v Speaker 3>faulty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he wants to hear,</v>

1462
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 3>but that isn't what God says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God says,</v>

1463
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

1464
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:38.800
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're doing something wrong.</v>

1465
01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1466
01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:44.080
<v Speaker 3>that's maybe a worse message than </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else is corrupt.</v>

1467
01:14:44.081 --> 01:14:49.081
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're having a problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're just not everything you </v>

1468
01:14:49.081 --> 01:14:49.081
<v Speaker 3>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1469
01:14:49.081 --> 01:14:51.730
<v Speaker 3>and then God says something really nasty</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't tell from this lines.</v>

1470
01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:55.030
<v Speaker 3>I read a bunch of translations to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out exactly what it meant.</v>

1471
01:14:55.031 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 3>So this is what God tells kate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1472
01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 3>you're in a room in a house and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something at the door,</v>

1473
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 3>and he uses a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God uses metaphor.</v>

1474
01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:10.860
<v Speaker 3>It's a sexually aroused predatory cat </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you invited in even invited.</v>

1475
01:15:12.101 --> 01:15:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that it has evil intent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You invited in to mate with you,</v>

1476
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're.</v>

1477
01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.710
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's union with you.</v>

1478
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.660
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this malevolent force,</v>

1479
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:27.870
<v Speaker 3>this sexual union with you has produced </v>
<v Speaker 3>an offspring and that offspring is what </v>

1480
01:15:28.421 --> 01:15:33.421
<v Speaker 3>possesses you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so not only have you done something </v>

1481
01:15:33.421 --> 01:15:33.421
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've,</v>

1482
01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:39.330
<v Speaker 3>you've invited the spirit of wrong doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>into your life and you creatively </v>

1483
01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:43.261
<v Speaker 3>intermingled it with it voluntarily to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring forth a monster of your own </v>

1484
01:15:43.391 --> 01:15:45.670
<v Speaker 3>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what God tells Kane.</v>

1485
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:46.450
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

1486
01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.580
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bad enough that God says,</v>

1487
01:15:50.581 --> 01:15:52.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should get your act together because</v>

1488
01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:57.170
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's why things aren't going so </v>
<v Speaker 3>well for you before you criticize the </v>

1489
01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:58.650
<v Speaker 3>transcendent and the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of being.</v>

1490
01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're doing something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's worse than that.</v>

1491
01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:03.270
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only are you doing something wrong,</v>

1492
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:06.720
<v Speaker 3>you bloody well know you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something wrong and you and you're doing</v>

1493
01:16:06.721 --> 01:16:11.721
<v Speaker 3>it creatively and with intent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so not only are things not going well </v>

1494
01:16:11.721 --> 01:16:15.591
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've played a creative role in </v>

1495
01:16:15.591 --> 01:16:17.970
<v Speaker 3>producing that situation and so god </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically says,</v>

1496
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:21.210
<v Speaker 3>I am taking zero responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 3>rejecting your sacrifice.</v>

1497
01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:25.200
<v Speaker 3>It's all on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so kane leaves and he's like,</v>

1498
01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.320
<v Speaker 3>seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Happy with that response because he </v>

1499
01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.340
<v Speaker 3>wanted to hear Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pat,</v>

1500
01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:35.400
<v Speaker 3>you're a victim of circumstance and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's conspiring against you.</v>

1501
01:16:35.401 --> 01:16:40.401
<v Speaker 3>And really being God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should get my act together and just </v>

1502
01:16:40.401 --> 01:16:40.401
<v Speaker 3>give you what you want.</v>

1503
01:16:40.401 --> 01:16:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Because obviously being God I'm wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're right.</v>

1504
01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Well that isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly the opposite of that.</v>

1505
01:16:46.081 --> 01:16:47.850
<v Speaker 3>It's completely on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

1506
01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.580
<v Speaker 3>that's the judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so kane leaves and believe me,</v>

1507
01:16:50.581 --> 01:16:52.530
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was wroth before it.</v>

1508
01:16:52.531 --> 01:16:56.400
<v Speaker 3>His countenance had fallen before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's nothing like it is now.</v>

1509
01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.980
<v Speaker 3>And so he's hits the next stage and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinks,</v>

1510
01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:02.160
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take my revenge.</v>

1511
01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:07.340
<v Speaker 3>What am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find the most innocent and </v>

1512
01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:08.670
<v Speaker 3>worthwhile thing that's favored of God </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to kill it.</v>

1513
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.970
<v Speaker 3>And that's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't matter.</v>

1514
01:17:10.971 --> 01:17:14.390
<v Speaker 3>That's his brother and able.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know we're drawing the inference.</v>

1515
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Ables done the right things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone likes him.</v>

1516
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Everything's flourishing for Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a good guy.</v>

1517
01:17:19.611 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 3>He's one of those people that you meet </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has everything,</v>

1518
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:23.600
<v Speaker 3>and then you meet them and you wish you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could hate them,</v>

1519
01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:25.310
<v Speaker 3>but you can't because they're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good people.</v>

1520
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:28.700
<v Speaker 3>And then you're really hate them because</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only do they have everything,</v>

1521
01:17:28.701 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 3>but it appears that they deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing that sort of sits in</v>

1522
01:17:32.151 --> 01:17:34.880
<v Speaker 3>your soul and rots it more than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>realization.</v>

1523
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:39.620
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the situation with Cain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And cain thinks Cain talked with Abel,</v>

1524
01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:44.621
<v Speaker 3>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it came to pass when they were in </v>

1525
01:17:44.621 --> 01:17:44.630
<v Speaker 3>the field that Cain rose up against </v>
<v Speaker 3>Abel,</v>

1526
01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:46.100
<v Speaker 3>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and slew him.</v>

1527
01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:49.820
<v Speaker 3>So that's so interesting because look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what happens to cane here.</v>

1528
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.470
<v Speaker 3>So he's not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's separated from the transcendent and</v>

1529
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:59.471
<v Speaker 3>from society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's bitterly resentful and now he goes </v>

1530
01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:01.430
<v Speaker 3>out and kills the very thing that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>most wants to be.</v>

1531
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.860
<v Speaker 3>So he destroys his own ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1532
01:18:03.861 --> 01:18:08.410
<v Speaker 3>He just demolishes his own ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how far his resentment has pushed</v>

1533
01:18:08.411 --> 01:18:09.290
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's,</v>

1534
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.770
<v Speaker 3>he's done right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't matter because it enables</v>

1535
01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:13.700
<v Speaker 3>them to take revenge.</v>

1536
01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.560
<v Speaker 3>So he doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1537
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:20.590
<v Speaker 3>it's like the suicidal school shooter </v>
<v Speaker 3>that blows off his head at the end of </v>

1538
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:21.200
<v Speaker 3>his mayhem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it doesn't matter to him.</v>

1539
01:18:21.201 --> 01:18:25.640
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the same art form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Lord says unto Cain,</v>

1540
01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:28.190
<v Speaker 3>where is Abel lie brother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And cain said,</v>

1541
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1542
01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Am I my brother's keeper?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While that's a good question,</v>

1543
01:18:31.981 --> 01:18:34.370
<v Speaker 3>and that's why it's posed in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they answered that it's supposed</v>

1544
01:18:34.371 --> 01:18:36.590
<v Speaker 3>to be yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And God says,</v>

1545
01:18:36.591 --> 01:18:41.591
<v Speaker 3>what have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Voice of your brother's blood cries </v>

1546
01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:44.381
<v Speaker 3>unto me from the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually the Motif that </v>

1547
01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky explorers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say in crime and punishment,</v>

1548
01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:53.620
<v Speaker 3>because what happens is that was calling</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coffee's cane for all intents and </v>

1549
01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:54.200
<v Speaker 3>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he commits a murder,</v>

1550
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:58.180
<v Speaker 3>but he gets away with it well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he thinks so.</v>

1551
01:18:58.181 --> 01:19:01.820
<v Speaker 3>He thinks no one suspected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He buries the money.</v>

1552
01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:05.960
<v Speaker 3>He can't stand to touch the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He buries it in a in an abandoned lot,</v>

1553
01:19:05.961 --> 01:19:08.990
<v Speaker 3>and he's drawn there now and then to </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at where it is,</v>

1554
01:19:08.991 --> 01:19:13.991
<v Speaker 3>but he can't touch it because the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny because the money before </v>

1555
01:19:14.031 --> 01:19:19.031
<v Speaker 3>he kills the pawnbroker is not the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the money after he kills the pawn </v>

1556
01:19:19.031 --> 01:19:23.791
<v Speaker 3>broker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the risk only cough before he kills </v>

1557
01:19:23.791 --> 01:19:26.891
<v Speaker 3>the pawnbroker is not the same as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>risk and cost after he kills the pole </v>

1558
01:19:26.891 --> 01:19:26.891
<v Speaker 3>broker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1559
01:19:26.891 --> 01:19:31.690
<v Speaker 3>they're not the same at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the scarlet macaw is tormented by</v>

1560
01:19:32.451 --> 01:19:33.320
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>

1561
01:19:33.321 --> 01:19:36.710
<v Speaker 3>but not from the external world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sets the crime up quite nicely.</v>

1562
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:42.010
<v Speaker 3>It's that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this spirit against which he </v>

1563
01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.981
<v Speaker 3>transgressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tortures him from within and there's no </v>

1564
01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:48.581
<v Speaker 3>escape from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so eventually what happens in crime </v>

1565
01:19:48.581 --> 01:19:51.431
<v Speaker 3>and punishment is was called Nicole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cough continues to manifest himself as </v>

1566
01:19:51.431 --> 01:19:55.751
<v Speaker 3>guilty in every possible way until he </v>
<v Speaker 3>receives the punishment that he desires </v>

1567
01:19:55.751 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 3>because it's the only way that he can </v>
<v Speaker 3>set things right.</v>

1568
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:59.390
<v Speaker 3>He actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually,</v>

1569
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:05.080
<v Speaker 3>he essentially turns himself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually because he can't tolerate </v>

1570
01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.620
<v Speaker 3>what he's done so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the idea.</v>

1571
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.440
<v Speaker 2>The Voice of your brother's blood cries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm to me from the ground.</v>

1572
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:18.500
<v Speaker 2>It's guilt and now you're cursed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth which has opened her mouth to </v>

1573
01:20:19.651 --> 01:20:22.320
<v Speaker 2>receive your brother's blood from thy </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

1574
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:28.250
<v Speaker 2>When you till the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will not henceforth yield to you its </v>

1575
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.920
<v Speaker 2>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fugitive and a vagabond,</v>

1576
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:31.510
<v Speaker 2>shall thou be in the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1577
01:20:31.511 --> 01:20:36.511
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why does God not just strike caden </v>

1578
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:41.000
<v Speaker 2>dead?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And answer to that perhaps is that </v>

1579
01:20:42.901 --> 01:20:47.070
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be sufficient punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

1580
01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:50.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's the punishment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live with what you did.</v>

1581
01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want anybody taking you out </v>

1582
01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:57.600
<v Speaker 2>either because then you won't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live with what you did.</v>

1583
01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:01.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's the punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And cain says unto the Lord,</v>

1584
01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:03.340
<v Speaker 2>my punishment is greater than I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear.</v>

1585
01:21:03.370 --> 01:21:04.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1586
01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:09.780
<v Speaker 2>behold you have driven me out this day </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the face of the earth and from thy </v>

1587
01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:13.081
<v Speaker 2>face shall I be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same as what happens to Adam </v>

1588
01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:13.081
<v Speaker 2>in the garden of Eden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

1589
01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Adam hides from God and he has his </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>

1590
01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:19.060
<v Speaker 2>And now cain is alienated from God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no real,</v>

1591
01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:24.810
<v Speaker 2>there's no reconstructing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship he's put himself by </v>

1592
01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:28.711
<v Speaker 2>violating his contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but say with the transcendent and also </v>

1593
01:21:28.711 --> 01:21:29.950
<v Speaker 2>with society and also with his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit,</v>

1594
01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:32.920
<v Speaker 2>he's put himself outside the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>of redemption.</v>

1595
01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:36.400
<v Speaker 2>And that's why he says the punishment is</v>
<v Speaker 2>greater than I can bear.</v>

1596
01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.380
<v Speaker 2>There's no hope left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1597
01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:40.840
<v Speaker 2>So he's in hell for all intents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>purposes,</v>

1598
01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:49.240
<v Speaker 2>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has driven me out to stay from the </v>

1599
01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:49.240
<v Speaker 2>face of the earth and from thy face </v>
<v Speaker 2>shall I be hidden.</v>

1600
01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the earth.</v>

1601
01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And it shall come to pass that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who finds me will kill me,</v>

1602
01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:57.910
<v Speaker 2>and God says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore whoever slayeth Cain,</v>

1603
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.490
<v Speaker 2>vengeance shall be taken on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven fold.</v>

1604
01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:04.720
<v Speaker 2>And the Lord set a mark onto Cain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lest any finding him should kill him.</v>

1605
01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

1606
01:22:05.901 --> 01:22:07.930
<v Speaker 2>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why in the world would God protect cane?</v>

1607
01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next part of the story actually </v>

1608
01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 2>tells you that you have a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a family.</v>

1609
01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Your brother kills my son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do I do?</v>

1610
01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:22.200
<v Speaker 2>I come and I kill your father and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>cousin and then you think,</v>

1611
01:22:22.331 --> 01:22:24.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I killed your father and your cousin.</v>

1612
01:22:24.581 --> 01:22:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come back and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill four of your people.</v>

1613
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:29.710
<v Speaker 2>And then I come back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1614
01:22:29.890 --> 01:22:32.200
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 16 to you this time.</v>

1615
01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.990
<v Speaker 2>And then you come back and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 a,</v>

1616
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:38.110
<v Speaker 2>let's try for 32.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this is what happens.</v>

1617
01:22:38.111 --> 01:22:41.290
<v Speaker 2>This is actually why justice systems are</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up by the way you go.</v>

1618
01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:46.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of reasons justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems are set up and one is to punish </v>

1619
01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:46.720
<v Speaker 2>the guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>

1620
01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:51.900
<v Speaker 2>The other is to have the guilty repent </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's to to maintain social order.</v>

1621
01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:57.210
<v Speaker 2>That's three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's another one that no one ever </v>

1622
01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:58.000
<v Speaker 2>thinks about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back 30 years ago,</v>

1623
01:22:59.170 --> 01:23:04.170
<v Speaker 2>the governor of Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose name I forget was running for </v>

1624
01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:05.110
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and while he was governor,</v>

1625
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he</v>

1626
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:08.770
<v Speaker 3>had released a number of prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of whom his name was,</v>

1627
01:23:08.771 --> 01:23:12.460
<v Speaker 3>I think Willie Horton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really matter.</v>

1628
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:15.400
<v Speaker 3>And when Willy was released on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>program,</v>

1629
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.940
<v Speaker 3>he went out and raped someone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps killed them.</v>

1630
01:23:18.941 --> 01:23:20.320
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>

1631
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:25.630
<v Speaker 3>The rape is good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the governor was asked during a </v>

1632
01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:30.391
<v Speaker 3>debate what he would do if a release </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoner had raped his daughter or his </v>

1633
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:33.780
<v Speaker 3>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he gave a very weak answer.</v>

1634
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was his name?</v>

1635
01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.050
<v Speaker 3>He gave a very weak answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something about,</v>

1636
01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:40.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>letting the law take its due course.</v>

1637
01:23:40.811 --> 01:23:42.100
<v Speaker 3>And that's the wrong answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1638
01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:47.220
<v Speaker 3>The right answer is I would be compelled</v>
<v Speaker 3>with every fiber of my being to hunt </v>

1639
01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:50.320
<v Speaker 3>that person down and to tear them into </v>
<v Speaker 3>bits,</v>

1640
01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.560
<v Speaker 3>but I won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1641
01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:53.860
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1642
01:23:53.861 --> 01:23:58.861
<v Speaker 3>what's the purpose of the justice system</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to alleviate you from the </v>

1643
01:23:58.861 --> 01:24:01.720
<v Speaker 3>responsibility of revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's for,</v>

1644
01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.590
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kill one.</v>

1645
01:24:05.591 --> 01:24:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I killed two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kill for kill eight,</v>

1646
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.960
<v Speaker 3>you kill 16 and soon everyone's at war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so God protects cane to stop that </v>

1647
01:24:14.531 --> 01:24:19.531
<v Speaker 3>from happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stop the feud from emerging because </v>

1648
01:24:19.531 --> 01:24:22.711
<v Speaker 3>those things can go forever and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>from transforming the entire society </v>

1649
01:24:22.711 --> 01:24:23.560
<v Speaker 3>into a state of war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what's also.</v>

1650
01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.420
<v Speaker 3>So I'll tell you the rest of the story.</v>

1651
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:31.510
<v Speaker 3>And Kane went out from the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lord and dwelt in the land of nod on</v>

1652
01:24:31.511 --> 01:24:35.340
<v Speaker 3>the east of Eden and Cain knew his wife </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she conceived and bare enoch,</v>

1653
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:37.270
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you have a genealogy,</v>

1654
01:24:37.271 --> 01:24:39.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So came starts to have a family,</v>

1655
01:24:39.251 --> 01:24:44.251
<v Speaker 3>you have a genealogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a number of people are named in </v>

1656
01:24:44.251 --> 01:24:44.260
<v Speaker 3>the lineage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1657
01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:49.440
<v Speaker 3>and it tells you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is sort of an attempt to describe </v>

1658
01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.190
<v Speaker 3>how things came about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like the naming of the heroes</v>

1659
01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:56.191
<v Speaker 3>of old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you have a enoch who builds a </v>

1660
01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:59.671
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a gal who is the father of </v>

1661
01:24:59.671 --> 01:25:01.900
<v Speaker 3>those who dwell intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of those who have cattle,</v>

1662
01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.960
<v Speaker 3>you have juvenile who was the father of </v>
<v Speaker 3>of musicians and Zillah who bore </v>

1663
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.700
<v Speaker 3>tubilcain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tubilcain is a very interesting person </v>

1664
01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:17.190
<v Speaker 3>by tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tubal cocaine is the first artificer of </v>

1665
01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:18.610
<v Speaker 3>weapons of war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so keynes,</v>

1666
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:23.611
<v Speaker 3>descendant after multiple generations is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person who produces weapons of war.</v>

1667
01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:25.810
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

1668
01:25:26.190 --> 01:25:31.190
<v Speaker 3>so there's another bit of the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>within which that needs to be placed in </v>

1669
01:25:31.190 --> 01:25:34.290
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And lamech,</v>

1670
01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:40.260
<v Speaker 3>who's one of the grandchildren of Cain </v>
<v Speaker 3>says unto his wife at Wives Adah and </v>

1671
01:25:44.101 --> 01:25:49.101
<v Speaker 3>Zillah hear my voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wives of Lamech Hearken unto my </v>

1672
01:25:49.101 --> 01:25:51.930
<v Speaker 3>speech for I have slain a man to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>wounding and the young man to my hurt.</v>

1673
01:25:52.050 --> 01:25:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what he's saying is he,</v>

1674
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:59.570
<v Speaker 3>he's been involved in a murder if can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>avenged.</v>

1675
01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>Sevenfold truly Lamaq 70 and seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1676
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:09.010
<v Speaker 2>so there's the implication there that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tit for tat process has begun.</v>

1677
01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Cain killed Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abel Caine's children killed seven </v>

1678
01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 2>canes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandchildren kill 70 fold,</v>

1679
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:23.590
<v Speaker 2>and then tubal cane pops up on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horizon and he's the person who makes </v>

1680
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:28.570
<v Speaker 2>artifices of war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the story in its fragmentary </v>

1681
01:26:28.570 --> 01:26:32.441
<v Speaker 2>manner ties the individual's </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology that's resentful and </v>

1682
01:26:32.661 --> 01:26:36.620
<v Speaker 2>revenge seeking to the proclivity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>broad scale warfare.</v>

1683
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:41.830
<v Speaker 2>And this really hit me because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested particularly in what was </v>

1684
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:45.611
<v Speaker 2>happening in the Nazi camps with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guards because the guards were </v>

1685
01:26:45.611 --> 01:26:48.860
<v Speaker 2>gratuitously cruel and I was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>curious about that.</v>

1686
01:26:48.861 --> 01:26:53.861
<v Speaker 2>And so here's an interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was in a book called a ordinary </v>

1687
01:26:53.861 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler's willing executioners.</v>

1688
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:58.100
<v Speaker 2>And it was a book that was written about</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago.</v>

1689
01:26:58.101 --> 01:27:03.101
<v Speaker 2>The challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that the Nazi phenomenon was </v>

1690
01:27:03.101 --> 01:27:03.650
<v Speaker 2>topped down order following,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't believe,</v>

1691
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.490
<v Speaker 2>by the way I think that that's a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>weak,</v>

1692
01:27:06.610 --> 01:27:07.760
<v Speaker 2>weak hypothesis.</v>

1693
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Fascistic societies are fascistic at </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single level of organization </v>

1694
01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:15.650
<v Speaker 2>spiritually within the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the local community.</v>

1695
01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like a holograph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same,</v>

1696
01:27:17.511 --> 01:27:19.790
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not top down.</v>

1697
01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are leaders who get produced and </v>

1698
01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.711
<v Speaker 2>maybe they catalyze it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to blame it on the leaders is to </v>

1699
01:27:26.711 --> 01:27:27.650
<v Speaker 2>forget about the process by which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders come to be.</v>

1700
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 2>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get a pass that way.</v>

1701
01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.450
<v Speaker 2>So here's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

1702
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:37.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the Nazis started to lose the war.</v>

1703
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
<v Speaker 2>So here's what you should have done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are a Nazi and he wanted to win </v>

1704
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.341
<v Speaker 2>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have enslaved the Jews and </v>

1705
01:27:45.341 --> 01:27:47.381
<v Speaker 2>the Gypsies and had them work right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have had them work for the </v>

1706
01:27:47.381 --> 01:27:51.440
<v Speaker 2>benefit of the victory and then if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to liquidate them afterwards,</v>

1707
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:52.940
<v Speaker 2>that's the logical thing to do.</v>

1708
01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.270
<v Speaker 2>If you want to win and we assume that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler wanted to win,</v>

1709
01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.520
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a very intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumption.</v>

1710
01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Why would you assume that he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly a good guy?</v>

1711
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:06.880
<v Speaker 2>So why should we assume that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>aiming at the good that he was </v>

1712
01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:07.160
<v Speaker 2>promoting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in his own terms,</v>

1713
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:12.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The glorious everlasting for Third </v>

1714
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Reich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1715
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:16.580
<v Speaker 2>That'll rule for a thousand years and be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bastion of civilization and music </v>

1716
01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:17.870
<v Speaker 2>because that's the sort of thing he </v>
<v Speaker 2>purported to be interested in.</v>

1717
01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you do with the Jews and the </v>

1718
01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Gypsies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1719
01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:23.380
<v Speaker 2>round them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1720
01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Enslave them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1721
01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You certainly don't devote a substantial</v>

1722
01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:32.501
<v Speaker 2>proportion of your war resources well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're losing to accelerate the rate at </v>

1723
01:28:33.201 --> 01:28:38.201
<v Speaker 2>which the extermination is taking place </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's a bit counterproductive </v>

1724
01:28:38.201 --> 01:28:42.040
<v Speaker 2>unless what you're aiming at is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximum possible mayhem in the shortest </v>

1725
01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:42.200
<v Speaker 2>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1726
01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:44.570
<v Speaker 2>so what happened as the Germans started </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lose the war,</v>

1727
01:28:44.710 --> 01:28:47.420
<v Speaker 2>get Hitler lose faith in his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability.</v>

1728
01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.480
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believed that the Germans had to be </v>

1729
01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.180
<v Speaker 2>traded with weakness and so he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly willing to accelerate the rate</v>

1730
01:28:53.181 --> 01:28:58.181
<v Speaker 2>at which Germany was losing the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so when Hitler and his minions have </v>

1731
01:28:58.181 --> 01:28:58.550
<v Speaker 2>the choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the choice.</v>

1732
01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 2>You can suspend your unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>demolition</v>

1733
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.040
<v Speaker 3>of people when the damn war and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick it up afterwards or while you're </v>

1734
01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:12.021
<v Speaker 3>losing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can just accelerate the mayhem even </v>

1735
01:29:12.021 --> 01:29:14.391
<v Speaker 3>though it's counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what'd they pick while they </v>

1736
01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:15.330
<v Speaker 3>pick to accelerate the mayhem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so to me,</v>

1737
01:29:15.331 --> 01:29:18.840
<v Speaker 3>there's an old psychoanalytic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this was derived by young.</v>

1738
01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:23.190
<v Speaker 3>If you can't figure out what someone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing or why,</v>

1739
01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:26.970
<v Speaker 3>look at the outcome and infer the </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivation.</v>

1740
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:29.640
<v Speaker 3>If it produces may him.</v>

1741
01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps it was aiming at me hip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1742
01:29:33.941 --> 01:29:36.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to use that dictum carefully.</v>

1743
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:38.050
<v Speaker 3>If someone's irritating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1744
01:29:38.051 --> 01:29:40.690
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's because you're irritable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had you should sort yourself out,</v>

1745
01:29:40.691 --> 01:29:45.691
<v Speaker 3>but maybe it's because they're actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>aiming at irritating you and that's the </v>

1746
01:29:45.691 --> 01:29:47.200
<v Speaker 3>actual motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So perhaps not,</v>

1747
01:29:47.201 --> 01:29:49.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's another tool in your analytical</v>
<v Speaker 3>armament.</v>

1748
01:29:50.710 --> 01:29:53.650
<v Speaker 3>So and so you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1749
01:29:53.651 --> 01:29:56.140
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing about warfare that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>so interesting about,</v>

1750
01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.260
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can,</v>

1751
01:29:58.390 --> 01:30:03.390
<v Speaker 3>you can attribute it to territoriality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can attribute it to a war for </v>

1752
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.970
<v Speaker 3>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the,</v>

1753
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:07.060
<v Speaker 3>I would say wretchedly,</v>

1754
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:13.910
<v Speaker 3>simple minded economists presume people </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight over scarce resources.</v>

1755
01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1756
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:19.020
<v Speaker 3>we're a little bit more sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

1757
01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:21.540
<v Speaker 3>And first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what resources are you talking about?</v>

1758
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.310
<v Speaker 3>The bloody anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had nothing.</v>

1759
01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:25.200
<v Speaker 3>They live perfectly well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did they have?</v>

1760
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:27.030
<v Speaker 3>Snow and seal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blubber,</v>

1761
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:32.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can live and unbelievably </v>

1762
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:34.431
<v Speaker 3>deprived conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the idea that there are natural </v>

1763
01:30:34.431 --> 01:30:38.451
<v Speaker 3>resources that we fight over because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a shortage of them is a pretty </v>

1764
01:30:38.451 --> 01:30:38.970
<v Speaker 3>oversimplified view of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1765
01:30:38.971 --> 01:30:40.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do people fight?</v>

1766
01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:45.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they fight sometimes for good </v>

1767
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.290
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but very,</v>

1768
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:48.171
<v Speaker 3>very frequently they fight for bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons and those bad reasons are our </v>

1769
01:30:48.171 --> 01:30:50.520
<v Speaker 3>personal as well as sociocultural and </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic.</v>

1770
01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:52.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were announced a prison guard,</v>

1771
01:30:52.471 --> 01:30:57.471
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever pathologies you were carrying </v>

1772
01:30:57.471 --> 01:31:00.351
<v Speaker 3>around in your destructive little soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever element of Cain was deeply </v>

1773
01:31:00.351 --> 01:31:03.831
<v Speaker 3>embedded in you had the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be manifest fully at every moment of </v>

1774
01:31:03.831 --> 01:31:03.831
<v Speaker 3>your waking existence.</v>

1775
01:31:03.831 --> 01:31:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had these people who were completely</v>

1776
01:31:06.061 --> 01:31:08.910
<v Speaker 3>beholden to you with no rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever,</v>

1777
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.350
<v Speaker 3>to whom you could do whatever you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil little heart determined think,</v>

1778
01:31:13.351 --> 01:31:18.351
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that was a motivation for putting </v>

1779
01:31:18.351 --> 01:31:18.351
<v Speaker 3>them there to begin with and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover story about,</v>

1780
01:31:18.351 --> 01:31:22.700
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to build the Third Reich </v>

1781
01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.321
<v Speaker 3>and we're trying to stabilize the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're trying to do all these good </v>

1782
01:31:24.321 --> 01:31:27.141
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's just a cover story for the </v>

1783
01:31:27.141 --> 01:31:29.211
<v Speaker 3>real motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is nothing but but what the </v>

1784
01:31:29.211 --> 01:31:30.360
<v Speaker 3>construction of death camps had killed 6</v>
<v Speaker 3>million people.</v>

1785
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:35.510
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the obliteration of 120 million </v>

1786
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:38.070
<v Speaker 3>people on the planet and the and the and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the and the leaving of European runes.</v>

1787
01:31:38.670 --> 01:31:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that was the motivation or are we </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to attribute to Hitler the highest</v>

1788
01:31:42.571 --> 01:31:44.400
<v Speaker 3>possible motives?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say No,</v>

1789
01:31:44.401 --> 01:31:46.650
<v Speaker 3>it's an archetype of manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cane.</v>

1790
01:31:47.190 --> 01:31:49.140
<v Speaker 3>Now he's going to put up a front that </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1791
01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.340
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm your savior.</v>

1792
01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:51.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1793
01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.700
<v Speaker 3>disruptive people think that Kayden is </v>
<v Speaker 3>their savior.</v>

1794
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a break for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

1795
01:32:03.521 --> 01:32:03.910
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1796
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:13.470
<v Speaker 2>the next thing that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these stories were so together,</v>

1797
01:32:14.231 --> 01:32:19.231
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To make something that resembles a </v>

1798
01:32:19.231 --> 01:32:20.380
<v Speaker 2>coherent text and there's this literary </v>
<v Speaker 2>analytic.</v>

1799
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:26.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a literary technique known as </v>

1800
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:28.730
<v Speaker 2>autonomy and autonomy is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>juxtaposition of two things beside one </v>

1801
01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:31.960
<v Speaker 2>another with the implication that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're juxtaposed,</v>

1802
01:32:31.961 --> 01:32:34.660
<v Speaker 2>they are causally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're related in some important matter</v>

1803
01:32:34.661 --> 01:32:39.661
<v Speaker 2>to one another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the stories are sequenced and the</v>

1804
01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:44.900
<v Speaker 2>there's an implicit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stories are sequenced in a </v>

1805
01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:48.691
<v Speaker 2>particular manner and you might operate </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the assumption that that </v>

1806
01:32:49.181 --> 01:32:54.181
<v Speaker 2>sequencing occurred because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequencer who was an editor or a group </v>

1807
01:32:54.181 --> 01:32:56.320
<v Speaker 2>of editors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call that person the redactor,</v>

1808
01:32:56.340 --> 01:33:01.340
<v Speaker 2>but they have no idea if it was one </v>
<v Speaker 2>person or many people who organized </v>

1809
01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:01.720
<v Speaker 2>these texts into something resembling a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coherent story.</v>

1810
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:06.990
<v Speaker 2>So imagine the story's evolved somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>independently and then they were </v>

1811
01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:10.060
<v Speaker 2>organized so that they produced what </v>
<v Speaker 2>approximated the coherent narrative.</v>

1812
01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:14.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not entirely coherent because there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are paradoxical claims,</v>

1813
01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:17.350
<v Speaker 2>say at the level of the sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1814
01:33:17.351 --> 01:33:22.351
<v Speaker 2>the creation order in the first story of</v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis isn't exactly the same as the </v>

1815
01:33:22.351 --> 01:33:26.191
<v Speaker 2>creation order in the second story and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know people who insist upon the </v>

1816
01:33:26.191 --> 01:33:30.301
<v Speaker 2>literal truth of the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means is are bothered by </v>

1817
01:33:30.301 --> 01:33:34.651
<v Speaker 2>those contradictions and turn themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>into knots trying to iron them out and </v>

1818
01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:34.651
<v Speaker 2>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1819
01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Because you want the story to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>coherent,</v>

1820
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:38.200
<v Speaker 2>but you know that sort of.</v>

1821
01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:44.140
<v Speaker 2>It's important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also beside the point.</v>

1822
01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:49.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to focus on one level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis at the exclusion of all the </v>

1823
01:33:49.170 --> 01:33:51.991
<v Speaker 2>other levels of analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the right way to think </v>

1824
01:33:51.991 --> 01:33:51.991
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1825
01:33:51.991 --> 01:33:56.520
<v Speaker 2>The fact that these stories are </v>
<v Speaker 2>sequenced in a particular manner and </v>

1826
01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:59.341
<v Speaker 2>that that kind of makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>implies that there's some sort of </v>

1827
01:33:59.341 --> 01:33:59.740
<v Speaker 2>narrative coherence underneath driving </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

1828
01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they would be nothing but a </v>
<v Speaker 2>random assemblage of stories and they're</v>

1829
01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:06.430
<v Speaker 2>by no means random.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

1830
01:34:06.431 --> 01:34:11.431
<v Speaker 2>They're selected and edited and put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together in a particular manner by and </v>

1831
01:34:11.431 --> 01:34:13.510
<v Speaker 2>then stored that way and dealt with in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular manner by thousands of people</v>

1832
01:34:13.511 --> 01:34:14.530
<v Speaker 2>over many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years.</v>

1833
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:18.910
<v Speaker 2>What happens after Cain and Abel is </v>
<v Speaker 2>while there's an interlude,</v>

1834
01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:23.940
<v Speaker 2>which is this interlude and it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bridge and there's a lot packed into </v>

1835
01:34:25.271 --> 01:34:27.430
<v Speaker 2>it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I'm not going to take it apart,</v>

1836
01:34:27.431 --> 01:34:32.431
<v Speaker 2>very much so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is after after Cain and Abel </v>

1837
01:34:32.431 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Story and it came to pass when men began</v>
<v Speaker 2>to multiply on the face of the earth and</v>

1838
01:34:34.811 --> 01:34:39.811
<v Speaker 2>daughters were born unto them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the sons of God saw the daughters </v>

1839
01:34:39.811 --> 01:34:43.021
<v Speaker 2>of men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were fair and then took them </v>

1840
01:34:43.021 --> 01:34:45.151
<v Speaker 2>wives of all which they chose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there were giants in the earth in </v>

1841
01:34:45.151 --> 01:34:45.151
<v Speaker 2>those days.</v>

1842
01:34:45.151 --> 01:34:50.010
<v Speaker 2>And also after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the sons of God came into the </v>

1843
01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:50.010
<v Speaker 2>daughters of men and they bare children </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them,</v>

1844
01:34:50.010 --> 01:34:52.720
<v Speaker 2>the same became mighty men which are of </v>
<v Speaker 2>old men of renown.</v>

1845
01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I already pointed out that if you go </v>

1846
01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.421
<v Speaker 2>back just a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that the descendants of cain are</v>

1847
01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:06.770
<v Speaker 2>represented as founders of of </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions.</v>

1848
01:35:06.771 --> 01:35:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Right there are</v>

1849
01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:17.720
<v Speaker 2>in our norco builds the city and a and </v>
<v Speaker 2>add a or Jibo who was the father of </v>

1850
01:35:18.431 --> 01:35:20.890
<v Speaker 2>those who dwell in tents and of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>who own cattle.</v>

1851
01:35:20.891 --> 01:35:24.300
<v Speaker 2>And then there's Jubal who's the father </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all that are musicians and so on.</v>

1852
01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:29.320
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that you see in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in myths very frequently is that if </v>

1853
01:35:29.861 --> 01:35:32.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a pattern of behavior that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristic of the culture,</v>

1854
01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:36.370
<v Speaker 2>that pattern of behavior is attributed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a hero.</v>

1855
01:35:36.490 --> 01:35:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Who was in the past who was the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who did that?</v>

1856
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.580
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what does that mean?</v>

1857
01:35:42.581 --> 01:35:47.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means in part that there was a first </v>

1858
01:35:47.581 --> 01:35:49.801
<v Speaker 2>person who did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although more likely there was an </v>

1859
01:35:49.801 --> 01:35:52.711
<v Speaker 2>assemblage of people who aggregated that</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular ability say the ability to </v>

1860
01:35:52.711 --> 01:35:55.000
<v Speaker 2>play music across a very large amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1861
01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.490
<v Speaker 2>But these are preliterate people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1862
01:35:57.491 --> 01:35:59.200
<v Speaker 2>And they're trying to remember the past.</v>

1863
01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:04.440
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mircea Eliade documented this quite </v>

1864
01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.021
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that that aggregation of people gets </v>

1865
01:36:07.021 --> 01:36:09.790
<v Speaker 2>collapsed into a single Meta person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the hero of old.</v>

1866
01:36:10.210 --> 01:36:15.210
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we already talked about how this </v>

1867
01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:15.250
<v Speaker 2>works is that you know there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>admirable people and then you can tell a</v>

1868
01:36:15.251 --> 01:36:20.251
<v Speaker 2>story about an admirable person and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can extract a story out of the set </v>

1869
01:36:20.251 --> 01:36:24.271
<v Speaker 2>of admirable people and you keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>building higher and higher order </v>

1870
01:36:24.271 --> 01:36:27.700
<v Speaker 2>admirable people until you extract out </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top what's ultimately admirable,</v>

1871
01:36:27.970 --> 01:36:30.160
<v Speaker 2>and this is actually an indication of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that process.</v>

1872
01:36:30.161 --> 01:36:32.860
<v Speaker 2>So curry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the giants that are being referred to in</v>

1873
01:36:32.861 --> 01:36:37.861
<v Speaker 2>this particular phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they heroes of the past who </v>

1874
01:36:37.861 --> 01:36:40.540
<v Speaker 2>established the traditions on which the </v>
<v Speaker 2>society exists.</v>

1875
01:36:40.541 --> 01:36:43.480
<v Speaker 2>And so that's all compacted into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>little paragraph.</v>

1876
01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:48.960
<v Speaker 2>So this little paragraph here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were giants in the earth in those </v>

1877
01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:53.401
<v Speaker 2>days and after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the sons of God came into the </v>

1878
01:36:53.401 --> 01:36:53.401
<v Speaker 2>daughters of men and they bare children </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them,</v>

1879
01:36:53.401 --> 01:36:56.080
<v Speaker 2>the same became mighty men which were of</v>
<v Speaker 2>old men of renown.</v>

1880
01:36:56.170 --> 01:37:01.170
<v Speaker 2>While you could hardly say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's very little difference </v>

1881
01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:04.360
<v Speaker 2>between what I just told you and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>this story says mean.</v>

1882
01:37:04.361 --> 01:37:08.440
<v Speaker 2>It says it as if it was something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally occurred.</v>

1883
01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:12.220
<v Speaker 2>But in some sense it doesn't exactly say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1884
01:37:12.221 --> 01:37:12.880
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1885
01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:16.300
<v Speaker 2>the ancient landscape was the landscape </v>
<v Speaker 2>of heroic adventures.</v>

1886
01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:17.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1887
01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:18.700
<v Speaker 2>we do that to our own history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1888
01:37:18.730 --> 01:37:22.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean even when we consider it literal </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

1889
01:37:22.001 --> 01:37:26.440
<v Speaker 2>we don't pick people at random to </v>
<v Speaker 2>historicize.</v>

1890
01:37:26.441 --> 01:37:31.441
<v Speaker 2>We picked people who had some </v>
<v Speaker 2>substantive impact and tell stories </v>

1891
01:37:31.441 --> 01:37:36.391
<v Speaker 2>about them and they're emblematic in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense of the spirit of striving </v>

1892
01:37:36.391 --> 01:37:40.981
<v Speaker 2>that characterize this humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can't have history without </v>

1893
01:37:40.981 --> 01:37:45.841
<v Speaker 2>something pathologization because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythologized occurs at the level of the </v>

1894
01:37:45.841 --> 01:37:50.551
<v Speaker 2>selection of the entities about which </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to weave the historical </v>

1895
01:37:50.551 --> 01:37:50.560
<v Speaker 2>tale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1896
01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1897
01:37:52.011 --> 01:37:55.230
<v Speaker 2>so there's little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little interlude there that,</v>

1898
01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.500
<v Speaker 2>that talks about the appearance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroes in the past,</v>

1899
01:37:58.501 --> 01:38:00.930
<v Speaker 2>but then it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just done with very,</v>

1900
01:38:00.931 --> 01:38:05.630
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we move into another story.</v>

1901
01:38:06.730 --> 01:38:10.040
<v Speaker 2>This is the story of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the way it looks to me is that</v>

1902
01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:18.060
<v Speaker 2>the part of genesis that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to you about ends with the flood </v>

1903
01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:22.551
<v Speaker 2>myth and also with the Tower of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the flood myth is the desert </v>

1904
01:38:22.551 --> 01:38:24.720
<v Speaker 2>demolition of everything that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>before and the Tower of Babel.</v>

1905
01:38:24.721 --> 01:38:28.980
<v Speaker 2>In some sense is exactly the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's too chaotic.</v>

1906
01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like the fall occurs in </v>
<v Speaker 2>stages.</v>

1907
01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:36.980
<v Speaker 2>There's paradise and then Adam and eve </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall into culture and then Cain and </v>

1908
01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:40.911
<v Speaker 2>Abel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cain falls into chaos and then the </v>

1909
01:38:40.911 --> 01:38:42.990
<v Speaker 2>entire society falls into chaos and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flood comes in,</v>

1910
01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:47.991
<v Speaker 2>the Tower of Babel is produced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that's the end of the truly </v>

1911
01:38:47.991 --> 01:38:51.570
<v Speaker 2>archaic parts of the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what that seems to me,</v>

1912
01:38:52.170 --> 01:38:54.090
<v Speaker 2>what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very sophisticated,</v>

1913
01:38:54.091 --> 01:38:59.091
<v Speaker 2>is that there's an implicit causal </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative being warrant woven about the </v>

1914
01:38:59.581 --> 01:39:04.581
<v Speaker 2>manner in which Kane responds and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that human beings are going </v>

1915
01:39:04.581 --> 01:39:09.141
<v Speaker 2>to deteriorate and the flood is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come so and God saw that the wickedness </v>

1916
01:39:09.141 --> 01:39:13.170
<v Speaker 2>of man was great in the earth and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>every imagination of the thoughts of his</v>

1917
01:39:13.171 --> 01:39:18.171
<v Speaker 2>heart was only evil continually and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>repented the Lord that he had made man </v>

1918
01:39:18.511 --> 01:39:23.511
<v Speaker 2>on earth and it grieved him at his heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>while we already encountered a story </v>

1919
01:39:23.511 --> 01:39:23.511
<v Speaker 2>like that once already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1920
01:39:23.511 --> 01:39:27.910
<v Speaker 2>That happened in the Marta story where </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeout and ab sue give rise to the </v>

1921
01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:32.970
<v Speaker 2>elder gods and they kill app suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was not very smart idea,</v>

1922
01:39:33.210 --> 01:39:38.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They demolished the substructure of </v>

1923
01:39:38.210 --> 01:39:39.870
<v Speaker 2>their stable society and of course chaos</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes flooding back.</v>

1924
01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to say that human </v>

1925
01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:46.710
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>

1926
01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.390
<v Speaker 2>to say that</v>

1927
01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:55.020
<v Speaker 2>the wickedness of man was great in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth and that every imagination of the </v>

1928
01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:58.261
<v Speaker 2>hearts of his thoughts of his heart was </v>
<v Speaker 2>only evil continually is not much </v>

1929
01:39:58.261 --> 01:40:02.011
<v Speaker 2>different than to say that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting in a manner that demolishes the </v>

1930
01:40:02.011 --> 01:40:02.860
<v Speaker 2>cultural structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1931
01:40:02.861 --> 01:40:07.861
<v Speaker 2>we've already even pointed out that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural structure that happens in this </v>

1932
01:40:07.861 --> 01:40:11.020
<v Speaker 2>story was produced by the heroic giants </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the past.</v>

1933
01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've also noted that what Cain is </v>

1934
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.321
<v Speaker 2>objecting to in this came like manner is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social structure which isn't </v>

1935
01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:22.711
<v Speaker 2>rewarding and properly and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendence that's above that and the </v>

1936
01:40:22.711 --> 01:40:24.370
<v Speaker 2>spirit of logos itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's rejecting all that.</v>

1937
01:40:24.610 --> 01:40:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the issue here is that when that sort</v>

1938
01:40:28.181 --> 01:40:32.620
<v Speaker 2>of evil is produced exactly as when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Appsu is slade,</v>

1939
01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.140
<v Speaker 2>slade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's right by the,</v>

1940
01:40:35.170 --> 01:40:37.690
<v Speaker 2>by the elder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gods then all hell breaks loose.</v>

1941
01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.690
<v Speaker 2>All chaos comes back now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tie Matt,</v>

1942
01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:44.760
<v Speaker 2>if you remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the god of the salt water goddess of </v>

1943
01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.761
<v Speaker 2>the salt water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the return of Tire Matt and the </v>

1944
01:40:47.761 --> 01:40:49.120
<v Speaker 2>flood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mythologically similar ideas.</v>

1945
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Now Elliot has taken apart flood myths </v>
<v Speaker 2>from all over the world and he two</v>

1946
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.700
<v Speaker 3>brilliant comments about them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also akin to some degree to what</v>

1947
01:40:57.701 --> 01:41:01.330
<v Speaker 3>you can see in the Egyptian story about </v>
<v Speaker 3>seth and the corruption of the state.</v>

1948
01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:06.900
<v Speaker 3>So because the Egyptians figured out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's always a power working </v>

1949
01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:07.960
<v Speaker 3>within this state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that corrupted it.</v>

1950
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:10.540
<v Speaker 3>Now that was set and that was always </v>
<v Speaker 3>working for its overthrow.</v>

1951
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:15.630
<v Speaker 3>It's an idea like Satan and I said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the word Seth becomes the word Satan </v>

1952
01:41:15.630 --> 01:41:17.050
<v Speaker 3>through Coptic Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1953
01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:22.860
<v Speaker 3>so the iliads idea was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that things fall apart of their own </v>

1954
01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:27.961
<v Speaker 3>accord merely because they age that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the first motif in the flood </v>

1955
01:41:27.961 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's only to say that if you build</v>

1956
01:41:28.751 --> 01:41:33.751
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it indicates if you build something and </v>

1957
01:41:33.751 --> 01:41:34.300
<v Speaker 3>you just leave it the hell alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will assume not work.</v>

1958
01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's entropy.</v>

1959
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:40.950
<v Speaker 3>So one of the reasons that the flood </v>
<v Speaker 3>always threatens is merely because of </v>

1960
01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:45.061
<v Speaker 3>entropy and you see that reflected in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Egyptian story because one of the </v>

1961
01:41:45.061 --> 01:41:45.061
<v Speaker 3>reasons that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1962
01:41:45.061 --> 01:41:49.960
<v Speaker 3>cyrus falls prey to seth is because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

1963
01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.460
<v Speaker 3>He was a great hero when he was young </v>
<v Speaker 3>and created the Egyptian state,</v>

1964
01:41:54.461 --> 01:41:57.940
<v Speaker 3>like the men of renown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now he's old and it's worse.</v>

1965
01:41:57.941 --> 01:42:00.190
<v Speaker 3>He's willfully blind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the next thing.</v>

1966
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:05.460
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that he's old is just to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start things fall apart of their own </v>

1967
01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:06.400
<v Speaker 3>accord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once something is given to you,</v>

1968
01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:11.020
<v Speaker 3>you have to maintain it just to ensure </v>
<v Speaker 3>its continued existence.</v>

1969
01:42:11.021 --> 01:42:16.021
<v Speaker 3>And so you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually have a contract with most </v>

1970
01:42:16.021 --> 01:42:16.180
<v Speaker 3>of the things that you own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

1971
01:42:16.450 --> 01:42:21.450
<v Speaker 3>it's like a moral contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say you have a car or you've </v>

1972
01:42:21.450 --> 01:42:24.550
<v Speaker 3>decided that you're going to sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have the car and so you've.</v>

1973
01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:29.640
<v Speaker 3>You've performed an ethical calculation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the car was only worth the sacrifice</v>

1974
01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:34.980
<v Speaker 3>as long as it functions as a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what that means is that to </v>

1975
01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:36.310
<v Speaker 3>justify the sacrifice you've made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have the car,</v>

1976
01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.930
<v Speaker 3>you have to maintain the car.</v>

1977
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Because otherwise you're acting out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposition that the thing that you </v>

1978
01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 3>sacrificed for actually didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>value and so your obliterating that as a</v>

1979
01:42:45.401 --> 01:42:50.401
<v Speaker 3>useful contract and you run into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation where the car will just </v>

1980
01:42:50.401 --> 01:42:53.380
<v Speaker 3>deteriorate of its own accord and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't have a car at all.</v>

1981
01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's say,</v>

1982
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 3>how do you speed the process by which </v>
<v Speaker 3>your car deteriorates?</v>

1983
01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:00.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's easy.</v>

1984
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:03.580
<v Speaker 3>You're driving it along the road and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts to make a ticking noise,</v>

1985
01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:03.990
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>

1986
01:43:03.991 --> 01:43:04.360
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>

1987
01:43:04.361 --> 01:43:09.361
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you think I should go have that </v>

1988
01:43:09.361 --> 01:43:09.361
<v Speaker 3>ticking noise checked because you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard it and then you think,</v>

1989
01:43:09.361 --> 01:43:10.480
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it won't matter.</v>

1990
01:43:10.690 --> 01:43:11.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1991
01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:17.250
<v Speaker 3>probably it'll matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what does matter mean while it </v>

1992
01:43:17.250 --> 01:43:17.290
<v Speaker 3>matter his mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's chaos to you,</v>

1993
01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:22.291
<v Speaker 3>no matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what it means is that that little </v>

1994
01:43:22.291 --> 01:43:23.560
<v Speaker 3>ticking noise is the birthplace of tie a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mat in your car.</v>

1995
01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:28.560
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it's your first indication that </v>

1996
01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.400
<v Speaker 3>the dragon of chaos is going to manifest</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself in your car.</v>

1997
01:43:30.610 --> 01:43:33.100
<v Speaker 3>That happens when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a funny story about that,</v>

1998
01:43:33.101 --> 01:43:37.960
<v Speaker 3>so I had a friend in in graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone I really liked,</v>

1999
01:43:38.230 --> 01:43:43.230
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't call her Mcelliott and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanically inclined let's put it that </v>

2000
01:43:43.230 --> 01:43:46.390
<v Speaker 3>way and she had an old Honda and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things were notorious for rusting out.</v>

2001
01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:48.760
<v Speaker 3>This is 30 years ago when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>first produced.</v>

2002
01:43:48.761 --> 01:43:53.761
<v Speaker 3>They weren't adapted well to Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 3>winters and we used to go into her car </v>

2003
01:43:53.761 --> 01:43:57.821
<v Speaker 3>and her Honda and it got a little on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>scary side because it was so rusty </v>

2004
01:43:57.821 --> 01:44:01.151
<v Speaker 3>underneath that you can actually see </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the floorboards and that </v>

2005
01:44:01.151 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 3>actually made me nervous because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can see through the floorboards,</v>

2006
01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:06.040
<v Speaker 3>that means that they're not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>floorboards.</v>

2007
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:11.050
<v Speaker 3>What they are is like rust and so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentioned the fact that that might be a </v>

2008
01:44:11.691 --> 01:44:14.240
<v Speaker 3>problem to her a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was sort of blind about it.</v>

2009
01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:17.930
<v Speaker 3>And one day she was driving down St </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lawrence Street in Montreal,</v>

2010
01:44:17.931 --> 01:44:20.510
<v Speaker 3>which is the main street running roughly</v>
<v Speaker 3>north and south.</v>

2011
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:25.750
<v Speaker 3>And her hood popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It bent and popped up spontaneously and </v>

2012
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:29.951
<v Speaker 3>so she was really curious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she was with this friend of hers </v>

2013
01:44:29.951 --> 01:44:31.490
<v Speaker 3>who was just as clueless mechanically as</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was,</v>

2014
01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.740
<v Speaker 3>which is really quite remarkably </v>
<v Speaker 3>clueless.</v>

2015
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:39.130
<v Speaker 3>And so they pulled off into a service </v>
<v Speaker 3>station and had the guy come out and </v>

2016
01:44:39.130 --> 01:44:39.330
<v Speaker 3>look at it and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2017
01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:44.620
<v Speaker 3>he opened the hood obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what had happened was the body had </v>

2018
01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:45.800
<v Speaker 3>fallen off the frame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2019
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:49.220
<v Speaker 3>And what had happened was the shock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like supposed to be attached to</v>

2020
01:44:49.221 --> 01:44:51.290
<v Speaker 3>the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had pushed up through the,</v>

2021
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 3>through the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hood.</v>

2022
01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:58.650
<v Speaker 3>So literally the car body had fallen </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto the ground and.</v>

2023
01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:01.040
<v Speaker 3>But she was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she managed to drive the cart.</v>

2024
01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:01.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So look,</v>

2025
01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:07.150
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't exactly call that willful </v>

2026
01:45:07.150 --> 01:45:08.060
<v Speaker 3>blindness because perhaps there is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>element of willful blindness.</v>

2027
01:45:08.061 --> 01:45:09.470
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanics,</v>

2028
01:45:09.471 --> 01:45:11.000
<v Speaker 3>but you get the point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2029
01:45:11.001 --> 01:45:13.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say she would have been in a fatal</v>

2030
01:45:13.941 --> 01:45:15.320
<v Speaker 3>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might say,</v>

2031
01:45:15.321 --> 01:45:18.410
<v Speaker 3>well you can shake your fist at God for </v>
<v Speaker 3>producing the circumstances,</v>

2032
01:45:18.411 --> 01:45:23.411
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you could see through the </v>

2033
01:45:23.411 --> 01:45:23.500
<v Speaker 3>floorboards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably something that you might</v>

2034
01:45:23.501 --> 01:45:26.390
<v Speaker 3>have paid attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's always the question is,</v>

2035
01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:31.540
<v Speaker 3>if things fall apart around you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what degree is it the mere tendency </v>

2036
01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:35.180
<v Speaker 3>of things to degenerate entropically </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they do that of their own accord</v>

2037
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:40.510
<v Speaker 3>or have you sped the probability of </v>
<v Speaker 3>decay by failing to pay attention when a</v>

2038
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:44.060
<v Speaker 3>little snake manifests itself inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>your paradise.</v>

2039
01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:46.130
<v Speaker 3>And it's always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always a question.</v>

2040
01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:49.160
<v Speaker 3>So here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an example,</v>

2041
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:50.780
<v Speaker 3>an interesting example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2042
01:45:50.781 --> 01:45:55.781
<v Speaker 3>So I thought about the actual floods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the New Orleans flood.</v>

2043
01:45:56.540 --> 01:46:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So New Orleans is built where there are </v>

2044
01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:04.391
<v Speaker 3>floods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows that and it's a major </v>

2045
01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:06.341
<v Speaker 3>port in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A huge part of American trade goes down </v>

2046
01:46:06.341 --> 01:46:06.980
<v Speaker 3>the river to New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a reason it was built where</v>

2047
01:46:06.981 --> 01:46:11.981
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it was a dangerous place to </v>

2048
01:46:11.981 --> 01:46:11.981
<v Speaker 3>build it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in order to maintain New Orleans,</v>

2049
01:46:11.981 --> 01:46:13.520
<v Speaker 3>they had to build these levees that kept</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water back.</v>

2050
01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Now the American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

2051
01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:19.940
<v Speaker 3>American Army Corps of Engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I remember correctly,</v>

2052
01:46:19.941 --> 01:46:23.480
<v Speaker 3>it was responsible for building and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maintaining the levies and the dikes.</v>

2053
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holland is also built underwater.</v>

2054
01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:32.320
<v Speaker 3>As you may or may not know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they built huge dykes to keep the </v>

2055
01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.130
<v Speaker 3>ocean back so they can reclaim the land </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's basically Holland.</v>

2056
01:46:34.131 --> 01:46:39.131
<v Speaker 3>Holland is an unbelievably organized </v>
<v Speaker 3>society and part of the reason is is it </v>

2057
01:46:39.131 --> 01:46:43.381
<v Speaker 3>isn't land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's underwater and so if you're not </v>

2058
01:46:43.381 --> 01:46:45.551
<v Speaker 3>bloody well awake in Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the ocean comes in and you all </v>

2059
01:46:45.551 --> 01:46:49.001
<v Speaker 3>drowned and so the Dutch are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very careful about such things and they </v>

2060
01:46:49.001 --> 01:46:50.050
<v Speaker 3>build their dikes so that they</v>

2061
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:55.070
<v Speaker 2>calculate storm intensity and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculate the intensity of the worst </v>

2062
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:58.911
<v Speaker 2>storm in 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and then they build the dikes to </v>

2063
01:46:58.911 --> 01:47:02.151
<v Speaker 2>withstand that storm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Army Corps of Engineers built the </v>

2064
01:47:02.151 --> 01:47:05.301
<v Speaker 2>dikes in New Orleans to withstand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst storm in 100 years and they knew </v>

2065
01:47:05.301 --> 01:47:09.381
<v Speaker 2>that was insufficient and New Orleans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louisiana is an unbelievably corrupt </v>

2066
01:47:09.381 --> 01:47:13.371
<v Speaker 2>state and you can't dump money in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix things because people just steal </v>

2067
01:47:13.371 --> 01:47:14.490
<v Speaker 2>the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and then nothing gets fixed.</v>

2068
01:47:14.491 --> 01:47:19.491
<v Speaker 2>And so then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a hurricane and then what </v>

2069
01:47:19.491 --> 01:47:19.491
<v Speaker 2>happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a flood and everybody says,</v>

2070
01:47:19.491 --> 01:47:21.870
<v Speaker 2>why would God send the flood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is,</v>

2071
01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:24.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was there a flood or where the dikes not</v>

2072
01:47:24.331 --> 01:47:27.150
<v Speaker 2>high enough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's so interesting is that</v>

2073
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:32.390
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a great father versus great </v>

2074
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:34.500
<v Speaker 2>mother conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the system fails,</v>

2075
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:40.160
<v Speaker 2>is it because of the surround </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming the system or is it because</v>

2076
01:47:40.201 --> 01:47:44.370
<v Speaker 2>the system was insufficiently awake and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doomed itself?</v>

2077
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so elliot is take on the flood myth is </v>

2078
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.161
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God comes along and floods the world </v>

2079
01:47:52.161 --> 01:47:52.161
<v Speaker 2>periodically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2080
01:47:52.161 --> 01:47:54.120
<v Speaker 2>And that that's the catastrophic influx </v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaos,</v>

2081
01:47:54.121 --> 01:47:59.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chaos will wipe you out from time to </v>

2082
01:47:59.121 --> 01:47:59.121
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2083
01:47:59.121 --> 01:48:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entropy does in your conceptual schemes </v>

2084
01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:03.810
<v Speaker 2>and your willful blindness speeds the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

2085
01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:06.320
<v Speaker 2>And remember that's what the Egyptians </v>
<v Speaker 2>said about.</v>

2086
01:48:06.321 --> 01:48:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus,</v>

2087
01:48:06.931 --> 01:48:08.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said he was,</v>

2088
01:48:08.461 --> 01:48:09.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a great king,</v>

2089
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:11.820
<v Speaker 2>a man of renowned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was old,</v>

2090
01:48:13.170 --> 01:48:18.170
<v Speaker 2>but he was also willfully blind and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the combination of his agent is </v>

2091
01:48:18.170 --> 01:48:21.720
<v Speaker 2>willful blindness that allowed seth to </v>
<v Speaker 2>chop them up into pieces and depose him.</v>

2092
01:48:22.050 --> 01:48:23.490
<v Speaker 2>And so with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair enough,</v>

2093
01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:24.690
<v Speaker 2>it's brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2094
01:48:24.691 --> 01:48:29.691
<v Speaker 2>It's like why does states fall apart?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the structures get old and no </v>

2095
01:48:29.691 --> 01:48:33.480
<v Speaker 2>one's taken care of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people have their eyes closed and so</v>

2096
01:48:33.481 --> 01:48:34.590
<v Speaker 2>it's the same situation.</v>

2097
01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:36.270
<v Speaker 2>It's the same situation in the flood </v>
<v Speaker 2>myths.</v>

2098
01:48:36.271 --> 01:48:36.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2099
01:48:36.931 --> 01:48:38.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things fall apart.</v>

2100
01:48:38.050 --> 01:48:43.050
<v Speaker 2>They're going to flood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you were awake enough and you </v>

2101
01:48:43.050 --> 01:48:46.401
<v Speaker 2>were on top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you could continually stave that </v>

2102
01:48:46.401 --> 01:48:48.060
<v Speaker 2>off and actually partly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing because you're alive,</v>

2103
01:48:48.061 --> 01:48:51.750
<v Speaker 2>is staving off entropy like you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti and tropic process.</v>

2104
01:48:52.050 --> 01:48:57.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good definition of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great physicist named Erwin </v>

2105
01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Schrodinger who wrote a book called what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is life,</v>

2106
01:48:57.571 --> 01:48:59.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's the fundamental thesis of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

2107
01:48:59.610 --> 01:49:01.530
<v Speaker 2>You're always trying to stave off </v>
<v Speaker 2>entropy.</v>

2108
01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:03.510
<v Speaker 2>What's the best way to stave off </v>
<v Speaker 2>entropy?</v>

2109
01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Decay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

2110
01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Keep your eyes open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the rule.</v>

2111
01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Shut your eyes especially to things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

2112
01:49:09.691 --> 01:49:14.691
<v Speaker 2>You should see the flood comes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the evil of man that's laid out </v>

2113
01:49:14.691 --> 01:49:18.000
<v Speaker 2>in this story because that's the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of perhaps it's not the worst.</v>

2114
01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:20.640
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the primary sin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

2115
01:49:20.641 --> 01:49:23.490
<v Speaker 2>that will bring about the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We already talked about the other things</v>

2116
01:49:23.491 --> 01:49:25.470
<v Speaker 2>that characterized canes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude,</v>

2117
01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:30.700
<v Speaker 4>so cool,</v>

2118
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:39.750
<v Speaker 2>so God's upset because he had made man </v>
<v Speaker 2>on earth and it grieved him at his </v>

2119
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:39.750
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and God says,</v>

2120
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:44.191
<v Speaker 2>I will destroy man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whom I've created from the face of the </v>

2121
01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:46.591
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both man and beast and the creeping </v>

2122
01:49:46.591 --> 01:49:47.020
<v Speaker 2>thing and the fowls of the air for I </v>
<v Speaker 2>repent.</v>

2123
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I've made them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the </v>

2124
01:49:52.170 --> 01:49:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2125
01:49:52.170 --> 01:49:54.770
<v Speaker 2>so that's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here what we have is the.</v>

2126
01:49:55.130 --> 01:49:59.590
<v Speaker 2>The question is the whole world's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos at this point,</v>

2127
01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 2>right in this point in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the chaos is a multiple sorts.</v>

2128
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:08.310
<v Speaker 2>It arose from the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It rose from the emergence of self </v>

2129
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.310
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It emerged safe.</v>

2130
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:11.590
<v Speaker 2>It rose from the sins of cane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like things are not going well.</v>

2131
01:50:11.591 --> 01:50:16.591
<v Speaker 2>It's multiple levels of collapse and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to the point where God saying </v>

2132
01:50:16.591 --> 01:50:20.371
<v Speaker 2>this is a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's such a mess that the whole </v>

2133
01:50:20.371 --> 01:50:20.371
<v Speaker 2>thing has to be washed away.</v>

2134
01:50:20.371 --> 01:50:22.630
<v Speaker 2>The first fall wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even canes collapse wasn't enough.</v>

2135
01:50:22.631 --> 01:50:25.330
<v Speaker 2>We're going to just scrub the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody thing clean.</v>

2136
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:30.690
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the ultimate in traumatic </v>

2137
01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:30.690
<v Speaker 2>collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

2138
01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:35.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do in the face of the </v>

2139
01:50:35.130 --> 01:50:36.490
<v Speaker 2>ultimate in traumatic collapses and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers in the story.</v>

2140
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:40.870
<v Speaker 2>So Noah is someone who finds fate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who finds favor in the eyes of God.</v>

2141
01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:42.070
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abel,</v>

2142
01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:44.050
<v Speaker 2>there's something that Noah is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2143
01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:46.960
<v Speaker 2>It's going to enable him to ride out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>storm.</v>

2144
01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.540
<v Speaker 2>And so the question here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same question.</v>

2145
01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to have a life where there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>newell storms</v>

2146
01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:56.890
<v Speaker 2>or do you want to have a life where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can ride out the storms?</v>

2147
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:59.140
<v Speaker 2>That's the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2148
01:50:59.350 --> 01:51:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Are you behind the dikes or do you build</v>
<v Speaker 2>a boat?</v>

2149
01:51:01.230 --> 01:51:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you captain the boat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same idea.</v>

2150
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 2>So the idea here is that the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rides out the chaos is the thing that </v>

2151
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:11.320
<v Speaker 2>builds and captains the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another dominance hierarchy idea.</v>

2152
01:51:11.321 --> 01:51:13.450
<v Speaker 2>What should be at the top?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2153
01:51:13.590 --> 01:51:18.590
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the top of something that doesn't </v>

2154
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:18.590
<v Speaker 2>get flooded out as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What should be at the top?</v>

2155
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to be the boat builder and to be </v>

2156
01:51:22.770 --> 01:51:23.140
<v Speaker 2>the captain of the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not to be hidden from the flood.</v>

2157
01:51:23.170 --> 01:51:24.640
<v Speaker 2>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2158
01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:25.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

2159
01:51:25.511 --> 01:51:26.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

2160
01:51:26.831 --> 01:51:29.320
<v Speaker 2>here's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Identity,</v>

2161
01:51:29.770 --> 01:51:33.010
<v Speaker 2>identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what we're up to our neck</v>

2162
01:51:33.011 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2163
01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Are you who you are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I box you it?</v>

2164
01:51:38.110 --> 01:51:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Will you accept that as an identity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could do that lots of ways.</v>

2165
01:51:41.230 --> 01:51:42.520
<v Speaker 2>You're male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're Asia,</v>

2166
01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:43.930
<v Speaker 2>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2167
01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:49.020
<v Speaker 2>There's things about you that I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>derive because of your putative </v>

2168
01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:52.681
<v Speaker 2>membership in a set of different groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with doing that is that the </v>

2169
01:51:52.681 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 2>number of groups that I can assign </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube is without end.</v>

2170
01:51:56.890 --> 01:52:01.120
<v Speaker 2>So I have to pick arbitrary groups to </v>
<v Speaker 2>assign you to and you can accept that if</v>

2171
01:52:01.121 --> 01:52:06.121
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no evidence that those are </v>

2172
01:52:06.121 --> 01:52:07.921
<v Speaker 2>the proper canonical groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you're happy about that </v>

2173
01:52:07.921 --> 01:52:10.891
<v Speaker 2>because now you've been assigned </v>
<v Speaker 2>membership in a group and that's your </v>

2174
01:52:10.891 --> 01:52:10.891
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2175
01:52:10.891 --> 01:52:11.620
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2176
01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:16.420
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens when that identity is flown</v>

2177
01:52:16.421 --> 01:52:18.760
<v Speaker 2>into pieces?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what?</v>

2178
01:52:20.630 --> 01:52:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

2179
01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:26.980
<v Speaker 2>here's the answer to some degree and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the answer that's embedded in </v>

2180
01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:31.631
<v Speaker 2>the story of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want it withstand chaos.</v>

2181
01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to be who you are or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be the thing that changes who </v>

2182
01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:43.701
<v Speaker 2>you are constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the question and that's the </v>

2183
01:52:43.701 --> 01:52:43.701
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference.</v>

2184
01:52:43.701 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a categorical difference in are</v>

2185
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:51.100
<v Speaker 3>you who you are or are you the thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that could continually be more than you </v>

2186
01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.990
<v Speaker 3>are and that's the thing that isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stable identity.</v>

2187
01:52:53.991 --> 01:52:58.991
<v Speaker 3>It's not the initial state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also not the state of being in </v>

2188
01:52:58.991 --> 01:53:00.770
<v Speaker 3>chaos that nihilistic state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2189
01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:06.160
<v Speaker 3>and it's not even the state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reformulation that occurs after you've </v>

2190
01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:09.461
<v Speaker 3>gone through the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the state of continually going </v>

2191
01:53:09.461 --> 01:53:12.971
<v Speaker 3>through the process so you can identify </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the thing that trends you could </v>

2192
01:53:12.971 --> 01:53:17.201
<v Speaker 3>identify,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identify with the thing that you are or </v>

2193
01:53:17.201 --> 01:53:18.170
<v Speaker 3>you can identify with the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>transforms who you are.</v>

2194
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the same as the state </v>

2195
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.650
<v Speaker 3>subjugating itself to the individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the individual is the thing that</v>

2196
01:53:24.651 --> 01:53:27.360
<v Speaker 3>transforms the state and what the state </v>
<v Speaker 3>should do.</v>

2197
01:53:27.361 --> 01:53:32.361
<v Speaker 3>The states necessary because obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>it organizes all of us into peaceful </v>

2198
01:53:32.361 --> 01:53:34.130
<v Speaker 3>cooperation and competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the states necessary.</v>

2199
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the state the highest good?</v>

2200
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:38.840
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2201
01:53:38.841 --> 01:53:41.630
<v Speaker 3>it can't be because it's old and dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>and blind,</v>

2202
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:43.850
<v Speaker 3>and so if the state becomes the highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

2203
01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:48.410
<v Speaker 3>then you're occupied by the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's old and dead and blind.</v>

2204
01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not only not good for you because</v>

2205
01:53:51.441 --> 01:53:56.441
<v Speaker 3>then you're old and dead and blind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also bad for the state because </v>

2206
01:53:56.441 --> 01:53:57.350
<v Speaker 3>as soon as the state gets old and dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>and blind,</v>

2207
01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:00.680
<v Speaker 3>God gets unhappy with it and the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes in and washes it away.</v>

2208
01:54:01.130 --> 01:54:05.120
<v Speaker 3>So it seems like a bad solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's the proper solution?</v>

2209
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:10.870
<v Speaker 3>You subordinate your group identity to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the identity that transforms your </v>

2210
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:10.870
<v Speaker 3>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2211
01:54:10.870 --> 01:54:15.790
<v Speaker 3>And this state subordinates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's power to the vision and </v>

2212
01:54:15.790 --> 01:54:18.590
<v Speaker 3>articulation of the individual because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what revives the state.</v>

2213
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:22.460
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what these stories are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to stumble towards.</v>

2214
01:54:22.461 --> 01:54:27.461
<v Speaker 3>Roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Noah found grace in the eyes of the </v>

2215
01:54:27.461 --> 01:54:27.461
<v Speaker 3>Lord.</v>

2216
01:54:27.461 --> 01:54:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>While Noah was a just man and perfect in</v>

2217
01:54:29.721 --> 01:54:31.970
<v Speaker 3>his generations and Noah walked with </v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2218
01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:35.720
<v Speaker 3>now you remember in the Adam and Eve </v>
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>

2219
01:54:37.010 --> 01:54:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Adam was walking with God to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then he got all self conscious and </v>

2220
01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:43.910
<v Speaker 3>hid behind a bush and when God came to </v>
<v Speaker 3>walk with him,</v>

2221
01:54:43.911 --> 01:54:47.260
<v Speaker 3>he blamed his wife for his </v>
<v Speaker 3>insufficiencies,</v>

2222
01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:50.090
<v Speaker 3>which I still think that's such an </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably comic story.</v>

2223
01:54:50.091 --> 01:54:52.790
<v Speaker 3>I just can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so absolutely ridiculous,</v>

2224
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.240
<v Speaker 3>but that's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While you have no adhere and Noah.</v>

2225
01:54:56.510 --> 01:55:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Noah is like a counter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another counterpart to some degree to </v>

2226
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:04.541
<v Speaker 3>kate as adjustment and he walks with God</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so he's oriented properly and </v>

2227
01:55:04.541 --> 01:55:06.500
<v Speaker 3>because he is oriented properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the flood comes,</v>

2228
01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:10.820
<v Speaker 3>not only does he managed to get through </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as an individual,</v>

2229
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:15.300
<v Speaker 3>he manages to get through it with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>family and he saves and while he saves,</v>

2230
01:55:15.330 --> 01:55:16.760
<v Speaker 3>he roughly saves the world.</v>

2231
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:18.620
<v Speaker 3>That's how the story puts it forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2232
01:55:18.621 --> 01:55:20.750
<v Speaker 3>it's an arc and it's full of animals and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2233
01:55:20.751 --> 01:55:23.540
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got a child's story element to it.</v>

2234
01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:25.670
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect it probably was the story that</v>

2235
01:55:25.671 --> 01:55:27.230
<v Speaker 3>was primarily told to children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2236
01:55:27.231 --> 01:55:30.410
<v Speaker 3>it's like a fable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a fable with punch,</v>

2237
01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:32.780
<v Speaker 3>like the Pinocchio Story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fable with punch.</v>

2238
01:55:32.781 --> 01:55:33.830
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2239
01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:36.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be a flood.</v>

2240
01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:39.140
<v Speaker 3>There's always a flood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always a flood.</v>

2241
01:55:39.141 --> 01:55:41.420
<v Speaker 3>So who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get through the flood,</v>

2242
01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 3>well then you're noah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the that builds the boat.</v>

2243
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:48.120
<v Speaker 2>You're the thing that acts justly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the thing that walks with God.</v>

2244
01:55:48.121 --> 01:55:51.540
<v Speaker 2>We already know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You identify with the transcendent.</v>

2245
01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:52.650
<v Speaker 2>That's Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2246
01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.720
<v Speaker 2>pointing to the star before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformation process that occurs with </v>

2247
01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.001
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you're identifying with a </v>

2248
01:56:02.001 --> 01:56:04.071
<v Speaker 2>benevolent spirit of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have a relationship with the </v>

2249
01:56:04.071 --> 01:56:05.250
<v Speaker 2>transcendent and the benevolent spirit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the state,</v>

2250
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:10.430
<v Speaker 2>and you're also identified with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to generate chaos out of order </v>

2251
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:12.840
<v Speaker 2>and the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it means to walk with God.</v>

2252
01:56:12.841 --> 01:56:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's across all of those dimensions.</v>

2253
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:20.510
<v Speaker 2>So what does that do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you the power to withstand the </v>

2254
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:24.501
<v Speaker 2>flood and to bring people and and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself and civilization along with you.</v>

2255
01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.880
<v Speaker 2>And that's the story of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a precursor,</v>

2256
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:30.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another.</v>

2257
01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Abel is a precursor to the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Redeeming Messiah,</v>

2258
01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:39.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Noah is a precursor to the idea of the </v>

2259
01:56:39.230 --> 01:56:39.230
<v Speaker 2>redeeming messiah.</v>

2260
01:56:39.230 --> 01:56:42.780
<v Speaker 2>You could think about the best pro tow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Messiah's or pro tow Meta heroes,</v>

2261
01:56:42.781 --> 01:56:45.300
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they manifest themselves.</v>

2262
01:56:45.301 --> 01:56:50.301
<v Speaker 2>They're part of the giants that walked </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past and they're embodied their </v>

2263
01:56:50.301 --> 01:56:54.771
<v Speaker 2>attempts embodied in story to elucidate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this triangle that's at the top of the </v>

2264
01:56:55.051 --> 01:56:55.770
<v Speaker 2>pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2265
01:56:55.771 --> 01:56:57.510
<v Speaker 2>The eye that's at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pyramid.</v>

2266
01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:01.440
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I won't tell you the rest of the Noah</v>

2267
01:57:01.441 --> 01:57:05.380
<v Speaker 2>story because I don't think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary for us to,</v>

2268
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:07.570
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2269
01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:11.640
<v Speaker 2>to delve into the more narrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>details,</v>

2270
01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:15.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do want to.</v>

2271
01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:21.680
<v Speaker 2>So it's a pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can point it out in some pretty rough </v>

2272
01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:21.680
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every living substance was destroyed,</v>

2273
01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:26.031
<v Speaker 2>which was upon the face of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both men and cattle and creeping things </v>

2274
01:57:26.031 --> 01:57:27.180
<v Speaker 2>and the follow the heaven and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed from the earth.</v>

2275
01:57:27.210 --> 01:57:30.660
<v Speaker 2>And Noah only remained alive and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were with him in the Ark.</v>

2276
01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:32.800
<v Speaker 2>It's very terrifying story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2277
01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:34.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2278
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:39.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth attending to because we are </v>

2279
01:57:39.070 --> 01:57:39.070
<v Speaker 2>currently in a period of extreme chaos.</v>

2280
01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:41.820
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2281
01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:44.460
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>works out God's had enough.</v>

2282
01:57:44.461 --> 01:57:46.830
<v Speaker 2>He's killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's killed enough of everything.</v>

2283
01:57:46.831 --> 01:57:49.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a traumatic occurrence.</v>

2284
01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:52.590
<v Speaker 2>We can put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The waters recede and God,</v>

2285
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:57.830
<v Speaker 2>a God has done for the time being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then this is what happens at the </v>

2286
01:57:57.830 --> 01:58:01.800
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the arc settle down there,</v>

2287
01:58:01.801 --> 01:58:05.460
<v Speaker 2>unloading it and creation is reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you think,</v>

2288
01:58:05.461 --> 01:58:07.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sets things right?</v>

2289
01:58:07.891 --> 01:58:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between man and God,</v>

2290
01:58:09.511 --> 01:58:14.511
<v Speaker 2>and the story says that Noah built an </v>
<v Speaker 2>altar unto the Lord and took of every </v>

2291
01:58:14.511 --> 01:58:18.270
<v Speaker 2>clean beast and of every clean foul and </v>
<v Speaker 2>offered burnt offerings on the altar.</v>

2292
01:58:18.271 --> 01:58:23.271
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same idea here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that same idea that you started to </v>

2293
01:58:23.271 --> 01:58:26.571
<v Speaker 2>see emerging in the Cain and Abel Story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it that sets things right </v>

2294
01:58:26.571 --> 01:58:27.060
<v Speaker 2>between man and God?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sacrifice.</v>

2295
01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:28.940
<v Speaker 2>So the flood comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then no,</v>

2296
01:58:28.941 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 2>it makes the proper sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2297
01:58:31.471 --> 01:58:33.780
<v Speaker 2>It's part of reestablishing the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

2298
01:58:33.781 --> 01:58:38.160
<v Speaker 2>He makes the proper sacrifices and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>god is happy with the sacrifices,</v>

2299
01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:40.800
<v Speaker 2>which is a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that he's pretty ordinary</v>

2300
01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:42.540
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2301
01:58:44.150 --> 01:58:46.830
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Lord smelled a sweet savor.</v>

2302
01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:51.860
<v Speaker 2>So remember I told you before that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason people thought that this would </v>

2303
01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:55.251
<v Speaker 2>work for us because the smoke would rise</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and God would be able to detect </v>

2304
01:58:55.251 --> 01:58:57.300
<v Speaker 2>whether or not the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sacrifice was of high quality.</v>

2305
01:58:57.330 --> 01:58:59.730
<v Speaker 2>While you have it written right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2306
01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:00.900
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2307
01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:04.200
<v Speaker 2>concretized image of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2308
01:59:04.650 --> 01:59:06.960
<v Speaker 2>of the archetypal spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2309
01:59:07.110 --> 01:59:09.840
<v Speaker 2>The Lord smelled a sweet savor and said </v>
<v Speaker 2>in his heart,</v>

2310
01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:13.230
<v Speaker 2>I will not curse the ground anymore for </v>
<v Speaker 2>man's sake,</v>

2311
01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:16.500
<v Speaker 2>for the imagination of Man's heart is </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil from his youth.</v>

2312
01:59:16.530 --> 01:59:19.980
<v Speaker 2>Neither will I against smite anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>every living thing as I have done.</v>

2313
01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:25.220
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty nice is noah sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually calms down God down to the </v>

2314
01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:26.520
<v Speaker 2>point where he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2315
01:59:26.521 --> 01:59:28.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to wipe everything out </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2316
01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:30.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2317
01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:31.710
<v Speaker 2>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2318
01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:37.040
<v Speaker 2>but I would consider it somewhat of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tenuous contract because we've seen more</v>

2319
01:59:37.291 --> 01:59:42.291
<v Speaker 2>than one example in the recent century </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we came bloody close to wiping </v>

2320
01:59:42.511 --> 01:59:46.160
<v Speaker 2>everything out again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the earth remains,</v>

2321
01:59:46.161 --> 01:59:48.680
<v Speaker 2>seed time and harvest and cold and heat </v>
<v Speaker 2>in summer and winter,</v>

2322
01:59:49.290 --> 01:59:51.350
<v Speaker 2>day and night shall not cease neither.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2323
01:59:51.351 --> 01:59:54.650
<v Speaker 2>will I be any more every living thing as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have done.</v>

2324
01:59:55.730 --> 01:59:57.230
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2325
01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:59.900
<v Speaker 2>so that's that.</v>

2326
02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:05.030
<v Speaker 2>He basically tells noah the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2327
02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:07.550
<v Speaker 2>that he told Adam at the beginning of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

2328
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:10.640
<v Speaker 2>of the genesis story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fine.</v>

2329
02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:15.700
<v Speaker 2>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tells them a bunch of rules which I </v>

2330
02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:15.700
<v Speaker 2>could go into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the moment I won't,</v>

2331
02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:16.250
<v Speaker 2>but I want to show you that</v>

2332
02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:23.470
<v Speaker 2>basically what God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I should do this to some degree.</v>

2333
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:30.390
<v Speaker 2>God lays out a bunch of rules so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could think about it as a precursor to </v>

2334
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:31.660
<v Speaker 2>what happens in the story of exodus </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the 10 commandments are revealed.</v>

2335
02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.880
<v Speaker 2>So this is like a foreshadowing of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

2336
02:00:35.070 --> 02:00:36.940
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What makes the proper sacrifices?</v>

2337
02:00:36.941 --> 02:00:37.750
<v Speaker 2>And God says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2338
02:00:37.751 --> 02:00:38.680
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the rules.</v>

2339
02:00:38.710 --> 02:00:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Follow these rules and then they're laid</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and things will go okay with you.</v>

2340
02:00:43.150 --> 02:00:45.340
<v Speaker 2>That's the covenant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the agreement between the end.</v>

2341
02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:48.550
<v Speaker 2>You could say that's the agreement </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the individual and the spirit of</v>

2342
02:00:48.551 --> 02:00:50.430
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at it,</v>

2343
02:00:50.431 --> 02:00:55.431
<v Speaker 2>but it's not enough because it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>merely the spirit of the state that's </v>

2344
02:00:55.431 --> 02:00:57.460
<v Speaker 2>being negotiated with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the spirit of the state.</v>

2345
02:00:57.850 --> 02:01:02.850
<v Speaker 2>It's the spirit of that which transcends</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state and it's the spirit of the </v>

2346
02:01:02.850 --> 02:01:03.430
<v Speaker 2>moral order that's within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

2347
02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:06.160
<v Speaker 2>All three of those things are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiated simultaneously.</v>

2348
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:10.120
<v Speaker 2>The proper sacrifices are made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the proper rules are laid out,</v>

2349
02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:15.330
<v Speaker 2>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that there'll be a good </v>

2350
02:01:15.330 --> 02:01:15.330
<v Speaker 2>balance between order and chaos as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence,</v>

2351
02:01:15.330 --> 02:01:17.080
<v Speaker 2>as long as people continue to play by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules.</v>

2352
02:01:17.530 --> 02:01:21.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's the awkward fundamentally so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far that seems to work out.</v>

2353
02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:24.630
<v Speaker 4>And then</v>

2354
02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:27.480
<v Speaker 2>this one I think is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

2355
02:01:27.481 --> 02:01:30.540
<v Speaker 2>It's also very short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me a very,</v>

2356
02:01:30.541 --> 02:01:33.540
<v Speaker 2>very long time to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand this.</v>

2357
02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this is after</v>

2358
02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:45.220
<v Speaker 2>the story of Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is you get this </v>

2359
02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:46.750
<v Speaker 2>situation where things descend into </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and there's a great flood.</v>

2360
02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:48.890
<v Speaker 2>So that's sort of like the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos story.</v>

2361
02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:53.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think of it as a if there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you mentioned when things fall apart,</v>

2362
02:01:53.601 --> 02:01:56.660
<v Speaker 2>one possibility is that they fall into </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

2363
02:01:57.230 --> 02:01:59.450
<v Speaker 2>The other possibility is something like</v>

2364
02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:03.360
<v Speaker 4>they become hyper</v>

2365
02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:07.950
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized in hyper orderly and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the state itself,</v>

2366
02:02:07.951 --> 02:02:11.910
<v Speaker 2>which would be the antidote to chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually becomes a source of pathology.</v>

2367
02:02:12.330 --> 02:02:17.330
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's what's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>hinted at in the story of the Tower of </v>

2368
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's what happens is that human </v>

2369
02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:21.140
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll read it to you,</v>

2370
02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:23.100
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has to do with Noah's descendants.</v>

2371
02:02:23.220 --> 02:02:28.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a flip into another story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass as they journeyed </v>

2372
02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:28.590
<v Speaker 2>from the east.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

2373
02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:32.820
<v Speaker 2>And all the days of Noah were 950 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he died.</v>

2374
02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:37.500
<v Speaker 2>New Story and the whole earth was of one</v>
<v Speaker 2>language and one speech.</v>

2375
02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is getting along fine in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribal organization.</v>

2376
02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:46.821
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's homogenous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can all speak to one another and </v>

2377
02:02:46.821 --> 02:02:49.791
<v Speaker 2>they all speak the same language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it came to pass as they journeyed </v>

2378
02:02:49.791 --> 02:02:53.601
<v Speaker 2>from the east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they found a plain in the land of </v>

2379
02:02:53.601 --> 02:02:53.601
<v Speaker 2>Shinar and they dwelt there and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said to one another,</v>

2380
02:02:53.601 --> 02:02:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Goto let us make brick and burn them </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoroughly,</v>

2381
02:02:56.340 --> 02:03:00.630
<v Speaker 2>and they had brick for stone and slime </v>
<v Speaker 2>had they for mortar and they said,</v>

2382
02:03:00.631 --> 02:03:05.631
<v Speaker 2>go to go to let us build a city and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tower whose top may reach unto heaven </v>

2383
02:03:08.250 --> 02:03:13.250
<v Speaker 2>and let us make a name lest we be </v>
<v Speaker 2>scattered abroad upon the face of the </v>

2384
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:13.250
<v Speaker 2>whole earth.</v>

2385
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what's happening here?</v>

2386
02:03:19.170 --> 02:03:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Only the bare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is this.</v>

2387
02:03:21.630 --> 02:03:24.900
<v Speaker 2>What this story means is very deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>implicit in the story.</v>

2388
02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:30.020
<v Speaker 2>It's hinting at it and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was really beyond the power </v>

2389
02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:31.830
<v Speaker 2>of the conceptualization of the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who generated this story.</v>

2390
02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:35.550
<v Speaker 2>To elaborate it to any great detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think what it means is this,</v>

2391
02:03:35.551 --> 02:03:35.790
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

2392
02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:41.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy named Robin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Robin Dunbar,</v>

2393
02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:47.320
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that Dunbar has </v>
<v Speaker 2>done is do a very detailed correlation </v>

2394
02:03:48.141 --> 02:03:51.170
<v Speaker 2>analysis of cortical expansion and group</v>
<v Speaker 2>size.</v>

2395
02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>And what he showed is that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you plot primates bicortical size,</v>

2396
02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:02.480
<v Speaker 2>let's say you correct it for body size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you plot primates by critical size,</v>

2397
02:04:02.481 --> 02:04:05.210
<v Speaker 2>and then you plot the size of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>social groups.</v>

2398
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:08.870
<v Speaker 2>You see a very tight relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the size of the social group and</v>

2399
02:04:08.871 --> 02:04:13.871
<v Speaker 2>the size of the cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The optimal human social group is like </v>

2400
02:04:13.871 --> 02:04:13.871
<v Speaker 2>200 individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that,</v>

2401
02:04:13.871 --> 02:04:18.820
<v Speaker 2>which is maybe roughly the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that you can reasonably track on </v>

2402
02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:18.820
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After that.</v>

2403
02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:19.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2404
02:04:19.431 --> 02:04:21.140
<v Speaker 2>there's names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know those people.</v>

2405
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:26.470
<v Speaker 2>You're not capable of tracking social </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamics there any more complex than </v>

2406
02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:30.971
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly because you have other problems </v>

2407
02:04:30.971 --> 02:04:32.411
<v Speaker 2>to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that has been </v>

2408
02:04:32.411 --> 02:04:34.811
<v Speaker 2>observed is that human groups tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraction eight if they start to exceed </v>

2409
02:04:34.811 --> 02:04:38.741
<v Speaker 2>200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe that's partly because you </v>

2410
02:04:38.741 --> 02:04:38.741
<v Speaker 2>can't keep track of the complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's another</v>

2411
02:04:38.741 --> 02:04:43.220
<v Speaker 3>constraint which is you want your group </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be big enough so that it protects </v>

2412
02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:46.761
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you want it to be small enough so </v>

2413
02:04:46.761 --> 02:04:47.460
<v Speaker 3>that you can climb to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when the group gets really,</v>

2414
02:04:47.461 --> 02:04:48.300
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2415
02:04:48.301 --> 02:04:51.960
<v Speaker 3>really big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe it can protect you,</v>

2416
02:04:51.961 --> 02:04:54.200
<v Speaker 3>although it also doesn't give a damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>about you,</v>

2417
02:04:54.201 --> 02:04:57.210
<v Speaker 3>like once your won $60,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the group,</v>

2418
02:04:57.211 --> 02:05:02.211
<v Speaker 3>like you are at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Toronto where one 30 million of the </v>

2419
02:05:02.211 --> 02:05:04.470
<v Speaker 3>country or maybe one slash 300 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Europe,</v>

2420
02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:08.340
<v Speaker 3>which is partly why Europe is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fragment because that's just not enough,</v>

2421
02:05:08.610 --> 02:05:13.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just not enough there that this </v>

2422
02:05:13.610 --> 02:05:13.610
<v Speaker 3>group is too big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>

2423
02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:19.010
<v Speaker 3>You keep aggregating the group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets more and more powerful and you </v>

2424
02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:22.851
<v Speaker 3>can think of that as something that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>the capacity to replace the </v>

2425
02:05:22.851 --> 02:05:22.950
<v Speaker 3>transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2426
02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.280
<v Speaker 3>We'll make a society that's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a Utopian vision.</v>

2427
02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:27.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what I see happening in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

2428
02:05:27.901 --> 02:05:28.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2429
02:05:28.681 --> 02:05:33.681
<v Speaker 3>make something so great on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings that it will reach up to </v>

2430
02:05:33.681 --> 02:05:37.641
<v Speaker 3>heaven itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means it will take the place of </v>

2431
02:05:37.641 --> 02:05:37.641
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means.</v>

2432
02:05:37.641 --> 02:05:38.770
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what the Communists did </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Soviet Russia,</v>

2433
02:05:38.771 --> 02:05:41.010
<v Speaker 3>and that's what they tried to do in in </v>
<v Speaker 3>China too,</v>

2434
02:05:41.011 --> 02:05:44.070
<v Speaker 3>and so that's why you ended up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like Stalin as the God,</v>

2435
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:46.710
<v Speaker 3>so you talk about getting what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>deserve.</v>

2436
02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:52.220
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you build these monolithic </v>

2437
02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:56.360
<v Speaker 3>enterprises that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's call them state enterprises and </v>

2438
02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:59.301
<v Speaker 3>the idea there is that the state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hyper organized and all inclusive </v>

2439
02:05:59.301 --> 02:06:03.180
<v Speaker 3>state can bring about utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means to reach to heaven.</v>

2440
02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:06.900
<v Speaker 3>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So God gets wind of that and he says,</v>

2441
02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:12.340
<v Speaker 3>the Lord says the Lord came down to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>the city and the tower which the </v>

2442
02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:13.830
<v Speaker 3>children of men built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Lord said,</v>

2443
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:19.310
<v Speaker 3>behold the people is one and now they </v>
<v Speaker 3>all have one language and this they </v>

2444
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:21.480
<v Speaker 3>begin to do and now nothing will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>restrained from them,</v>

2445
02:06:21.630 --> 02:06:23.520
<v Speaker 3>which they have imagined to do.</v>

2446
02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:29.360
<v Speaker 3>Go to let us go down and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 3>confound their language that they may </v>

2447
02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:29.670
<v Speaker 3>not understand one another's speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2448
02:06:29.671 --> 02:06:33.750
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because it sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story kind of portrays it as jealousy on</v>

2449
02:06:33.751 --> 02:06:34.710
<v Speaker 3>God's part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2450
02:06:34.711 --> 02:06:35.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2451
02:06:35.221 --> 02:06:37.510
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these human beings there,</v>

2452
02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:42.840
<v Speaker 3>they're building so magnificently that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to challenge my </v>

2453
02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:46.311
<v Speaker 3>dominion while while I'm going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>down there and play a trick or two on </v>

2454
02:06:46.311 --> 02:06:46.311
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that'll,</v>

2455
02:06:46.311 --> 02:06:46.920
<v Speaker 3>that'll take care of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happens?</v>

2456
02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:53.360
<v Speaker 3>The people within the group gets bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bigger and bigger and bigger and </v>

2457
02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:53.360
<v Speaker 3>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what happens?</v>

2458
02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:55.410
<v Speaker 3>It starts to fragment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is what happens.</v>

2459
02:06:55.440 --> 02:07:00.440
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the reason why the </v>

2460
02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:03.600
<v Speaker 3>totalitarian state enterprise to replace</v>
<v Speaker 3>the transcendent with structure.</v>

2461
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:07.350
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons it's doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you pull more and more people in,</v>

2462
02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:11.490
<v Speaker 3>what happens is you start to pull in </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos itself and that starts to fragment</v>

2463
02:07:11.491 --> 02:07:11.880
<v Speaker 3>the order.</v>

2464
02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Here's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's happening with the.</v>

2465
02:07:15.810 --> 02:07:20.810
<v Speaker 3>So the lgbt power groups are exclusion </v>
<v Speaker 3>excluded groups,</v>

2466
02:07:21.091 --> 02:07:26.091
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it started out with gay rights </v>

2467
02:07:26.091 --> 02:07:26.220
<v Speaker 3>and then one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened that's so interesting,</v>

2468
02:07:26.221 --> 02:07:31.221
<v Speaker 3>so you could think of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a normative group and there </v>

2469
02:07:31.221 --> 02:07:31.221
<v Speaker 3>was excluded people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2470
02:07:31.221 --> 02:07:34.260
<v Speaker 3>And so one section of the excluded </v>
<v Speaker 3>people stood up and said,</v>

2471
02:07:34.261 --> 02:07:35.000
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2472
02:07:35.110 --> 02:07:40.110
<v Speaker 3>enough of this exclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we're gonna categorize ourselves and </v>

2473
02:07:40.110 --> 02:07:41.230
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna fight for recognition as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>excluded,</v>

2474
02:07:41.231 --> 02:07:44.830
<v Speaker 3>we're going to fight to be included.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what happens is,</v>

2475
02:07:44.831 --> 02:07:48.580
<v Speaker 3>well it's l and then it's lb and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's lbg and then it's lgbt.</v>

2476
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:53.790
<v Speaker 3>And the last thing I saw which was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually handed to the medical students </v>

2477
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:55.840
<v Speaker 3>at the University of Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 20 letters.</v>

2478
02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2479
02:07:57.521 --> 02:07:57.910
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

2480
02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:06.100
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is tangentially related to this </v>

2481
02:08:06.100 --> 02:08:07.280
<v Speaker 3>story only.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't come up with a category of the</v>

2482
02:08:07.281 --> 02:08:12.281
<v Speaker 3>things that don't fit inside categories </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's an infinite number of </v>

2483
02:08:12.281 --> 02:08:16.241
<v Speaker 3>things that don't fit inside categories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you try to build a category </v>

2484
02:08:16.241 --> 02:08:20.771
<v Speaker 3>out of all and categorical entities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that happens is it starts to </v>

2485
02:08:20.771 --> 02:08:22.130
<v Speaker 3>fragment because there's actually no </v>
<v Speaker 3>unity there.</v>

2486
02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:27.250
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things you are starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to see is that there's power battles </v>

2487
02:08:27.250 --> 02:08:28.190
<v Speaker 3>emerging on the part of the excluded on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the left.</v>

2488
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:33.370
<v Speaker 3>And it's inevitable because I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what this story is trying to </v>

2489
02:08:33.370 --> 02:08:37.421
<v Speaker 3>represent is that you can't build the </v>
<v Speaker 3>state up beyond a certain size if you </v>

2490
02:08:37.971 --> 02:08:39.710
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will fragment and fall apart.</v>

2491
02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:42.860
<v Speaker 3>The people within it will no longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak the same language and they'll,</v>

2492
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:45.260
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll disperse themselves to different</v>

2493
02:08:45.261 --> 02:08:50.261
<v Speaker 3>corners of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think we're actually in real </v>

2494
02:08:50.261 --> 02:08:53.111
<v Speaker 3>danger of forgetting this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I saw read a </v>

2495
02:08:53.111 --> 02:08:56.951
<v Speaker 3>couple of ominous things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you plot the size of economic </v>

2496
02:08:56.951 --> 02:08:59.540
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes over the last 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting bigger each time.</v>

2497
02:09:00.410 --> 02:09:01.700
<v Speaker 3>So that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2498
02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:06.760
<v Speaker 3>part of that is because the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>economy is getting bigger and so maybe </v>

2499
02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:09.971
<v Speaker 3>you have to control for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the magnitude of the chaos has been </v>

2500
02:09:09.971 --> 02:09:10.640
<v Speaker 3>increasing with each collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2501
02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:21.120
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that came out of the </v>

2502
02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.071
<v Speaker 3>last collapsed 2008 was the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>rescuing collapsed companies like Aig </v>

2503
02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:26.800
<v Speaker 3>and the Royal Bank of Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way was the biggest company</v>

2504
02:09:26.801 --> 02:09:28.060
<v Speaker 3>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knows that.</v>

2505
02:09:28.061 --> 02:09:31.120
<v Speaker 3>But Royal Bank of Scotland collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the biggest company in the world.</v>

2506
02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:35.860
<v Speaker 3>And Aig was the insurer of insurers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so it collapsed too.</v>

2507
02:09:36.010 --> 02:09:38.440
<v Speaker 3>They were rescued by the government and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe fair enough.</v>

2508
02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:44.100
<v Speaker 3>But one of the motifs that came out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the idea of too big to fail.</v>

2509
02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this story says,</v>

2510
02:09:47.290 --> 02:09:52.290
<v Speaker 3>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says two big means definite failure.</v>

2511
02:09:53.890 --> 02:09:58.890
<v Speaker 3>It means inevitable failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that strikes me as highly probable </v>

2512
02:09:58.890 --> 02:10:01.030
<v Speaker 3>is there's a warning in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it's,</v>

2513
02:10:01.410 --> 02:10:01.930
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2514
02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:03.400
<v Speaker 3>it's a bear story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2515
02:10:03.401 --> 02:10:06.040
<v Speaker 3>It's only four or five lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the outlines,</v>

2516
02:10:06.250 --> 02:10:08.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's placed in a very particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2517
02:10:08.051 --> 02:10:09.700
<v Speaker 3>It's placed right after the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2518
02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:10.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2519
02:10:10.721 --> 02:10:12.730
<v Speaker 3>there's the nihilistic chaos of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flood.</v>

2520
02:10:12.731 --> 02:10:17.731
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the temp totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 3>temptation to build hyper structures </v>

2521
02:10:17.731 --> 02:10:19.810
<v Speaker 3>that can theoretically replace the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendent.</v>

2522
02:10:20.050 --> 02:10:25.050
<v Speaker 3>But what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you build the hyper structure and it </v>

2523
02:10:25.050 --> 02:10:26.880
<v Speaker 3>fragments from within,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people don't speak the same </v>

2524
02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:27.220
<v Speaker 3>language and they and they distribute </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

2525
02:10:27.221 --> 02:10:29.230
<v Speaker 3>sort of chaotically on the surface of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>

2526
02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:30.400
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2527
02:10:33.090 --> 02:10:35.810
<v Speaker 2>therefore is the name of it called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Babel.</v>

2528
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Because the Lord did there confound the </v>
<v Speaker 2>language of all the earth.</v>

2529
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:44.950
<v Speaker 2>And from thence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did the Lord scatter them abroad upon </v>

2530
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:47.621
<v Speaker 2>the face of all the earth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the other issue too is that </v>

2531
02:10:47.621 --> 02:10:49.370
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>homogenization of a group?</v>

2532
02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:54.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like you bring everyone into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>group and then they're all the same </v>

2533
02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:54.960
<v Speaker 2>uniformity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2534
02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:56.450
<v Speaker 2>the advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can understand everyone,</v>

2535
02:10:57.740 --> 02:10:59.840
<v Speaker 2>the disadvantages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no variability left,</v>

2536
02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no variability.</v>

2537
02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is a clone of everyone else and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great if you know where you're </v>

2538
02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:07.130
<v Speaker 2>going and you know how to get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really,</v>

2539
02:11:07.131 --> 02:11:12.131
<v Speaker 2>really bad if the underlying structure </v>
<v Speaker 2>shifts on you because the fact that </v>

2540
02:11:12.131 --> 02:11:16.691
<v Speaker 2>you're adapted to one situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyper adapted to one situation might </v>

2541
02:11:16.691 --> 02:11:20.210
<v Speaker 2>mean that your content completely not </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapted to the next situation.</v>

2542
02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:23.000
<v Speaker 2>You build groups that are too big and </v>
<v Speaker 2>too homogenous.</v>

2543
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:28.420
<v Speaker 2>They're effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only within the limited range of </v>

2544
02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:29.420
<v Speaker 2>their map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the map no longer functions,</v>

2545
02:11:29.421 --> 02:11:34.421
<v Speaker 2>then the whole thing sinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's I think what happens in this </v>

2546
02:11:34.421 --> 02:11:34.421
<v Speaker 2>particular story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then okay,</v>

2547
02:11:34.421 --> 02:11:38.951
<v Speaker 2>at the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what happens is that soon </v>

2548
02:11:38.951 --> 02:11:39.380
<v Speaker 2>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think perhaps immediately afterwards,</v>

2549
02:11:39.590 --> 02:11:42.740
<v Speaker 2>the story of Abraham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he merges and that's really.</v>

2550
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:47.360
<v Speaker 2>I would say that's when the the prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>myths,</v>

2551
02:11:47.361 --> 02:11:47.970
<v Speaker 2>the prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2552
02:11:47.971 --> 02:11:52.070
<v Speaker 2>myths take on a more historical element </v>
<v Speaker 2>and history,</v>

2553
02:11:52.090 --> 02:11:57.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking history as we know it </v>

2554
02:11:57.090 --> 02:11:57.090
<v Speaker 2>begins something like 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

2555
02:11:57.090 --> 02:12:01.990
<v Speaker 2>so and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the rest of the biblical stories </v>

2556
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:01.990
<v Speaker 2>proceed at pace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From there,</v>

2557
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:06.520
<v Speaker 2>what basically happens is that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that was well mapped out by </v>

2558
02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:09.680
<v Speaker 2>northrop Frye and you think at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Toronto that you all would</v>

2559
02:12:09.681 --> 02:12:13.250
<v Speaker 2>have been encouraged to read northrop </v>
<v Speaker 2>frye because he was perhaps the greatest</v>

2560
02:12:13.251 --> 02:12:18.251
<v Speaker 2>literary scholar that the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto ever produced and what He.</v>

2561
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:21.110
<v Speaker 2>He outlined the old testament very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

2562
02:12:21.111 --> 02:12:26.111
<v Speaker 2>he said that what happens after these </v>
<v Speaker 2>initial stories is that the state </v>

2563
02:12:26.111 --> 02:12:30.130
<v Speaker 2>arises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like the Tower of Babel is </v>

2564
02:12:30.130 --> 02:12:32.050
<v Speaker 2>continually rebuild over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the state of Israel's.</v>

2565
02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:34.210
<v Speaker 2>The Israelis Israelites get their act </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

2566
02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:36.170
<v Speaker 2>build a state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

2567
02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:39.380
<v Speaker 2>They get corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A prophet comes up and says,</v>

2568
02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:44.440
<v Speaker 2>you better watch out because what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is not making God happy and the </v>

2569
02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:47.340
<v Speaker 2>profits are very brave because they come</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward that the kings are authoritarian</v>

2570
02:12:47.341 --> 02:12:48.800
<v Speaker 2>and they can kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At an instant,</v>

2571
02:12:48.801 --> 02:12:51.860
<v Speaker 2>but the profits are moved by walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>with God,</v>

2572
02:12:51.861 --> 02:12:53.660
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better argument.</v>

2573
02:12:53.661 --> 02:12:54.980
<v Speaker 2>They come to the king and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2574
02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:57.110
<v Speaker 2>you're not caring for the widows and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

2575
02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you think that's okay because </v>

2576
02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:02.800
<v Speaker 2>they're weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not okay.</v>

2577
02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:05.770
<v Speaker 2>You're breaking the covenant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're breaking the rules and the price </v>

2578
02:13:05.770 --> 02:13:06.260
<v Speaker 2>for that is what we really saw.</v>

2579
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:11.290
<v Speaker 2>The price for that is a flood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like get your act together or </v>

2580
02:13:11.290 --> 02:13:13.961
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now sometimes the kings to whom the </v>

2581
02:13:13.961 --> 02:13:13.961
<v Speaker 2>prophets speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2582
02:13:13.961 --> 02:13:18.550
<v Speaker 2>but often they don't and then the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody state is demolished and then </v>

2583
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560
<v Speaker 2>isn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lights are back.</v>

2584
02:13:18.561 --> 02:13:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Like they're enslaved or they get wiped </v>
<v Speaker 2>out by their enemies are like,</v>

2585
02:13:21.831 --> 02:13:26.831
<v Speaker 2>it's a complete bloody catastrophe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lasts for centuries and then they kind </v>

2586
02:13:26.831 --> 02:13:30.721
<v Speaker 2>of struggled back up and make another </v>
<v Speaker 2>state and then they get arrogant and </v>

2587
02:13:30.721 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>then it gets corrupt and then a profit </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes along and says,</v>

2588
02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:34.590
<v Speaker 2>you know what happened last time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2589
02:13:34.650 --> 02:13:36.000
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was 600 years ago,</v>

2590
02:13:36.001 --> 02:13:41.001
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I knew everything now so I don't </v>

2591
02:13:41.001 --> 02:13:41.700
<v Speaker 2>have to pay any attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's they ignore it and then because the</v>

2592
02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:46.740
<v Speaker 2>and the prophet say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are violating a fundamental moral </v>

2593
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:46.740
<v Speaker 2>order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to as king,</v>

2594
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:50.580
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be subject to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something higher than yourself.</v>

2595
02:13:50.670 --> 02:13:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the idea that the </v>

2596
02:13:55.670 --> 02:13:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamians had that the emperor was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be an emissary of Marduk.</v>

2597
02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:58.950
<v Speaker 2>That's why he was the emperor because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a good Marduk.</v>

2598
02:13:58.951 --> 02:14:03.951
<v Speaker 2>He could confront chaos and make order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was what gave him his sovereignty </v>

2599
02:14:03.951 --> 02:14:06.450
<v Speaker 2>or the Egyptian Pharaoh was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of Osiris and horus.</v>

2600
02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what gave him sovereignty and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea was you get to be king,</v>

2601
02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:15.810
<v Speaker 2>but you have to act out the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being king and if you don't do that,</v>

2602
02:14:16.110 --> 02:14:20.940
<v Speaker 2>then well king or not all hell's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>break loose for you.</v>

2603
02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:23.280
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the profit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually say,</v>

2604
02:14:23.281 --> 02:14:24.580
<v Speaker 2>but the Israel lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2605
02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:27.810
<v Speaker 2>they don't pay enough attention and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>continued to get absolutely demolished.</v>

2606
02:14:27.811 --> 02:14:32.811
<v Speaker 2>And so the Old Testament can be read at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least in part as the description of a </v>

2607
02:14:32.811 --> 02:14:37.791
<v Speaker 2>sequence of the rise and fall of states </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their descent into corruption and </v>

2608
02:14:37.791 --> 02:14:42.471
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we'll leave it at that because I </v>

2609
02:14:42.471 --> 02:14:43.170
<v Speaker 2>want to tell you the next part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

2610
02:14:43.171 --> 02:14:46.500
<v Speaker 2>the last part of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking in our next lecture,</v>

2611
02:14:46.501 --> 02:14:51.501
<v Speaker 2>which is also the last lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've got about 12 minutes if we want</v>

2612
02:14:52.411 --> 02:14:57.411
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if anybody has any questions you can </v>

2613
02:14:57.411 --> 02:14:58.140
<v Speaker 2>ask them are we can and if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we could call it a day.</v>

2614
02:14:58.530 --> 02:15:01.020
<v Speaker 2>So does any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2615
02:15:02.530 --> 02:15:04.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2616
02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:07.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's a lot of strange inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm curious,</v>

2617
02:15:07.351 --> 02:15:07.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2618
02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:10.560
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if what you make of it,</v>

2619
02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:25.860
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about your why is why </v>
<v Speaker 5>is it a similar size,</v>

2620
02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:28.960
<v Speaker 5>which is American.</v>

2621
02:15:32.130 --> 02:15:34.020
<v Speaker 2>You think the right and left can talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

2622
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:37.000
<v Speaker 2>You think they speak the same language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2623
02:15:37.770 --> 02:15:40.950
<v Speaker 2>You see it that fragmenting occurring </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they really are.</v>

2624
02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Not only are they speaking different </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages there,</v>

2625
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:45.390
<v Speaker 2>they really are speaking different </v>
<v Speaker 2>languages.</v>

2626
02:15:45.391 --> 02:15:47.340
<v Speaker 2>It's the right way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2627
02:15:47.341 --> 02:15:48.630
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous.</v>

2628
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:51.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the US worked for a long time,</v>

2629
02:15:51.450 --> 02:15:54.150
<v Speaker 2>first of all because it didn't always </v>
<v Speaker 2>have 300 million people.</v>

2630
02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:56.550
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people to put under one </v>
<v Speaker 2>umbrella.</v>

2631
02:15:56.850 --> 02:16:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Now the utility of the American system </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it is a hierarchy,</v>

2632
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:03.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's individuals,</v>

2633
02:16:03.641 --> 02:16:05.110
<v Speaker 2>families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>towns,</v>

2634
02:16:05.170 --> 02:16:09.730
<v Speaker 2>states underneath a somewhat loose </v>
<v Speaker 2>federal structure and that sort of.</v>

2635
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:14.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a monolith where everyone has </v>

2636
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:16.720
<v Speaker 2>to speak precisely the same language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got some flexibility built into its</v>

2637
02:16:16.721 --> 02:16:18.110
<v Speaker 2>structure because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2638
02:16:18.570 --> 02:16:19.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2639
02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:24.010
<v Speaker 2>it's formulated into components which </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a certain amount of autonomy and so</v>

2640
02:16:24.011 --> 02:16:25.690
<v Speaker 2>far that's worked sufficiently well.</v>

2641
02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Whether it will and it will probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to work.</v>

2642
02:16:28.511 --> 02:16:33.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean the are a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very robust people and they've gone </v>

2643
02:16:33.511 --> 02:16:34.330
<v Speaker 2>through things that are analogous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're going through now.</v>

2644
02:16:34.331 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Many times God only knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2645
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:41.260
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very dangerous thing to presume</v>

2646
02:16:41.261 --> 02:16:46.261
<v Speaker 2>that the Americans are down for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>count because they have an uncanny </v>

2647
02:16:46.261 --> 02:16:47.350
<v Speaker 2>ability to rise from the ashes even </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger than they were before.</v>

2648
02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:50.380
<v Speaker 2>But you can certainly see the danger </v>
<v Speaker 2>lurking in Europe.</v>

2649
02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:52.180
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different thing.</v>

2650
02:16:52.210 --> 02:16:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I think the European state is dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it grew too fast and </v>

2651
02:16:58.290 --> 02:17:03.290
<v Speaker 2>it's severed that connection between </v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's not the proper hierarchy </v>

2652
02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:04.270
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of identification.</v>

2653
02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:05.890
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are saying,</v>

2654
02:17:05.891 --> 02:17:07.180
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Brussels,</v>

2655
02:17:07.181 --> 02:17:08.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the hell are you guys?</v>

2656
02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Why are you making decisions for us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't agree with your decisions </v>

2657
02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:16.150
<v Speaker 2>and like are you sure that Greece and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany can be in the same place because</v>

2658
02:17:16.151 --> 02:17:19.000
<v Speaker 2>that's by no means self evident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2659
02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:24.060
<v Speaker 2>The Germans aren't very happy about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Greeks aren't very happy about </v>

2660
02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:27.151
<v Speaker 2>it and one of the rules for making an </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization is that it's a lot easier </v>

2661
02:17:27.151 --> 02:17:31.681
<v Speaker 2>to make a functional organization worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is to make a dysfunctional </v>

2662
02:17:31.681 --> 02:17:33.370
<v Speaker 2>organization better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>

2663
02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:36.070
<v Speaker 2>well you've got Germany and France and </v>
<v Speaker 2>England,</v>

2664
02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:38.590
<v Speaker 2>well let's say Germany and France </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerhouses,</v>

2665
02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:41.710
<v Speaker 2>especially Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can afford to bring Greece in.</v>

2666
02:17:42.010 --> 02:17:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

2667
02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:45.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2668
02:17:46.290 --> 02:17:48.570
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence that they can afford</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2669
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:51.180
<v Speaker 2>So I mean Greece is unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt.</v>

2670
02:17:51.210 --> 02:17:53.610
<v Speaker 2>No one pays her income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big problem.</v>

2671
02:17:53.670 --> 02:17:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And bringing them in to a union at a </v>

2672
02:17:58.670 --> 02:18:01.440
<v Speaker 2>high order has no effect whatsoever on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the micro behaviors.</v>

2673
02:18:01.770 --> 02:18:06.770
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is the micro behaviors </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be rectified and no one really </v>

2674
02:18:06.770 --> 02:18:10.071
<v Speaker 2>knows how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you stop a country where people </v>

2675
02:18:10.071 --> 02:18:12.411
<v Speaker 2>don't pay their taxes from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you stop the people from not </v>

2676
02:18:12.411 --> 02:18:14.040
<v Speaker 2>paying their taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we pay our taxes?</v>

2677
02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could just all of a sudden decide not</v>

2678
02:18:17.011 --> 02:18:17.580
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2679
02:18:17.581 --> 02:18:22.581
<v Speaker 2>and the government wouldn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources to run around gathering them </v>

2680
02:18:22.581 --> 02:18:25.221
<v Speaker 2>all up for one reason or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become customary for people in </v>

2681
02:18:25.221 --> 02:18:27.420
<v Speaker 2>functional Western democracies to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>their taxes.</v>

2682
02:18:27.630 --> 02:18:31.470
<v Speaker 2>But why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

2683
02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:36.500
<v Speaker 2>It would have been way easier for us </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to do what the Greeks did and </v>

2684
02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:36.500
<v Speaker 2>pretend to pay them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2685
02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:41.780
<v Speaker 2>so there are too big I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the people on the right is saying</v>

2686
02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:44.850
<v Speaker 2>back to the nation and like I understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they're doing that,</v>

2687
02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:47.510
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2688
02:18:49.310 --> 02:18:51.800
<v Speaker 2>the danger is the nation will </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinate the individual.</v>

2689
02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:55.010
<v Speaker 2>And I do see it as another example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe spaces.</v>

2690
02:18:55.470 --> 02:18:57.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just scales different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2691
02:18:58.310 --> 02:19:02.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I think that the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidote to that,</v>

2692
02:19:02.451 --> 02:19:04.940
<v Speaker 2>to both the chaos on the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>order on the right,</v>

2693
02:19:05.210 --> 02:19:10.210
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to walk the proper line in the </v>

2694
02:19:10.210 --> 02:19:10.520
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we better do that because things are</v>

2695
02:19:10.521 --> 02:19:12.680
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things are too chaotic at the moment.</v>

2696
02:19:13.460 --> 02:19:17.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's really good that's possible.</v>

2697
02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:22.840
<v Speaker 2>But we're in a state where I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe we're in a state where things </v>

2698
02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:25.160
<v Speaker 2>could go any number of ways and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2699
02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:26.930
<v Speaker 2>there's no predicting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2700
02:19:26.931 --> 02:19:28.430
<v Speaker 2>And never felt that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2701
02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean I lived in the eighties and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2702
02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:37.300
<v Speaker 2>political correctness rose up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties as well and I can remember a </v>

2703
02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:40.601
<v Speaker 2>lot of what happened in the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies with the oil crisis and all </v>

2704
02:19:40.601 --> 02:19:43.361
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there were times when things were </v>

2705
02:19:43.361 --> 02:19:43.580
<v Speaker 2>shaky but they weren't shaky the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are now.</v>

2706
02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:49.180
<v Speaker 2>They're an internal shakiness rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than something that was a threat that </v>

2707
02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:49.340
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be imposed from the outside.</v>

2708
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:51.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2709
02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:53.810
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2710
02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:54.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2711
02:19:54.890 --> 02:19:59.890
<v Speaker 2>it is associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this intellectual war that's going </v>

2712
02:19:59.890 --> 02:20:01.190
<v Speaker 2>on with postmodernism in new Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of that as well.</v>

2713
02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:01.850
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2714
02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:13.070
<v Speaker 5>dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you mentioned that the effects are </v>

2715
02:20:14.730 --> 02:20:19.730
<v Speaker 5>much more pronounced than men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially given the agenda.</v>

2716
02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:39.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're good questions.</v>

2717
02:20:39.780 --> 02:20:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a couple of strange things</v>

2718
02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:44.210
<v Speaker 2>that it takes that I don't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

2719
02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:49.240
<v Speaker 2>The first is when we've done the </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis of the effects of the future </v>

2720
02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:52.451
<v Speaker 2>authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has had a different differential </v>

2721
02:20:52.451 --> 02:20:55.370
<v Speaker 2>impact on men and it's had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly differential impact on what</v>

2722
02:20:55.371 --> 02:21:00.371
<v Speaker 2>I would call it excluded men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that would be non western ethic </v>

2723
02:21:00.371 --> 02:21:04.121
<v Speaker 2>minority men or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what majority men who aren't doing </v>

2724
02:21:04.731 --> 02:21:06.230
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

2725
02:21:06.231 --> 02:21:11.231
<v Speaker 2>at Mohawk College,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future authoring program had a </v>

2726
02:21:11.231 --> 02:21:14.321
<v Speaker 2>particularly robust effect on Mohawk </v>
<v Speaker 2>college students who are men who hadn't </v>

2727
02:21:14.321 --> 02:21:18.431
<v Speaker 2>done very well in high school and knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't picked a major that had a </v>

2728
02:21:18.431 --> 02:21:20.540
<v Speaker 2>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a career destination at it's amp.</v>

2729
02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:24.590
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine those people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have an ambiguous relationship with</v>

2730
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:29.510
<v Speaker 2>the idea of education and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented specifically towards a goal.</v>

2731
02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:34.900
<v Speaker 2>They're not very motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now why did it have a differential </v>

2732
02:21:34.900 --> 02:21:36.830
<v Speaker 2>effect on man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

2733
02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:38.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2734
02:21:38.721 --> 02:21:42.350
<v Speaker 2>the women are doing better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it might just be a matter of the fact</v>

2735
02:21:42.351 --> 02:21:47.351
<v Speaker 2>that it does better for people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't doing as well and at the moment </v>

2736
02:21:47.351 --> 02:21:47.960
<v Speaker 2>most of them are men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe.</v>

2737
02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that might be part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't believe that's all of it.</v>

2738
02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I think that part of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 2>women are doing better is because </v>

2739
02:21:57.040 --> 02:21:59.000
<v Speaker 2>they're agreeable and so if a system </v>
<v Speaker 2>sets out a structure and says,</v>

2740
02:21:59.060 --> 02:22:02.260
<v Speaker 2>here's a pathway to attainment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women won't rebel against that.</v>

2741
02:22:02.270 --> 02:22:07.270
<v Speaker 2>They'll go along with it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>working very well for them at the </v>

2742
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.270
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man,</v>

2743
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:10.841
<v Speaker 2>especially the men on the disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the distribution and there's way </v>

2744
02:22:10.841 --> 02:22:12.080
<v Speaker 2>more men on the district disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the distribution.</v>

2745
02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Then there are women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2746
02:22:13.431 --> 02:22:18.431
<v Speaker 2>That's what you get from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at overlapping normal </v>

2747
02:22:18.431 --> 02:22:18.590
<v Speaker 2>distributions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the male district,</v>

2748
02:22:18.591 --> 02:22:22.730
<v Speaker 2>female distribution for agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mail distribution for agreeableness.</v>

2749
02:22:22.970 --> 02:22:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Tremendous overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2750
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Women are higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the really agreeable people are </v>

2751
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:32.391
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the really disagreeable people are </v>

2752
02:22:32.391 --> 02:22:33.060
<v Speaker 2>meant and maybe the real differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>occur at the extremes.</v>

2753
02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2754
02:22:34.290 --> 02:22:39.290
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a very interesting side effect </v>

2755
02:22:39.290 --> 02:22:40.680
<v Speaker 2>of overlapping distributions so people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be mostly the same,</v>

2756
02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:43.440
<v Speaker 2>but that can still produce radical </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

2757
02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Disagreeable men won't do anything they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to do.</v>

2758
02:22:47.850 --> 02:22:52.850
<v Speaker 2>They just say up yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go home and play video games with </v>

2759
02:22:52.850 --> 02:22:54.000
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not listening to your stupid classes</v>

2760
02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:57.780
<v Speaker 2>and why should I work for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just go have fun.</v>

2761
02:22:58.650 --> 02:23:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I'll do my own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're motivated.</v>

2762
02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:04.230
<v Speaker 2>And so then if you take the men who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and you say,</v>

2763
02:23:04.231 --> 02:23:05.340
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want?</v>

2764
02:23:06.390 --> 02:23:08.850
<v Speaker 2>You can have what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have figured out what it is.</v>

2765
02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.620
<v Speaker 2>So then they write down what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>

2766
02:23:10.621 --> 02:23:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that might be worth having.</v>

2767
02:23:12.421 --> 02:23:15.660
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I'll put some effort into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

2768
02:23:16.050 --> 02:23:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2769
02:23:16.650 --> 02:23:19.770
<v Speaker 2>that's weak evidence and this is a weak </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

2770
02:23:20.010 --> 02:23:23.070
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to stretch out my </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding to account for this.</v>

2771
02:23:23.071 --> 02:23:24.720
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you something else that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really weird.</v>

2772
02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand this either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So more than 90 percent of the people </v>

2773
02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:34.461
<v Speaker 2>who watch my videos on youtube are men </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that's weird because now about 80 </v>

2774
02:23:34.461 --> 02:23:35.850
<v Speaker 2>percent of psychology students are </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

2775
02:23:36.390 --> 02:23:38.340
<v Speaker 2>So that is not what you would expect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2776
02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:41.850
<v Speaker 2>You would expect that the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them would be women and you might say,</v>

2777
02:23:41.851 --> 02:23:43.800
<v Speaker 2>well it's because of the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance I've taken.</v>

2778
02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:45.360
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's possible.</v>

2779
02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:48.090
<v Speaker 2>So I went and looked at the demographic </v>
<v Speaker 2>data because I have that.</v>

2780
02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Well before I did any of the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>

2781
02:23:50.730 --> 02:23:54.810
<v Speaker 2>85 percent of my viewers were men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually increased a bit.</v>

2782
02:23:54.811 --> 02:23:58.440
<v Speaker 2>It's increased by six percent and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not trivial,</v>

2783
02:23:58.441 --> 02:24:02.580
<v Speaker 2>but it was still overwhelmingly men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was interesting.</v>

2784
02:24:02.581 --> 02:24:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell,</v>

2785
02:24:03.451 --> 02:24:04.620
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2786
02:24:05.010 --> 02:24:10.010
<v Speaker 2>And then now I've been watching crowds </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I've been talking to them and the </v>

2787
02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:11.220
<v Speaker 2>crowds that have come to see me in </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

2788
02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:16.400
<v Speaker 2>This happened at the University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto Free Speech Debate and I </v>

2789
02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:19.611
<v Speaker 2>actually noticed it and commented on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the debate took place because I </v>

2790
02:24:19.611 --> 02:24:20.520
<v Speaker 2>was talking about intrinsic differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>between men and women.</v>

2791
02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:21.990
<v Speaker 2>And I looked around the room and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

2792
02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:23.100
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2793
02:24:23.130 --> 02:24:24.900
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of the people in this room </v>
<v Speaker 2>are men.</v>

2794
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:30.110
<v Speaker 2>So I had all the men stay windham and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women stand up and then all the men </v>

2795
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.110
<v Speaker 2>stand up.</v>

2796
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.110
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2797
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:32.520
<v Speaker 2>here's a natural experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some reason,</v>

2798
02:24:32.521 --> 02:24:34.470
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of the people who showed up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this sermon,</v>

2799
02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:37.320
<v Speaker 2>now everybody thought I was kinda </v>
<v Speaker 2>cracked to to do that.</v>

2800
02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:39.140
<v Speaker 2>And it was a risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2801
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:40.770
<v Speaker 2>But I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2802
02:24:40.771 --> 02:24:45.771
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what's interesting now is that </v>

2803
02:24:45.771 --> 02:24:49.550
<v Speaker 2>every public appearance that I've made </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's related to the sort of topics </v>

2804
02:24:49.550 --> 02:24:50.490
<v Speaker 2>that we're discussing is overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

2805
02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:54.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like 85 to 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought,</v>

2806
02:24:54.481 --> 02:24:55.290
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

2807
02:24:55.291 --> 02:24:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Like what the Hell's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2808
02:24:57.450 --> 02:25:02.450
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing I've noticed is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've been talking a lot to the </v>

2809
02:25:02.450 --> 02:25:06.561
<v Speaker 2>crowds that I've been talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not about rights but about </v>

2810
02:25:06.561 --> 02:25:06.561
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2811
02:25:06.561 --> 02:25:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Because he can't have the bloody </v>
<v Speaker 2>converse.</v>

2812
02:25:07.350 --> 02:25:12.350
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have the conversation about </v>

2813
02:25:12.350 --> 02:25:14.631
<v Speaker 2>rights without the conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility because your rights are </v>

2814
02:25:14.631 --> 02:25:17.790
<v Speaker 2>my responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they are technically,</v>

2815
02:25:17.970 --> 02:25:22.970
<v Speaker 2>so you just can't have only half of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion and we're only having half </v>

2816
02:25:22.970 --> 02:25:23.980
<v Speaker 2>that discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

2817
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:25.720
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are you leaving out?</v>

2818
02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:29.620
<v Speaker 3>If you only have that half of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion and the answer is,</v>

2819
02:25:29.621 --> 02:25:34.621
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're leaving out responsibility and </v>

2820
02:25:34.621 --> 02:25:34.621
<v Speaker 3>then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2821
02:25:34.621 --> 02:25:35.680
<v Speaker 3>what are you leaving out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're leaving out responsibility and</v>

2822
02:25:35.681 --> 02:25:40.681
<v Speaker 3>that answer might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe you're leaving out the </v>

2823
02:25:40.681 --> 02:25:40.780
<v Speaker 3>meaning of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks like to me.</v>

2824
02:25:41.010 --> 02:25:45.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like here you are suffering away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes it worthwhile,</v>

2825
02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:48.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you're completely out.</v>

2826
02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:53.340
<v Speaker 3>You're completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea what you're you.</v>

2827
02:25:53.350 --> 02:25:58.150
<v Speaker 3>It's almost impossible to describe how </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad an idea that is.</v>

2828
02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what gives life meaning.</v>

2829
02:26:03.430 --> 02:26:07.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like lift a load.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you can tolerate yourself,</v>

2830
02:26:07.091 --> 02:26:08.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because look at your useless,</v>

2831
02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:11.350
<v Speaker 3>easily hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>easily killed.</v>

2832
02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Why should you have any self respect?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the story of the fall.</v>

2833
02:26:15.730 --> 02:26:17.550
<v Speaker 3>Pick something up and carry it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pick.</v>

2834
02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:19.330
<v Speaker 3>Make it heavy enough so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

2835
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:21.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well useless as I am.</v>

2836
02:26:21.730 --> 02:26:24.100
<v Speaker 3>At least I could move that from there to</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2837
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really cool about that is that </v>

2838
02:26:29.550 --> 02:26:31.171
<v Speaker 3>when I talk to these crowds about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the man's eyes light up and that's very </v>

2839
02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:36.240
<v Speaker 3>like I've seen that phenomena because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been talking about this </v>

2840
02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:36.240
<v Speaker 3>mythological material for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can see what I'm watching.</v>

2841
02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Crowds people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2842
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:42.630
<v Speaker 3>their eyebrows lift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their eyes light up because I put </v>

2843
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.660
<v Speaker 3>something together for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not sweat,</v>

2844
02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:47.700
<v Speaker 3>mythological stories do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not taking responsibility for </v>

2845
02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:47.700
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the stories due.</v>

2846
02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:48.760
<v Speaker 3>So I say this story to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go click,</v>

2847
02:26:48.761 --> 02:26:49.420
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>

2848
02:26:49.710 --> 02:26:54.710
<v Speaker 3>you know when their eyes light up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this responsibility thing that's a </v>

2849
02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:56.350
<v Speaker 3>whole new order of this is that young </v>
<v Speaker 3>men are so hungry for that.</v>

2850
02:26:56.351 --> 02:27:01.351
<v Speaker 3>It is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I've been talking </v>

2851
02:27:01.351 --> 02:27:04.411
<v Speaker 3>to some of the people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>running for the conservative leadership </v>

2852
02:27:04.411 --> 02:27:06.160
<v Speaker 3>in Canada and I've been talking to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2853
02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:11.360
<v Speaker 3>well the difficulties they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating with young people because </v>

2854
02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:11.360
<v Speaker 3>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2855
02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:11.650
<v Speaker 3>What the hell are they going to sell to </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people,</v>

2856
02:27:11.651 --> 02:27:16.651
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because being conservative is something </v>

2857
02:27:16.651 --> 02:27:16.651
<v Speaker 3>that happens when you're older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can sell responsibility.</v>

2858
02:27:17.470 --> 02:27:19.390
<v Speaker 3>No one's selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>

2859
02:27:19.690 --> 02:27:21.610
<v Speaker 3>for men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing but responsibility.</v>

2860
02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:27.250
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching the simpsons the other </v>

2861
02:27:27.250 --> 02:27:29.281
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched the simpsons episode and I </v>

2862
02:27:29.281 --> 02:27:29.830
<v Speaker 3>deconstructed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's really interesting.</v>

2863
02:27:29.831 --> 02:27:34.150
<v Speaker 3>So what happens in the first Simpson </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode is that it's Christmas and homer</v>

2864
02:27:34.151 --> 02:27:39.151
<v Speaker 3>and marge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to buy some Christmas </v>

2865
02:27:39.151 --> 02:27:41.011
<v Speaker 3>presents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but homer doesn't get his Christmas </v>

2866
02:27:41.011 --> 02:27:41.110
<v Speaker 3>bonus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he's absolutely crushed by that.</v>

2867
02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:46.320
<v Speaker 3>And that actually is a recurring theme </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the simpsons where homer loses his </v>

2868
02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:47.470
<v Speaker 3>job or something like that or can't make</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough money.</v>

2869
02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:50.170
<v Speaker 3>He's completely crushed even though he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of useless,</v>

2870
02:27:50.171 --> 02:27:51.790
<v Speaker 3>bumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing,</v>

2871
02:27:51.791 --> 02:27:53.770
<v Speaker 3>fool of a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2872
02:27:54.010 --> 02:27:59.010
<v Speaker 3>The thing that gives that show its soul </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that he still oriented towards his </v>

2873
02:27:59.010 --> 02:27:59.010
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

2874
02:27:59.010 --> 02:28:01.450
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes them honorable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that foolish as he is.</v>

2875
02:28:01.630 --> 02:28:05.620
<v Speaker 3>He's decided to adopt responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 3>his family and to try to bear that.</v>

2876
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:07.750
<v Speaker 3>And so he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a holy fool.</v>

2877
02:28:07.751 --> 02:28:12.751
<v Speaker 3>He's not a complete fool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so interesting watching the story </v>

2878
02:28:12.751 --> 02:28:14.800
<v Speaker 3>because he suffers dreadfully as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequence of not being able to fulfill</v>

2879
02:28:14.801 --> 02:28:16.150
<v Speaker 3>his responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2880
02:28:16.151 --> 02:28:21.151
<v Speaker 3>that's for men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women have their sets of </v>

2881
02:28:21.151 --> 02:28:21.220
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not the same,</v>

2882
02:28:21.950 --> 02:28:26.950
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're complicated because </v>

2883
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.950
<v Speaker 3>women of course have to take primary </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for,</v>

2884
02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:30.290
<v Speaker 3>for having infants at least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then also for caring for them,</v>

2885
02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:35.560
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're structured differently than men </v>

2886
02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:38.740
<v Speaker 3>for biological necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if it's not a psychological issue </v>

2887
02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:38.930
<v Speaker 3>and it's also partly a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

2888
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Women know what they have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men have to figure out what they have to</v>

2889
02:28:43.641 --> 02:28:46.670
<v Speaker 3>do and if they have nothing worth living</v>
<v Speaker 3>for them,</v>

2890
02:28:46.671 --> 02:28:51.671
<v Speaker 3>they stay Peter Pan and why the hell not</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the alternative to valued </v>

2891
02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:58.960
<v Speaker 3>responsibility is impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low class pleasure,</v>

2892
02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:02.600
<v Speaker 3>and you saw that in the Pinocchio Story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2893
02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:04.310
<v Speaker 3>That's pleasure island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2894
02:29:04.311 --> 02:29:09.311
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why lift the load if there's nothing in </v>

2895
02:29:09.311 --> 02:29:09.311
<v Speaker 3>it for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing that we're doing to</v>

2896
02:29:09.311 --> 02:29:11.570
<v Speaker 3>men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very bad idea and two boys,</v>

2897
02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:14.780
<v Speaker 3>it's like your pathological and </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressive.</v>

2898
02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:15.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

2899
02:29:15.561 --> 02:29:17.700
<v Speaker 3>Then why the hell am I going to play if </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>

2900
02:29:17.701 --> 02:29:22.701
<v Speaker 3>If that's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I get no credit for bearing </v>

2901
02:29:22.701 --> 02:29:25.481
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can bloody well be sure I'm not </v>

2902
02:29:25.481 --> 02:29:28.031
<v Speaker 3>going to bear it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you know your life is useless </v>

2903
02:29:28.031 --> 02:29:28.880
<v Speaker 3>and meaningless and you have your full </v>
<v Speaker 3>of self contempt,</v>

2904
02:29:28.881 --> 02:29:31.370
<v Speaker 3>denialism and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's not good.</v>

2905
02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:35.780
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why I think that's what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think is going on at a deeper level with</v>

2906
02:29:35.781 --> 02:29:40.781
<v Speaker 3>regards to men needing this direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A man has to decide that he's going to </v>

2907
02:29:40.781 --> 02:29:42.320
<v Speaker 3>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to decide that</v>

2908
02:29:48.990 --> 02:29:49.830
<v Speaker 5>image.</v>

2909
02:29:52.820 --> 02:29:53.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2910
02:29:53.271 --> 02:29:56.240
<v Speaker 3>you know partly what you're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the future authoring process to say,</v>

2911
02:29:56.241 --> 02:29:57.590
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what's your highest value?</v>

2912
02:29:58.430 --> 02:29:59.480
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the star.</v>

2913
02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:00.440
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2914
02:30:00.470 --> 02:30:03.320
<v Speaker 3>what are you aiming for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can decide man,</v>

2915
02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:05.120
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some criteria.</v>

2916
02:30:05.300 --> 02:30:10.300
<v Speaker 3>It should be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be good for you in a way that </v>

2917
02:30:10.300 --> 02:30:12.140
<v Speaker 3>facilitates your moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it should be good for you in a way</v>

2918
02:30:12.141 --> 02:30:14.210
<v Speaker 3>that's also good for the family and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

2919
02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:19.420
<v Speaker 3>It should cover the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the domain of life mean there's </v>

2920
02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:21.380
<v Speaker 3>constraints on what you should regard as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a value,</v>

2921
02:30:21.970 --> 02:30:23.810
<v Speaker 3>but you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But within those constraints,</v>

2922
02:30:23.811 --> 02:30:27.710
<v Speaker 3>you have the choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have choice.</v>

2923
02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is is that people will carry a</v>

2924
02:30:30.561 --> 02:30:35.240
<v Speaker 3>heavy load if they get to pick the god </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn load so and they think,</v>

2925
02:30:35.241 --> 02:30:36.410
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't carry any load.</v>

2926
02:30:36.411 --> 02:30:37.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2927
02:30:37.041 --> 02:30:42.041
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you're like the sled dog that </v>

2928
02:30:42.041 --> 02:30:42.041
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have a sled pole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just gonna.</v>

2929
02:30:42.041 --> 02:30:44.450
<v Speaker 3>You're going to tear a piece is out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own legs because you're bored.</v>

2930
02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:47.300
<v Speaker 3>You know you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are pack animals.</v>

2931
02:30:47.301 --> 02:30:52.301
<v Speaker 3>They need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need to pull against a weight and </v>

2932
02:30:52.301 --> 02:30:52.880
<v Speaker 3>and that's not true for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not true.</v>

2933
02:30:52.881 --> 02:30:55.010
<v Speaker 3>Particularly say for low conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2934
02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe they're open and creative </v>
<v Speaker 3>are extroverted and some other things,</v>

2935
02:30:58.071 --> 02:31:00.860
<v Speaker 3>but for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the typical person,</v>

2936
02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:02.560
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2937
02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:07.780
<v Speaker 3>they'll eat themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll eat themselves up unless they </v>

2938
02:31:07.780 --> 02:31:10.631
<v Speaker 3>have a load.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why there's such an opiate </v>

2939
02:31:10.631 --> 02:31:12.401
<v Speaker 3>epidemic among a dispossessed white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle aged guys who were unemployed in </v>

2940
02:31:12.401 --> 02:31:13.910
<v Speaker 3>the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they lose their job.</v>

2941
02:31:13.940 --> 02:31:15.860
<v Speaker 3>They're done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2942
02:31:16.220 --> 02:31:21.220
<v Speaker 3>They despise themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They develop chronic pain syndromes and </v>

2943
02:31:21.220 --> 02:31:21.220
<v Speaker 3>depression</v>

2944
02:31:21.220 --> 02:31:22.590
<v Speaker 2>and the chronic pain is treated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>opiates.</v>

2945
02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:26.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2946
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:29.250
<v Speaker 2>that's what it looks like to me is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to.</v>

2947
02:31:29.310 --> 02:31:34.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's so interesting to watch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>young men when you talk to them about </v>

2948
02:31:34.310 --> 02:31:34.310
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a God damn thrilled about it.</v>

2949
02:31:34.350 --> 02:31:35.990
<v Speaker 2>It just blows me away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2950
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:37.920
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's.</v>

2951
02:31:38.250 --> 02:31:43.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the counterculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grow the hell up and do something </v>

2952
02:31:43.250 --> 02:31:43.890
<v Speaker 2>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2953
02:31:43.891 --> 02:31:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2954
02:31:44.731 --> 02:31:48.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm so excited by that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one ever mentioned that before.</v>

2955
02:31:48.660 --> 02:31:49.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

2956
02:31:49.621 --> 02:31:50.520
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

2957
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2958
02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:53.580
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's appalling.</v>

2959
02:31:53.900 --> 02:31:54.450
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2960
02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:57.510
<v Speaker 2>and I feel that that's deeply felt by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are,</v>

2961
02:31:58.140 --> 02:32:01.260
<v Speaker 2>who are coming out to to listen to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of things,</v>

2962
02:32:01.261 --> 02:32:04.260
<v Speaker 2>to there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've had enough of that so.</v>

2963
02:32:04.350 --> 02:32:09.350
<v Speaker 2>And they better have because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nonproductive motive being </v>

2964
02:32:09.350 --> 02:32:09.350
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2965
02:32:09.540 --> 02:32:11.910
<v Speaker 2>That's where the meaning in life is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2966
02:32:14.590 --> 02:32:15.860
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2967
02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:17.100
<v Speaker 2>One more class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2968
02:32:17.850 --> 02:32:18.960
<v Speaker 2>we'll see you next week.</v>
