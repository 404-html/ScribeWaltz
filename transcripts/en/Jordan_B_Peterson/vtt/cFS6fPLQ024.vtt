1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we divided up the brain one way</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and now we're going to divide it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>another way,</v>

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>and so this is the brain from the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and you know you have two</v>

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>hemispheres and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>why do you need two hemispheres?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you probably know this,</v>

7
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:20.181
<v Speaker 1>that a Zana who's a relatively famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychologist,</v>

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>studied split brain patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that your cortical</v>

9
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>hemispheres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain is united down in the</v>

10
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>subcortical areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of stuck together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you have twin 11 twins of many</v>

12
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>of the subcortical structures like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to Hipaa camp,</v>

13
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>eye to Amygdala,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

14
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>one on each side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the top the hemispheres are quite</v>

15
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>separate and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're connected by the Corpus</v>

16
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>callosum which makes them communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of interesting because you</v>

17
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>kind of wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why aren't they just all glued</v>

18
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>

19
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what it seems to indicate is that</v>

20
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>there's some utility of functional</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence combined with some utility</v>

21
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>of communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>so it might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really want to be networked at</v>

23
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>the same time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To everyone in the world,</v>

24
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.911
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

25
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want some narrow channel pathways so</v>

26
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>that only the important information</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes through,</v>

27
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 1>so it's sort of maybe like the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere is one kind of computational</v>

28
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>device in the left hemisphere is another</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of computational device.</v>

29
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Of course they're not computational</v>
<v Speaker 1>devices,</v>

30
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>but you get the point and only the</v>
<v Speaker 1>important information and process</v>

31
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 1>information from the right hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes across and only the process,</v>

32
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>the information from the left hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes across something like that,</v>

33
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have someone who's epileptic or</v>

34
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>or that that has a brain illness of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of specific type,</v>

35
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>it's usually epilepsy but not always and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do surgery on them and you cut the</v>

36
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Corpus callosum.</v>

37
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 1>What you find weirdly enough is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>each hemisphere develops its own</v>

38
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>personality and so it's Kinda Nice as</v>
<v Speaker 1>other evidence.</v>

39
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I would say for the idea that what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain does is produce personalities,</v>

40
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can keep pairing the brain down and</v>

41
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>what it's going to do is produce lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lower resolution personalities all</v>

42
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>the way down to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just known as detailed.</v>

43
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.530
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you lost,</v>

44
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:11.310
<v Speaker 1>say 80 percent of your cortex randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd sort of be like a thumbnail of</v>

45
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'd still be you,</v>

46
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>but just not at the same detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you,</v>

47
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>here's an interesting idea from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholics.</v>

48
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It kind of goes along with the Avatar</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

49
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>So the Catholics had been wrestling for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time with the question about how</v>

50
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>God could have fit himself in the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>body because you could imagine that</v>

51
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>would obsess Christians.</v>

52
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like God is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big God and you know,</v>

53
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>little bitty body put God in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just bursts the boundaries.</v>

54
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this idea called Kenosis,</v>

55
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>which means emptying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is that God had to empty</v>

56
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed before and get inhabited human</v>

57
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>body and it's very much like a thumbnail</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

58
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and young would have of course thought</v>

59
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>exactly that the self was a thumbnail of</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

60
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wouldn't put it that way,</v>

61
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>but definitely that's where his thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>was leading.</v>

62
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a pretty damn cool idea.</v>

63
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is from.</v>

64
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I developed this before I ran what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to tell you,</v>

65
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about it from another theorist,</v>

66
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:18.260
<v Speaker 1>his point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy I'm going to tell you about,</v>

67
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>his name is Al Cohen and Goldberg and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a neuropsychologist and he was one</v>

68
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.880
<v Speaker 1>of learning as students who ended up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York and Goldberg was obviously</v>

69
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.690
<v Speaker 1>influenced by Luria and all the Sokolov</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vinegar,</v>

70
00:03:29.691 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>silver and gray and all those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've already talked to you about</v>

71
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>and he was interested in why you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hemispheres.</v>

72
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things that you can</v>

73
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>say broadly speaking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemispheres,</v>

74
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>and I've written them some of them down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

75
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>so the right hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an idealized representation of a</v>

76
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>relatively highly lateralized right</v>
<v Speaker 1>handed male,</v>

77
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I'm saying that is men</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be more lateralized than women</v>

78
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>and the right handed lateralization is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard kind,</v>

79
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but you know the brain can be louder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lysed all sorts of ways.</v>

80
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>What you might say is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of ways of looking at</v>

81
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way you can look at it is that your</v>

82
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:13.081
<v Speaker 1>cortex gets colonized by underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures so and that each underlying</v>

83
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>structure is likely to call annise a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular area.</v>

84
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

85
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.690
<v Speaker 1>when you are born and you wake up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see your eyes are going to call an</v>

86
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your visual Cortex,</v>

87
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>most likely because it's sort of adapted</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that,</v>

88
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have a visual Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your eyes will colonize something</v>

89
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:33.454
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

90
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's.</v>

91
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>So the brain has proclivities towards a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of structure,</v>

92
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>but especially early in development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably plastic.</v>

93
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>And so brains can be organized in</v>
<v Speaker 1>lateralized in a bunch of different</v>

94
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so to simplify what you do is you</v>

95
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>kind of take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

96
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:56.191
<v Speaker 1>well let's take the most straightforward</v>
<v Speaker 1>and typical brain and talk about it as</v>

97
00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>if it's the canonical brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what you can say is</v>

98
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>regardless of where these systems are</v>
<v Speaker 1>localized,</v>

99
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 1>they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an over simplification,</v>

100
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what you've got with</v>

101
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 1>regards to your core to cs is a quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dirty cortex and that's the right</v>

102
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got a longterm detailed</v>

103
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>cortex and that's the left hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left hemisphere,</v>

104
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>specialized for language language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cuts,</v>

105
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 1>things up into little tiny bitty pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

106
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's really useful if you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>little tiny bitty things and you</v>

107
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be precision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

108
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Pinpoint accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that takes a lot of time and a lot</v>

109
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>of computation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the right hemisphere says,</v>

110
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

111
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.020
<v Speaker 1>let's get to the bloody point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

112
00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>And so it captures the thing in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>

113
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>So like the monster I showed you from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hippy cartoon,</v>

114
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a right hemisphere thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an image that represents a class of</v>

115
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>entities and which of course the images</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

116
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's this woman named</v>

117
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefree number autistic woman.</v>

118
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>She's a developed cattle handling</v>
<v Speaker 1>facilities all across.</v>

119
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Temple.</v>

120
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:07.731
<v Speaker 1>Grandin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

121
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Very cool person I saw at temple grandin</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak at the University of Arizona at</v>

122
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>the consciousness conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like the funniest speech I'd</v>

123
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because it wasn't perfect,</v>

124
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>it was bloody perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she's a tough woman.</v>

125
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>She looks like a cowboy and she spent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time with animals.</v>

126
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 1>She kind of comes out on the stage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>her cowboy outfit and she's unbelievably</v>

127
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 1>straightforward and without nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's autistic,</v>

128
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 1>she's severely autistic and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 1>her mother helped her a lot and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed this thing that you would go</v>

130
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>inside to compress her and hold her was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little machine and that would comfort</v>

131
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

132
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 1>she turned herself into quite the quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person and she thinks she thinks</v>

133
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 1>like an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why she can design cattle</v>

134
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>handling facility often slaughter houses</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the cattle don't get all freaked</v>

135
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:57.090
<v Speaker 1>out as they're on their way to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventual demise.</v>

136
00:06:57.091 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things she does is she</v>
<v Speaker 1>walks through where the counselor going</v>

137
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 1>in anything that bothers her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she assumes will bother a cow.</v>

138
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.820
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the cows are walking through this say</v>

139
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>spiral or they're on their way to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughterhouse and there's a coke can</v>

140
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>lying on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the cows will stop and look at the</v>

141
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>coke can to normalist.</v>

142
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She talked a lot about how she thought</v>

143
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:25.481
<v Speaker 1>and what she said was she could not</v>
<v Speaker 1>devise abstract representations.</v>

144
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 1>So she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

145
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine how a child draws a house.</v>

146
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

147
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.770
<v Speaker 1>what is he now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles' house,</v>

148
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a triangle and a square on the</v>

149
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's another rectangle and</v>

150
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>another kind of Parallelogram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a door and two windows,</v>

151
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's a chimney with smoke coming</v>

152
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite cool.</v>

153
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

154
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Where's the smoke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

155
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 1>you don't see that modern houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kids still do that.</v>

156
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe there's a tree and usually</v>

157
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:58.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a sun and then house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you think,</v>

158
00:07:58.161 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that cute?</v>

159
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 1>A simple drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that drawing.</v>

160
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never seen a house that looks</v>

161
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>like that in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks nothing like a house.</v>

162
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a picture.</v>

163
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a hero cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pre linguistic representation and</v>

164
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:16.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like the essential elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

165
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say what the child has</v>
<v Speaker 1>done is extracted out all those things</v>

166
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>that are common across all houses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then represented that it's not a</v>

167
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you take autistic people</v>

168
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and you get them to draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll start in one corner of the house</v>

169
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>and what they'll draw is that helps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with every damn brick in place.</v>

170
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 1>So there are autistic people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

171
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>who they can look at a building and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can count every single window at one</v>

172
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 1>glance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another guy who in</v>

173
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>England who's really famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is just completely out of.</v>

174
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 1>He's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take them up in a helicopter and</v>

175
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>show them a city that he's never seen.</v>

176
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes home and has a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>

177
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>like as big as a wall and he starts in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one corner and he draws the entire city,</v>

178
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he doesn't sketch it out,</v>

179
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

180
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.880
<v Speaker 1>it's from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

181
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 1>that's autistic savant drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often what happens is he's very</v>

182
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>realistic looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what happens if the autistic</v>

183
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:15.420
<v Speaker 1>drawing survivors languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start being able to draw and that's</v>

184
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 1>because the abstraction interferes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the realism,</v>

185
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really hard to draw a hand.</v>

186
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is if you draw a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

187
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 1>you draw a hieroglyph the hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what heroin looks like.</v>

188
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.290
<v Speaker 1>You tried to draw your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really strange.</v>

189
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And one of the strange things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to draw your hand is that in</v>

190
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 1>order to draw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to stop seeing it as if it's a</v>

191
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 1>hand and then it pops out.</v>

192
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

193
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>that's the weirdest looking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a tree root.</v>

194
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:46.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know it's a claw because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

195
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at your hand like that,</v>

196
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.870
<v Speaker 1>it looks nothing like a hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it hair looks.</v>

197
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.870
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some sort of spider,</v>

198
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:55.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

199
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>But you have to see it that way before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can draw it.</v>

200
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 1>And so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So partly what happens is that your</v>

201
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 1>capacity for abstraction interferes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ability to see detail and not</v>

202
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 1>probably good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the ways that you simplify</v>

203
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 1>the world anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right hemisphere looks like it's</v>

204
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 1>specialized for anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the way I look at it is this,</v>

205
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:18.960
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got your hippocampus down</v>

206
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 1>there and it's keeping track of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison between what you want and</v>

207
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 1>what you think is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

208
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 1>something emerges.</v>

209
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 1>It's anomalous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the hell is going</v>

210
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:29.420
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you freeze.</v>

211
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you start to feel anxious.</v>

212
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Then the right hemisphere comes up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some pictures.</v>

213
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>What might this be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can experience this at home for your</v>

214
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 1>own enjoyment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're home at two in the</v>

215
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Speaker 1>morning and it's dark and you're alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

216
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've watched a horror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movies are all nicely pride,</v>

217
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you hear a noise in another</v>

218
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 1>room and not knowing shouldn't be there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're going to go investigate,</v>

219
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say the door is just a</v>

220
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 1>little bit open and it's dark in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room and you have to put your hand in to</v>

221
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:00.810
<v Speaker 1>turn on the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just watched what your</v>

222
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 1>imagination populates that room with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do that,</v>

223
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:05.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.470
<v Speaker 1>guy with acs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake alligator,</v>

225
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 1>like whatever.</v>

226
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:13.220
<v Speaker 1>But your right hemisphere is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There may be one of this class of</v>

227
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:17.300
<v Speaker 1>dangerous things in there and what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is basically coming up with a</v>

228
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.190
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of monster might be in there</v>

229
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 1>and you're all sort of freaked out about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that even though you know that you know,</v>

230
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.710
<v Speaker 1>who knows what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know nothing.</v>

231
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Something creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're all like on edge because your</v>

232
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 1>brain doesn't work at night like it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the day and everyone knows that.</v>

233
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Wake up in the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all manner of horrors go</v>

234
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>through your imagination and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually happens when you're asleep.</v>

235
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.440
<v Speaker 1>You're asleep for that most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you wake up and it's like</v>

236
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.320
<v Speaker 1>you worry about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

237
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>so that's the right hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming up with pictures of what</v>

238
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 1>might be there and they're generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrous pictures and reason for that</v>

239
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 1>is while it's obvious what the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that is,</v>

240
00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you'll probably turn the light on</v>

241
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 1>and look anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you might sort of peer</v>

242
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>around the corner and then when there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

243
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:04.960
<v Speaker 1>you'll be embarrassed about how foolish</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

244
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can see the instinctual behavior</v>

245
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 1>right there and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wise,</v>

246
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a low probability that something</v>

247
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:17.791
<v Speaker 1>terrible is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but zero times low probability times</v>

248
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 1>infinity equals large danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a two percent chance that</v>

249
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a killer in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pays to be a little on the 10 side</v>

250
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:30.700
<v Speaker 1>because being killed really sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your,</v>

251
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:33.490
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your prime to feel negative emotion more</v>

252
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 1>intensely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

253
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Because you're so vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

254
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what the right hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>is up to.</v>

255
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It does quick and dirty representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also does categorization.</v>

256
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't give you exactly realistic</v>

257
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 1>representations of what's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it does instead is gives you</v>

258
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 1>categorical representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>

259
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 1>how should you represent an unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger?</v>

260
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 1>You should use an amalgam of all known</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangers to represent it.</v>

261
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And that is what it is in a sense.</v>

262
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's why I talked to you earlier</v>

263
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 1>about the category of all dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

264
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So the aborigines in Australia have</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

265
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 1>this category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is women fire and dangerous things</v>

266
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.351
<v Speaker 1>like what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

267
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:19.720
<v Speaker 1>why are all those things in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>category?</v>

268
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

269
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not that hard to figure out if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

270
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:25.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a category that you very</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently see say,</v>

271
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 1>and Disney cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the wicked queen for example,</v>

272
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:31.690
<v Speaker 1>in sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's constantly bursting into</v>

273
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 1>flames and turning into a dragon and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one seems to object to that.</v>

274
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 1>It makes perfect sense that the wicked</v>
<v Speaker 1>queen would turn into a fire breathing</v>

275
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:40.120
<v Speaker 1>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it doesn't make any sense at</v>

276
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but although it does,</v>

277
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:46.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a rational transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because it's in keeping with an</v>

278
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.490
<v Speaker 1>archetypal structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody goes,</v>

279
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:50.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that's what she's going to do.</v>

280
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.380
<v Speaker 1>And it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Disney movies like Ursula,</v>

281
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>you remember her from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Little Mermaid.</v>

282
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.600
<v Speaker 1>She's trying to keep her daughter from</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming conscious.</v>

283
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice mother doing that.</v>

284
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.830
<v Speaker 1>And she trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sold Zeus,</v>

285
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:04.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she squeezes it soul to death.</v>

286
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Traps them in the underworld because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also.</v>

287
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we won't get into that,</v>

288
00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:12.600
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to Ursula is when you find,</v>

289
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 1>get her irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if she grows into this huge ship</v>

290
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 1>destroying store monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part octopus,</v>

291
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or giant octopus,</v>

292
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:21.801
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

293
00:14:21.801 --> 00:14:23.950
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

294
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make a lot of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a kind of hypothesis now that's</v>

295
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 1>a representation of mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red in tooth and claw,</v>

296
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.930
<v Speaker 1>and there's also a reason that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>

297
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's feminine.</v>

298
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

299
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.070
<v Speaker 1>But we'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the right hemisphere,</v>

300
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's specialized for a.</v>

301
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 1>normally it does quick and dirty</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis under the influence of the</v>

302
00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:48.670
<v Speaker 1>limbic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not linguistics,</v>

303
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:53.671
<v Speaker 1>so I would say it's still dominated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the systems and my suspicion is that</v>

304
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 1>animals are still dominated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subcortical systems.</v>

305
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Their brains worked from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a top down model and that's at</v>

306
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:05.840
<v Speaker 1>least a part of the left hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic system and it's a new thing</v>

307
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 1>that people have and it's based on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to abstract.</v>

308
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So that would partly be visual like here</v>
<v Speaker 1>or glyphic.</v>

309
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 1>And then also to transform things into</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic form.</v>

310
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that that's the part</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we really identify as ourself,</v>

311
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's weird if you're,</v>

312
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.100
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're home alone and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>freaked out and all these images come to</v>

313
00:15:25.101 --> 00:15:26.440
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

314
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 1>if you think of those images is part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

315
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 1>you think more.</v>

316
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.230
<v Speaker 1>There are things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that appeared to you and that's</v>

317
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:36.830
<v Speaker 1>what you think about your dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things that appeared to you.</v>

318
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>They're not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

319
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 1>why would you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're there in your</v>

320
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:45.740
<v Speaker 1>experientials space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that separation between you</v>

321
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 1>and your dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a dream,</v>

322
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 1>not I thought up a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or look what I created.</v>

323
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like there you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Observer.</v>

324
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:54.530
<v Speaker 1>And up comes a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

325
00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 1>very weird and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows you that there are forces</v>

326
00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 1>operating in your psyche that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>impersonal,</v>

327
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>genuinely impersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's part of what you</v>

328
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 1>can call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collective unconscious.</v>

329
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the thing that generates these</v>

330
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 1>weird images and protects you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in its nature,</v>

331
00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:12.830
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can be absolutely terrifying.</v>

332
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can have dreams that are so</v>

333
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:15.584
<v Speaker 1>terrible that.</v>

334
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the one my my little niece nephew</v>

335
00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:23.081
<v Speaker 1>had that's pretty damn nasty little</v>
<v Speaker 1>greasy door things with big beaks.</v>

336
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's an ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very ugly representation.</v>

337
00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:30.080
<v Speaker 1>And then if that wasn't bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there had to be a fire breathing dragon</v>

338
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 1>behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating them in to this thing like it's</v>

339
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 1>no bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was waking up screaming.</v>

340
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

341
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I figured out what life is like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like at four,</v>

342
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.420
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty traumatic.</v>

343
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.490
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the left hemisphere,</v>

344
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.030
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is out,</v>

345
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 1>and the goldbergs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypo potts says she got one hemisphere</v>

346
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:54.341
<v Speaker 1>or system that operates when you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and when what you want</v>

347
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:58.550
<v Speaker 1>is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the happy talky part that</v>

348
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 1>thinks it knows what the hell is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

349
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 1>And then you have another part that only</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns on when you don't know what's</v>

350
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:04.610
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

351
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's full of anxiety and negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

352
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 1>The Right Hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

353
00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:11.150
<v Speaker 1>is specialized for negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

354
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.240
<v Speaker 1>if you sustain right prefrontal damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become inappropriately happy and you</v>

355
00:17:16.591 --> 00:17:18.970
<v Speaker 1>think you're full of positive illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Think,</v>

356
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an excellent thing.</v>

357
00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make really impulsive,</v>

358
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 1>risky decisions and your life goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly to help because he needed the</v>

359
00:17:26.751 --> 00:17:31.040
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you know the reason you suffer</v>

360
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 1>with negative emotion is because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't suffer with negative emotion use,</v>

361
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.870
<v Speaker 1>you'd suffer from being destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are your options.</v>

362
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 1>There are people by the way who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>born without pain and so you think,</v>

363
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:44.690
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good deal.</v>

364
00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like they never last past 20 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason for that is you don't</v>

365
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.580
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but while you're sitting there,</v>

366
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.650
<v Speaker 1>you're going like this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is,</v>

367
00:17:53.651 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 1>is that if you sit for any length of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time on one part of your body,</v>

368
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.060
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't get much blood and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get oxygenated,</v>

369
00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:02.230
<v Speaker 1>and so you do that.</v>

370
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>A bitch is a little bit little pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you shift,</v>

371
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you shift and you shift and so you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doing this all the time because</v>

372
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you wear out your damn body or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get bedsores or that sort of thing.</v>

373
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Well these people that don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

374
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 1>they just wear themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

375
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 1>So you need the negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

376
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.810
<v Speaker 1>it keeps you going and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it can get out of hand and have its</v>

377
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:22.980
<v Speaker 1>own pathologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

378
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the right hemisphere does negative</v>

379
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.420
<v Speaker 1>emotion inhibition of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the freezing and its attendant on</v>

380
00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:33.900
<v Speaker 1>anxiety does image processing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holistic thinking.</v>

381
00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:37.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's the quick and dirty hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern recognition,</v>

382
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.930
<v Speaker 1>pattern generation and gross motor</v>
<v Speaker 1>action not.</v>

383
00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:41.160
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

384
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Because the gross motor action is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quick and dirty stuff.</v>

385
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you need to slap something away,</v>

386
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.970
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:18:49.971 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 1>a gross motor gesture.</v>

388
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go like this and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>precise.</v>

389
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:57.390
<v Speaker 1>It can just be fast and sloppy and it'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>still work.</v>

390
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Now the left hemisphere is specialized</v>
<v Speaker 1>for when you know what the hell's going</v>

391
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:05.520
<v Speaker 1>on and you can concentrate on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>details so and then you can think about</v>

392
00:19:05.521 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 1>it in terms of the hierarchy that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed,</v>

393
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:11.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it implies is that at the level</v>

394
00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:16.131
<v Speaker 1>of specific fine detailed motor output,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left hemisphere is operating and so</v>

395
00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:18.480
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of associated with positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect.</v>

396
00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what I'm doing and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>making minor adjustments and</v>

397
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:24.540
<v Speaker 1>everything's going well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you go up the hierarchy</v>

398
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:28.080
<v Speaker 1>towards more and more abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>

399
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:31.650
<v Speaker 1>then increasingly that's moving over</v>
<v Speaker 1>into right hemisphere space.</v>

400
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.450
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also partly why when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupt those higher order structures</v>

401
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 1>that well literally all hell breaks</v>
<v Speaker 1>loose.</v>

402
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So left hemisphere operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory,</v>

403
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:45.810
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>activation of behavior.</v>

404
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's also exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a word processing,</v>

405
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:51.780
<v Speaker 1>linear thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail recognition,</v>

406
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.420
<v Speaker 1>detailed generation and fine motor</v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

407
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 1>So you need one system that works when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's going on and you</v>

408
00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:00.150
<v Speaker 1>need another system that works when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

409
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.750
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes your where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you're doing and sometimes</v>

410
00:20:03.751 --> 00:20:05.130
<v Speaker 1>your where you do know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

411
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Now Ramachandra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a fairly famous neurologist who</v>

412
00:20:08.551 --> 00:20:13.551
<v Speaker 1>operates out of La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he associated that totalitarian eagle</v>

413
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:15.900
<v Speaker 1>with hyper domination of the left</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere.</v>

414
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.540
<v Speaker 1>And the reason he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very cool.</v>

415
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>So he's got these patients that have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>

416
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.750
<v Speaker 1>He said Agnosia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

417
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 1>We'll call it neglect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neglect.</v>

418
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is what happens.</v>

419
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a stroke and the stroke affects</v>

420
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.870
<v Speaker 1>the back part of the right hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

421
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.180
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your left side is paralyzed.</v>

422
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 1>You can't do anything with it.</v>

423
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So however you also don't notice that</v>

424
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you might do if</v>

425
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:52.390
<v Speaker 1>you do become aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're laying in bed,</v>

426
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:55.420
<v Speaker 1>you've had a stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for some reason you noticed that</v>

427
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.690
<v Speaker 1>there's an arm lying in there with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what you do is you pick it up</v>

428
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 1>with your other hand and you try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it out of the bed and when you</v>

429
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:04.120
<v Speaker 1>find out that it's attached to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not your arm,</v>

430
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not very happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you throw yourself right out of</v>

431
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:09.370
<v Speaker 1>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if someone gets you to draw a</v>

432
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.860
<v Speaker 1>clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you draw half a clock and if you eat a</v>

433
00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>plate full of food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat half the plate unless someone</v>

434
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 1>turns it and then you eat half of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so half the world is gone.</v>

435
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.220
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to imagine what that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>liking.</v>

436
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.060
<v Speaker 1>But I think what it's sort of like is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how there's a whole world</v>

437
00:21:25.061 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 1>behind you and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't detect it as not there.</v>

438
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not black or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when your eyes are closed,</v>

439
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 1>it's just not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what happens with people</v>

440
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:41.011
<v Speaker 1>with neglect is that the not there</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes three quarters instead of just</v>

441
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.360
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that anyways.</v>

442
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.450
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't know what's going on.</v>

443
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:49.090
<v Speaker 1>And there you are like this and someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>says to you,</v>

444
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that you can't move your left</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm today.</v>

445
00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 1>And what do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

446
00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:57.100
<v Speaker 1>well that's because I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you say I'm,</v>

447
00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like moving it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>

448
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:03.130
<v Speaker 1>So you'll have this reason that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to move it.</v>

449
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say the same thing about the</v>

450
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:06.160
<v Speaker 1>left foot or whatever.</v>

451
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.701
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

452
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 1>well I don't feel like moving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll have some story about why</v>

453
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to move it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

454
00:22:11.321 --> 00:22:14.680
<v Speaker 1>So that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for Indians thought about that as</v>

455
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:19.090
<v Speaker 1>traumatic denial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that it was so overwhelming to</v>

456
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:21.610
<v Speaker 1>you that you lost the left part of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

457
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.610
<v Speaker 1>that you couldn't face it and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>denied it happened.</v>

458
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite right.</v>

459
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:28.870
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a bad theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

460
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.160
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you a couple of associated</v>

461
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're on dialysis.</v>

462
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.620
<v Speaker 1>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have this big thing in your</v>

463
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 1>arm that's like a shunt and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go get hooked up to a dialysis</v>

464
00:22:42.251 --> 00:22:45.310
<v Speaker 1>machine like all the time because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>kidneys are failing.</v>

465
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 1>And so who wants that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

466
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:50.200
<v Speaker 1>So everybody thinks time for a kidney</v>
<v Speaker 1>transplant.</v>

467
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So then they're on a long waiting list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it one kidney that's not very many</v>

468
00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:54.784
<v Speaker 1>kidneys.</v>

469
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.370
<v Speaker 1>And so then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

470
00:22:57.371 --> 00:22:59.500
<v Speaker 1>you got your kidney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's thrilled about that.</v>

471
00:22:59.501 --> 00:23:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Here's your antirejection medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure you take it and so then a year</v>

472
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.470
<v Speaker 1>later you lose your kidney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

473
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't take your damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>antirejection medication.</v>

474
00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:10.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the most common reason you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

475
00:23:10.691 --> 00:23:12.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why in the world would you not take your</v>

476
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:15.850
<v Speaker 1>antirejection medication?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the Freud's would say denial?</v>

477
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Here's a different hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a whole map of you is person with</v>

478
00:23:21.131 --> 00:23:25.870
<v Speaker 1>kidney and then you lose your kidneys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you're a whole weird thing</v>

479
00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:29.680
<v Speaker 1>that you have no idea about and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually impossible for you to update</v>

480
00:23:29.681 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 1>your model and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

481
00:23:31.601 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 1>does that make any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

482
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.620
<v Speaker 1>have you ever lost a tooth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

483
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.750
<v Speaker 1>What is your tongue do for like six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months?</v>

484
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.380
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting there in your tongue is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fiddling away in there like a mad</v>

485
00:23:41.381 --> 00:23:46.381
<v Speaker 1>dog investigating every nook and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an obsessive exploratory device and</v>

486
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even when you don't want it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to and then six months later you get</v>

487
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:53.360
<v Speaker 1>your mouth remapped.</v>

488
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's just a tooth man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lose a kidney and see what happens or</v>

489
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 1>lose the whole left side of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

490
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:02.150
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

491
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.970
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then Ramachandra and he's testing</v>

492
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:09.971
<v Speaker 1>these people for balance and so what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>does is he checks out this phenomena</v>

493
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:15.320
<v Speaker 1>called Nystagmus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you pour cold water in</v>

494
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:17.450
<v Speaker 1>someone's ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their eyes move back and forth because</v>

495
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:19.320
<v Speaker 1>it screws up the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

496
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a balanced system in your,</v>

497
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.550
<v Speaker 1>in your ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you pour cold water and air it</v>

498
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.600
<v Speaker 1>screws it up and then your eyes move</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>

499
00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not very pleasant.</v>

500
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.900
<v Speaker 1>So what he found was that if he poured</v>
<v Speaker 1>water in the cold water in the left ear,</v>

501
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.540
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden the people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up and go,</v>

502
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.090
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the left side of my body.</v>

503
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And then they would have a catastrophic</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional experience,</v>

504
00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.080
<v Speaker 1>may be all upset about it and crying</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

505
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.900
<v Speaker 1>which is of course what they should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then 20 minutes later it would wear</v>

506
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 1>off and then you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

507
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:50.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything wrong with your left</v>

508
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.681
<v Speaker 1>side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd say,</v>

509
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:53.300
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't feel like moving it.</v>

510
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what seems to have happened is</v>

511
00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:59.870
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a body representation center,</v>

512
00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:04.040
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the back of the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere and you blow that soccer out</v>

513
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 1>with a stroke and that means you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent that part of your body</v>

514
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:10.400
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there's tatters of it left.</v>

515
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like a network that's damaged</v>
<v Speaker 1>and under some conditions you could more</v>

516
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 1>or less get it to operate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you pour some cold water in the year,</v>

517
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.140
<v Speaker 1>you shocked the whole system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's enough neurological</v>

518
00:25:21.141 --> 00:25:21.890
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

519
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 1>So the network kicks in even though it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged for like 10 minutes.</v>

520
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 1>And then you get this tremendous burst</v>
<v Speaker 1>of negative emotion,</v>

521
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 1>which is what the right hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be doing.</v>

522
00:25:31.191 --> 00:25:34.670
<v Speaker 1>When you lose half your body and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced that and will left</v>

523
00:25:34.671 --> 00:25:37.490
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere is like flapping away trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to account for this,</v>

524
00:25:37.491 --> 00:25:41.600
<v Speaker 1>which it can't because it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive archer catastrophe.</v>

525
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.940
<v Speaker 1>But then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

526
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.390
<v Speaker 1>the shock wears off and bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system shuts back down and Poof,</v>

527
00:25:47.391 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 1>you're back in denial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good example of the</v>

528
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:53.450
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the left hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and right hemisphere.</v>

529
00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 1>The left hemisphere has a fixed idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the world.</v>

530
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.760
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense you might think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as the instantiation of your latest</v>

531
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even certainly see that with people who</v>

532
00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:05.930
<v Speaker 1>are ideological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he possessed,</v>

533
00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:08.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got this verbal system that</v>

534
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:12.620
<v Speaker 1>accounts for the whole world and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just no damn way that things go in</v>

535
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:13.100
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

536
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.740
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's got this totalitarian aspect</v>

537
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:18.800
<v Speaker 1>because it wants to explain every last</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

538
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.360
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't like to normally at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't come to terms with the</v>

539
00:26:22.361 --> 00:26:26.630
<v Speaker 1>normally at all and there's no sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation within the system,</v>

540
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.450
<v Speaker 1>which is partly white totalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems die.</v>

541
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:34.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Red Queen says to Alice in</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderland when she was in the</v>

542
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:37.640
<v Speaker 1>underworld and my kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to run as fast as you can just</v>

543
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:41.240
<v Speaker 1>to say in the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why totalitarian systems don't</v>

544
00:26:41.241 --> 00:26:44.450
<v Speaker 1>work is because the damn environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting around on,</v>

545
00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they are fixed in place,</v>

546
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.390
<v Speaker 1>the gap between their theory and reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets larger and larger and larger and</v>

547
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 1>larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until finally,</v>

548
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.770
<v Speaker 1>you know they fall into a pit and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of it.</v>

549
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So now it's what happens to people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't stay updated,</v>

550
00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they let things get away on them,</v>

551
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.740
<v Speaker 1>eventually the ignored reality comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>flooding back and we'll see that</v>

552
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:11.130
<v Speaker 1>represented in mythology because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented very nicely and mythology.</v>

553
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.780
<v Speaker 1>That's where I often dragons in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairytales,</v>

554
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.700
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the St George Story and in the</v>

555
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that matter,</v>

556
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:23.070
<v Speaker 1>the dragon is an eternal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lives underneath the earth and most</v>

557
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:24.690
<v Speaker 1>of the time it leaves you the hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>

558
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.160
<v Speaker 1>but now and then it comes back and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to destroy the city and then you</v>

559
00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:32.310
<v Speaker 1>have to zip out there and fight the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing so you get to go back and it's</v>

560
00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:35.790
<v Speaker 1>whole and maybe you get the treasure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's caring and then it's back in</v>

561
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:38.130
<v Speaker 1>the hole for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that thing's coming back.</v>

562
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 1>It's always coming back and so you build</v>
<v Speaker 1>the walls and all that,</v>

563
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.840
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a dragon can destroy any walls and</v>

564
00:27:45.841 --> 00:27:48.750
<v Speaker 1>so walls aren't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be prepared to go out there</v>

565
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:51.960
<v Speaker 1>and fight the damn thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you keep it at bay and</v>

566
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that basically means that you have to</v>

567
00:27:54.601 --> 00:27:57.090
<v Speaker 1>maintain everything you build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>

568
00:27:57.091 --> 00:27:59.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise it falls apart with</v>

569
00:27:59.161 --> 00:28:00.960
<v Speaker 1>increasing entropy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

570
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.210
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

571
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Goldberg thought about this as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>anomaly system and offy system and a</v>

572
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.600
<v Speaker 1>route and ization system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I tended to think about it more from</v>

573
00:28:16.601 --> 00:28:18.790
<v Speaker 1>an anthropological or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

574
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:19.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

575
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.890
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A ecological perspective,</v>

576
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.190
<v Speaker 1>thinking about an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>US In our natural environment,</v>

577
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not so much novelty versus root</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzation.</v>

578
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.250
<v Speaker 1>It's explored versus unexplored</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

579
00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the world's made out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of,</v>

580
00:28:36.341 --> 00:28:41.290
<v Speaker 1>explored versus unexplored territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a domain that you inhabit</v>

581
00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.830
<v Speaker 1>which is the center of the universe from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mythological perspective with you,</v>

582
00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:49.831
<v Speaker 1>right in the middle of it and around you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this circle of which is your place</v>

583
00:28:50.081 --> 00:28:52.720
<v Speaker 1>that you move around with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that circle you know what the</v>

584
00:28:52.721 --> 00:28:56.110
<v Speaker 1>hell's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because you've mapped</v>

585
00:28:56.111 --> 00:28:58.810
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly because you don't</v>

586
00:28:58.811 --> 00:29:00.370
<v Speaker 1>go outside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

587
00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:04.090
<v Speaker 1>so you have your friends and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>your routine and that's nested inside</v>

588
00:29:04.091 --> 00:29:08.440
<v Speaker 1>your culture and you try to keep that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing from flipping upside down and you</v>

589
00:29:08.441 --> 00:29:12.730
<v Speaker 1>do that all sorts of ways partly by</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the same thing all the time,</v>

590
00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.940
<v Speaker 1>but also partly by refusing to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere that might seriously challenge</v>

591
00:29:17.951 --> 00:29:18.650
<v Speaker 1>your beliefs.</v>

592
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough,</v>

593
00:29:19.631 --> 00:29:23.110
<v Speaker 1>you can understand that although it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you weak to do that because you're</v>

594
00:29:23.111 --> 00:29:25.870
<v Speaker 1>not as prepared as you might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>

595
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are tribal,</v>

596
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:34.000
<v Speaker 1>social animals that have a territory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the territory.</v>

597
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the territory while let's</v>

598
00:29:36.281 --> 00:29:39.130
<v Speaker 1>say tree dwelling chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors,</v>

599
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.330
<v Speaker 1>territories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jungle.</v>

600
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:40.871
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

601
00:29:40.871 --> 00:29:43.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the territory.</v>

602
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:49.760
<v Speaker 1>The territory is a little bit of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle plus the things that come in from</v>

603
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 1>outside plus the primate dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy that exists in that area.</v>

604
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

605
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the territory.</v>

606
00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

607
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 1>because for mythological reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to make a separation between the</v>

608
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:07.210
<v Speaker 1>environment and culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's yes,</v>

609
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.080
<v Speaker 1>makes sense at one level of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at another level of analysis,</v>

610
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Speaker 1>all it does is screw you up because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory fundamentally isn't the world,</v>

611
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 1>not the natural objective world.</v>

612
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 1>You want to stay as far away from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing as you possibly can.</v>

613
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Your territory is that circle of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>with whom you spend 90 percent of your</v>

614
00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 1>time and so if you're a gym for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some other kind of monkey,</v>

615
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 1>highly social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do all day?</v>

616
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.710
<v Speaker 1>You sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat,</v>

617
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.780
<v Speaker 1>your chew leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a chip and you grew mother</v>

618
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:43.720
<v Speaker 1>gyms like it's constantly social</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction and you're jockeying for</v>

619
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 1>position in the dominance hierarchy like</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean girls and not in that movie.</v>

620
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're mapping out the social</v>

621
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:52.900
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing who's who and what's what,</v>

622
00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 1>and then trying to get up somewhere near</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>

623
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's your environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your environment.</v>

624
00:30:58.061 --> 00:31:00.430
<v Speaker 1>And so your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

625
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.480
<v Speaker 1>your world is that social natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle,</v>

626
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.150
<v Speaker 1>which is a four dimensional territory</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

627
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going length,</v>

628
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:14.200
<v Speaker 1>width and height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus it stretches across time.</v>

629
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's this transforming natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>entity.</v>

630
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And then inside that there's a pyramid</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the pyramid is made out of all the</v>

631
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:25.180
<v Speaker 1>primates that you interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the world.</v>

632
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.200
<v Speaker 1>A circle with a pyramid on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll give you a vision.</v>

633
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:31.810
<v Speaker 1>This vision I had once when I was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure this stuff out.</v>

634
00:31:31.811 --> 00:31:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is the world?</v>

635
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.520
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that there's a field in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you that stretches as far as you can</v>

636
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:40.920
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

637
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.740
<v Speaker 1>And then you're flying above it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you see everywhere are these</v>

638
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:47.440
<v Speaker 1>pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say for the sake of argument that</v>

639
00:31:47.441 --> 00:31:49.690
<v Speaker 1>they're like skyscrapers made out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>

640
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 1>There's peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tears in them and you fly down and one's</v>

641
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:55.720
<v Speaker 1>here and one's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of them overlap and some of</v>

642
00:31:55.721 --> 00:32:00.040
<v Speaker 1>them are really big and some of them are</v>
<v Speaker 1>small and like they're just everywhere.</v>

643
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:03.610
<v Speaker 1>And you're flying around above them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fly close enough to look inside.</v>

644
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:07.750
<v Speaker 1>And what you see inside them are people</v>
<v Speaker 1>all packed together trying to scramble</v>

645
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:10.000
<v Speaker 1>up to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the world.</v>

646
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing is,</v>

647
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:14.710
<v Speaker 1>is that you can be in one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramids,</v>

648
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:16.870
<v Speaker 1>crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clambering away to the top or you can be</v>

649
00:32:16.871 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 1>flying above it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are your options and if you have</v>

650
00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 1>to choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be flying above it.</v>

651
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 1>And so the relationship between the self</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Ego Avatar is the same as the</v>

652
00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:31.960
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the thing that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying above and the thing that's within</v>

653
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:34.450
<v Speaker 1>one of those pyramids trying to scramble</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the top,</v>

654
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

655
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:38.620
<v Speaker 1>well I'm going to get to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of what?</v>

656
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 1>There's 100 talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 200 talks and then you might</v>

657
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:44.150
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything above the top?</v>

658
00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

659
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:51.350
<v Speaker 1>There's this part of you that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrapped within that particular system.</v>

660
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:55.190
<v Speaker 1>And that can move from place to place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Egypt mythology,</v>

661
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.860
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see on the back of the American</v>

662
00:32:57.861 --> 00:32:59.870
<v Speaker 1>dollar bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a symbol of value,</v>

663
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:00.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

664
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 1>So what's The pyramid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a pyramid on it,</v>

665
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the top of the pyramid?</v>

666
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 1>It's the triangle separate from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid.</v>

667
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.720
<v Speaker 1>There's an ID inside it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because the top of the pyramid is</v>

668
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Speaker 1>an IRA and it's separate from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid.</v>

669
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.640
<v Speaker 1>And what that means fundamentally is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

670
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.960
<v Speaker 1>the thing that transcends the structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>is attention,</v>

671
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.330
<v Speaker 1>voluntary attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

672
00:33:25.331 --> 00:33:28.930
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians worshiped voluntary</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention in the form of Horace</v>

673
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:29.771
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

674
00:33:29.771 --> 00:33:30.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was gone,</v>

675
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.593
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horace.</v>

676
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you about horace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>detail,</v>

677
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:38.550
<v Speaker 1>but one of Horus is avatars was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fault and the reason for that is falcons</v>

678
00:33:39.551 --> 00:33:40.600
<v Speaker 1>can really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

679
00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:43.180
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really see and they fly around.</v>

680
00:33:43.181 --> 00:33:44.850
<v Speaker 1>And so they're like the king's eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

681
00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.220
<v Speaker 1>like the little bird zoo in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

682
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.970
<v Speaker 1>in the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

683
00:33:48.971 --> 00:33:52.240
<v Speaker 1>He was the king's eyes to thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>flies around the boat and he was a</v>

684
00:33:52.241 --> 00:33:56.510
<v Speaker 1>particular enemy of scar scar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat some at the beginning and then spits</v>

685
00:33:56.511 --> 00:33:59.350
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that the king's eyes is</v>

686
00:33:59.351 --> 00:34:02.770
<v Speaker 1>an enemy of scars because the king's</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes can see what he is,</v>

687
00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's the eternal forest that works</v>

688
00:34:05.231 --> 00:34:07.750
<v Speaker 1>to disrupt the kingdom and bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything into ruin.</v>

689
00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Classic myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic Grantham.</v>

690
00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Partly accounting for why that was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>largest selling highest grossing cartoon</v>

691
00:34:15.311 --> 00:34:16.510
<v Speaker 1>in Disney history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

692
00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.620
<v Speaker 1>They got from mythology pretty right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

693
00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:27.090
<v Speaker 1>so attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

694
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:30.230
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we'll do this.</v>

695
00:34:30.231 --> 00:34:33.140
<v Speaker 1>So you might say what's a human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>

696
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Remember I told you that when Penfield</v>
<v Speaker 1>was mapping the brain,</v>

697
00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:45.280
<v Speaker 1>he was poking people and you can either</v>
<v Speaker 1>poke them along the sensory strip,</v>

698
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:50.850
<v Speaker 1>which is if the motor strip is here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sensory strip is just behind it and</v>

699
00:34:51.131 --> 00:34:55.480
<v Speaker 1>the motor strip is where the motor</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems of your body are represented in</v>

700
00:34:55.481 --> 00:34:59.410
<v Speaker 1>so far as you can control them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the sensory strip is where the</v>

701
00:34:59.411 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>sensory systems are represented in so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as you can feel them.</v>

702
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.760
<v Speaker 1>So what this is is a that the bar is</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out weirdly on the motor cortex.</v>

703
00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:14.320
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's pretty funny is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Genitalia area in the sensory</v>

704
00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right beside the feet.</v>

705
00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:17.850
<v Speaker 1>And so I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

706
00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.620
<v Speaker 1>that's why people have foot fetishes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>love massages,</v>

707
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.400
<v Speaker 1>foot massages is because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>spreading activation from the foot area</v>

708
00:35:24.401 --> 00:35:26.860
<v Speaker 1>to the general area and God only knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>why that is.</v>

709
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because you had to have really</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive feet to tromp around without</v>

710
00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.740
<v Speaker 1>stepping on horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

711
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.730
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put this weird stretched out</v>

712
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:42.150
<v Speaker 1>body representation together in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a representational form like this.</v>

713
00:35:42.151 --> 00:35:43.960
<v Speaker 1>And they called that the whole monkey</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus,</v>

714
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.890
<v Speaker 1>which is the like the little man that</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists inside your brain.</v>

715
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.440
<v Speaker 1>So what you see that's the motor</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homunculus,</v>

716
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 1>not the sensory Homonculus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

717
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:53.010
<v Speaker 1>So what do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

718
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:55.230
<v Speaker 1>What's a person as far as brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned?</v>

719
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

720
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.260
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thumb,</v>

721
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.640
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your thumb is represented as</v>

722
00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:06.060
<v Speaker 1>your whole body and it's because your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

723
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.390
<v Speaker 1>your chest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your torsos hardly represented at all is</v>

724
00:36:09.391 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

725
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many things do you manipulate with</v>

726
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 1>your chest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like none.</v>

727
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.773
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't,</v>

728
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't have motor control over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not represented so.</v>

729
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.690
<v Speaker 1>But the hands man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

730
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:26.691
<v Speaker 1>they're represented like mad and so is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face and the lips and the tongue and</v>

731
00:36:26.761 --> 00:36:29.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that when you're an infant,</v>

732
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 1>you explored like mad with your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do that through your whole life</v>

733
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:35.760
<v Speaker 1>because when you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like.</v>

734
00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:38.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating something and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of sand in it like you,</v>

735
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:43.050
<v Speaker 1>you find it and you take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can detect this teeny</v>

736
00:36:43.051 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 1>little thing that's not supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your mouth and while that's a good</v>

737
00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 1>thing because lots of things aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be in your mouth.</v>

738
00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the other part of the reason is,</v>

739
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about what you do with your</v>

740
00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 1>tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of things you do</v>

741
00:36:55.981 --> 00:36:56.814
<v Speaker 1>with your tongue.</v>

742
00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are talking,</v>

743
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.460
<v Speaker 1>some of them are all sorts of intimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

744
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:06.810
<v Speaker 1>That thing is wired up and it's wired up</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at birth and then it's the same</v>

745
00:37:06.811 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 1>with your lips and your and the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mouth.</v>

746
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You use that to communicate so your</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands will wander around taking the</v>

747
00:37:14.281 --> 00:37:16.110
<v Speaker 1>world apart and putting it back</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

748
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:19.650
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what your brain does</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you blab about what you're</v>

749
00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 1>doing to everyone and that's basically a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being and I like to think of this</v>

750
00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:28.770
<v Speaker 1>thing is it's sort of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a comical representation of the</v>

751
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:30.930
<v Speaker 1>hero that goes out to confront the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

752
00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the hero has two elements.</v>

753
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:37.180
<v Speaker 1>One is explore</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of what?</v>

754
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:40.530
<v Speaker 1>That's where the West is powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say like we have a really well</v>

755
00:37:40.531 --> 00:37:42.990
<v Speaker 1>developed mythology of the exploratory</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>

756
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.680
<v Speaker 1>but where we're not so well developed as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second part because in the second</v>

757
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:50.670
<v Speaker 1>part of the classic Hero's story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to come back and</v>

758
00:37:50.671 --> 00:37:55.671
<v Speaker 1>communicate about what you found and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a individual exploration element</v>

759
00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a communicate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>update.</v>

760
00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:02.280
<v Speaker 1>The culture element and both of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>are equally important and it's something</v>

761
00:38:02.281 --> 00:38:05.610
<v Speaker 1>that we don't do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have much respect for tradition</v>

762
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:09.930
<v Speaker 1>in the west and it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really big problem because the ethical</v>

763
00:38:09.931 --> 00:38:13.680
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of a human being is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the dead culture,</v>

764
00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:16.590
<v Speaker 1>so that's the dead father or the dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

765
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:21.570
<v Speaker 1>and to revivify it with attention and</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication and you've failed to do</v>

766
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:23.960
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then everything disappears and we,</v>

767
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.300
<v Speaker 1>we are failing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're leaving it all behind instead.</v>

768
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

769
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:33.420
<v Speaker 1>if the old gods die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Nietzsche said,</v>

770
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 1>they had new gods in very rapidly and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think the old guard was bad,</v>

771
00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 1>you wait till the new gods get ahold of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

772
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 1>So while we saw what happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>

773
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the ideologies that sprang up</v>

774
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of classical religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

775
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:50.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

776
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 1>you're not so thrilled with Catholicism.</v>

777
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.880
<v Speaker 1>If you think about that as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

778
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.410
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental tradition of the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:38:56.411 --> 00:38:58.720
<v Speaker 1>with the witch burnings and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inquisition and all that,</v>

780
00:38:58.721 --> 00:38:59.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

781
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well get a load of the Nazis and then</v>

782
00:39:01.241 --> 00:39:05.050
<v Speaker 1>see what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So or the communists for that matter,</v>

783
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:10.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>from bad to worse in an unimaginable</v>

784
00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:12.131
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

785
00:39:12.131 --> 00:39:16.270
<v Speaker 1>so and that's partly because those</v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic systems,</v>

786
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:18.910
<v Speaker 1>those are religious systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't ideologies.</v>

787
00:39:18.911 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Speaker 1>There are a whole different class of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and we don't understand them very</v>

788
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:26.620
<v Speaker 1>well and it's not good because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot live without understanding them.</v>

789
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you fall prey to weird mental</v>

790
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:32.180
<v Speaker 1>diseases like nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

791
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.510
<v Speaker 1>that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other one is ideological</v>

792
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 1>possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you become a totalitarian or a</v>

793
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.660
<v Speaker 1>analyst and that's a bad outcome and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>

794
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the alternative?</v>

795
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happens in Pinocchio,</v>

796
00:39:44.321 --> 00:39:45.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've watched Pinocchio.</v>

797
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often show up in oak you to this</v>

798
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:48.970
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if I'm going to do that</v>

799
00:39:48.971 --> 00:39:50.170
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

800
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:54.390
<v Speaker 1>but now he's a puppet marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone else's pulling his strings has.</v>

801
00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:56.410
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not very bright.</v>

802
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.180
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't banged around the world at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

803
00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 1>He's got a good father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old Japan who really would,</v>

804
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:03.310
<v Speaker 1>rather than he was a real boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

805
00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:05.770
<v Speaker 1>A real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's the kind of father that wants to</v>

806
00:40:05.771 --> 00:40:09.550
<v Speaker 1>produce an individual and not a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

807
00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:10.490
<v Speaker 1>and that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

808
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.720
<v Speaker 1>in his workshop it's all friendly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a nice fire and he's making toys</v>

809
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:15.590
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like go Japan.</v>

810
00:40:15.591 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good guy.</v>

811
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.260
<v Speaker 1>So it makes this little puppet and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>sends them out in the world,</v>

812
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go be a real boy.</v>

813
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio runs into a whole class of</v>

814
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:26.740
<v Speaker 1>different obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is evil,</v>

815
00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

816
00:40:28.061 --> 00:40:29.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the coachman.</v>

817
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.170
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italian stereotype guy who makes him</v>

818
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.960
<v Speaker 1>a dancing puppets celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is pretty funny.</v>

819
00:40:37.961 --> 00:40:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really prescient because you</v>

820
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:42.161
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

821
00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:44.830
<v Speaker 1>what's the goal of your typical</v>
<v Speaker 1>boneheaded,</v>

822
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid adolescent in North America.</v>

823
00:40:48.341 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like unearned celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

824
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:52.600
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what Pinocchio goes for</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

825
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.390
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't work out so well</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he ends up a slave.</v>

826
00:40:55.391 --> 00:41:00.370
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing that happens is</v>
<v Speaker 1>he capitalizes on the fact that he's</v>

827
00:41:00.371 --> 00:41:03.460
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable and pretends he's sick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes off for a vacation under the</v>

828
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:06.850
<v Speaker 1>direction of the coachman who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically Satan in disguise.</v>

829
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.580
<v Speaker 1>And it goes out to treasure island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure island,</v>

830
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.780
<v Speaker 1>and meets all the delinquent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're just like Nazis.</v>

831
00:41:12.781 --> 00:41:16.690
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole ploys to enslave everyone,</v>

832
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:20.560
<v Speaker 1>to deprive them of their voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the donkey's brain and to make</v>

833
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:23.200
<v Speaker 1>them into slaves pretty damn horrifying.</v>

834
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie came out about the same time</v>

835
00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:27.360
<v Speaker 1>that the Nazis were really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

836
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.240
<v Speaker 1>grasping power in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in central Europe.</v>

837
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like they got it exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's really going on behind the</v>

838
00:41:35.211 --> 00:41:36.530
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

839
00:41:36.531 --> 00:41:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

840
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio turns halfway into a brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>donkey because,</v>

841
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gone off the path and in order to</v>

842
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 1>get back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tries to go home,</v>

843
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's grown up.</v>

844
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:48.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a kid anymore.</v>

845
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Goes home and dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there surprised,</v>

846
00:41:51.011 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Speaker 1>surprised?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because once you grow up and you go</v>

847
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad isn't there.</v>

848
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:59.000
<v Speaker 1>It's just another human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens?</v>

849
00:41:59.001 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Well then he has to go into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's particularly weird,</v>

850
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:02.924
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

851
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.130
<v Speaker 1>there he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half donkey.</v>

852
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:07.490
<v Speaker 1>He's a puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dove comes down and drops him a</v>

853
00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:08.900
<v Speaker 1>message from God.</v>

854
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:12.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Holy Spirit descending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it's actually from the blue fairy</v>

855
00:42:12.651 --> 00:42:15.740
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the message says you have to go to</v>

856
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:18.020
<v Speaker 1>the deepest part of the ocean and rescue</v>
<v Speaker 1>your father.</v>

857
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.831
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

858
00:42:18.831 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 1>that is what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to be a bloody puppet</v>

859
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.250
<v Speaker 1>donkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go down into the depths and</v>

860
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:28.460
<v Speaker 1>find your dead father and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>revivify him.</v>

861
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:31.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Pinocchio goes way down there to the</v>

862
00:42:31.701 --> 00:42:35.120
<v Speaker 1>deepest depths and finds monster who's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

863
00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:38.750
<v Speaker 1>So terrible that the fish swim away just</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the sound of his voice,</v>

864
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.400
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

865
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he who shall not be named Voldemort,</v>

866
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even say his damn name.</v>

867
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Same with monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put occhio goes down there.</v>

868
00:42:50.121 --> 00:42:54.320
<v Speaker 1>It goes into the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens in Japan?</v>

869
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says there's no getting out with this.</v>

870
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just have to sit here and Cook Fish</v>

871
00:42:59.061 --> 00:42:59.990
<v Speaker 1>and Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

872
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he starts breaking up all the</v>

873
00:43:02.511 --> 00:43:05.130
<v Speaker 1>chairs and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as freaking out,</v>

874
00:43:05.131 --> 00:43:05.910
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>

875
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Breaking all these chairs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to sit on?</v>

876
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:11.090
<v Speaker 1>And then Pinocchio Lights them on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a master of fire.</v>

877
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:14.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a shamonic ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he is a master of fire.</v>

878
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.150
<v Speaker 1>That's where human being is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

879
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.510
<v Speaker 1>he gets everything burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

880
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 1>pedal was all freaked out about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what are they going to sit on</v>

881
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:24.260
<v Speaker 1>and Pinocchio thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares about sitting?</v>

882
00:43:24.261 --> 00:43:26.780
<v Speaker 1>We're going to solve the problem once</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for all.</v>

883
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.810
<v Speaker 1>And so then the whale turns into a fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing dragon,</v>

884
00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:31.880
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty damn weird thing for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whale to do.</v>

885
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Half Kills Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived,</v>

886
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.640
<v Speaker 1>washes up on shore dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he saves his father.</v>

887
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And then at the very end of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's lying on his bed,</v>

888
00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.290
<v Speaker 1>all drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all like having a show.</v>

889
00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:44.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a dead pop it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

890
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:45.550
<v Speaker 1>do you want to be alive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Popular?</v>

891
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.940
<v Speaker 1>A dead puppet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

892
00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:49.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe the dead puppet is better than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>live property.</v>

893
00:43:49.351 --> 00:43:51.920
<v Speaker 1>It depends on where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he's on the bed.</v>

894
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:53.570
<v Speaker 1>The blue fairy comes down and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

895
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 1>you've been honest and courageous bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're real.</v>

896
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they have a little party and</v>

897
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:01.730
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just exactly right.</v>

898
00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

899
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the hero mythology is the</v>

900
00:44:07.671 --> 00:44:10.550
<v Speaker 1>rescuing of the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father,</v>

901
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:18.180
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you're a corpse like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a historical creature.</v>

902
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.960
<v Speaker 1>You're cultural creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a.</v>

903
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:27.260
<v Speaker 1>You cannot live without your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you can,</v>

904
00:44:27.261 --> 00:44:30.650
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It disappears in and you don't even</v>

905
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>

906
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.790
<v Speaker 1>In the Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to tell you about next</v>

907
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.370
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens is that</v>

908
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.300
<v Speaker 1>the first round of gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're like primordial forces.</v>

909
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:47.310
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty damn careless and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed their father and they make this</v>

910
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:49.530
<v Speaker 1>place to live on his corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

911
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:53.550
<v Speaker 1>That's where we live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live on the corpse of our ancestors</v>

912
00:44:53.551 --> 00:44:55.740
<v Speaker 1>because we live in this society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dead.</v>

913
00:44:55.741 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 1>It's the product of dead people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's got this dead element,</v>

914
00:44:58.771 --> 00:45:00.600
<v Speaker 1>but we're living on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

915
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.640
<v Speaker 1>They're very careless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill it.</v>

916
00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.700
<v Speaker 1>They render it completely dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

917
00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 1>what happens is Taya Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the mother of chaos,</v>

918
00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:11.400
<v Speaker 1>she comes flooding back and she thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

919
00:45:11.401 --> 00:45:13.530
<v Speaker 1>you killed the thing that protects you.</v>

920
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 1>You just wait to see what happens and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly.</v>

921
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Yet you killed the thing that structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

922
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.030
<v Speaker 1>You will know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like niches,</v>

923
00:45:21.031 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 1>prediction from the death of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you killed this.</v>

924
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.370
<v Speaker 1>You think are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any difference.</v>

925
00:45:26.371 --> 00:45:27.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>

926
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:30.960
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the striders protecting the</v>

927
00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 1>hobbits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get rid of that thing that protects</v>

928
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:35.550
<v Speaker 1>you in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes flooding in and you like.</v>

929
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:38.430
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do though,</v>

930
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.020
<v Speaker 1>because we lived through the 20th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

931
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:42.840
<v Speaker 1>we know exactly what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

932
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of unnecessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths.</v>

933
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky we didn't blow the whole</v>

934
00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:53.280
<v Speaker 1>damn thing up so and we still could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people pursuing their dead</v>

935
00:45:53.281 --> 00:45:56.250
<v Speaker 1>etiologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't rescue the dead father.</v>

936
00:45:56.251 --> 00:46:00.930
<v Speaker 1>You're the puppet of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you are already on.</v>

937
00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:01.800
<v Speaker 1>That cheery note.</v>
