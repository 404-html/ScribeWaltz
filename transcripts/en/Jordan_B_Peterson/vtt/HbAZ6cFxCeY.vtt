1
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.921
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:14.754
<v Speaker 1>I use this picture</v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent my class and you might not </v>

3
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.533
<v Speaker 1>know anything about this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a picture of Jonah being thrown up </v>

4
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>out of a whale's belly after spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>three days inside it.</v>

5
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It's an old biblical story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a myth.</v>

6
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a fairy tale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

7
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.354
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of looking at it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean that drug in a </v>

8
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>derogative manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know for example,</v>

9
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>that some of the grims brothers' </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairytales are perhaps 15,000 years old.</v>

10
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>It'd be traced way back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>

11
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:50.334
<v Speaker 1>really old and old stories are strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're strange because while they're </v>

12
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>being told generation after generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>after generation,</v>

13
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>so you could imagine that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>retold over such an expansive,</v>

14
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>expansive time has been reduced to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>just many,</v>

15
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>many times and nothing that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story anymore is superfluous.</v>

16
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It's all meaningful in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a med,</v>

17
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about,</v>

18
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you took a hundred books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred adventure books,</v>

19
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>and you had to extract out the central </v>
<v Speaker 1>features of an adventure book.</v>

20
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.433
<v Speaker 1>Now it's hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're averaging across them </v>

21
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distilling them in some manner.</v>

22
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.353
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Meta adventure and it would be like a </v>

24
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:40.670
<v Speaker 1>myth upon which all adventures are </v>
<v Speaker 1>based.</v>

25
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>And this story is actually one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

26
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to tell you what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story means.</v>

27
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that this is all it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

28
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>because most stories of this sort are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense inexhaustible,</v>

29
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>just like great works of art are </v>
<v Speaker 1>inexhaustible there.</v>

30
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>There's more information in them than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can possibly articulate.</v>

31
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes them</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound.</v>

32
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.763
<v Speaker 1>That's why you go look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause otherwise someone could just tell </v>

33
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you about the painting and that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of that.</v>

34
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

35
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>so Jonah is being spit up by this whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course on the face of it,</v>

36
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>that's an impossibility because,</v>

37
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.523
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

38
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you can't live inside a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's impossible.</v>

39
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may remember and likely do that.</v>

40
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 1>You all know a story about someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>is inside a whale.</v>

41
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>That's Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.783
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to that movie,</v>

44
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe even as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch that movie and Japan goes down</v>

45
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>there in the whale and his little boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>it's big cavernous inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really care that that's,</v>

47
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things you don't care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

48
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't care that those are drawings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not real people.</v>

49
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.103
<v Speaker 1>You don't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't care that the inside of a </v>

50
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:02.284
<v Speaker 1>whale isn't a cavern and you don't care </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Pinocchio's a puppet for that </v>

51
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that matters to you at all.</v>

52
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's because you're really strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures and you don't even notice when</v>

53
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd.</v>

54
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of those times when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in,</v>

55
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>but if someone taps you on the shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

56
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just watching drawings of a </v>

57
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:23.884
<v Speaker 1>puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppets can't really move autonomously </v>

58
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:27.214
<v Speaker 1>and now he's at the bottom of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea why he's going to </v>

59
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:31.024
<v Speaker 1>rescue his father and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there and all and you're okay </v>

60
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll say,</v>

61
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>shut up because I want to finish </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the movie.</v>

62
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>And so that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You See,</v>

63
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>that tells you something about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

64
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.383
<v Speaker 1>If you're a psychoanalytically minded </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're doing something that you </v>

65
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>cannot account for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

66
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

67
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>it's enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's deep man.</v>

68
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>You really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really going a long ways with that.</v>

69
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

70
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>why is it comprehensible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

71
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Why is it enjoyable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

72
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.873
<v Speaker 1>just exactly what are you doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think that whatever you are </v>

73
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 1>doing there is so valuable that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually pay to do it.</v>

74
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

75
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

76
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:20.524
<v Speaker 1>when you read about</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the archaic rituals of tribal </v>

77
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 1>people and you ask yourself just what </v>
<v Speaker 1>are they up to?</v>

78
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 1>they're up to the same thing that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to when you go see a movie.</v>

80
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.233
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might also notice that the </v>

81
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:39.274
<v Speaker 1>most expensive artifacts or among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most expensive artifacts that human </v>

82
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:43.684
<v Speaker 1>beings create our movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been hundreds of millions of </v>

83
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.033
<v Speaker 1>dollars on them.</v>

84
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>And we consider that a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

85
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.763
<v Speaker 1>it drives our technology too because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>high tech movies like the marvel movies </v>

86
00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:58.264
<v Speaker 1>that require so much computer animation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually drive the demand for high </v>

87
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:02.524
<v Speaker 1>end graphics chips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our technological advance forward is </v>

88
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:07.474
<v Speaker 1>actually motivated in part by our desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent things fictionally in </v>

89
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:17.791
<v Speaker 1>evermore spectacular manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Jonah,</v>

90
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you the story of Jonah</v>

91
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.863
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you what this is from </v>

92
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Camille Paglia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a critic of the modern university</v>

93
00:05:29.271 --> 00:05:32.840
<v Speaker 1>and very brilliant woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say very controversial,</v>

94
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>credibly rapid speaker and she can think</v>

95
00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:38.150
<v Speaker 1>so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just unbelievable.</v>

96
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:41.060
<v Speaker 1>She's really fun to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like that sort of thing.</v>

97
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.193
<v Speaker 1>Vicious adversary in an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says the number one problem in </v>

98
00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:51.620
<v Speaker 1>academia today is not ignorant students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ignorant professors</v>

99
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.673
<v Speaker 1>who have substituted narrow expertise in</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical of preposterous term for </v>

100
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>breadth and depth of learning in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

101
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:06.011
<v Speaker 1>history of art and thought art is a vast</v>
<v Speaker 1>interconnected web work,</v>

102
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.933
<v Speaker 1>a fabricated tradition and </v>
<v Speaker 1>overconcentration on any one point is a </v>

103
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:17.921
<v Speaker 1>distortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

104
00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:23.910
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to,</v>

105
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.763
<v Speaker 1>I wrestled with this when I was trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand some of the things that </v>

106
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:28.424
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to teach you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some things that you kind of </v>

107
00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:35.140
<v Speaker 1>have to grasp as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

108
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:35.974
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have a flash of insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of things that you didn't </v>

109
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:38.914
<v Speaker 1>know were related fall together that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to happen in </v>

110
00:06:41.471 --> 00:06:42.304
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy when you link different </v>
<v Speaker 1>disparate patterns of behavior together </v>

111
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.713
<v Speaker 1>because you've linked them say with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single cause and you get this like </v>

112
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.040
<v Speaker 1>excited feeling of illumination and </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility</v>

113
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.260
<v Speaker 1>and there are forms of communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>that require the simile.</v>

114
00:07:04.261 --> 00:07:05.094
<v Speaker 1>Tanium Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the simultaneous realization of a </v>

115
00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:08.400
<v Speaker 1>multitude of disparate.</v>

116
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm gonna like a movie can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

117
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:18.044
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

118
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you listen to a movie,</v>

119
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:20.114
<v Speaker 1>you watch a movie and then you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what the hell is going on and then </v>

120
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.203
<v Speaker 1>something happens near the end and bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything clicks together and it's </v>

121
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:29.570
<v Speaker 1>because you've sort of seen the thing as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole.</v>

122
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.943
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the things that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the ways that we interact with </v>

123
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:39.011
<v Speaker 1>the world that are mysterious</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like that there.</v>

124
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And this is what Peggy is referring to </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

125
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.500
<v Speaker 1>and this is a psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition,</v>

126
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a romantic proposition.</v>

127
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:48.863
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

128
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Then the idea roughly is that</v>

129
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.523
<v Speaker 1>way out in the periphery of reality or </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things that not only do you </v>

130
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:00.060
<v Speaker 1>not know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't even know,</v>

131
00:08:00.061 --> 00:08:00.894
<v Speaker 1>you don't know right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're completely blind to their </v>

132
00:08:03.391 --> 00:08:06.270
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's unknown things that you</v>

133
00:08:06.271 --> 00:08:10.470
<v Speaker 1>have some suspicions about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's unknown things that you</v>

134
00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:15.240
<v Speaker 1>can start to imagine and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and act out and dramatize.</v>

135
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And so all of that is on the periphery </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our knowledge,</v>

136
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.340
<v Speaker 1>not to psycho Hadley analytic dictum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do thoughts come from?</v>

137
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly they're nested in dreams.</v>

138
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Dreams are the birthplace of thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantasy.</v>

139
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not that surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantasy is the birthplace of ideas.</v>

140
00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:34.164
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about what you're </v>

141
00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:38.220
<v Speaker 1>gonna do in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you enter into a reverie,</v>

142
00:08:38.221 --> 00:08:39.054
<v Speaker 1>a dream state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you contemplate multiple </v>

143
00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:44.910
<v Speaker 1>possibilities and then you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking them through.</v>

144
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.893
<v Speaker 1>Use your imagination to search beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are and the collective human </v>

145
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:57.741
<v Speaker 1>attempt to do that is are mysterious </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanistic,</v>

146
00:08:58.651 --> 00:08:59.484
<v Speaker 1>artistic tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very difficult to justify from </v>

147
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>a formal articulate point of view.</v>

148
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 1>What good is dance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like?</v>

149
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>What is it that you're doing when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing?</v>

150
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't care because he liked to </v>

151
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 1>dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

152
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know like you do.</v>

153
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 1>It's built into music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music's a human.</v>

154
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Universal culture is used music to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves,</v>

155
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:26.634
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use music to catalyze their </v>

156
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:28.524
<v Speaker 1>identities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use music to unite around no in </v>

157
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.413
<v Speaker 1>more archaic societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less differentiated society's let's say </v>

158
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

159
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.513
<v Speaker 1>a mask that represents part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family tradition will have a particular </v>

160
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:43.614
<v Speaker 1>design and there'll be a particular song</v>
<v Speaker 1>written for it and there'll be a </v>

161
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.544
<v Speaker 1>particular dance about it and the song </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dance or something like the </v>

162
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 1>symbolic representation of a mode of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in the world.</v>

163
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:56.394
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe the mask is a wolf mask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you act out the wolf and there's </v>

164
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 1>music that goes along with that and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

165
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:02.334
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing when you're acting </v>

166
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>out the wolf?</v>

167
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And part of that is what you're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to understand wolves,</v>

168
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an image,</v>

169
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 1>it's imitation in part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

170
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 1>if you live in the natural world and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you haunt and if you're preyed upon,</v>

171
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.723
<v Speaker 1>then understanding the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hunting and preying upon is </v>

172
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:20.880
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also pull out perhaps useful</v>

173
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:21.714
<v Speaker 1>things to learn from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we played this strange symbolic </v>

174
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:27.324
<v Speaker 1>game with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like children pretending that's another </v>

175
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:30.744
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we do that to act out and to begin </v>

176
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:38.430
<v Speaker 1>to understand things we don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how to act.</v>

177
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.223
<v Speaker 1>That's now for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important question in life is </v>

178
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 1>not</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the world is made of.</v>

179
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.153
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that's a relatively new </v>

180
00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:58.150
<v Speaker 1>preoccupation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humankind.</v>

181
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really formalize,</v>

182
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.550
<v Speaker 1>you could say that the ancient Greeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>originated,</v>

183
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.510
<v Speaker 1>laid the groundwork for the emergence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an empirical science.</v>

184
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:17.050
<v Speaker 1>And then it emerged more formally with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bacon and Descartes and,</v>

185
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newton</v>

186
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.550
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600 years ago.</v>

187
00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Not very long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a blink,</v>

188
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.650
<v Speaker 1>blink of the eye in human terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>

189
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.650
<v Speaker 1>people were engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could build things and so forth,</v>

190
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:35.410
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't scientists.</v>

191
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.550
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really conceptualize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world as an objective place.</v>

192
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.170
<v Speaker 1>We do that automatically because science</v>
<v Speaker 1>has seeped so far into our</v>

193
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.020
<v Speaker 1>set of presuppositions that doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>us good scientists by the way.</v>

194
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.153
<v Speaker 1>But it does make us that the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of the world is an objective </v>

195
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:56.584
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not going to dispute that </v>

196
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.303
<v Speaker 1>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but leaves one set of questions on </v>

197
00:12:03.861 --> 00:12:05.850
<v Speaker 1>answered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

198
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 1>probably by its nature because it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to answer the question.</v>

199
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:15.481
<v Speaker 1>And that question is how should one </v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct oneself in the world?</v>

200
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's an important thing since </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're alive and hypothetically,</v>

201
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 1>you'd rather stay alive and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're alive.</v>

202
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:25.084
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't want to suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore than you have to and no more </v>

203
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 1>stupidly than you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it might also be good if some of the</v>

204
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 1>things that you wanted actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

205
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.770
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're motivated to know how to act and,</v>

206
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.530
<v Speaker 1>and people are always telling each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to act.</v>

207
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Speaker 1>We're sending each other information all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time about how to act.</v>

208
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 1>We do that with are the expressions on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our face.</v>

209
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:47.674
<v Speaker 1>And of course when we talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always look at their face and that's </v>

210
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 1>because their face tells you what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up to.</v>

211
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.673
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're smiling and paying attention </v>

212
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:56.854
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you can assume that you're </v>

213
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 1>doing something right and if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking annoyed or disgusted,</v>

214
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:04.563
<v Speaker 1>that's a particularly bad one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you might think he might take him </v>

215
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 1>from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you know,</v>

216
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 1>three or four people are doing it at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

217
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.873
<v Speaker 1>And so we're reflecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're reflecting some ideal to one </v>

218
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:20.800
<v Speaker 1>another constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more attentive you are,</v>

219
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 1>the more likely you are to act in </v>
<v Speaker 1>accordance with that ideal.</v>

220
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 1>And the more like you likely you are to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move towards it,</v>

221
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.510
<v Speaker 1>you may not even know what the ideal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in an articulated sentence.</v>

222
00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't.</v>

223
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could come up with a,</v>

224
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.173
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 1>a good person is nice and friendly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperative and yeah,</v>

226
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:42.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

227
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 1>that's all just cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't,</v>

228
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your conception might be very hollow.</v>

229
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:48.634
<v Speaker 1>It's very likely that it's very hollow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you may be to act in a very </v>

230
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

231
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.870
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a story I'd say.</v>

232
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:58.330
<v Speaker 1>What's a metes story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

233
00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.673
<v Speaker 1>it's what would happen if you collected </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of stories and then you extract </v>

234
00:14:02.061 --> 00:14:02.894
<v Speaker 1>it out a story from them and it's sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a story about destiny and it's </v>

235
00:14:06.071 --> 00:14:08.560
<v Speaker 1>couched in a religious language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

236
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.220
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay because most of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>distilled stories are formed.</v>

237
00:14:16.621 --> 00:14:17.454
<v Speaker 1>The foundation of religious texts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious texts and myth and myths and </v>

238
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:22.990
<v Speaker 1>stories are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

239
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 1>part of the outer perimeter of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

240
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.820
<v Speaker 1>They have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a coherent nature and it's all</v>

241
00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.693
<v Speaker 1>it and the form of a foundation and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that foundation that everything that </v>

242
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you take for granted rests even if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand the foundation.</v>

243
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.093
<v Speaker 1>So I can give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a metaphysical idea that </v>

244
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:45.904
<v Speaker 1>underlies western civilization and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical idea is that the has </v>

245
00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:54.180
<v Speaker 1>transcendent worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

246
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea from which the notion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural rights is derived.</v>

247
00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.053
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our legal system is predicated on the </v>

248
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:03.290
<v Speaker 1>idea that you have certain natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

249
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.790
<v Speaker 1>They're enshrined in the bill of rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

250
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And in the states when the bills bill of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights was being formulated,</v>

251
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.703
<v Speaker 1>when the legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>original legislation that founded the </v>

252
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:19.940
<v Speaker 1>state was being formulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the formulators said,</v>

253
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 1>we hold these truths to be self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

254
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.013
<v Speaker 1>They're axioms of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're propositions and there's no </v>

255
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:32.834
<v Speaker 1>proof for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there or mode of operation in </v>

256
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:38.600
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the hypothesis is something like,</v>

257
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:39.434
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I treat you like there's something </v>

258
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 1>about you that has transcendent value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit intrinsic value,</v>

259
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.173
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are stories about that and </v>

260
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:51.740
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about that and you do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same to me.</v>

261
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.533
<v Speaker 1>And then we set up a body of laws that </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizes the sovereignty of the </v>

262
00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:57.974
<v Speaker 1>individual so that the law itself has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>act with respect towards every </v>

263
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:04.214
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if that individual has done </v>

264
00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:07.790
<v Speaker 1>something reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very weird.</v>

265
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then our society will work better</v>

266
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.760
<v Speaker 4>and well,</v>

267
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.910
<v Speaker 1>perhaps that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for better or worse,</v>

268
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 1>that is what this society is predicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

269
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

270
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:25.401
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

271
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:27.050
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old idea.</v>

272
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.293
<v Speaker 1>And it's an idea that people came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>with great difficulty because it was </v>

273
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:34.874
<v Speaker 1>over thousands of years that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned how to take their little tribal </v>

274
00:16:37.911 --> 00:16:38.744
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are always squabbling with one </v>

275
00:16:40.401 --> 00:16:41.031
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

276
00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:41.864
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very violent and tribal groups </v>

277
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:47.390
<v Speaker 1>are by no means civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

278
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.330
<v Speaker 1>there's no noble savage like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europeans thought.</v>

279
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 1>If you study tribal groups in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

280
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:53.893
<v Speaker 1>the murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the death rate by violence is </v>

281
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:57.860
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

282
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.080
<v Speaker 1>something unites a tribe within a tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often kinship.</v>

283
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.943
<v Speaker 1>But then tribes come together to form </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger civilizations and they have to </v>

284
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.543
<v Speaker 1>determine some sort of med,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have principle that guides them so that </v>

285
00:17:10.671 --> 00:17:13.670
<v Speaker 1>they can cooperate and come together </v>
<v Speaker 1>without destroying one another.</v>

286
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.773
<v Speaker 1>And they have to extract out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle by which the society might </v>

287
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that has to work.</v>

288
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And then as societies get bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,</v>

289
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:23.864
<v Speaker 1>they have to bring more and more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these diverse traditions together and </v>

290
00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:31.961
<v Speaker 1>extract out something from them that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and functional utility.</v>

291
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And that allows people to unite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

292
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:43.420
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the stories that talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that it's a story about individual</v>

293
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not heated.</v>

294
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.363
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause we could say you are a social </v>

295
00:17:53.671 --> 00:17:54.504
<v Speaker 1>creature right to the core and most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your environment is other people and </v>

296
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.350
<v Speaker 1>those other people want something from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you want something from them.</v>

297
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:07.620
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to play games with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're either going to be good at it,</v>

298
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:08.454
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be bad at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to play games with </v>

299
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:14.370
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the game might have rules,</v>

300
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.653
<v Speaker 1>really sophisticated rules in fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd expect that because as your </v>

301
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:22.080
<v Speaker 1>behavior more and more approximates an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>

302
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.510
<v Speaker 1>assuming such a thing exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're more and more sophisticated.</v>

303
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:28.344
<v Speaker 1>And the nature of the ideal is perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more complex and difficult to </v>

304
00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:34.800
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a hint of this though.</v>

305
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:36.743
<v Speaker 1>You can get a hint of this because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>will see if you pay attention to your </v>

306
00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:43.950
<v Speaker 1>own soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your psyche,</v>

307
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.243
<v Speaker 1>your unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that there are people that </v>

308
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 1>you admire and that there are people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have contempt for.</v>

309
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.283
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't necessarily that you're a </v>

310
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent accurate in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment,</v>

311
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not such a bad idea to criticize </v>

312
00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>your first</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressions,</v>

313
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.463
<v Speaker 1>but those states exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a reason you admire </v>

314
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:11.880
<v Speaker 1>someone and there's a reason you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt for someone.</v>

315
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:12.923
<v Speaker 1>There may be multiple reasons and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hint to your intrinsic value </v>

316
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:16.434
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hint about your intrinsic value </v>

317
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:18.684
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

318
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't admire someone unless there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was something about them that you valued</v>

319
00:19:23.431 --> 00:19:25.800
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps that you would also like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to do.</v>

320
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.053
<v Speaker 1>And you wouldn't despise someone or have</v>
<v Speaker 1>contempt for them if you didn't feel </v>

321
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 1>that something they were doing was wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it would be wrong if you did it</v>

322
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:35.574
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're bringing to bear on the </v>

323
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:38.124
<v Speaker 1>situation and implicit morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to do that because as I </v>

324
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:42.594
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

325
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.473
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

326
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.680
<v Speaker 1>it can't act without a morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to act,</v>

327
00:19:49.681 --> 00:19:54.681
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>better that otherwise why bother?</v>

328
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.283
<v Speaker 1>And if you're acting to make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than some things have to be </v>

329
00:19:58.321 --> 00:20:01.050
<v Speaker 1>better and some things have to be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a value structure.</v>

330
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 1>So you have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

331
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:06.294
<v Speaker 1>so Jonah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets a call from God and God tells </v>

332
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:18.171
<v Speaker 1>him that there's a city Nineveh that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling into moral disarray.</v>

333
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

334
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:23.963
<v Speaker 1>it's a universal story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all cultures are always </v>

335
00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 1>falling into disarray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's their nature.</v>

336
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 1>Just entropy does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

337
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Things change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world changes the environment,</v>

338
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:38.670
<v Speaker 1>changes in the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't keep up very well.</v>

339
00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And then of course it has corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements and so it's an enduring eternal</v>

340
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:44.154
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The individual is always placed in </v>

341
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.810
<v Speaker 1>relationship to a culture that somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>

342
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

343
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is nothing,</v>

344
00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.730
<v Speaker 1>well then it'll just get more corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is b corrupt too,</v>

345
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.713
<v Speaker 1>then it will just get more corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the answer has to be to oppose the </v>

346
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:11.290
<v Speaker 1>corruption because that's the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to stop.</v>

347
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:13.443
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God threatens to destroy this city </v>

348
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:16.983
<v Speaker 1>because of its corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think you need to presume </v>

349
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:25.720
<v Speaker 1>anything particularly metaphysical about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to understand it.</v>

350
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.603
<v Speaker 1>It's very straight forward that the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt the culture is and the less </v>

351
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 1>trust is possible between individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less productive the culture is going</v>

352
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:37.660
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because why do anything,</v>

353
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 1>if some corrupt person is just going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come and take it,</v>

354
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.493
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might even be that the culture is so </v>

355
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:43.624
<v Speaker 1>corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are good for something and you </v>

356
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.583
<v Speaker 1>produce resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually more likely to get </v>

357
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 1>killed because you have something of </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

358
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.593
<v Speaker 1>So like there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just not going anywhere with </v>

359
00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:55.114
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why would you work if you didn't </v>

360
00:21:56.261 --> 00:21:58.680
<v Speaker 1>have any sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

361
00:21:58.690 --> 00:21:59.523
<v Speaker 1>you could store up the value of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>work for some reasonable time in the </v>

362
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:02.974
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the society is corrupt and there </v>

363
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.133
<v Speaker 1>no trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's degenerating and you know it might </v>

364
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:10.810
<v Speaker 1>live for a while but isn't going to last</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long.</v>

365
00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:13.420
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corrupt societies collapse</v>

366
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.640
<v Speaker 1>that leaves open what corruption means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

367
00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Jonah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

368
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would no bloody way.</v>

369
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.493
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to that city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can go to hell as far as I'm </v>

370
00:22:26.721 --> 00:22:28.250
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what he thinks.</v>

371
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And why in the world should I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it anyways?</v>

372
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.190
<v Speaker 1>And these are good objections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

373
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.490
<v Speaker 1>why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll face this,</v>

374
00:22:37.491 --> 00:22:41.000
<v Speaker 1>believe me in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will face this.</v>

375
00:22:41.001 --> 00:22:42.650
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already do always,</v>

376
00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.010
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continually in small ways.</v>

377
00:22:46.011 --> 00:22:46.844
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps when you're interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who aren't treating you properly </v>

378
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.550
<v Speaker 1>and when you're acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those might be your parents,</v>

379
00:22:52.551 --> 00:22:55.010
<v Speaker 1>they might be your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be people at your workplace,</v>

380
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.480
<v Speaker 1>they might be professors,</v>

381
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.720
<v Speaker 1>they're playing a crooked game and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like it and you know it's crooked.</v>

382
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

383
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:08.230
<v Speaker 1>what should you do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

384
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 1>if you know your crib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

385
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:12.070
<v Speaker 1>it's crooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so good to play along with it.</v>

386
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say that you know,</v>

387
00:23:13.451 --> 00:23:15.370
<v Speaker 1>it's crooked by your own standard of </v>
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

388
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 1>It d degrades you to play along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to stand up and oppose it.</v>

389
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

390
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:24.783
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably going to do what Jonah </v>

391
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:28.114
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump on a ship and get the hell out of </v>

392
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:31.330
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

393
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a logical thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't solve the problem.</v>

394
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.393
<v Speaker 1>And I think this has something to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with human ethical responsibility </v>

395
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:40.204
<v Speaker 1>because there are other old stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll tell you one likely where the </v>

396
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:49.460
<v Speaker 1>son of the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion king,</v>

397
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.733
<v Speaker 1>the son of the king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes off and he's some pathetic </v>

398
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 1>adolescent.</v>

399
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.383
<v Speaker 1>And then he shamed by the reappearance </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his old girlfriend into turning into </v>

400
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.124
<v Speaker 1>something vaguely useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he opens his eyes and he goes back </v>

401
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:07.820
<v Speaker 1>and he fights scar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

402
00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:09.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a scene of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

403
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Because there's fire everywhere and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights scar,</v>

404
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 1>finds out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scar killed,</v>

405
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:17.000
<v Speaker 1>his father casts him into the pit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

406
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:21.350
<v Speaker 1>and then the rain comes and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

407
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:26.351
<v Speaker 1>the movie returns to its beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally it's an paradise,</v>

408
00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Paradise lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise regained.</v>

409
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

410
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.220
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that's the story of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

411
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:35.054
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in that place that's working out </v>

412
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:36.764
<v Speaker 1>pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something happens to knock you off your </v>

413
00:24:39.201 --> 00:24:40.034
<v Speaker 1>perch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're down in the chaos for a good </v>

414
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:43.820
<v Speaker 1>amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you never get out,</v>

415
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you learn something down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

416
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a strength in your character and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you pop up to a new place and maybe</v>

417
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:53.660
<v Speaker 1>it's better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better aim,</v>

418
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

419
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.913
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not being overly optimistic </v>

420
00:24:57.201 --> 00:24:58.034
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know perfectly well that people </v>

421
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.703
<v Speaker 1>encounter</v>
<v Speaker 1>impediments during their life that they </v>

422
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:10.061
<v Speaker 1>find almost impossible to recover from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the best shot you have.</v>

423
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.570
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah runs away,</v>

424
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.890
<v Speaker 1>but God isn't very happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually joan is destiny.</v>

425
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.310
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary for Jonah to repair the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

426
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:28.270
<v Speaker 1>So God sends a storm and the waves are </v>
<v Speaker 1>high and and,</v>

427
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:29.563
<v Speaker 1>and I think what that means is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the water is often a symbol for the </v>

428
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:32.864
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and that's because things </v>
<v Speaker 1>lurk down there in the water and that </v>

429
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:36.614
<v Speaker 1>you could pull up that that are useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrous things that you can pull up </v>

430
00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:40.910
<v Speaker 1>their useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fish for them,</v>

431
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 1>you can go fishing in your own being for</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers,</v>

432
00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do when you try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think right.</v>

433
00:25:46.341 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 1>You ask yourself a question and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

434
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe an answer appears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like where did that come from?</v>

435
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.160
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know what the answer was </v>
<v Speaker 1>before it appeared.</v>

436
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.610
<v Speaker 1>When it just pop into being out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>

437
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you fish.</v>

438
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.203
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waves come and the boat's going to </v>

439
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 1>be knocked over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens.</v>

440
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I think when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know you should do something,</v>

441
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.633
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone has the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe perhaps you would be willing </v>

442
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:19.730
<v Speaker 1>to put up your hands if this experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>is foreign to you.</v>

443
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's party,</v>

444
00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:23.764
<v Speaker 1>you're telling you you should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and it's hard to do it </v>

445
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.230
<v Speaker 1>effortful and maybe you're afraid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't do it.</v>

446
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.970
<v Speaker 1>You just procrastinate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

447
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And so how do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

448
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you feel that you're </v>

449
00:26:39.021 --> 00:26:42.560
<v Speaker 1>betraying yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your anxiety actually gets worse,</v>

450
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:43.650
<v Speaker 1>not better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though,</v>

451
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put it off moment to moment,</v>

452
00:26:45.301 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't help because every time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put it off,</v>

453
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:50.640
<v Speaker 1>the anxiety just grows a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not proud of yourself.</v>

454
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.623
<v Speaker 1>You have a sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making things more chaotic than </v>

455
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 1>they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

456
00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:58.224
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure many of you have had that </v>

457
00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:01.800
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that long enough,</v>

458
00:27:01.801 --> 00:27:02.634
<v Speaker 1>if that becomes habitual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things will get so stormy around you </v>

459
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:09.060
<v Speaker 1>that you'll fall right into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the chaos,</v>

460
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 1>into the watery chaos and maybe you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>drown.</v>

461
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.330
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a very good idea to run from</v>
<v Speaker 1>your destiny,</v>

462
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 1>let's say</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might be.</v>

463
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.213
<v Speaker 1>And you need a destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need it a place to aim out because </v>

464
00:27:25.021 --> 00:27:25.854
<v Speaker 1>that's what gives your life meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need meaning in your life because </v>

465
00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:30.960
<v Speaker 1>life is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

466
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 1>you need something to buttress yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>against that.</v>

467
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:34.584
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

468
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:38.320
<v Speaker 1>they wake Jonah up and Jonah says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

469
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.290
<v Speaker 1>it's probably my fault because like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>running away from something I'm supposed</v>

470
00:27:41.291 --> 00:27:42.160
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

471
00:27:42.161 --> 00:27:42.994
<v Speaker 1>God isn't very happy about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why don't you just throw me over to </v>

472
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:45.543
<v Speaker 1>overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the crew isn't very happy about </v>

473
00:27:47.501 --> 00:27:48.334
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the waves are really starting to </v>

474
00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:52.540
<v Speaker 1>come up and Joan is pretty insistent </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's the cause of the problem.</v>

475
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.733
<v Speaker 1>And so they draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they draw a lot and and Jonah is chosen </v>

476
00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:01.144
<v Speaker 1>and so they decided to toss them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean and immediately everything's </v>

477
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:06.843
<v Speaker 1>calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's a center of chaos because he's </v>

478
00:28:09.461 --> 00:28:12.250
<v Speaker 1>not doing what he's supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

479
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Well then a whale comes up and swallows </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and then he's in the whale for three</v>

480
00:28:17.561 --> 00:28:20.330
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

481
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whale,</v>

482
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.920
<v Speaker 1>that's the way all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japan Petrosian,</v>

483
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.653
<v Speaker 1>that's a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not thing that you have to go out </v>

484
00:28:31.731 --> 00:28:34.760
<v Speaker 1>there and conquer to get something of </v>
<v Speaker 1>value now,</v>

485
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.083
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

486
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.310
<v Speaker 1>When you've made an error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've</v>

487
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 1>fallen off the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pathway,</v>

488
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.670
<v Speaker 1>when you've deviated from what you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do,</v>

489
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.380
<v Speaker 1>it produces a state of internal chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and worry and concern.</v>

490
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.050
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thrust into the unknown.</v>

491
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.360
<v Speaker 1>You're thrust into unknown territory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

492
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.343
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's often symbolized by the </v>

493
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.970
<v Speaker 1>encounter with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a monster,</v>

494
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.480
<v Speaker 1>like a dragon or something that lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the water.</v>

495
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.373
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is as </v>

496
00:29:08.551 --> 00:29:11.850
<v Speaker 1>far as I've been able to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that human beings,</v>

497
00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:12.684
<v Speaker 1>because we'd been prey animals for </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever and our battle with carnivorous </v>

498
00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:17.184
<v Speaker 1>lizards for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and alligators and even dinosaurs </v>

499
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:23.250
<v Speaker 1>because there were dinosaurs around at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time of our most distant ancestors.</v>

500
00:29:23.251 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And there was even a cat at one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

501
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.480
<v Speaker 1>that was adapted with teeth to Paris </v>
<v Speaker 1>human skulls.</v>

502
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.063
<v Speaker 1>So it had a head that was exactly shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grab you here and put a two through </v>

503
00:29:37.171 --> 00:29:38.190
<v Speaker 1>the back of your skull.</v>

504
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.440
<v Speaker 1>So like we've come through some rough </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

505
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:42.580
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have,</v>

506
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:44.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system in our mind,</v>

507
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:45.993
<v Speaker 1>it's a threat Predator detection system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that makes little kids </v>

508
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.180
<v Speaker 1>think about monsters in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

509
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Because while there is monsters in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

510
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 1>parents always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

511
00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:57.610
<v Speaker 1>there's no monsters in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

512
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.640
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The darkest full of monsters.</v>

513
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 1>There might not be any in your room </v>
<v Speaker 1>right at that moment.</v>

514
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.340
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean there aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters in the dark.</v>

515
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.013
<v Speaker 1>And crimes take place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like criminals don't get up at six in </v>

516
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:11.464
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

517
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have breakfast and go rob a bank,</v>

518
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.690
<v Speaker 1>they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do that sort of thing at night.</v>

519
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:17.763
<v Speaker 1>People do the things that are fit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the night in the night and lots of </v>

520
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:24.064
<v Speaker 1>predators are nocturnal and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see very well in the dark and kids </v>

521
00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:29.230
<v Speaker 1>aren't stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

522
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.213
<v Speaker 1>they've evolved to stay pretty damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the fire because the kids that </v>

523
00:30:35.381 --> 00:30:36.214
<v Speaker 1>wandered away from the fire got picked </v>
<v Speaker 1>off by hyenas and lions and crocodiles </v>

524
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:46.810
<v Speaker 1>and whatever else the hell was out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat the unwary.</v>

525
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:53.070
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>the circuit that we use to,</v>

526
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.960
<v Speaker 1>to defend ourselves against predators</v>

527
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.210
<v Speaker 1>as we've evolved cortically that circuit</v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

528
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:03.913
<v Speaker 1>has come to represent what we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general because the predators of </v>

529
00:31:07.161 --> 00:31:12.161
<v Speaker 1>course in habit where we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so evolution is a conservative force</v>

530
00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:17.120
<v Speaker 1>and we use the circuits that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved to represent new things.</v>

531
00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.223
<v Speaker 1>And so the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos is often represented by a </v>

532
00:31:22.041 --> 00:31:24.290
<v Speaker 1>monster that swallows you up and pulls </v>
<v Speaker 1>you down.</v>

533
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know when you're feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

534
00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm feeling up.</v>

535
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.660
<v Speaker 1>You say I'm feeling down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well why is that?</v>

536
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.593
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

537
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.570
<v Speaker 1>down is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

538
00:31:36.571 --> 00:31:37.404
<v Speaker 1>You're flat on the ground when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>down or you're in a hole or something </v>

539
00:31:39.721 --> 00:31:41.280
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hiding in a hole,</v>

540
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you know it's down and you're threatened</v>
<v Speaker 1>by something.</v>

541
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:45.683
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're threatened by your own </v>

542
00:31:47.551 --> 00:31:49.290
<v Speaker 1>inadequacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might be part of it.</v>

543
00:31:49.291 --> 00:31:50.124
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's partly what you imagine as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a monstrous force because you know your </v>

544
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.593
<v Speaker 1>proclivity towards prass procrastination</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your weakness of character is part </v>

545
00:31:58.561 --> 00:31:59.394
<v Speaker 1>and parcel of why you happen to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the underworld and that's the </v>

546
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:05.550
<v Speaker 1>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mythological underworld.</v>

547
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:11.640
<v Speaker 1>That's where you go when things fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart and if you understand that,</v>

548
00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.900
<v Speaker 1>if you know that that's what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have one of the keys that opens</v>

549
00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:20.680
<v Speaker 1>up ancient stories to you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand things you could,</v>

550
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:23.640
<v Speaker 1>your life can be an organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going very well,</v>

551
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.710
<v Speaker 1>and then something comes up and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything changes.</v>

552
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Some axiom that you were up living by </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

553
00:32:31.291 --> 00:32:34.200
<v Speaker 1>it might be the existence of a partner </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a job.</v>

554
00:32:34.201 --> 00:32:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That might be your health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of those things</v>

555
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 4>go on and</v>

556
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 1>you go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that happens,</v>

557
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 1>you go somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a state of being.</v>

558
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Speaker 1>You're still in the same world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same at all anymore.</v>

559
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all negative and dark and you don't</v>

560
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:53.570
<v Speaker 1>know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're confused.</v>

561
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.153
<v Speaker 1>And so what do you do down there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld when things have fallen </v>

562
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:01.270
<v Speaker 1>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if hope,</v>

563
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.713
<v Speaker 1>if it's the worst possible case scenario</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you realize that you actually had </v>

564
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:08.810
<v Speaker 1>something to do with your demise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really annoying.</v>

565
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.080
<v Speaker 1>You know when something bad happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and then you know,</v>

566
00:33:12.081 --> 00:33:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you grind yourself into bits trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what the hell happened.</v>

567
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:20.591
<v Speaker 1>And then you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you are playing a causal role now.</v>

568
00:33:21.441 --> 00:33:22.274
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you're so depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assume you're playing a causal role </v>

569
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.393
<v Speaker 1>and you work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to figure out by any </v>

570
00:33:26.691 --> 00:33:27.920
<v Speaker 1>stretch of the imagination.</v>

571
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't that everyone who does </v>
<v Speaker 1>something terrible is at fault for it.</v>

572
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.920
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you find that you are off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the path somehow.</v>

573
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And maybe even that you knew it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't attend to it.</v>

574
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's why all of this hit the fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then down there in that chaos,</v>

575
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.030
<v Speaker 1>you decide that you're going to do what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to do instead.</v>

576
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you get to rise up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>renewed if you're lucky.</v>

577
00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And then you can go fix the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this story's about.</v>

578
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I picked the image to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the chorus.</v>

579
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Because really what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see with the psychoanalysts,</v>

580
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 1>the road due to health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not doing well,</v>

581
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.670
<v Speaker 1>which means that as you act in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

582
00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with your,</v>

583
00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:23.720
<v Speaker 1>the match between your presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your actions,</v>

584
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.840
<v Speaker 1>habitual and the way the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to you.</v>

585
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:31.130
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not turning out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

586
00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:32.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you do about that?</v>

587
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.123
<v Speaker 1>And one answer might be to examine </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself for presuppositions and action </v>

588
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:38.984
<v Speaker 1>patterns that are not serving you well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to find out what they are and what </v>

589
00:34:42.681 --> 00:34:43.514
<v Speaker 1>to do about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe some of that is maybe you're </v>

590
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.063
<v Speaker 1>not moving forward because of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that theory is grounded in </v>

591
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:49.544
<v Speaker 1>terrible experiences that you had in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past that you've never been able to </v>

592
00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:52.514
<v Speaker 1>understand and maybe one of the ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluing yourself back together and </v>

593
00:34:56.091 --> 00:34:56.924
<v Speaker 1>expanding your personality so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could in fact live properly in the </v>

594
00:35:00.561 --> 00:35:01.394
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to go back to those terrible events </v>

595
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 1>and untie them and straighten them out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and understand them and drop them.</v>

596
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's what psychotherapy is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>in large part,</v>

597
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral,</v>

598
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:19.700
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you afraid of?</v>

599
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.310
<v Speaker 1>What are you avoiding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you failing to develop?</v>

600
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe from fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe from avoidance,</v>

601
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:26.990
<v Speaker 1>God only knows maybe from disgust.</v>

602
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.583
<v Speaker 1>How can you get over it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you reclaim those parts of your </v>

603
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:33.613
<v Speaker 1>self?</v>

604
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:49.143
<v Speaker 1>I sat in the first lecture that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to try to provide you with a </v>

605
00:35:51.411 --> 00:35:56.411
<v Speaker 1>Schema</v>
<v Speaker 1>into which you could place the theorists</v>

606
00:35:56.691 --> 00:36:01.691
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to discuss and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires going down deep to do that.</v>

607
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.910
<v Speaker 1>And there are presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My presupposition,</v>

608
00:36:04.911 --> 00:36:06.800
<v Speaker 1>and this is a psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition,</v>

609
00:36:06.801 --> 00:36:11.150
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a poetic tradition,</v>

610
00:36:11.151 --> 00:36:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I would say on an ancient tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned most of it from reading young.</v>

611
00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:17.683
<v Speaker 1>It was Carl Young that</v>
<v Speaker 1>helped me understand that we're nested </v>

612
00:36:22.071 --> 00:36:26.540
<v Speaker 1>inside a dream that we have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know everything.</v>

613
00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.423
<v Speaker 1>We have to take things as givens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the things that we take it as </v>

614
00:36:33.471 --> 00:36:38.471
<v Speaker 1>givens are nested inside stories and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept the stories as valid.</v>

615
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:42.560
<v Speaker 1>And then outside the stories is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute unknown,</v>

616
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.660
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly,</v>

617
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.913
<v Speaker 1>the stories are tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that one of the classic </v>

618
00:36:48.471 --> 00:36:49.304
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a variant of the Jonah story I </v>

619
00:36:52.791 --> 00:36:53.624
<v Speaker 1>would say is</v>

620
00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.513
<v Speaker 1>Saint George and the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that story was represented in </v>

621
00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.070
<v Speaker 1>during the renaissance and during </v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval times,</v>

622
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:12.010
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the story of Saint Patrick who</v>

623
00:37:12.011 --> 00:37:14.470
<v Speaker 1>chased the snakes out of Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same idea.</v>

624
00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And that the typical St George story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hobbit or Harry Potter.</v>

625
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.023
<v Speaker 1>So in the second volume of Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I have any of these </v>

626
00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:29.320
<v Speaker 1>details wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember there's that snake,</v>

627
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.680
<v Speaker 1>the Bass lisc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is magic castle,</v>

628
00:37:32.681 --> 00:37:34.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys have no problem with that magic</v>

629
00:37:34.841 --> 00:37:35.950
<v Speaker 1>castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

630
00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:37.960
<v Speaker 1>There's an RF,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an orphan.</v>

631
00:37:37.961 --> 00:37:41.740
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the magic castle to learn how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more than normal,</v>

632
00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:42.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The muggles,</v>

633
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:46.060
<v Speaker 1>he has a muggle family were not too </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with the muggle family.</v>

634
00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Like as representatives of normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

635
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.793
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some blacks now of course the </v>

636
00:37:52.301 --> 00:37:53.134
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's what teenagers often feel </v>

637
00:37:54.971 --> 00:37:56.560
<v Speaker 1>about their parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

638
00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.900
<v Speaker 1>They failed Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These couldn't really be my parents.</v>

639
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I must have some other parents who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like together and those are like magical</v>

640
00:38:04.271 --> 00:38:05.104
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

641
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Parents that live in the sky and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course Harry Potter has earthly parents.</v>

642
00:38:09.431 --> 00:38:12.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the muggles and Dursley I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the kid.</v>

643
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 1>He's at what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a wonderful piece of work and uh,</v>

644
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ill form day spoiled ill formed selfish </v>

645
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.500
<v Speaker 1>very far from the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a foil for Harry and of course he's</v>

646
00:38:26.501 --> 00:38:30.820
<v Speaker 1>appreciated and doted on and Harry is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually punished for his virtues.</v>

647
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Lots of classic story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to,</v>

648
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>to be punished for your virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at the story,</v>

649
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.233
<v Speaker 1>the central story in Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the central story in Christianity is </v>

650
00:38:40.301 --> 00:38:43.540
<v Speaker 1>about someone who is precisely punished </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the worst possible way.</v>

651
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:44.374
<v Speaker 1>For the highest possible virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it makes it an </v>

652
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 1>archetypal story because there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything more unfair than that.</v>

653
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.153
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a limit in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be worse than that being </v>

654
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 1>punished for being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:38:55.601 --> 00:38:56.620
<v Speaker 1>unworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

656
00:38:56.621 --> 00:38:57.011
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

657
00:38:57.011 --> 00:39:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I will at least make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to be punished because you have your</v>

658
00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:02.134
<v Speaker 1>act together and you're a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real punishment and that's what </v>

659
00:39:05.981 --> 00:39:06.814
<v Speaker 1>happens to Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So luckily he finds out that he's </v>

660
00:39:09.551 --> 00:39:10.384
<v Speaker 1>magical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite convenient and off he </v>

661
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 1>goes to wizarding school and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually like taking,</v>

662
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.140
<v Speaker 1>that's actually like going and studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the humanities.</v>

663
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was when they still were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

664
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.920
<v Speaker 1>because if it's through the humanities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

665
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.353
<v Speaker 1>that you make contact with the magic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your culture and that makes you more </v>

666
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:36.514
<v Speaker 1>than merely the child of your parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are more than merely the </v>

667
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:40.864
<v Speaker 1>child of your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are the child of nature and you're </v>

668
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:43.714
<v Speaker 1>the child of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until you understand what that </v>

669
00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:48.424
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that you have two sets of </v>

670
00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:52.480
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the divine hero always has two sets</v>

671
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:53.880
<v Speaker 1>of parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

672
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:58.090
<v Speaker 1>you can't construe yourself properly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual.</v>

673
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.370
<v Speaker 1>You're not situated properly in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

674
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities are.</v>

675
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:06.670
<v Speaker 1>You Count Orient your values property </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will suffer for that.</v>

676
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Because as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because life is so difficult,</v>

677
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to do something that's truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile in order to justify it.</v>

678
00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.240
<v Speaker 1>And so well that's what all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories tell you.</v>

679
00:40:23.241 --> 00:40:24.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what the story of Jonah is </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you.</v>

680
00:40:24.861 --> 00:40:29.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have an ethical duty to </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten things up.</v>

681
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:33.890
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be sorry.</v>

682
00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.870
<v Speaker 1>And that story is echoed everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>while now Saint George.</v>

683
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to Harry Potter.</v>

684
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.833
<v Speaker 1>That's what we were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he goes off to the magic castle and </v>

685
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:49.670
<v Speaker 1>he's learning to be a wizard and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of an interesting character because</v>

686
00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.090
<v Speaker 1>he's not really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we find out,</v>

687
00:40:53.091 --> 00:40:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I think that's because it doesn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of voldemort in him.</v>

688
00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.900
<v Speaker 1>He's not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

689
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that means is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be good,</v>

690
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:07.910
<v Speaker 1>truly good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just follow rules.</v>

691
00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:08.773
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very clear in the Harry Potter </v>

692
00:41:09.861 --> 00:41:10.694
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you also have to be able to </v>

693
00:41:11.901 --> 00:41:12.734
<v Speaker 1>understand malevolence and in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand malevolence so that you can </v>

694
00:41:16.251 --> 00:41:17.084
<v Speaker 1>withstand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that part of you </v>

695
00:41:18.891 --> 00:41:23.660
<v Speaker 1>that's malevolent because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're naive and if you're naive,</v>

696
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you're easy pickings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a union idea too.</v>

697
00:41:27.831 --> 00:41:31.760
<v Speaker 1>And the union idea is that part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality development is to understand</v>

698
00:41:31.761 --> 00:41:36.761
<v Speaker 1>your shadow and the shadow is those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about you that you do not want to</v>

699
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:38.594
<v Speaker 1>admit to.</v>

700
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:40.503
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

701
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.700
<v Speaker 1>you can learn about your shadow by </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading history.</v>

702
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read about Auschwitz,</v>

703
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:47.383
<v Speaker 1>you can read about the concentration </v>
<v Speaker 1>camps in Russia and you can imagine </v>

704
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:51.854
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a guard</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of as a heroic rescue or of </v>

705
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:01.490
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate victims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be very,</v>

706
00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:02.324
<v Speaker 1>very unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you can imagine yourself as a </v>

707
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:08.240
<v Speaker 1>guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a terrifying thing to do,</v>

708
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Speaker 1>then you understand something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

709
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.193
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is also from students </v>

710
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:17.924
<v Speaker 1>studying young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you cannot have proper respect for </v>

711
00:42:20.751 --> 00:42:21.584
<v Speaker 1>yourself until you know that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster because you won't act carefully </v>

712
00:42:25.371 --> 00:42:26.181
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

713
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:26.781
<v Speaker 1>if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

714
00:42:26.781 --> 00:42:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nice person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never do anyone any harm.</v>

715
00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:29.684
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're no saint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be sure of that and the harm </v>

716
00:42:33.861 --> 00:42:35.330
<v Speaker 1>that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can come in many,</v>

717
00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:36.164
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you regard yourself as </v>

718
00:42:39.261 --> 00:42:41.360
<v Speaker 1>harmless inoffensive.</v>

719
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

720
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Marty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have any reason to be careful.</v>

721
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:48.860
<v Speaker 1>You're like a teddy bear sitting on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf.</v>

722
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Even if you throw it at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to get hurt.</v>

723
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.813
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what you're like because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a human being and human beings </v>

724
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:55.634
<v Speaker 1>are some vicious creatures and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility in knowing that because it's </v>

725
00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:03.410
<v Speaker 1>also the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

726
00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.253
<v Speaker 1>when the Harry Potter series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry could stand up against voldemort </v>

727
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:06.913
<v Speaker 1>and understand them and speak his </v>
<v Speaker 1>language because he was instructed by </v>

728
00:43:09.321 --> 00:43:11.630
<v Speaker 1>him to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

729
00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:13.550
<v Speaker 1>very interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

730
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.230
<v Speaker 1>in the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

731
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm telling you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where thinking about,</v>

732
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:21.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like how long were each of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>books?</v>

733
00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Like 500 pages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are long Hais and there was,</v>

734
00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.870
<v Speaker 1>how many of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven and how many were there more sold?</v>

735
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:31.243
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you read every Harry Potter </v>

736
00:43:32.241 --> 00:43:33.074
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

737
00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you read at least one?</v>

738
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you saw the movies?</v>

739
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:46.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're all in a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>

740
00:43:46.971 --> 00:43:48.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

741
00:43:48.081 --> 00:43:50.510
<v Speaker 1>that's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really the truth.</v>

742
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.940
<v Speaker 1>So in the second volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this snake that's zipping around</v>

743
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:55.790
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Basilisk,</v>

744
00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it lives in the underground.</v>

745
00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.860
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

746
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.473
<v Speaker 1>And that's because wherever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on thin ice and underneath your </v>

747
00:44:04.881 --> 00:44:05.714
<v Speaker 1>thin ice is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here we are in this unbelievably </v>

748
00:44:08.961 --> 00:44:12.860
<v Speaker 1>civilized environment and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting along so perfectly,</v>

749
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.260
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got hot,</v>

750
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:16.850
<v Speaker 1>we've got lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got electricity,</v>

751
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.880
<v Speaker 1>sewage system is working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's hungry.</v>

752
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:21.103
<v Speaker 1>It's like we can be peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if any of that fell apart and it </v>

753
00:44:25.671 --> 00:44:29.150
<v Speaker 1>could easily fall apart because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody miracle it ever works at all,</v>

754
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.673
<v Speaker 1>then the chaos that's just underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface is going to come up right </v>

755
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:35.723
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's useful to know that because it </v>

756
00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 1>makes you properly grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really understand it,</v>

757
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.653
<v Speaker 1>it makes you properly grateful for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody miracle it is that you can be </v>

758
00:44:46.261 --> 00:44:49.320
<v Speaker 1>here in peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

759
00:44:49.321 --> 00:44:51.950
<v Speaker 1>there's this snake that's underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface and it's still,</v>

760
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no joke.</v>

761
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:55.680
<v Speaker 1>That thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's big and it's ancient.</v>

762
00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:58.650
<v Speaker 1>It's always been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens if you look at it,</v>

763
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.240
<v Speaker 1>it turns you to stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

764
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.680
<v Speaker 1>It paralyzes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

765
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:06.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Gorgon,</v>

766
00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 1>that's Medusa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman with the head of snakes.</v>

767
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:11.910
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it paralyzes you.</v>

768
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:13.980
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

769
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.340
<v Speaker 1>you're walking through the jungle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>big snake appears.</v>

770
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.130
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you freeze?</v>

771
00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:23.220
<v Speaker 1>And no bloody wonder because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prey animal.</v>

772
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:25.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they do when they see </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are going to eat them.</v>

773
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:30.570
<v Speaker 1>And so the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

774
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.880
<v Speaker 1>lots of people still die from snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>bite.</v>

775
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.080
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ancestors were,</v>

776
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean our ancestors like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

777
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.193
<v Speaker 1>tens of millions of years ago when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were living in trees and weren't very </v>

778
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:45.000
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made a nice snack for a snake.</v>

779
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:46.223
<v Speaker 1>And there's a woman named Lynn Isabelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an anthropologist at Ucla who's </v>

780
00:45:49.531 --> 00:45:50.364
<v Speaker 1>correlated the presence of carnivorous </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes with the acuity of primate </v>

781
00:45:55.321 --> 00:45:56.154
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what she found was that the more </v>

782
00:45:57.961 --> 00:46:00.600
<v Speaker 1>snakes around the better the primates </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see.</v>

783
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:02.783
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're particularly good at picking </v>

784
00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:08.910
<v Speaker 1>up patterns like snake camouflage in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower half of our visual quadrant.</v>

785
00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people generally don't like snakes.</v>

786
00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:11.874
<v Speaker 1>You can learn to handle them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no snake fear appears to be a nate </v>

787
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.253
<v Speaker 1>to nate and chimpanzees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it tends to increase as you age </v>

788
00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:20.250
<v Speaker 1>rather than decreasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can overcome it,</v>

789
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.750
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

790
00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:24.570
<v Speaker 1>my daughter had snakes and one day her </v>
<v Speaker 1>sneak bitter.</v>

791
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.770
<v Speaker 1>It was a fairly big snake</v>

792
00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:30.100
<v Speaker 1>and she hadn't paid it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paid attention to it for a while.</v>

793
00:46:30.101 --> 00:46:30.934
<v Speaker 1>So it nailed her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from then on she has had very </v>

794
00:46:34.871 --> 00:46:38.470
<v Speaker 1>difficult time grabbing the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like bitten once,</v>

795
00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shy permanently.</v>

796
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:42.933
<v Speaker 1>She also told me years later she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmares about snakes all the time </v>

797
00:46:46.181 --> 00:46:48.520
<v Speaker 1>when she had a snake in her room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

798
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was probably the smell.</v>

799
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:56.190
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Harry Potter decides he's going to go</v>

800
00:46:56.591 --> 00:46:57.670
<v Speaker 1>after the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

801
00:46:57.671 --> 00:47:00.640
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go out there and face the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that he's most afraid of.</v>

802
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.983
<v Speaker 1>So he does that way down in the depths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like Jonah going down into the </v>

803
00:47:06.401 --> 00:47:11.401
<v Speaker 1>depths and he faces the bass lisc and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>bites him.</v>

804
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.460
<v Speaker 1>And you know that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right because if you go down into</v>

805
00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:18.220
<v Speaker 1>the depths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get bitten.</v>

806
00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Like it's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a hero story,</v>

807
00:47:21.221 --> 00:47:23.770
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about the hero stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually real.</v>

808
00:47:23.771 --> 00:47:26.440
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you're facing is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

809
00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:27.483
<v Speaker 1>And even though facing it voluntarily be</v>
<v Speaker 1>your best bet and is likely your best </v>

810
00:47:32.171 --> 00:47:33.004
<v Speaker 1>bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's the central story of </v>

811
00:47:33.761 --> 00:47:34.594
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you're going to </v>

812
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 1>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the real thing.</v>

813
00:47:38.111 --> 00:47:39.310
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets bitten,</v>

814
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's going to die.</v>

815
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Now he's rescuing ginny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Saint George Story.</v>

816
00:47:45.311 --> 00:47:50.210
<v Speaker 1>If you go after like dragon dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to capture virgin,</v>

817
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:54.430
<v Speaker 1>God only knows why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because</v>

818
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:01.533
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that male humans have done from the </v>

819
00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:08.230
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time is chase the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators away.</v>

820
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.113
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect that the males from God </v>
<v Speaker 1>only knows how long ago who were </v>

821
00:48:16.151 --> 00:48:16.984
<v Speaker 1>particularly good at that we're rewarded</v>
<v Speaker 1>with female attention and why the hell </v>

822
00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:23.434
<v Speaker 1>not so it's deeply rooted inside of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea of facing the unknown and </v>

823
00:48:29.591 --> 00:48:32.320
<v Speaker 1>freeing the woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea there is that if you,</v>

824
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:37.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a male idea in large part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can talk about the central female myth</v>

825
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.253
<v Speaker 1>and I will as we proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that if you're the sort of </v>

826
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.780
<v Speaker 1>person who can stand up against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and the frightening,</v>

827
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:50.560
<v Speaker 1>then you're also likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you develop into that sort of person,</v>

828
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:51.394
<v Speaker 1>then you're also likely to develop into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of person that other people </v>

829
00:48:53.801 --> 00:48:58.030
<v Speaker 1>will find attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

830
00:48:58.031 --> 00:49:01.660
<v Speaker 1>and that's why young believed that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the shadow was the anima,</v>

831
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.340
<v Speaker 1>which is like a female figure.</v>

832
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And so his idea was something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.700
<v Speaker 1>if you look watch movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always this Beta male guy.</v>

834
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:11.043
<v Speaker 1>If they're romantic movies and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice guy and he's the friend and you </v>

835
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:15.010
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman tells him everything,</v>

836
00:49:15.011 --> 00:49:15.844
<v Speaker 1>but she doesn't like him a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She likes the guy who's like got an </v>

837
00:49:18.611 --> 00:49:19.950
<v Speaker 1>edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

838
00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.540
<v Speaker 1>and who's capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say may him,</v>

839
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.553
<v Speaker 1>but at least of aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean she wants him to </v>

840
00:49:27.341 --> 00:49:28.174
<v Speaker 1>be aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it does mean is that she wants </v>

841
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:32.590
<v Speaker 1>him to be able to be aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>

842
00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:33.723
<v Speaker 1>And so he's the romantic target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's the person that's </v>

843
00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:41.071
<v Speaker 1>incorporated the shadow and he's someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is respectable and perhaps useful.</v>

844
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

845
00:49:43.841 --> 00:49:45.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a very old story.</v>

846
00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about this for a minute.</v>

847
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:02.383
<v Speaker 1>I've already offered you a proposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's an important </v>

848
00:50:06.171 --> 00:50:07.010
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

849
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:08.263
<v Speaker 1>I'm offering you this proposition so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can make sense of art and </v>

850
00:50:12.591 --> 00:50:17.591
<v Speaker 1>literature and mythology and religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dance and all those strange,</v>

851
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:22.160
<v Speaker 1>ritualistic things that human beings do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems central to us,</v>

852
00:50:22.161 --> 00:50:22.994
<v Speaker 1>including including not least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eradicable tendency of us to seek </v>

853
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:35.231
<v Speaker 1>out stories of heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should finish the,</v>

854
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.753
<v Speaker 1>the Harry Potter story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Harry Potter goes down there to </v>

855
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:41.470
<v Speaker 1>rescue Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

856
00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:42.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

857
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:45.930
<v Speaker 1>that's not her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it Jenny?</v>

858
00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>

859
00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:51.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a formal name for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a variant of Virginia anyways,</v>

860
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:52.670
<v Speaker 1>which is very divergent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

861
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he gets bitten.</v>

862
00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Genever that's it.</v>

863
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.900
<v Speaker 1>He gets bitten and the bite is poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there is dying,</v>

864
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't seem to be so good.</v>

865
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.370
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

866
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you guys swallowed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no problem.</v>

867
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 1>So what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dumbledore character.</v>

868
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:14.750
<v Speaker 1>He's got a Berg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

869
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:18.470
<v Speaker 1>So he's the wise old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the ruler of the castle.</v>

870
00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:21.860
<v Speaker 1>He's the ruler of the magic castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the magic king.</v>

871
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like God,</v>

872
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:24.974
<v Speaker 1>the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as Harry Potter is concerned and </v>

873
00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:28.940
<v Speaker 1>he has a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of bird is it?</v>

874
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

875
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.353
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange about a phoenix is that while </v>

876
00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:37.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a strange way,</v>

877
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:39.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lives and lives,</v>

878
00:51:39.321 --> 00:51:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I think a hundred years and it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>older and older and then one day,</v>

879
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:43.580
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bursts into flames.</v>

880
00:51:43.581 --> 00:51:47.330
<v Speaker 1>And it turns into an egg and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a new phoenix.</v>

881
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's a symbol of transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of transformation.</v>

882
00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.770
<v Speaker 1>The bird is a spirit or psyche.</v>

883
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:59.330
<v Speaker 1>And so here's what it means in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

884
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:04.430
<v Speaker 1>you know how when you learn a lesson in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life that that's not very pleasant,</v>

885
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:06.163
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like when you learn something </v>

886
00:52:07.431 --> 00:52:10.700
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best day of your life.</v>

887
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:15.970
<v Speaker 1>It's often the importance of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn is often proportionate to just how</v>

888
00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:18.710
<v Speaker 1>wretched it is to learn it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

889
00:52:18.711 --> 00:52:19.544
<v Speaker 1>you learn things the hard way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn things by getting hit because </v>

890
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:25.550
<v Speaker 1>obviously if what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>

891
00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:26.384
<v Speaker 1>you get where you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no learning in that and that's </v>

892
00:52:28.671 --> 00:52:32.210
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when you're doing something and you</v>

893
00:52:32.211 --> 00:52:36.140
<v Speaker 1>hit an obstacle and maybe a bloody well </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit it hard and then you know you recoil</v>

894
00:52:36.141 --> 00:52:36.974
<v Speaker 1>and then you down into the depths you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to sort yourself out and </v>

895
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.060
<v Speaker 1>you realize that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

896
00:52:41.061 --> 00:52:44.570
<v Speaker 1>this particular kind of idiot and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should probably fix that.</v>

897
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's really annoying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

898
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:47.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

899
00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.413
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're down in the dumps and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious for quite a while and then you </v>

900
00:52:50.811 --> 00:52:52.640
<v Speaker 1>get it repaired more or less than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

901
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:57.641
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself back together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Phoenix poof into flames,</v>

902
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Bang egg new you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

903
00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the ability to learn.</v>

904
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are very strange creatures,</v>

905
00:53:07.371 --> 00:53:11.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're very malleable compared to</v>

906
00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:12.320
<v Speaker 1>most animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

907
00:53:12.321 --> 00:53:15.980
<v Speaker 1>like grizzly bears now in Grizzly bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years ago,</v>

908
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:18.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the same thing.</v>

909
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>They do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no transformation.</v>

910
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.090
<v Speaker 1>But human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this massive brain and you know,</v>

911
00:53:27.091 --> 00:53:27.924
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain because it means you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of human children until </v>

912
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 1>they're 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a big burden.</v>

913
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.571
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

914
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:39.570
<v Speaker 1>we pay a big price for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also makes childbirth very difficult.</v>

915
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:42.150
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's costly.</v>

916
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.983
<v Speaker 1>You have to eat a lot because you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big brain because it uses up a lot of </v>

917
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:46.440
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

918
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

919
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you pay a price for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the advantage is your plastic.</v>

920
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:52.223
<v Speaker 1>You can learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now learning is a strange thing because </v>

921
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you can think of it as just acquiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>more information,</v>

922
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:04.050
<v Speaker 1>but you could also think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is more accurate as</v>

923
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.010
<v Speaker 1>finding out something that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

924
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So that sort of built into like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

925
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:11.723
<v Speaker 1>a character element of your character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a presumption of your perception or a </v>

926
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:16.320
<v Speaker 1>deep habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really built into you.</v>

927
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a neural structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

928
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:19.463
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's alive and you have to kill it </v>

929
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.823
<v Speaker 1>because this is working properly and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain that you go through in part when </v>

930
00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:28.470
<v Speaker 1>you're suffering because you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something stupid.</v>

931
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Is it something like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the neurology,</v>

932
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I can never get this quite right.</v>

933
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.373
<v Speaker 1>It's the pain of the death of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and that can be a huge chunk </v>

934
00:54:41.431 --> 00:54:42.151
<v Speaker 1>of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

935
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:45.630
<v Speaker 1>if you really have to go through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive revision,</v>

936
00:54:45.631 --> 00:54:46.464
<v Speaker 1>it's like the person that comes out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other end might hardly be the same at </v>

937
00:54:50.221 --> 00:54:51.660
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

938
00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:52.800
<v Speaker 1>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

939
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:53.634
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to combat alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just a ratchet thing to do </v>

940
00:54:58.111 --> 00:55:01.650
<v Speaker 1>because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all your friends are alcoholic.</v>

941
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.033
<v Speaker 1>All your family drinks too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you know how to do when </v>

942
00:55:05.671 --> 00:55:08.190
<v Speaker 1>you're socializing is to go to the bar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and drink too much.</v>

943
00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:09.443
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you spend like 20 hours a week on </v>

944
00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:12.420
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

945
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that you're addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the substance.</v>

946
00:55:15.931 --> 00:55:16.764
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's how you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to stop being an </v>

947
00:55:19.141 --> 00:55:19.974
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do you have to stop drinking </v>

948
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:22.944
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to stop seeing all your </v>

949
00:55:24.931 --> 00:55:26.040
<v Speaker 1>drunk friends.</v>

950
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:26.903
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you've had them for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life and you have to have </v>

951
00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:31.200
<v Speaker 1>continual battles with your drunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

952
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:34.080
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do with that 20 hours.</v>

953
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:37.770
<v Speaker 1>It's now like hanging around your neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an albatross.</v>

954
00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:39.173
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to lift that whole part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your personality die and a new part </v>

955
00:55:43.771 --> 00:55:47.520
<v Speaker 1>house to spring forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the Phoenix is.</v>

956
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:51.690
<v Speaker 1>And the Phoenix is the capacity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person to transform.</v>

957
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:57.030
<v Speaker 1>And so when Harry gets bit by the snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>that freezes him,</v>

958
00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:01.350
<v Speaker 1>he gets seriously injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Phoenix comes in Christ,</v>

959
00:56:01.351 --> 00:56:05.340
<v Speaker 1>some tears in his wound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it prepares him,</v>

960
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's back to life.</v>

961
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:14.150
<v Speaker 1>And the strange thing is that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay with all of the viewers now.</v>

962
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.213
<v Speaker 1>Why would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing about it that's </v>

963
00:56:19.951 --> 00:56:21.750
<v Speaker 1>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>

964
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:26.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magic castle that's not rational.</v>

965
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Giant snake underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a little more rational.</v>

966
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Turning you to stone going down there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>face it,</v>

967
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:38.020
<v Speaker 1>being rejuvenated by a phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

968
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:38.381
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

969
00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:39.214
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>

970
00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.920
<v Speaker 1>we'll watch that glue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all swallow.</v>

971
00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:42.754
<v Speaker 1>It will be completely engaged in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because it's </v>

972
00:56:44.921 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 1>a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about how people,</v>

973
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:49.240
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

974
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.073
<v Speaker 1>it's a Meta story about how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to conduct yourself in the </v>

975
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:53.344
<v Speaker 1>world to face the things that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of that would otherwise paralyze </v>

976
00:56:56.321 --> 00:57:01.321
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To let the death of what is insufficient</v>

977
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:06.820
<v Speaker 1>about you ochre and then to wait for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebirth.</v>

978
00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:12.413
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So science is about what the world is </v>

979
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.313
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

980
00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:22.550
<v Speaker 1>mythodrama and dream and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

981
00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:27.230
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the aesthetic and artistic and</v>

982
00:57:27.231 --> 00:57:32.180
<v Speaker 1>fantastic side of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more about how things should be.</v>

983
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.073
<v Speaker 1>It's more about how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there lessons in how to act and </v>

984
00:57:36.771 --> 00:57:39.590
<v Speaker 1>they're abstract glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are capable of abstraction.</v>

985
00:57:39.591 --> 00:57:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

986
00:57:40.851 --> 00:57:41.684
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something good about you and </v>

987
00:57:43.131 --> 00:57:45.320
<v Speaker 1>there's something good about you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something good about you and,</v>

988
00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:47.510
<v Speaker 1>and there's some bad about you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you.</v>

989
00:57:47.511 --> 00:57:50.660
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll take all the good things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make one good thing out of that.</v>

990
00:57:50.661 --> 00:57:53.090
<v Speaker 1>We'll take all the bad things and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>one bad thing out of that.</v>

991
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:54.103
<v Speaker 1>And then we start to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between good and bad and we </v>

992
00:57:56.271 --> 00:57:57.104
<v Speaker 1>get better and better and better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at that over the centuries as we </v>

993
00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:00.733
<v Speaker 1>distill that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have a figure of ultimate </v>

994
00:58:02.271 --> 00:58:03.104
<v Speaker 1>good and a figure of ultimate evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that helps us understand what those </v>

995
00:58:06.351 --> 00:58:10.340
<v Speaker 1>two things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the hostile brothers.</v>

996
00:58:10.341 --> 00:58:12.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a very common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological motif.</v>

997
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:13.461
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

998
00:58:13.461 --> 00:58:15.890
<v Speaker 1>they're at war inside you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

999
00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:19.160
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's a universal </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

1000
00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:22.950
<v Speaker 1>It's an existential truth.</v>

1001
00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:31.430
<v Speaker 1>The domain of ethics and morality is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we in the world and what,</v>

1002
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:33.020
<v Speaker 1>how should we be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the good?</v>

1003
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.410
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from the fact that you should know</v>

1004
00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:37.910
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is what you should know.</v>

1005
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:42.470
<v Speaker 1>If you go through university is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>bears directly on issues of health.</v>

1006
00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:46.760
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to accomplish something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say if you go see a psychotherapist,</v>

1007
00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:47.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

1008
00:58:47.421 --> 00:58:50.750
<v Speaker 1>well I'm trying to get healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know that's not really right.</v>

1009
00:58:50.751 --> 00:58:54.380
<v Speaker 1>What you're trying to do when you go see</v>
<v Speaker 1>a therapist is get your life together.</v>

1010
00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1011
00:58:56.451 --> 00:59:00.620
<v Speaker 1>like mostly when I'm acting as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist,</v>

1012
00:59:00.621 --> 00:59:03.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I'm directly treating </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental disorder.</v>

1013
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Like mental disorders aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not neat little boxes.</v>

1014
00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:08.143
<v Speaker 1>It's not like someone has a fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning life but they have an </v>

1015
00:59:10.791 --> 00:59:13.100
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorder and then you bring them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1016
00:59:13.101 --> 00:59:16.130
<v Speaker 1>you treat the anxiety disorder and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to their fully functioning life.</v>

1017
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:17.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that at all.</v>

1018
00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.390
<v Speaker 1>The disorders tangled out into their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1019
00:59:20.391 --> 00:59:22.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're well usually your,</v>

1020
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.650
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your workplace isn't going very well and</v>

1021
00:59:24.651 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 1>your relationships with the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you are damaged and you know,</v>

1022
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you're connected in the actual world </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of these things.</v>

1023
00:59:31.791 --> 00:59:32.624
<v Speaker 1>And so when you come to see a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work on putting your life </v>

1024
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:37.094
<v Speaker 1>together in a sustainable manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's certainly not just removing </v>

1025
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.593
<v Speaker 1>the mental illness is very rare now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see someone who's </v>

1026
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:45.104
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose life is together and they're just </v>

1027
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:48.254
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's gone wrong probably </v>

1028
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:53.210
<v Speaker 1>biochemically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so with someone like that,</v>

1029
00:59:53.211 --> 00:59:55.310
<v Speaker 1>you can often give them an SSRI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1030
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't give them to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can recommend them,</v>

1031
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.440
<v Speaker 1>recommend they go see a doctor anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1032
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 1>that's sometimes just does the trick </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1033
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 1>their life is actually pretty good.</v>

1034
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>They just can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's bloody rare man.</v>

1035
01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>It's usually the case that someone comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sees you and things are in a serious</v>

1036
01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>state of chaos and all of that has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>addressed.</v>

1037
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And some of it's psychological and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it's just practical.</v>

1038
01:00:20.901 --> 01:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>It's embedded out there in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the behavior,</v>

1039
01:00:24.351 --> 01:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>psycho behavioral psychologists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly concerned about.</v>

1040
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

1041
01:00:29.481 --> 01:00:30.314
<v Speaker 1>especially the clinical end is </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on it necessarily predicated </v>

1042
01:00:34.701 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>on the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that we obtained the good,</v>

1043
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:38.833
<v Speaker 1>how do we aim at the good and what would</v>
<v Speaker 1>that be when my clients first come to </v>

1044
01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>see me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I often ask them is,</v>

1045
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:45.530
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's say you look a year ahead.</v>

1046
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we aiming at?</v>

1047
01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:48.973
<v Speaker 1>What would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would your life isn't the way you </v>

1048
01:00:50.181 --> 01:00:51.014
<v Speaker 1>want it to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would it look if it was the way you </v>

1049
01:00:53.181 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>wanted it to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least partly that way.</v>

1050
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>And we aim at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1051
01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>And we look for impediments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological impediments,</v>

1052
01:01:02.121 --> 01:01:04.310
<v Speaker 1>fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoidance strategies,</v>

1053
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.173
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we develop strategies and we try to </v>

1054
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>move towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say ideal.</v>

1055
01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.010
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand the categories</v>

1056
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.793
<v Speaker 1>of myth will say you have to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about the nature of </v>

1057
01:01:21.561 --> 01:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>categorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1058
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:24.643
<v Speaker 1>categorization is a tricky thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run through some </v>

1059
01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>complicated ideas relatively quickly.</v>

1060
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.123
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you put things in the same </v>

1061
01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:41.471
<v Speaker 1>category because they're similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is that first of all,</v>

1062
01:01:42.351 --> 01:01:43.184
<v Speaker 1>that's not an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a restatement of the initial </v>

1063
01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second of all,</v>

1064
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:50.083
<v Speaker 1>you can put things in the same category </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are by no means identical and you </v>

1065
01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>often do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And third,</v>

1066
01:01:55.431 --> 01:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>it's things are things that are similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>are often also importantly different.</v>

1067
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.640
<v Speaker 1>And so picking which element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarity,</v>

1068
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say you,</v>

1069
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.380
<v Speaker 1>if you have a group of books while are </v>
<v Speaker 1>they the same?</v>

1070
01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously no because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1071
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>unless they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:14.563
<v Speaker 1>all the same book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the category of books is a pretty </v>

1073
01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:18.554
<v Speaker 1>strange category because the content of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the books differs completely well and </v>

1074
01:02:21.211 --> 01:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>you could still make a group of books </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you pick some arbitrary element that</v>

1075
01:02:25.531 --> 01:02:29.430
<v Speaker 1>unites them and consider that grounds to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a category.</v>

1076
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.433
<v Speaker 1>There's other categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more scientific categories and </v>

1077
01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>scientific categories tend to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>contain things that are very,</v>

1078
01:02:37.981 --> 01:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>very similar in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Mo across multiple dimensions.</v>

1079
01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Like protons are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>

1080
01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that distinguishes one </v>
<v Speaker 1>proton from another.</v>

1081
01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>And the same with electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1082
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>the set of triangles is like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can define it precisely,</v>

1083
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:56.310
<v Speaker 1>but most of the categories that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings use aren't so neat.</v>

1084
01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.090
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>the categories are neat,</v>

1085
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:00.953
<v Speaker 1>like scientific categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to investigate them </v>

1086
01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:06.390
<v Speaker 1>scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1087
01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:10.530
<v Speaker 1>you might do research on a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people with anxiety disorders,</v>

1088
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:11.933
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorder category is so </v>

1089
01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:21.380
<v Speaker 1>heterogeneous that it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to identify the commonalities</v>

1090
01:03:23.401 --> 01:03:25.470
<v Speaker 1>across all the people who are in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

1091
01:03:25.471 --> 01:03:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because the category </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't actually a scientific category,</v>

1092
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:32.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a hybrid category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a practical category.</v>

1093
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example of that.</v>

1094
01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.113
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1095
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't because I must not have saved it</v>

1096
01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.280
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the dsm category,</v>

1097
01:04:00.281 --> 01:04:03.360
<v Speaker 1>so these are categories for </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology require.</v>

1098
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:04.463
<v Speaker 1>If you're part of that category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine there's seven symptoms that you </v>

1099
01:04:07.621 --> 01:04:08.454
<v Speaker 1>could have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or eight symptoms that you could have </v>

1100
01:04:09.571 --> 01:04:12.390
<v Speaker 1>that would put you in that category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like antisocial personality,</v>

1101
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.820
<v Speaker 1>eight symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You steal,</v>

1102
01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>you kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit,</v>

1103
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:18.300
<v Speaker 1>you bite you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're abusive.</v>

1104
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the category categories</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely,</v>

1105
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.493
<v Speaker 1>but you can be in the category if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have symptoms two through five and you </v>

1106
01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:28.110
<v Speaker 1>can be in the category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have symptoms six through eight,</v>

1107
01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.093
<v Speaker 1>they aren't the same symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're in the same category and you </v>

1108
01:04:31.741 --> 01:04:32.041
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1109
01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:33.840
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1110
01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:34.674
<v Speaker 1>that's a family resemblance category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and lots of the things </v>

1111
01:04:37.921 --> 01:04:40.020
<v Speaker 1>that we use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our family resemblance categories,</v>

1112
01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:40.854
<v Speaker 1>there's a prototype and then if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of the features of that </v>

1113
01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:44.964
<v Speaker 1>prototype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine the prototype has 10 features </v>

1114
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>and if you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six of those pro features,</v>

1115
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.533
<v Speaker 1>you get to be in that category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it means that the category is </v>

1116
01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>actually quite diverse and that's one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problems that plagues.</v>

1117
01:04:58.780 --> 01:04:59.613
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1118
01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:00.603
<v Speaker 1>Psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatry as a science and clinical </v>

1119
01:05:01.901 --> 01:05:05.470
<v Speaker 1>psychology is a science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really big problem because if the</v>

1120
01:05:05.471 --> 01:05:06.304
<v Speaker 1>categories aren't homogenous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's very difficult to draw </v>

1121
01:05:08.861 --> 01:05:09.694
<v Speaker 1>conclusions about the members of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>category and the psychologists and the </v>

1122
01:05:13.391 --> 01:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrists claim that those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific categories,</v>

1123
01:05:16.601 --> 01:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>

1124
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And they can't be partly because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>aimed at the classification of health or</v>

1125
01:05:22.811 --> 01:05:23.644
<v Speaker 1>ideal versus no unhealth or no an ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly because they play multiple </v>

1126
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:27.663
<v Speaker 1>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

1127
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean the category isn't there just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide neat demarcations for scientific</v>

1128
01:05:33.911 --> 01:05:34.744
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The categories there to give people a </v>

1129
01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>language to talk about certain sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>symptoms to diagnose.</v>

1130
01:05:42.191 --> 01:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Because you know when you come in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a set of symptoms,</v>

1131
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you might want to know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are so that you also know what</v>

1132
01:05:48.191 --> 01:05:49.024
<v Speaker 1>they aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a relief often to find a </v>

1133
01:05:51.731 --> 01:05:52.564
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the diagnosis has </v>

1134
01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:58.420
<v Speaker 1>certain implications for treatment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for billing and for all of that.</v>

1135
01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.580
<v Speaker 1>So the category has to play all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

1136
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>So there's multiple types of category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1137
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:05.703
<v Speaker 1>and the categories that we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in relationship to mythology </v>

1138
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:10.263
<v Speaker 1>aren't scientific categories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their categories about the world </v>

1139
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.880
<v Speaker 1>construed as a place to act.</v>

1140
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:18.843
<v Speaker 1>So here's the way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always looking at the world </v>

1141
01:06:23.471 --> 01:06:24.304
<v Speaker 1>through a framework of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to do that because there </v>

1142
01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:31.180
<v Speaker 1>isn't very much of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see the whole world at once.</v>

1143
01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And in fact the amount of the world you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually see is so small,</v>

1144
01:06:34.571 --> 01:06:35.404
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The central part of your vision is </v>

1145
01:06:37.241 --> 01:06:38.074
<v Speaker 1>zipping around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing a pretty high resolution </v>

1146
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:42.160
<v Speaker 1>representation of exactly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at.</v>

1147
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:46.330
<v Speaker 1>But outside of that center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I look at you,</v>

1148
01:06:46.331 --> 01:06:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't see her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see her glasses,</v>

1149
01:06:49.331 --> 01:06:53.890
<v Speaker 1>but barely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even tell whether you're male or</v>

1150
01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:57.490
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person passed that.</v>

1151
01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I can't see it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't notice that.</v>

1152
01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:01.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't notice that you're that blind </v>

1153
01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:04.084
<v Speaker 1>because your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your central vision is always popping </v>

1154
01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:09.910
<v Speaker 1>around illuminating that tiny space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're Sudan blind.</v>

1155
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:10.743
<v Speaker 1>It's just mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure some of you have seen the </v>

1156
01:07:13.121 --> 01:07:15.610
<v Speaker 1>invisible gorilla video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1157
01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:16.444
<v Speaker 1>wear a gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes into the video and you don't </v>

1158
01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:20.554
<v Speaker 1>notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is somewhat shocking because you </v>

1159
01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:24.010
<v Speaker 1>would think that you had noticed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla.</v>

1160
01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:25.053
<v Speaker 1>But what happens is that you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't notice something unless it </v>

1161
01:07:28.121 --> 01:07:32.020
<v Speaker 1>interferes with what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because what are you going to do?</v>

1162
01:07:32.021 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Notice everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

1163
01:07:34.961 --> 01:07:35.794
<v Speaker 1>You can hardly notice anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you do is you pick something to </v>

1164
01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:38.344
<v Speaker 1>focus on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually something that you value </v>

1165
01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:40.564
<v Speaker 1>because why else would you focus on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means that your value system </v>

1166
01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:46.870
<v Speaker 1>determines the direction of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception.</v>

1167
01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Bloody well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that for a minute.</v>

1168
01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 1>That's a Buddhist idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1169
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:53.463
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people live in a kind of illusion and </v>

1170
01:07:56.171 --> 01:07:59.200
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that illusion causes suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can transform the way they look</v>

1171
01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:01.450
<v Speaker 1>at the world and that can release them </v>
<v Speaker 1>from their suffering.</v>

1172
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.210
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you do live in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion,</v>

1173
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:05.463
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's exactly an </v>

1174
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:06.934
<v Speaker 1>illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you certainly do live within a </v>

1175
01:08:09.731 --> 01:08:13.210
<v Speaker 1>framework of perception that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined by your values.</v>

1176
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Now that is so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1177
01:08:15.411 --> 01:08:16.244
<v Speaker 1>because we never think of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that reveals itself through </v>

1178
01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:19.844
<v Speaker 1>our values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course it of course it does </v>

1179
01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>because you look at what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you aim at what you want,</v>

1180
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>and once you've aimed the world lays </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself out for you and that,</v>

1181
01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly how perception works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why represented at this way.</v>

1182
01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.470
<v Speaker 1>You're always somewhere that's point a </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that somewhere in some place in some</v>

1183
01:08:39.471 --> 01:08:40.304
<v Speaker 1>time and you're always have some notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what you want to have have </v>

1184
01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:44.534
<v Speaker 1>happened next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're going to go to the next </v>

1185
01:08:46.641 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've got a plan after this.</v>

1186
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>In this class you have a plan.</v>

1187
01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 1>You're hoping to learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume,</v>

1188
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:57.170
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you have a goal with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a grade and that's nested inside your</v>

1189
01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.490
<v Speaker 1>desire to get a degree and that's nested</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside your desire to be educated and to</v>

1190
01:09:01.491 --> 01:09:02.740
<v Speaker 1>have a career and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1191
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a successful life.</v>

1192
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.923
<v Speaker 1>So attending to me at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you're doing that is because </v>

1193
01:09:10.311 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 1>all of those values exist within you </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously focusing your attention.</v>

1194
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:19.100
<v Speaker 1>And so you're attending to me and not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

1195
01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:23.360
<v Speaker 1>assuming that all of you with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Computers Open Aren't surfing the web,</v>

1196
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:24.403
<v Speaker 1>which you might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but assuming that you're focusing w </v>

1197
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.490
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're focusing on is directed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by what you value.</v>

1198
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And some of that can be unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1199
01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:35.504
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it is unconscious because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it's very difficult for you to get </v>

1200
01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:39.800
<v Speaker 1>control of what you pay attention to.</v>

1201
01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to study.</v>

1202
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:46.040
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a boring paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ your attention.</v>

1203
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:47.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just like everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1204
01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll vacuum under the band </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of doing the paper,</v>

1205
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:51.920
<v Speaker 1>reading the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1206
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.293
<v Speaker 1>you can't get grip on that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your attention has an autonomy and </v>

1207
01:09:57.021 --> 01:09:58.940
<v Speaker 1>that's another psychoanalytic idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1208
01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:00.170
<v Speaker 1>because you kind of think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1209
01:10:00.171 --> 01:10:01.004
<v Speaker 1>you're in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like really ever try telling </v>

1210
01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:05.840
<v Speaker 1>yourself what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the,</v>

1211
01:10:05.841 --> 01:10:09.110
<v Speaker 1>how does that work for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the gym three times a</v>

1212
01:10:09.111 --> 01:10:10.550
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1213
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:11.413
<v Speaker 1>Sure you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to quit eating sugar for a </v>

1214
01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:18.010
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how long does that last?</v>

1215
01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:18.844
<v Speaker 1>It's like 50 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're eating like three chocolate </v>

1216
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:23.570
<v Speaker 1>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>

1217
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:25.670
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is Freud central insight.</v>

1218
01:10:25.671 --> 01:10:30.671
<v Speaker 1>I would say you're an autonomous group </v>
<v Speaker 1>of spiritual agents,</v>

1219
01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:34.850
<v Speaker 1>let's say personalities and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really get along very well.</v>

1220
01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.013
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ego will say is by no means </v>

1221
01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:40.574
<v Speaker 1>necessarily in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very strange thing to </v>

1222
01:10:43.221 --> 01:10:44.054
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can really realize that by </v>

1223
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.530
<v Speaker 1>noticing how little control you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>over your attentional focus.</v>

1224
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got your point a,</v>

1225
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:54.770
<v Speaker 1>you're going to point b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always doing that.</v>

1226
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.633
<v Speaker 1>You inhabit a structure of value and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes what the point is and what the </v>

1227
01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.670
<v Speaker 1>point B is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the structure itself doesn't change.</v>

1228
01:11:01.671 --> 01:11:05.180
<v Speaker 1>And when you're looking at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see is not objects.</v>

1229
01:11:05.190 --> 01:11:06.023
<v Speaker 1>You see tools and they make you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things that facilitate </v>

1230
01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:12.350
<v Speaker 1>your movement forward and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles and those are things that make</v>

1231
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you encounter an obstacle,</v>

1232
01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.493
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems is as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to where you're going and </v>

1233
01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:19.584
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other problem is if you </v>

1234
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:23.970
<v Speaker 1>encounter an obstacle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frame might be wrong,</v>

1235
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:24.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1236
01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:25.553
<v Speaker 1>Because you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be just something that you </v>

1237
01:11:26.701 --> 01:11:27.534
<v Speaker 1>could detour around real easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a fatal flaw in your whole </v>

1238
01:11:30.061 --> 01:11:34.140
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so obstacles have this dual nature,</v>

1239
01:11:34.141 --> 01:11:34.974
<v Speaker 1>they get in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can also take your plan down </v>

1240
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:41.190
<v Speaker 1>and so they can produce anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my point is this,</v>

1241
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.353
<v Speaker 1>there's a book called a visual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ecological approach to visual </v>

1242
01:11:45.610 --> 01:11:47.070
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great book,</v>

1243
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:49.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Gibson,</v>

1244
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Jj Gibson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

1245
01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:57.770
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I thought of this a while back,</v>

1246
01:11:57.931 --> 01:12:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I realized eventually that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variant of his theory.</v>

1247
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:03.900
<v Speaker 1>And what he believed was that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people looked at the world,</v>

1248
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:08.220
<v Speaker 1>they saw a value first and inferred </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects second.</v>

1249
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:09.840
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Gibson,</v>

1250
01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.050
<v Speaker 1>if you're standing by a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a cliff.</v>

1251
01:12:13.051 --> 01:12:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And then think about the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might fall and then feel frightened.</v>

1252
01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:18.653
<v Speaker 1>You see a falling off place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the seeing of that part of </v>

1253
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:22.764
<v Speaker 1>the act of seeing is being afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because your eyes are connected </v>

1254
01:12:25.711 --> 01:12:26.544
<v Speaker 1>right to your emotional systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of what your eyes do is tell </v>

1255
01:12:29.701 --> 01:12:30.534
<v Speaker 1>you what the object is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your eyes do all sorts of other </v>

1256
01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:34.470
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they prepare you for action,</v>

1257
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 1>they prepare you for gripping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they prepare you for emotion.</v>

1258
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and none of that actually requires the,</v>

1259
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:46.020
<v Speaker 1>the existence necessarily the existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your perception of the object.</v>

1260
01:12:46.021 --> 01:12:49.320
<v Speaker 1>So there aren't people who have blind </v>
<v Speaker 1>sight and if you show them,</v>

1261
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 1>so they think they can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you flash them an angry face,</v>

1262
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:54.900
<v Speaker 1>they'll show a skin conductance </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

1263
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the visual pathways </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Amygdala,</v>

1264
01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 1>which does face Emoji,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facial emotional processing,</v>

1265
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.333
<v Speaker 1>can still be active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are people who have usually had a </v>

1266
01:13:03.721 --> 01:13:05.130
<v Speaker 1>stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so their eyes are okay,</v>

1267
01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.110
<v Speaker 1>but they've destroyed the visual cortex.</v>

1268
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

1269
01:13:10.921 --> 01:13:13.920
<v Speaker 1>it's perfectly plausible that at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>at one level of analysis,</v>

1270
01:13:13.921 --> 01:13:17.250
<v Speaker 1>when you look at something you see it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility first.</v>

1271
01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:20.670
<v Speaker 1>So you see a chair and you might say a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chair is an object,</v>

1272
01:13:20.671 --> 01:13:21.504
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't say that beanbags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chair and a stump is a chair and they </v>

1273
01:13:25.621 --> 01:13:28.200
<v Speaker 1>don't share much in common except that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sit on them.</v>

1274
01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:29.363
<v Speaker 1>And so you know the chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chairs basically conceptualized by </v>

1275
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:36.090
<v Speaker 1>its functional utility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at a chair,</v>

1276
01:13:36.091 --> 01:13:36.924
<v Speaker 1>what you perceive it's is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional utility and the chair tells </v>

1277
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:41.040
<v Speaker 1>you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

1278
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:42.260
<v Speaker 1>sit on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>

1279
01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:43.283
<v Speaker 1>and there are people who have prefrontal</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage and they engage in something </v>

1280
01:13:46.231 --> 01:13:47.064
<v Speaker 1>called utilization behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they're walking down a hallway </v>

1281
01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:52.140
<v Speaker 1>and there's this door open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to walk through it.</v>

1282
01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.350
<v Speaker 1>They can't not do what the object tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to do.</v>

1283
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:59.910
<v Speaker 1>That's called utilization behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how the world is laid out.</v>

1284
01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And I would say inside that domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the predictable world.</v>

1285
01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.470
<v Speaker 1>You're in the world that you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1286
01:14:07.471 --> 01:14:10.890
<v Speaker 1>that you know and that if you hit an </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle or if you're outside,</v>

1287
01:14:10.891 --> 01:14:13.780
<v Speaker 1>that you're in the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in unknown territory.</v>

1288
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.200
<v Speaker 1>In the mythological world and the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>for action,</v>

1289
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:23.410
<v Speaker 1>you could conceptualize the world as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage for action.</v>

1290
01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And this is a shakespearian quote that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of sums it up quite nicely.</v>

1291
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:34.230
<v Speaker 1>All the world is a stage and all the men</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women,</v>

1292
01:14:34.231 --> 01:14:35.064
<v Speaker 1>merely players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their exits and their </v>

1293
01:14:37.591 --> 01:14:40.380
<v Speaker 1>entrances and one man in his time plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>many parts.</v>

1294
01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.440
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well is that really true?</v>

1295
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1296
01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:48.270
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by true and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1297
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.193
<v Speaker 1>and that really is the answer because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different ways of defining </v>

1298
01:14:51.751 --> 01:14:53.790
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1299
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:58.783
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't self evident that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>only one way of defining true that's </v>

1300
01:15:02.361 --> 01:15:03.650
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1301
01:15:03.651 --> 01:15:06.530
<v Speaker 1>the definition of truth might be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tool.</v>

1302
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:08.150
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1303
01:15:08.151 --> 01:15:08.984
<v Speaker 1>our tool using creatures and really what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to do with our conceptions </v>

1304
01:15:11.451 --> 01:15:14.870
<v Speaker 1>of truth is to work through the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully.</v>

1305
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:20.590
<v Speaker 1>So even science is subordinate should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate to our use of the world as a</v>

1306
01:15:21.111 --> 01:15:23.390
<v Speaker 1>tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it isn't useful tool,</v>

1307
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:25.940
<v Speaker 1>like what are we doing with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1308
01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:29.030
<v Speaker 1>just generating technology that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy the world,</v>

1309
01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1310
01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:34.873
<v Speaker 1>so I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the world as tool is actually the </v>

1311
01:15:36.891 --> 01:15:37.724
<v Speaker 1>fundamental sort of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's a Darwinian </v>

1312
01:15:40.371 --> 01:15:41.330
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1313
01:15:41.331 --> 01:15:42.164
<v Speaker 1>That our notions about the world have </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved through a Darwinian process and </v>

1314
01:15:46.491 --> 01:15:51.491
<v Speaker 1>that it's appropriate for us to regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>as what is most real.</v>

1315
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:54.283
<v Speaker 1>Those things that reliably ensure are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the continuation of our life and the </v>

1316
01:16:00.861 --> 01:16:05.030
<v Speaker 1>probability of our propagation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a true Darwinian,</v>

1317
01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a way out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

1318
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:13.300
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't self evident by any stretch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the imagination that seeing the world</v>

1319
01:16:14.271 --> 01:16:18.680
<v Speaker 1>as our as objects is the way that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain works.</v>

1320
01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.753
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the way it works at </v>

1321
01:16:20.661 --> 01:16:23.720
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's why we're so</v>

1322
01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:29.930
<v Speaker 1>wired for stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1323
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:31.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1324
01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:35.780
<v Speaker 1>like you won't line up for two hours to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go see a lecturer,</v>

1325
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.903
<v Speaker 1>but you'll line up for two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll even camp overnight if </v>

1326
01:16:39.981 --> 01:16:44.360
<v Speaker 1>you're mythological imagination has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>seized for God only knows what reason by</v>

1327
01:16:44.361 --> 01:16:45.194
<v Speaker 1>star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that's a source of </v>

1328
01:16:48.261 --> 01:16:49.094
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the mythology of the modern person </v>

1329
01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:55.340
<v Speaker 1>and it fills a gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why people do it.</v>

1330
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:58.423
<v Speaker 1>So that to me speaks of Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manner in which our psyches are </v>

1331
01:17:03.111 --> 01:17:05.870
<v Speaker 1>constructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a union idea.</v>

1332
01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:08.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea of the archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>

1333
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:13.030
<v Speaker 1>that to be human is to participate in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain pattern of being.</v>

1334
01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:18.070
<v Speaker 1>And that that pattern of being is acted </v>
<v Speaker 1>out socially.</v>

1335
01:17:18.071 --> 01:17:21.820
<v Speaker 1>It talked about individually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also part of your structure.</v>

1336
01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:22.953
<v Speaker 1>Even your perceptual structure as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a living organism of your particular </v>

1337
01:17:27.941 --> 01:17:28.774
<v Speaker 1>type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it would be the case at least in </v>

1338
01:17:31.121 --> 01:17:31.954
<v Speaker 1>part that the hero myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is go out where no one has gone </v>

1339
01:17:35.111 --> 01:17:39.810
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>face the terrors of the unknown,</v>

1340
01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>gather something of value and return is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the central story of humankind.</v>

1341
01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only central story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1342
01:17:50.010 --> 01:17:50.843
<v Speaker 1>it's up there in the top three and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dramas that you engage yourself </v>

1343
01:17:56.131 --> 01:17:56.964
<v Speaker 1>in are variations of that story and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it over and over and over because </v>

1344
01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:07.290
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to learn how to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you need to do live.</v>

1345
01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

1346
01:18:15.351 --> 01:18:16.184
<v Speaker 1>here's an idea.</v>

1347
01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 1>What's common among people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1348
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:24.013
<v Speaker 1>we're self conscious so we know of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own existence and we knew of our own </v>

1349
01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:28.634
<v Speaker 1>limitations and so that means that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a certain innate terror and </v>

1350
01:18:33.831 --> 01:18:35.310
<v Speaker 1>fragility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

1351
01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:37.790
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our existence is a problem to us.</v>

1352
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:39.103
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense what we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do when we search for meaning is to </v>

1353
01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:44.510
<v Speaker 1>search for a solution to that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can be security,</v>

1354
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.420
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be motive being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1355
01:18:47.421 --> 01:18:48.254
<v Speaker 1>and so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being engaged in something worthwhile </v>

1356
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:53.630
<v Speaker 1>seems to be a good medicine for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragile,</v>

1357
01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:54.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think,</v>

1358
01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:56.570
<v Speaker 1>well I'm doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems worthwhile.</v>

1359
01:18:56.571 --> 01:18:57.404
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that there's a price to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid for it and that things could be </v>

1360
01:19:00.141 --> 01:19:00.974
<v Speaker 1>following me that aren't good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to put up with that because </v>

1361
01:19:02.991 --> 01:19:03.824
<v Speaker 1>what I'm engaged in seems to be of </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate of sufficient significance </v>

1362
01:19:07.071 --> 01:19:07.904
<v Speaker 1>to justify all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all become self conscious and we're </v>

1363
01:19:11.661 --> 01:19:14.660
<v Speaker 1>all trying to do something about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to deal with it.</v>

1364
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:18.833
<v Speaker 1>So there's a landscape that we inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say within which that takes </v>

1365
01:19:22.951 --> 01:19:24.270
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a human being,</v>

1366
01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:29.420
<v Speaker 1>self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d doom to tragedy and doomed to be aware</v>

1367
01:19:29.911 --> 01:19:30.744
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human being has two elements and </v>

1368
01:19:32.821 --> 01:19:33.654
<v Speaker 1>that's the element that seeks the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's the other element that </v>

1369
01:19:35.551 --> 01:19:36.900
<v Speaker 1>seeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say</v>

1370
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:41.700
<v Speaker 1>revenge and destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have our reasons.</v>

1371
01:19:41.701 --> 01:19:42.534
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something tragic happens to you and </v>

1372
01:19:43.951 --> 01:19:46.800
<v Speaker 1>it's tragic and unfair and it really </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings you low,</v>

1373
01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.083
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become resentful and want revenge is </v>

1374
01:19:51.001 --> 01:19:53.640
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily high and no wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1375
01:19:53.641 --> 01:19:56.940
<v Speaker 1>the architectural representation of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is evil itself.</v>

1376
01:19:56.941 --> 01:20:01.200
<v Speaker 1>And the architectural representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good that you could do is,</v>

1377
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:05.310
<v Speaker 1>is the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those things inhabit us.</v>

1378
01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>They're permanent elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>

1379
01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And then what else is universal to us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1380
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:15.540
<v Speaker 1>we live in a society you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's deep.</v>

1381
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.510
<v Speaker 1>That's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just human society.</v>

1382
01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Like we've lived in a society forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1383
01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:22.253
<v Speaker 1>lobsters live and dominance hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they use their serotonin system at </v>

1384
01:20:27.301 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 1>least in part to keep track of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant position.</v>

1385
01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:34.320
<v Speaker 1>And so you can use antidepressants on </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobsters when they get defeated and they</v>

1386
01:20:34.321 --> 01:20:36.570
<v Speaker 1>don't feel so bad from being defeated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fight.</v>

1387
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:37.793
<v Speaker 1>And so you just think about that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anti depressants do the same thing </v>

1388
01:20:40.111 --> 01:20:45.111
<v Speaker 1>to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so bloody social that the circuits</v>

1389
01:20:45.391 --> 01:20:48.450
<v Speaker 1>that evolved 300 million years ago when</v>

1390
01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.793
<v Speaker 1>the lobsters in us had a shared ancestor</v>
<v Speaker 1>are still operating at the base of your </v>

1391
01:20:55.541 --> 01:20:56.374
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why status is so important to </v>

1392
01:20:57.761 --> 01:20:58.594
<v Speaker 1>people and reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that serotonin system governs </v>

1393
01:21:01.661 --> 01:21:02.494
<v Speaker 1>your emotional regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how people respond to you and what they </v>

1394
01:21:04.931 --> 01:21:06.580
<v Speaker 1>think of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man that matters.</v>

1395
01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.900
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're on facebook all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and checking your texts and,</v>

1396
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:11.083
<v Speaker 1>and obsessing continually about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>online presence as soon assuming that </v>

1397
01:21:14.621 --> 01:21:18.190
<v Speaker 1>you're doing that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contacting people frantically and seeing</v>

1398
01:21:18.191 --> 01:21:20.560
<v Speaker 1>what the updates are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like where,</v>

1399
01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.633
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you held in the esteem of </v>

1400
01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:24.190
<v Speaker 1>others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1401
01:21:24.191 --> 01:21:25.024
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because it determines your </v>

1402
01:21:26.621 --> 01:21:29.200
<v Speaker 1>emotional regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important.</v>

1403
01:21:29.201 --> 01:21:33.520
<v Speaker 1>So we exist in a society always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the society has two elements.</v>

1404
01:21:33.850 --> 01:21:37.420
<v Speaker 1>The tyrannical element of the society </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the tyrannical king,</v>

1405
01:21:37.421 --> 01:21:40.390
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very common mythological theme.</v>

1406
01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:42.310
<v Speaker 1>You see that in the lion king too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1407
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Cause that scar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1408
01:21:44.230 --> 01:21:48.700
<v Speaker 1>and of course you see it in the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>world with almost continually.</v>

1409
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:49.743
<v Speaker 1>And then the benevolent king who is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of all the good things about </v>

1410
01:21:53.351 --> 01:21:54.610
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1411
01:21:54.611 --> 01:21:56.590
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see these things play out as</v>

1412
01:21:56.591 --> 01:21:59.800
<v Speaker 1>mythologies in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in political terms.</v>

1413
01:21:59.801 --> 01:22:00.634
<v Speaker 1>So I would say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the continual harping about the </v>

1414
01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:07.720
<v Speaker 1>oppressive nature of the Patriarchy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a myth.</v>

1415
01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And the myth is that society is </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive.</v>

1416
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:12.041
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1417
01:22:12.041 --> 01:22:13.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

1418
01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to be quite a bit like </v>

1419
01:22:16.481 --> 01:22:17.314
<v Speaker 1>you and you have to be quite a bit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you even if you're not so that you can </v>

1420
01:22:20.231 --> 01:22:21.280
<v Speaker 1>get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1421
01:22:21.281 --> 01:22:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Everybody sacrifices a tremendous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their individuality to the common,</v>

1422
01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.920
<v Speaker 1>to the common motive being that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tyrannical element to that.</v>

1423
01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.210
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the same token,</v>

1424
01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:38.590
<v Speaker 1>it's the basis of cooperation and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stability of society.</v>

1425
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:39.783
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final element is how it's often </v>

1426
01:22:42.551 --> 01:22:43.320
<v Speaker 1>represented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matt,</v>

1427
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.830
<v Speaker 1>in a masculine manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1428
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:45.783
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because our primary </v>

1429
01:22:47.801 --> 01:22:48.634
<v Speaker 1>dorman structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the creatures we are like </v>

1430
01:22:51.161 --> 01:22:51.994
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the primary structures of dominance are </v>

1431
01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:55.803
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then outside of what's known is the </v>

1432
01:22:58.961 --> 01:22:59.794
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

1433
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:05.083
<v Speaker 5>And we always have to contend with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's wonderful in that it's the </v>

1434
01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:09.484
<v Speaker 5>source of all new things and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible in that it's the place where </v>

1435
01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:14.890
<v Speaker 5>all the things that destabilize you come</v>
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>

1436
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.270
<v Speaker 5>And so this is a good representation or </v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1437
01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:22.600
<v Speaker 5>not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the feminine</v>

1438
01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:25.003
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the masculine order and that's </v>

1439
01:23:27.111 --> 01:23:32.000
<v Speaker 5>the individual who's destined to suffer </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the grasp of those two things.</v>

1440
01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:33.453
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

1441
01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:45.960
<v Speaker 5>I'll finish this next time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What have we got here?</v>

1442
01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.500
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

1443
01:23:50.190 --> 01:23:52.980
<v Speaker 5>good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll see you next time.</v>

1444
01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:59.310
<v Speaker 5>So today to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to finish</v>

1445
01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.040
<v Speaker 5>the last lecture and then with any luck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to start the next one.</v>

1446
01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:07.860
<v Speaker 5>They're thematically linked anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you know what?</v>

1447
01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:11.700
<v Speaker 5>All the lectures for the next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well for the whole course,</v>

1448
01:24:11.701 --> 01:24:14.250
<v Speaker 5>hopefully we'll be thematically late to </v>
<v Speaker 5>some degree.</v>

1449
01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:15.593
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>given that normally they're about the </v>

1450
01:24:17.191 --> 01:24:18.024
<v Speaker 5>same topic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some are more tightly linked than </v>

1451
01:24:19.801 --> 01:24:21.480
<v Speaker 5>others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

1452
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.903
<v Speaker 5>I started telling you</v>
<v Speaker 5>last week about this idea of the voyage </v>

1453
01:24:28.741 --> 01:24:29.574
<v Speaker 5>to the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I wanted to tell you a little bit </v>

1454
01:24:33.571 --> 01:24:34.404
<v Speaker 5>more about that.</v>

1455
01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:37.653
<v Speaker 5>You in particular conceptualize the </v>
<v Speaker 5>voyage to the underworld as a journey </v>

1456
01:24:42.181 --> 01:24:43.014
<v Speaker 5>into the unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the unconscious for the </v>

1457
01:24:46.351 --> 01:24:47.184
<v Speaker 5>psychoanalyst is a place of fantasy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>dream and implicit presupposition and </v>

1458
01:24:53.821 --> 01:24:55.410
<v Speaker 5>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's all correct.</v>

1459
01:24:55.411 --> 01:24:56.070
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1460
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.903
<v Speaker 5>there is an unconscious and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's perfectly reasonable to </v>

1461
01:25:00.961 --> 01:25:01.794
<v Speaker 5>conceptualize it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the big difference I think between </v>

1462
01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:04.464
<v Speaker 5>the psychoanalysts and the later more </v>
<v Speaker 5>empirical scientists is that the </v>

1463
01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.233
<v Speaker 5>psychoanalysts sort of envisioned your </v>
<v Speaker 5>psyche as a place of living partial </v>

1464
01:25:19.411 --> 01:25:24.411
<v Speaker 5>personalities instead of cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>computational systems.</v>

1465
01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.553
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they took into account the fact </v>

1466
01:25:28.681 --> 01:25:33.030
<v Speaker 5>that you're alive and that the parts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>you are alive.</v>

1467
01:25:33.031 --> 01:25:34.110
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1468
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.200
<v Speaker 5>there's a neuroscientist named Zack </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>

1469
01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:40.200
<v Speaker 5>nick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to say his name.</v>

1470
01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:42.720
<v Speaker 5>Gaza Nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's wrong.</v>

1471
01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.550
<v Speaker 5>Is that cause I had to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1472
01:25:44.551 --> 01:25:46.230
<v Speaker 5>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

1473
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:49.410
<v Speaker 5>he did some of the earliest experiments </v>
<v Speaker 5>on split brains.</v>

1474
01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:52.410
<v Speaker 5>And so sometimes if you have intractable</v>
<v Speaker 5>epilepsy,</v>

1475
01:25:52.411 --> 01:25:54.850
<v Speaker 5>which I wouldn't recommend by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1476
01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:56.813
<v Speaker 5>one of the surgical procedures for </v>
<v Speaker 5>mediating its negative effects is </v>

1477
01:26:01.021 --> 01:26:01.854
<v Speaker 5>something called a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you cut the corpus callosum and it's </v>

1478
01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.533
<v Speaker 5>very large,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very large structure in the brain that </v>

1479
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:11.620
<v Speaker 5>connects the two separate hemispheres.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1480
01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:13.880
<v Speaker 5>it's not obvious why we have two </v>
<v Speaker 5>separate hemispheres,</v>

1481
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 5>although I'll tell you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>about why I think it is.</v>

1482
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:19.940
<v Speaker 5>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do communicate and Uhh,</v>

1483
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.360
<v Speaker 5>what Kazana Gha</v>
<v Speaker 5>demonstrated was that you could tell one</v>

1484
01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:29.630
<v Speaker 5>hemisphere something without the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>one knowing</v>

1485
01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:31.993
<v Speaker 5>that both hemispheres we're conscious </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that the consciousness was somewhat </v>

1486
01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:37.730
<v Speaker 5>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really strange.</v>

1487
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.100
<v Speaker 5>It's very interest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Makes very interesting readings,</v>

1488
01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:41.570
<v Speaker 5>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1489
01:26:41.571 --> 01:26:45.350
<v Speaker 5>because it suggests that fragments of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves,</v>

1490
01:26:45.351 --> 01:26:46.184
<v Speaker 5>you can think of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have fragments of yourself within </v>

1491
01:26:48.081 --> 01:26:50.920
<v Speaker 5>you that are like low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 5>representations of you,</v>

1492
01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:51.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

1493
01:26:51.981 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 5>and the psychoanalysts would think of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those more as they're kind of like,</v>

1494
01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:56.900
<v Speaker 5>they're kind of like one I giants.</v>

1495
01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:57.733
<v Speaker 5>That might be a way of thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you were thinking about it in a </v>

1496
01:26:59.361 --> 01:27:00.194
<v Speaker 5>fantastical way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's the angry you and you know </v>

1497
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.550
<v Speaker 5>you've all come in contact with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>angry you.</v>

1498
01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:08.773
<v Speaker 5>It's a rather rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the first thing you might say </v>

1499
01:27:10.821 --> 01:27:13.340
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's impulsive and short term.</v>

1500
01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:14.413
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't think much about the past </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless it's bad things about whoever </v>

1501
01:27:18.261 --> 01:27:19.094
<v Speaker 5>you're angry at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in which case it thinks about them a </v>

1502
01:27:20.871 --> 01:27:21.704
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not too concerned with longterm </v>

1503
01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:27.260
<v Speaker 5>future consequences and mostly at wants </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be right.</v>

1504
01:27:28.730 --> 01:27:29.563
<v Speaker 5>And you know when angry you disappears </v>
<v Speaker 5>and normal you assuming such a thing </v>

1505
01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:37.340
<v Speaker 5>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reappears,</v>

1506
01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:41.750
<v Speaker 5>you can be perfectly shocked about how </v>
<v Speaker 5>angry you behaved.</v>

1507
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:47.500
<v Speaker 5>And in fact sometimes if angry you </v>
<v Speaker 5>really gets out of hand like it might in</v>

1508
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:49.064
<v Speaker 5>a battle and a war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might do things that you just can't </v>

1509
01:27:52.881 --> 01:27:54.200
<v Speaker 5>imagine you would do.</v>

1510
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:55.603
<v Speaker 5>And under those circumstances you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>reveal parts of yourself to yourself </v>

1511
01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:01.543
<v Speaker 5>that are so foreign and so horrifying </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it will leave you with post </v>

1512
01:28:08.271 --> 01:28:11.960
<v Speaker 5>traumatic stress disorder because it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the case that</v>

1513
01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:14.353
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not all people who suffer from post </v>

1514
01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:21.050
<v Speaker 5>traumatic stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if it's battlefield related,</v>

1515
01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:22.753
<v Speaker 5>get it because of something they did </v>
<v Speaker 5>rather than something they saw or </v>

1516
01:28:26.121 --> 01:28:29.870
<v Speaker 5>something that happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's really worth thinking about.</v>

1517
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:30.763
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of weird potential </v>

1518
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:33.374
<v Speaker 5>nested inside people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't see it under normal </v>

1519
01:28:35.841 --> 01:28:38.180
<v Speaker 5>circumstances because the circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 5>are normal.</v>

1520
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.823
<v Speaker 5>And part of the reason that we liked the</v>
<v Speaker 5>circumstances to be normal is precisely </v>

1521
01:28:45.651 --> 01:28:50.090
<v Speaker 5>so that we don't see those parts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people we don't want to see.</v>

1522
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:54.080
<v Speaker 5>And that's really worth knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really worth knowing because</v>

1523
01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:56.563
<v Speaker 5>that's why people are so identified with</v>
<v Speaker 5>their culture and why they need a </v>

1524
01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:00.950
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>

1525
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:01.783
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the terror management theorists </v>

1526
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:03.743
<v Speaker 5>types,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they kind of think of culture as a </v>

1527
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:09.030
<v Speaker 5>mechanism that inhibits anxiety and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about it psychologically.</v>

1528
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.670
<v Speaker 5>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's something inside your,</v>

1529
01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:11.730
<v Speaker 5>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say.</v>

1530
01:29:12.170 --> 01:29:15.390
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it gives meaning to events and stops</v>

1531
01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 5>you from collapsing into chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 5>protects you from death anxiety.</v>

1532
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 5>But</v>
<v Speaker 5>that isn't,</v>

1533
01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:24.660
<v Speaker 5>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of right.</v>

1534
01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:26.633
<v Speaker 5>But that isn't what your culture is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your culture is a set of value Laden </v>

1535
01:29:30.001 --> 01:29:35.001
<v Speaker 5>presuppositions that you orient yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the world that match the set of Value</v>

1536
01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:42.600
<v Speaker 5>Laden presuppositions that everyone in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your culture has and acts out.</v>

1537
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.733
<v Speaker 5>And so what that means is that when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe something and you're among your </v>

1538
01:29:47.161 --> 01:29:50.700
<v Speaker 5>own people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you believe something implicitly.</v>

1539
01:29:50.701 --> 01:29:53.070
<v Speaker 5>It's the way you look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the way you act things out.</v>

1540
01:29:53.071 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 5>You Act about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone expects you to act the belt.</v>

1541
01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.360
<v Speaker 5>They're happy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact.</v>

1542
01:29:57.361 --> 01:30:00.180
<v Speaker 5>So there's a match between what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>

1543
01:30:00.181 --> 01:30:03.180
<v Speaker 5>what you see and what you're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what other people expect.</v>

1544
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:06.150
<v Speaker 5>And it's that match that regulates your </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotions.</v>

1545
01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:09.570
<v Speaker 5>It's not the belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the match.</v>

1546
01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.273
<v Speaker 5>And so part of the reason that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>are so tied to their cultural identity </v>

1547
01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:20.660
<v Speaker 5>is because their cultural identity </v>
<v Speaker 5>regulates their emotions.</v>

1548
01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.390
<v Speaker 5>And in a profound way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this is no joke.</v>

1549
01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:25.253
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1550
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:30.410
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that stabilizes human </v>
<v Speaker 5>nervous systems is imagine that you have</v>

1551
01:30:31.861 --> 01:30:34.620
<v Speaker 5>a domain of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's many domains of competence.</v>

1552
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.500
<v Speaker 5>Of course in some of those domains </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're completely incompetent,</v>

1553
01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:40.560
<v Speaker 5>but they met me not matter because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't go into that domain.</v>

1554
01:30:40.561 --> 01:30:41.394
<v Speaker 5>So you have some area of specialization </v>
<v Speaker 5>which you might think of as your </v>

1555
01:30:44.150 --> 01:30:45.600
<v Speaker 5>subtribe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1556
01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:46.523
<v Speaker 5>your university students.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so some of you are lower status by </v>

1557
01:30:49.651 --> 01:30:50.484
<v Speaker 5>the rules of the university game and </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of you are higher status by the </v>

1558
01:30:53.911 --> 01:30:56.130
<v Speaker 5>rules of the university game by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribe.</v>

1559
01:30:56.130 --> 01:30:58.740
<v Speaker 5>And so the higher status people tend to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be the ones who,</v>

1560
01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.770
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fit into the academic environment,</v>

1561
01:31:01.771 --> 01:31:02.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1562
01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:07.500
<v Speaker 5>and find it conducive to their mode of </v>
<v Speaker 5>being and all who also do well and their</v>

1563
01:31:08.521 --> 01:31:11.520
<v Speaker 5>serotonin levels rise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1564
01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:16.640
<v Speaker 5>the neurochemicals that moderate mood </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly are serotonergic.</v>

1565
01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:20.460
<v Speaker 5>It's Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's lots of other things.</v>

1566
01:31:20.461 --> 01:31:22.560
<v Speaker 5>It's an over simplification.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that'll do for now.</v>

1567
01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.460
<v Speaker 5>As you become dominant in a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your serotonin levels rise.</v>

1568
01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:31.980
<v Speaker 5>And what that means is that happy things</v>
<v Speaker 5>make you happier and sad things make you</v>

1569
01:31:31.981 --> 01:31:34.380
<v Speaker 5>less sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It tunes your nervous system.</v>

1570
01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:37.560
<v Speaker 5>So if you're down at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy and you're failing,</v>

1571
01:31:37.561 --> 01:31:38.394
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1572
01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:42.870
<v Speaker 5>hardly anything makes you happy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything makes you nervous and it's no</v>

1573
01:31:42.871 --> 01:31:45.540
<v Speaker 5>wonder because it's just not very good </v>
<v Speaker 5>down there.</v>

1574
01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.240
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1575
01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.233
<v Speaker 5>the societal structure which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is an elaborated dominance </v>

1576
01:31:52.861 --> 01:31:53.694
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regulates your emotions because of the </v>

1577
01:31:57.181 --> 01:31:58.014
<v Speaker 5>match between your expectations and </v>
<v Speaker 5>behaviors of the people within that </v>

1578
01:32:00.611 --> 01:32:01.444
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>

1579
01:32:01.570 --> 01:32:05.890
<v Speaker 5>And then your position within the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy regulates the rate ratio.</v>

1580
01:32:05.891 --> 01:32:08.860
<v Speaker 5>Let's say I'm the intensity between </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive and negative emotion.</v>

1581
01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:14.100
<v Speaker 5>So you mass with people's status at your</v>
<v Speaker 5>peril and you disrupt their culture.</v>

1582
01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.640
<v Speaker 5>They don't like that and no wonder </v>
<v Speaker 5>because when it's disrupted,</v>

1583
01:32:20.921 --> 01:32:23.830
<v Speaker 5>they fall into chaos and chaos isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>just anxiety.</v>

1584
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:25.263
<v Speaker 5>My anxiety is bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not just anxiety because when </v>

1585
01:32:28.661 --> 01:32:31.240
<v Speaker 5>you fall into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when things fall apart for you,</v>

1586
01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:34.173
<v Speaker 5>of course you're uncertain and anxious </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you don't know what the hell is </v>

1587
01:32:37.211 --> 01:32:40.090
<v Speaker 5>going on and you don't know where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>are and you don't know what to do.</v>

1588
01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:44.110
<v Speaker 5>That's anxiety provoking and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't even understand your past properly</v>

1589
01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:44.710
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

1590
01:32:44.710 --> 01:32:46.750
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that happens when people get betrayed,</v>

1591
01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.520
<v Speaker 5>and so you fall into this state where </v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing is certain.</v>

1592
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:54.250
<v Speaker 5>The way you construe the world isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain,</v>

1593
01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:55.503
<v Speaker 5>and even the way the world is is no </v>
<v Speaker 5>longer certain because you don't know </v>

1594
01:32:58.601 --> 01:33:01.420
<v Speaker 5>how to act or your actions aren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>working.</v>

1595
01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:04.870
<v Speaker 5>And so the world is presenting itself as</v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's chaotic.</v>

1596
01:33:04.930 --> 01:33:05.763
<v Speaker 5>It's not just psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The chaos is a weird intermingling of </v>

1597
01:33:09.671 --> 01:33:12.780
<v Speaker 5>the chaotic world and the chaotic self.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1598
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:14.530
<v Speaker 5>that's what happens when you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>unemployed.</v>

1599
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:18.790
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's devastating to people.</v>

1600
01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:20.291
<v Speaker 5>And if you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1601
01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:21.550
<v Speaker 5>that's psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1602
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:22.384
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1603
01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.613
<v Speaker 5>but they're unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes the world far more </v>

1604
01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:30.430
<v Speaker 5>incomprehensible and uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not just psychological,</v>

1605
01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:31.533
<v Speaker 5>it's psychological and that's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also real and that's even </v>

1606
01:33:34.661 --> 01:33:36.970
<v Speaker 5>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then those two things can spiral,</v>

1607
01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:37.923
<v Speaker 5>which they often do because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't set your expectations </v>

1608
01:33:42.161 --> 01:33:42.994
<v Speaker 5>properly for a job search and assume </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're going to get 49 rejections </v>

1609
01:33:47.561 --> 01:33:51.460
<v Speaker 5>for every interview,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you really need to know because if</v>

1610
01:33:51.461 --> 01:33:54.250
<v Speaker 5>you get 49 rejections,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not because you're useless.</v>

1611
01:33:54.251 --> 01:33:58.900
<v Speaker 5>It's because of the baseline for </v>
<v Speaker 5>rejection is 98% and that's okay because</v>

1612
01:33:58.901 --> 01:34:03.901
<v Speaker 5>the base rate for rejection for </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything is 98% no matter what you do.</v>

1613
01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:05.493
<v Speaker 5>But you need to know that so that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't feel that it's like something </v>

1614
01:34:07.601 --> 01:34:08.434
<v Speaker 5>wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course you only have to get it </v>

1615
01:34:10.451 --> 01:34:14.230
<v Speaker 5>right once that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you have a job that's a lottery,</v>

1616
01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.360
<v Speaker 5>but you have to set yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to think,</v>

1617
01:34:16.361 --> 01:34:17.830
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I'm going to look for a job,</v>

1618
01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.120
<v Speaker 5>I need to s how many resumes can I </v>
<v Speaker 5>tolerate sending out a day?</v>

1619
01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:23.573
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has to be enough so you don't feel </v>

1620
01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:25.024
<v Speaker 5>like a useless moron and it can't be so </v>
<v Speaker 5>many that you're overwhelmed by the </v>

1621
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.730
<v Speaker 5>burden.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1622
01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:33.490
<v Speaker 5>and I help people do this sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>

1623
01:34:33.491 --> 01:34:34.324
<v Speaker 5>So maybe you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you're going to send out 10 a day </v>

1624
01:34:37.121 --> 01:34:40.150
<v Speaker 5>and you're going to work two hours on it</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's going to take six months.</v>

1625
01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:42.213
<v Speaker 5>And then you know you've got your </v>
<v Speaker 5>parameters set properly and you would </v>

1626
01:34:44.531 --> 01:34:48.220
<v Speaker 5>know what to expect in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your emotions are regulated.</v>

1627
01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:52.510
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the state of being unemployed,</v>

1628
01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:55.930
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't just produce psychological </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequences.</v>

1629
01:34:56.770 --> 01:34:57.603
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the distinction between the psyche in </v>

1630
01:34:59.811 --> 01:35:02.060
<v Speaker 5>the world in some sense is quite </v>
<v Speaker 5>arbitrary.</v>

1631
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:03.403
<v Speaker 5>And the psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it err too much on the side of </v>

1632
01:35:07.371 --> 01:35:08.204
<v Speaker 5>the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They tend to think that too much of you </v>

1633
01:35:09.981 --> 01:35:13.070
<v Speaker 5>is inside of you and too little of you </v>
<v Speaker 5>is outside of you.</v>

1634
01:35:13.071 --> 01:35:18.071
<v Speaker 5>And part of the reason I believe that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of my clinical experience.</v>

1635
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:22.250
<v Speaker 5>I love the psychoanalyst Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're brilliant,</v>

1636
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:23.750
<v Speaker 5>they're brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're deep.</v>

1637
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:28.790
<v Speaker 5>They grapple with real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like with the problems.</v>

1638
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.970
<v Speaker 5>When people have real problems and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean profound problems,</v>

1639
01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:33.013
<v Speaker 5>they're really profound moral problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're problems of good and evil </v>

1640
01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:36.710
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1641
01:35:36.711 --> 01:35:37.544
<v Speaker 5>there are things going on in their </v>
<v Speaker 5>family that are so terrible that well </v>

1642
01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:43.760
<v Speaker 5>that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are some times fatal,</v>

1643
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:45.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lie upon,</v>

1644
01:35:45.231 --> 01:35:49.430
<v Speaker 5>lie upon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lie upon lie for decades and decades and</v>

1645
01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:50.900
<v Speaker 5>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's awful.</v>

1646
01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.980
<v Speaker 5>And that's not exactly inside them.</v>

1647
01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:01.233
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1648
01:36:02.850 --> 01:36:05.460
<v Speaker 5>It's out there in the world and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that I see,</v>

1649
01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:11.300
<v Speaker 5>very famous critic of psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember his name,</v>

1650
01:36:12.001 --> 01:36:12.834
<v Speaker 5>but I probably will</v>
<v Speaker 5>criticize the practice of psychology </v>

1651
01:36:17.101 --> 01:36:22.101
<v Speaker 5>quite effectively in the believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>early sixties the myth of mental illness</v>

1652
01:36:22.681 --> 01:36:25.890
<v Speaker 5>by Thomas Sas as zed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a s zed.</v>

1653
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:27.143
<v Speaker 5>It's classic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should read it if you're interested </v>

1654
01:36:28.981 --> 01:36:31.100
<v Speaker 5>in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>read it like it's,</v>

1655
01:36:31.110 --> 01:36:31.943
<v Speaker 5>it's a classic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he basically said most people have </v>

1656
01:36:34.981 --> 01:36:37.590
<v Speaker 5>problems in living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have psychological problems.</v>

1657
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.080
<v Speaker 5>And so I've experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>despite my love for the psychoanalysts,</v>

1658
01:36:43.710 --> 01:36:44.543
<v Speaker 5>very frequently what I'm doing as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>therapist is helping people have a life </v>

1659
01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:50.820
<v Speaker 5>that would work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1660
01:36:50.821 --> 01:36:54.120
<v Speaker 5>and you can parameterize that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1661
01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.193
<v Speaker 5>what do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about some friends that can feel </v>

1662
01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.273
<v Speaker 5>kind of like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about an intimate relationship with </v>

1663
01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:03.180
<v Speaker 5>someone that you can trust that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>has a future?</v>

1664
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.313
<v Speaker 5>That'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about a career that puts you in a </v>

1665
01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:06.993
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchy somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So at least you've got some possibility </v>

1666
01:37:10.411 --> 01:37:13.170
<v Speaker 5>of rising,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some possibility of stabilizing yourself</v>

1667
01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:18.210
<v Speaker 5>and our schedule and a routine because </v>
<v Speaker 5>no one can live without a routine.</v>

1668
01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:21.120
<v Speaker 5>You just forget that if you guys don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a routine,</v>

1669
01:37:21.810 --> 01:37:22.643
<v Speaker 5>I would recommend like you get one going</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you cannot be mentally healthy </v>

1670
01:37:26.641 --> 01:37:27.474
<v Speaker 5>without a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to pick a time to get up </v>

1671
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:30.833
<v Speaker 5>whatever time you want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but pick one and stick to it because </v>

1672
01:37:33.211 --> 01:37:34.044
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you disregulate your circadian</v>
<v Speaker 5>rhythms and they regulate your mood and </v>

1673
01:37:39.631 --> 01:37:41.070
<v Speaker 5>eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the morning.</v>

1674
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.520
<v Speaker 5>I had lots of clients who've had anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 5>disorders.</v>

1675
01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:47.010
<v Speaker 5>I had one client who was literally </v>
<v Speaker 5>starving,</v>

1676
01:37:47.730 --> 01:37:49.570
<v Speaker 5>very smart girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cheat.</v>

1677
01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:50.413
<v Speaker 5>There was very little that she liked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She kind of tried to subsist on like </v>

1678
01:37:52.890 --> 01:37:54.960
<v Speaker 5>half a cup of rice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She came to me and said,</v>

1679
01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:56.910
<v Speaker 5>I have no energy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I come home.</v>

1680
01:37:56.911 --> 01:37:59.580
<v Speaker 5>All I want to do is watch the same movie</v>
<v Speaker 5>over and over.</v>

1681
01:37:59.581 --> 01:38:01.470
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like is that weird?</v>

1682
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.940
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1683
01:38:02.941 --> 01:38:04.350
<v Speaker 5>it depends on how hard you work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1684
01:38:04.351 --> 01:38:06.720
<v Speaker 5>it's a little weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but whatever.</v>

1685
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:09.450
<v Speaker 5>It's familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're looking for comfort.</v>

1686
01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:10.493
<v Speaker 5>So I did an analysis of her diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like three quarters of a cup of </v>

1687
01:38:14.671 --> 01:38:16.650
<v Speaker 5>rice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're starving.</v>

1688
01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:19.110
<v Speaker 5>Eat something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1689
01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:26.000
<v Speaker 5>you'll feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she modified her diet and you're all,</v>

1690
01:38:26.001 --> 01:38:28.340
<v Speaker 5>our anxiety went away and she had some </v>
<v Speaker 5>energy.</v>

1691
01:38:28.341 --> 01:38:29.600
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1692
01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:35.480
<v Speaker 5>you go out to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a schedule,</v>

1693
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:38.210
<v Speaker 5>that's a good thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your brain will thank you for it.</v>

1694
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:41.840
<v Speaker 5>It will stabilize your nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 5>when it's a bit of a plan.</v>

1695
01:38:41.841 --> 01:38:44.120
<v Speaker 5>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need a career.</v>

1696
01:38:44.121 --> 01:38:46.550
<v Speaker 5>You need something productive to do with</v>
<v Speaker 5>your time.</v>

1697
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:50.390
<v Speaker 5>You need to regulate your use of drugs </v>
<v Speaker 5>and alcohol.</v>

1698
01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:53.930
<v Speaker 5>Most particularly alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause that does even a lot of people.</v>

1699
01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:55.333
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1700
01:38:57.690 --> 01:38:59.330
<v Speaker 5>he knew your family,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the family,</v>

1701
01:38:59.331 --> 01:39:02.780
<v Speaker 5>you have your parents and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be nice if you all got along,</v>

1702
01:39:02.781 --> 01:39:04.700
<v Speaker 5>you could work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good thing to work on.</v>

1703
01:39:04.701 --> 01:39:07.160
<v Speaker 5>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you probably need children at some point</v>

1704
01:39:07.161 --> 01:39:10.790
<v Speaker 5>and that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what life is.</v>

1705
01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:13.250
<v Speaker 5>And if you're missing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1706
01:39:13.251 --> 01:39:17.720
<v Speaker 5>you may have a good reason to not be </v>
<v Speaker 5>operating on one of those dimensions.</v>

1707
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:19.723
<v Speaker 5>It's not mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I can tell you that if you're not </v>

1708
01:39:22.371 --> 01:39:26.000
<v Speaker 5>operating reasonably well on four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I mentioned six,</v>

1709
01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:29.120
<v Speaker 5>if you're not operating reasonably well </v>
<v Speaker 5>on at least three of them,</v>

1710
01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.120
<v Speaker 5>there's no way you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologically thriving.</v>

1711
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:38.990
<v Speaker 5>And that's more pragmatic in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 5>than psychological,</v>

1712
01:39:38.991 --> 01:39:41.090
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human beings have a nature.</v>

1713
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:44.210
<v Speaker 5>There's things we need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if we have them,</v>

1714
01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:46.370
<v Speaker 5>well that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if we don't have them,</v>

1715
01:39:46.371 --> 01:39:47.780
<v Speaker 5>well then we feel the lack.</v>

1716
01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:49.213
<v Speaker 5>So behaviorists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>behavioral psychologists concentrate a </v>

1717
01:39:52.101 --> 01:39:54.440
<v Speaker 5>lot more on that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1718
01:39:54.441 --> 01:39:57.170
<v Speaker 5>it's practical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like strategizing,</v>

1719
01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:59.980
<v Speaker 5>make a career plan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to negotiate,</v>

1720
01:39:59.981 --> 01:40:02.570
<v Speaker 5>cause that's bloody important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Figuring out how to say what you need,</v>

1721
01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:04.910
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to tell the truth to </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1722
01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:10.160
<v Speaker 5>figure out how to listen to your partner</v>
<v Speaker 5>in particular.</v>

1723
01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:11.413
<v Speaker 5>Because if you listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will actually tell you what they </v>

1724
01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:15.374
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes you can give it to them </v>

1725
01:40:17.001 --> 01:40:17.834
<v Speaker 5>and maybe they'll return the favor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you practice that for like 15 </v>

1726
01:40:20.751 --> 01:40:23.870
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well then maybe you're constantly giving</v>

1727
01:40:23.871 --> 01:40:25.970
<v Speaker 5>each other what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well Hooray.</v>

1728
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:27.223
<v Speaker 5>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then there's two of you under most </v>

1729
01:40:30.011 --> 01:40:35.011
<v Speaker 5>circumstances and it's better to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>two brains than one because people think</v>

1730
01:40:35.841 --> 01:40:37.850
<v Speaker 5>differently because of their temperament</v>
<v Speaker 5>mostly.</v>

1731
01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:39.163
<v Speaker 5>And so the negotiation is where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wisdom arises and it's part of the </v>

1732
01:40:43.971 --> 01:40:44.804
<v Speaker 5>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the psychological transformation that's </v>

1733
01:40:46.821 --> 01:40:51.200
<v Speaker 5>attendant on an intimate relationship </v>
<v Speaker 5>and one of the fundamental purposes of a</v>

1734
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:55.240
<v Speaker 5>longterm intimate relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyways,</v>

1735
01:40:55.241 --> 01:40:57.400
<v Speaker 5>when that falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chaos ensues.</v>

1736
01:40:57.401 --> 01:41:02.401
<v Speaker 5>And that's why chaos is represented.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So continually and myths and stories.</v>

1737
01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:06.340
<v Speaker 5>And I'm going to walk you through a bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that more today.</v>

1738
01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:09.280
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talked about the story of Jonah.</v>

1739
01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.190
<v Speaker 5>Now here's something to think about.</v>

1740
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:16.103
<v Speaker 5>The internal representations of language</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning evolve partly from our pre </v>

1741
01:41:20.881 --> 01:41:25.110
<v Speaker 5>linguistic ancestor's knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 5>social relations like modern monkeys and</v>

1742
01:41:25.111 --> 01:41:25.944
<v Speaker 5>apes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our ancestors lived in groups with </v>

1743
01:41:27.601 --> 01:41:28.434
<v Speaker 5>intricate networks of relationships that</v>
<v Speaker 5>were similar caneously competitive and </v>

1744
01:41:32.161 --> 01:41:32.994
<v Speaker 5>cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The demands of social life created </v>

1745
01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:37.440
<v Speaker 5>selective pressures for just the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>complex,</v>

1746
01:41:37.441 --> 01:41:38.274
<v Speaker 5>abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 5>conceptual and computational abilities </v>

1747
01:41:40.230 --> 01:41:41.063
<v Speaker 5>that are likely to have proceeded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The earliest forms of linguistic </v>

1748
01:41:43.741 --> 01:41:44.574
<v Speaker 5>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although baboons have concepts and </v>

1749
01:41:46.981 --> 01:41:50.190
<v Speaker 5>acquire propositional information from </v>
<v Speaker 5>other animals,</v>

1750
01:41:50.191 --> 01:41:53.070
<v Speaker 5>vocalizations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they cannot articulate this information.</v>

1751
01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:55.020
<v Speaker 5>They understand dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships.</v>

1752
01:41:55.021 --> 01:41:57.570
<v Speaker 5>And matrilineal kinship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they have no words for them.</v>

1753
01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.490
<v Speaker 5>This suggests that the internal </v>
<v Speaker 5>representation of many concept relations</v>

1754
01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:06.240
<v Speaker 5>and actual action sequences does not </v>
<v Speaker 5>require language.</v>

1755
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:07.223
<v Speaker 5>And that language did not evolve because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was uniquely suited to representing </v>

1756
01:42:09.811 --> 01:42:10.940
<v Speaker 5>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you,</v>

1757
01:42:10.941 --> 01:42:13.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can think without language.</v>

1758
01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.753
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take the case of someone who's deaf and </v>

1759
01:42:16.411 --> 01:42:19.200
<v Speaker 5>mute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have no language,</v>

1760
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:21.990
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can operate in society,</v>

1761
01:42:21.991 --> 01:42:25.470
<v Speaker 5>they learn how to represent other people</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they do that with image.</v>

1762
01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:27.173
<v Speaker 5>Now the postmodernists who I</v>
<v Speaker 5>despise would be a reasonable way of </v>

1763
01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.313
<v Speaker 5>putting it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have this proposition that there's no </v>

1764
01:42:36.751 --> 01:42:40.020
<v Speaker 5>meaning outside language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's a powerful argument by the way,</v>

1765
01:42:40.021 --> 01:42:41.730
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's seriously wrong.</v>

1766
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:43.423
<v Speaker 4>MMM.</v>

1767
01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:45.473
<v Speaker 5>There is a meaning network outside of </v>
<v Speaker 5>language and it's what language is </v>

1768
01:42:48.001 --> 01:42:53.001
<v Speaker 5>grounded in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's this pre verbal comprehension</v>

1769
01:42:53.521 --> 01:42:54.354
<v Speaker 5>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an embodied comprehension of the </v>

1770
01:42:55.501 --> 01:42:56.750
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Animals have it,</v>

1771
01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:00.390
<v Speaker 5>lobsters have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1772
01:43:00.391 --> 01:43:02.940
<v Speaker 5>this particular scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seyfarth</v>

1773
01:43:04.590 --> 01:43:07.170
<v Speaker 5>talks about our shared history with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1774
01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:08.273
<v Speaker 5>higher primates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That probably goes back 20 million </v>

1775
01:43:11.191 --> 01:43:12.300
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

1776
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:16.710
<v Speaker 5>We split from the common ancestor with </v>
<v Speaker 5>chimps about 7 million years ago.</v>

1777
01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.190
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1778
01:43:20.530 --> 01:43:21.363
<v Speaker 5>lobsters have dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hardly have a nervous system at </v>

1779
01:43:24.671 --> 01:43:25.504
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is partly why they're studied </v>

1780
01:43:26.171 --> 01:43:27.004
<v Speaker 5>quite extensively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they have a social structure and </v>

1781
01:43:30.281 --> 01:43:34.690
<v Speaker 5>they understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if one lobster Theora lobster to be</v>

1782
01:43:34.691 --> 01:43:35.524
<v Speaker 5>quite a shock to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it happened and you were fighting </v>

1783
01:43:38.561 --> 01:43:41.560
<v Speaker 5>with another lobster and you lost,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would remember that.</v>

1784
01:43:41.561 --> 01:43:42.394
<v Speaker 5>And the next time you saw that lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd scuttle off somewhere else and </v>

1785
01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:48.250
<v Speaker 5>you'd know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all the lobsters in an area,</v>

1786
01:43:48.251 --> 01:43:49.084
<v Speaker 5>no who's top lobster and who isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Pop lobster gets the best bloody </v>

1787
01:43:54.081 --> 01:43:59.081
<v Speaker 5>place to be and the best food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this dominance issue,</v>

1788
01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.330
<v Speaker 5>this cultural issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1789
01:44:02.331 --> 01:44:03.164
<v Speaker 5>the fact that we live in a social </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment is far deeper than people </v>

1790
01:44:07.191 --> 01:44:09.560
<v Speaker 5>usually consider.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's also worth considering and that</v>

1791
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:12.680
<v Speaker 5>this is what you might think of from an </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary perspective.</v>

1792
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:13.514
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think of natural selection as </v>

1793
01:44:15.051 --> 01:44:17.120
<v Speaker 5>producing evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1794
01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.940
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>random mutation with natural selection.</v>

1795
01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:23.480
<v Speaker 5>But here's something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Darwin knew this,</v>

1796
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:25.243
<v Speaker 5>but Darwin was really smart and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>biologists who followed in his </v>

1797
01:44:27.801 --> 01:44:29.360
<v Speaker 5>footsteps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even up to now,</v>

1798
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:33.770
<v Speaker 5>I've only expanded out a fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what he had to say.</v>

1799
01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:35.373
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was very interested in sexual </v>

1800
01:44:36.171 --> 01:44:40.190
<v Speaker 5>selection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now one of the things about human beings</v>

1801
01:44:40.191 --> 01:44:44.390
<v Speaker 5>that's unique is that human females are </v>
<v Speaker 5>picky maters.</v>

1802
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:46.680
<v Speaker 5>They're choosy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1803
01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:47.893
<v Speaker 5>they're also sneaky because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell when they're ovulating and without </v>

1804
01:44:50.391 --> 01:44:52.250
<v Speaker 5>many other female animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1805
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:53.833
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

1806
01:44:55.530 --> 01:44:56.363
<v Speaker 5>they have hidden ovulation and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>choosy and they tend to choose men who </v>

1807
01:45:00.121 --> 01:45:02.400
<v Speaker 5>are more successful in the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy.</v>

1808
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.040
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1809
01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:05.550
<v Speaker 5>there is a shock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1810
01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:07.890
<v Speaker 5>if you have a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why not?</v>

1811
01:45:09.450 --> 01:45:12.840
<v Speaker 5>If you pick someone who's at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the competence hierarchy,</v>

1812
01:45:13.170 --> 01:45:15.360
<v Speaker 5>all that's probably not going to work </v>
<v Speaker 5>out very well for you.</v>

1813
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:18.570
<v Speaker 5>And since women bear the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 5>reproduction,</v>

1814
01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:20.430
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1815
01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:21.263
<v Speaker 5>it's perfectly reasonable for them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>search out someone who's going to be </v>

1816
01:45:23.641 --> 01:45:25.290
<v Speaker 5>helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So productive,</v>

1817
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:27.540
<v Speaker 5>fair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>generous.</v>

1818
01:45:28.050 --> 01:45:29.970
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you think of a dominance hierarchy,</v>

1819
01:45:29.971 --> 01:45:30.631
<v Speaker 5>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1820
01:45:30.631 --> 01:45:34.260
<v Speaker 5>it's the powerful guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the aggressive guy say that rises to the</v>

1821
01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:36.240
<v Speaker 5>top of the dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's not true.</v>

1822
01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:40.020
<v Speaker 5>It's not even true among chimps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can get a chimp tyrant.</v>

1823
01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:41.213
<v Speaker 5>But then what happens is other chimps </v>
<v Speaker 5>gang up on him and tear him to pieces </v>

1824
01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.040
<v Speaker 5>and they don't do it nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't do it nicely.</v>

1825
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:51.390
<v Speaker 5>And the chimps that tend to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 5>their dominance for long periods of time</v>

1826
01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.433
<v Speaker 5>have a pretty wide network of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking with whom they engage </v>

1827
01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:58.290
<v Speaker 5>in reciprocal interactions like </v>
<v Speaker 5>grooming.</v>

1828
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:59.303
<v Speaker 5>And they actually pay a lot of positive </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention to the female chimps who have </v>

1829
01:46:01.741 --> 01:46:02.970
<v Speaker 5>their own hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1830
01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:04.470
<v Speaker 5>and to the their offspring.</v>

1831
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:06.960
<v Speaker 5>So they're like baby kissing </v>
<v Speaker 5>politicians.</v>

1832
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:11.400
<v Speaker 5>And so the idea that it's raw power that</v>
<v Speaker 5>produces dominance is a,</v>

1833
01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.220
<v Speaker 5>it's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1834
01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:15.180
<v Speaker 5>it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1835
01:46:15.181 --> 01:46:16.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tyrants,</v>

1836
01:46:16.291 --> 01:46:17.124
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty damn up unstable business </v>

1837
01:46:18.841 --> 01:46:19.674
<v Speaker 5>being a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's lots of people who want to kill </v>

1838
01:46:21.031 --> 01:46:21.930
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus,</v>

1839
01:46:21.931 --> 01:46:22.764
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you tend to rule over something </v>

1840
01:46:24.090 --> 01:46:27.410
<v Speaker 5>approximating hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So maybe that's the worst.</v>

1841
01:46:27.630 --> 01:46:30.660
<v Speaker 5>Better than being a subject in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not much better.</v>

1842
01:46:31.230 --> 01:46:35.250
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so this social social now,</v>

1843
01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:37.590
<v Speaker 5>so what this means,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about this for a minute.</v>

1844
01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:40.410
<v Speaker 5>So imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1845
01:46:40.530 --> 01:46:41.363
<v Speaker 5>imagine what I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bear some vague resemblance to the </v>

1846
01:46:43.291 --> 01:46:44.124
<v Speaker 5>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's quite a lot of evidence </v>

1847
01:46:45.331 --> 01:46:47.730
<v Speaker 5>for it from a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a biological perspective.</v>

1848
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:49.303
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this choosy mating thing occurs </v>

1849
01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.520
<v Speaker 5>with lots of species.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1850
01:46:53.670 --> 01:46:57.120
<v Speaker 5>there's this bird called the bower bird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to look up bowerbirds man,</v>

1851
01:46:57.121 --> 01:47:00.720
<v Speaker 5>those things are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just can't even believe they exist.</v>

1852
01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:01.793
<v Speaker 5>And so the male bowerbird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he makes this really complicated nest </v>

1853
01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:06.660
<v Speaker 5>that's close to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He weaves it.</v>

1854
01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:09.240
<v Speaker 5>It's really quite nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't make one.</v>

1855
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:10.703
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he sweeps the US the yard in </v>

1856
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:14.874
<v Speaker 5>front of the nest and then he runs </v>
<v Speaker 5>around the forest or flies because he </v>

1857
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:23.151
<v Speaker 5>has a bird finding pretty things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So maybe he'll find a nice collection of</v>

1858
01:47:23.581 --> 01:47:24.414
<v Speaker 5>red leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then he'll take the red leaves </v>

1859
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.460
<v Speaker 5>one by one and fly back to his front </v>
<v Speaker 5>yard and make a little square.</v>

1860
01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:30.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a bird,</v>

1861
01:47:30.541 --> 01:47:33.700
<v Speaker 5>so it's not a great square,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it makes a little patch of red.</v>

1862
01:47:33.701 --> 01:47:36.780
<v Speaker 5>And he takes a look at that and then he </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes off and find something blue.</v>

1863
01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:38.370
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he decorates,</v>

1864
01:47:38.371 --> 01:47:39.204
<v Speaker 5>it makes a little piece of abstract art </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the front of his nest and a lot of </v>

1865
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:45.090
<v Speaker 5>male bowerbirds do this all at the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1866
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:46.463
<v Speaker 5>And so then the females come along,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hop on something nearby and they </v>

1867
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:51.630
<v Speaker 5>kind of look at it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>checking it out.</v>

1868
01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:55.140
<v Speaker 5>And if they're happy with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well then things proceed.</v>

1869
01:47:55.141 --> 01:47:55.974
<v Speaker 5>But if they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'd fly off to someone else's piece </v>

1870
01:47:57.601 --> 01:47:58.434
<v Speaker 5>of abstract art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if a of mail piece of art is </v>

1871
01:48:01.951 --> 01:48:05.600
<v Speaker 5>rejected by like three females in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he gets irritated,</v>

1872
01:48:05.850 --> 01:48:09.210
<v Speaker 5>brushes it all off with his wing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he makes another one.</v>

1873
01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:11.850
<v Speaker 5>It's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1874
01:48:11.851 --> 01:48:15.090
<v Speaker 5>they obviously have a sentence of very </v>
<v Speaker 5>well developed sense of beauty.</v>

1875
01:48:15.570 --> 01:48:16.830
<v Speaker 5>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1876
01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:20.970
<v Speaker 5>And I guess the idea is that who knows </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell,</v>

1877
01:48:20.971 --> 01:48:24.940
<v Speaker 5>the idea is the female birds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like artistic males,</v>

1878
01:48:24.941 --> 01:48:25.774
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you're thinking about it </v>

1879
01:48:27.031 --> 01:48:27.864
<v Speaker 5>biologically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's an indication of </v>

1880
01:48:29.161 --> 01:48:30.630
<v Speaker 5>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1881
01:48:30.631 --> 01:48:32.610
<v Speaker 5>It's a marker of intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1882
01:48:32.611 --> 01:48:37.611
<v Speaker 5>And it's certainly the case that female </v>
<v Speaker 5>humans prefer creative meant so.</v>

1883
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:40.583
<v Speaker 5>And the wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course we wouldn't be creative if </v>

1884
01:48:43.321 --> 01:48:45.990
<v Speaker 5>that wasn't the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then imagine that there's two primary</v>

1885
01:48:45.991 --> 01:48:46.824
<v Speaker 5>forces of evolutionary selection </v>
<v Speaker 5>operating on us and they're not really </v>

1886
01:48:50.281 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 5>the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what people always think,</v>

1887
01:48:52.651 --> 01:48:53.484
<v Speaker 5>like the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that the animals and the trees </v>

1888
01:48:55.891 --> 01:48:59.010
<v Speaker 5>and nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it isn't nature that selected us.</v>

1889
01:48:59.490 --> 01:49:00.630
<v Speaker 5>It's two other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1890
01:49:00.631 --> 01:49:04.680
<v Speaker 5>partly it's to other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one is the dominance hierarchy,</v>

1891
01:49:04.681 --> 01:49:09.681
<v Speaker 5>the male dominance hierarchy is one is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the primary mechanisms of selection.</v>

1892
01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:13.350
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well women are faced with a hard choice,</v>

1893
01:49:13.351 --> 01:49:14.670
<v Speaker 5>which guy to go after,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1894
01:49:14.671 --> 01:49:16.260
<v Speaker 5>That's a hard choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1895
01:49:16.261 --> 01:49:20.010
<v Speaker 5>so they do the same thing that people do</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the stock market.</v>

1896
01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.113
<v Speaker 5>They outsource the cognitive problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the computational problem to the male </v>

1897
01:49:24.781 --> 01:49:25.614
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they just let the mail cirque </v>

1898
01:49:27.361 --> 01:49:30.930
<v Speaker 5>themselves out however they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they peel from the top.</v>

1899
01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:32.153
<v Speaker 5>And so what that means is the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 5>male dominance hierarchy itself is a </v>

1900
01:49:35.351 --> 01:49:38.100
<v Speaker 5>selection mechanism because if you fail </v>
<v Speaker 5>at it,</v>

1901
01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.520
<v Speaker 5>then you don't leave any offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what that means is,</v>

1902
01:49:43.601 --> 01:49:48.310
<v Speaker 5>at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that we have adapted to be and better</v>

1903
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:53.380
<v Speaker 5>at attaining status in dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hierarchies over God only knows how long</v>

1904
01:49:53.381 --> 01:49:55.870
<v Speaker 5>a period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that doesn't mean just power,</v>

1905
01:49:57.010 --> 01:49:57.843
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might mean cognitive flexibility </v>

1906
01:49:58.991 --> 01:50:03.310
<v Speaker 5>because you could imagine dorman is </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy a dominance hierarchy,</v>

1907
01:50:03.311 --> 01:50:05.290
<v Speaker 5>b dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1908
01:50:05.410 --> 01:50:07.240
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if like if you're really successful,</v>

1909
01:50:07.241 --> 01:50:09.970
<v Speaker 5>you climb up dominance hierarchy a </v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1910
01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:10.804
<v Speaker 5>But you'd be in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see now if you have land in though is </v>

1911
01:50:13.391 --> 01:50:14.224
<v Speaker 5>you just be a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then you could say the ideal human </v>

1912
01:50:18.281 --> 01:50:19.114
<v Speaker 5>being is someone who can climb to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>top of a dominance hierarchy no matter </v>

1913
01:50:21.311 --> 01:50:24.130
<v Speaker 5>what the dominance hierarchy is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1914
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:26.950
<v Speaker 5>So we've evolved too.</v>

1915
01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:29.943
<v Speaker 5>We've evolved such that success across </v>
<v Speaker 5>the set of possible dominance </v>

1916
01:50:34.601 --> 01:50:35.434
<v Speaker 5>hierarchies is the target.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's why we have general </v>

1917
01:50:38.711 --> 01:50:39.544
<v Speaker 5>intelligence because general </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligence is a general problem </v>

1918
01:50:42.131 --> 01:50:45.880
<v Speaker 5>solving mechanism and it's a single </v>
<v Speaker 5>factor.</v>

1919
01:50:45.881 --> 01:50:48.730
<v Speaker 5>Even like there is intelligence is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>single factor.</v>

1920
01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:53.200
<v Speaker 5>It's not divisible despite what people </v>
<v Speaker 5>like</v>

1921
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:59.790
<v Speaker 5>Robert Sternberg and Howard Gardner </v>
<v Speaker 5>falsely claim.</v>

1922
01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then from the female perspective,</v>

1923
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:07.143
<v Speaker 5>females are the next gatekeeper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's why they're often mother </v>

1924
01:51:09.851 --> 01:51:10.684
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took me a long time to figure this </v>

1925
01:51:11.591 --> 01:51:12.424
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why the hell is a nature feminine in </v>

1926
01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:16.510
<v Speaker 5>mythological representations?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a very,</v>

1927
01:51:16.511 --> 01:51:17.344
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's extraordinarily common mother </v>

1928
01:51:19.421 --> 01:51:21.370
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't think of father nature,</v>

1929
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:23.560
<v Speaker 5>you think of Mother Nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like why?</v>

1930
01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:25.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nature brings forth new forms.</v>

1931
01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.370
<v Speaker 5>So that's feminine</v>

1932
01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:31.513
<v Speaker 5>and nature selects in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the definition of nature from a </v>

1933
01:51:34.911 --> 01:51:35.744
<v Speaker 5>Darwinian perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nature is that which selects women </v>

1934
01:51:39.891 --> 01:51:40.724
<v Speaker 5>select their nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's partly why far more men than </v>

1935
01:51:45.741 --> 01:51:49.820
<v Speaker 5>you might think like far more are </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrified of women.</v>

1936
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:51.583
<v Speaker 5>Because to be rejected as a romantic </v>
<v Speaker 5>partner by a woman is to be classified </v>

1937
01:51:59.541 --> 01:52:04.541
<v Speaker 5>as vaguely acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lifeform Huh?</v>

1938
01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:09.890
<v Speaker 5>No value in propagating it though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1939
01:52:09.891 --> 01:52:12.560
<v Speaker 5>So it's a major,</v>
<v Speaker 5>major rejection.</v>

1940
01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:16.850
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had dozens of clients and many,</v>

1941
01:52:16.851 --> 01:52:17.684
<v Speaker 5>many people write to me whose primary </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem is that they're so terrified of </v>

1942
01:52:21.471 --> 01:52:22.760
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't even approach them.</v>

1943
01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:24.081
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

1944
01:52:24.081 --> 01:52:26.120
<v Speaker 5>very common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1945
01:52:26.150 --> 01:52:26.983
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to show you this little triangle </v>

1946
01:52:29.811 --> 01:52:32.120
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is kind of cool.</v>

1947
01:53:07.650 --> 01:53:12.650
<v Speaker 3>10</v>

1948
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:42.430
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So no,</v>

1949
01:53:42.431 --> 01:53:43.760
<v Speaker 5>no nonverbal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1950
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:45.640
<v Speaker 5>Nonverbal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what happened?</v>

1951
01:53:47.290 --> 01:53:48.123
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's mother triangle I would guess </v>

1952
01:53:50.530 --> 01:53:55.530
<v Speaker 5>and mother triangle has circle as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>child and triangle</v>

1953
01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:04.980
<v Speaker 5>is maybe a friend but not one that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>very welcome according to mother and uh,</v>

1954
01:54:09.570 --> 01:54:10.403
<v Speaker 5>child circle goes out to try to play </v>
<v Speaker 5>with triangle child and mother doesn't </v>

1955
01:54:15.781 --> 01:54:17.730
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she goes out there and pecks the hell</v>

1956
01:54:17.731 --> 01:54:18.810
<v Speaker 5>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Out of him,</v>

1957
01:54:19.530 --> 01:54:20.363
<v Speaker 5>chase him away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pushes child circle back into the home </v>

1958
01:54:25.890 --> 01:54:26.723
<v Speaker 5>and goes into the home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then child circle isn't very happy </v>

1959
01:54:29.371 --> 01:54:30.204
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's running around causing trouble and </v>

1960
01:54:32.411 --> 01:54:33.244
<v Speaker 5>he manages to escape and then bad child </v>
<v Speaker 5>triangle shows up and they played </v>

1961
01:54:37.641 --> 01:54:38.474
<v Speaker 5>together and run around and run around </v>
<v Speaker 5>and run around and run around with </v>

1962
01:54:40.501 --> 01:54:42.880
<v Speaker 5>mother chasing them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they will,</v>

1963
01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:44.670
<v Speaker 5>maybe they elope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows?</v>

1964
01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:48.300
<v Speaker 5>And then mother triangle has a fit and </v>
<v Speaker 5>blows down the house.</v>

1965
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:49.950
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So obvious,</v>

1966
01:54:52.170 --> 01:54:53.003
<v Speaker 5>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would you consider that a reasonable </v>

1967
01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:59.900
<v Speaker 5>story about what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps you had other interpretations,</v>

1968
01:55:00.601 --> 01:55:03.720
<v Speaker 5>but I suspect they were vaguely along </v>
<v Speaker 5>that line.</v>

1969
01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:05.340
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the point here,</v>

1970
01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:06.720
<v Speaker 5>and this is the point of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiment,</v>

1971
01:55:06.721 --> 01:55:10.860
<v Speaker 5>is how much information do you need from</v>
<v Speaker 5>which to derive a narrative?</v>

1972
01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:14.130
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is like none.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

1973
01:55:14.131 --> 01:55:14.964
<v Speaker 5>it's just immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can watch some triangles moving </v>

1974
01:55:17.521 --> 01:55:21.420
<v Speaker 5>around a box and instantly you </v>
<v Speaker 5>personalize it.</v>

1975
01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:25.680
<v Speaker 5>And that's because that's what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

1976
01:55:26.370 --> 01:55:31.110
<v Speaker 5>And the reason you're like that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're environment isn't nature.</v>

1977
01:55:32.670 --> 01:55:35.940
<v Speaker 5>Your environment is culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your environment is other people,</v>

1978
01:55:36.450 --> 01:55:37.283
<v Speaker 5>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was even more true for </v>

1979
01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:41.273
<v Speaker 5>chimpanzees and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And especially animals had a limited </v>

1980
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.960
<v Speaker 5>diet like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like gorillas,</v>

1981
01:55:45.961 --> 01:55:49.160
<v Speaker 5>they pretty much only eat like leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

1982
01:55:49.161 --> 01:55:51.930
<v Speaker 5>Chimps spends like 12 hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 5>chewing.</v>

1983
01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:55.050
<v Speaker 5>And that's why they have a gut like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1984
01:55:55.110 --> 01:55:57.780
<v Speaker 5>It's like you can't eat leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1985
01:55:57.810 --> 01:55:59.880
<v Speaker 5>have you tried?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have no nutrition.</v>

1986
01:55:59.881 --> 01:56:00.714
<v Speaker 5>So if you're going to eat leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to eat a lot of them and then </v>

1987
01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:06.480
<v Speaker 5>it takes like three months to digest </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1988
01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:09.840
<v Speaker 5>And so what we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is pretty cool cause it's we're</v>

1989
01:56:09.841 --> 01:56:12.900
<v Speaker 5>so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that we've traded gut for brain.</v>

1990
01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:14.453
<v Speaker 5>And that's why we're so spelled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the way we managed that it appears </v>

1991
01:56:17.581 --> 01:56:20.070
<v Speaker 5>is that we learned how to use fire to </v>
<v Speaker 5>cook things.</v>

1992
01:56:20.130 --> 01:56:23.790
<v Speaker 5>And that meant that we had high quality </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition,</v>

1993
01:56:23.791 --> 01:56:25.260
<v Speaker 5>much higher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's easier to digest,</v>

1994
01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.150
<v Speaker 5>cooked things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially meat.</v>

1995
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:28.583
<v Speaker 5>And so because we invented fire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we didn't have to have so much in test </v>

1996
01:56:31.901 --> 01:56:35.130
<v Speaker 5>done and we could spend a little more </v>
<v Speaker 5>time on the brain.</v>

1997
01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.173
<v Speaker 5>So human beings really are fire users.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We invented fire or discovered it or </v>

1998
01:56:40.261 --> 01:56:41.094
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man Mastered it at least a couple of </v>

1999
01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:45.390
<v Speaker 5>million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a long time.</v>

2000
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:49.830
<v Speaker 5>So that's all pretty cool as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>concerned.</v>

2001
01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:53.770
<v Speaker 5>So that's partly how you think</v>

2002
01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:59.220
<v Speaker 5>and that's naturally how you think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think a certain way.</v>

2003
01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:02.970
<v Speaker 5>And so we'll say that your fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 5>architecture is social cognitive.</v>

2004
01:57:03.150 --> 01:57:05.880
<v Speaker 5>You tend to view the world as if it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>personified.</v>

2005
01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:07.643
<v Speaker 5>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world in which you emerged as a being </v>

2006
01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:11.933
<v Speaker 5>was primarily social.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what you needed to know was who's </v>

2007
01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:17.020
<v Speaker 5>the big primate and who's the little </v>
<v Speaker 5>primate and who's related to who.</v>

2008
01:57:17.021 --> 01:57:18.360
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>among chimps,</v>

2009
01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.450
<v Speaker 5>if a big chimp is threatened by a small </v>
<v Speaker 5>chimp,</v>

2010
01:57:22.770 --> 01:57:23.603
<v Speaker 5>well you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the big chimp can just tear the small </v>

2011
01:57:24.691 --> 01:57:25.524
<v Speaker 5>champ apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the big chimp will back off if it </v>

2012
01:57:29.221 --> 01:57:34.110
<v Speaker 5>knows that the little chimp is </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with some really big chimps.</v>

2013
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:35.633
<v Speaker 5>And so the little chimp can bully the </v>
<v Speaker 5>big chimp because it's part of a </v>

2014
01:57:38.250 --> 01:57:41.820
<v Speaker 5>dominant family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's because the nervous system of</v>

2015
01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:45.630
<v Speaker 5>the big chimp doesn't respond to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>little chimp like a little chimp.</v>

2016
01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:50.340
<v Speaker 5>It responds to the little chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it's a little champ with four great</v>

2017
01:57:50.341 --> 01:57:53.070
<v Speaker 5>monsters attached to it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>true.</v>

2018
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:54.623
<v Speaker 5>So it's nervous system is actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>responding to the network around the </v>

2019
01:57:58.501 --> 01:58:00.870
<v Speaker 5>chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's exactly what you,</v>

2020
01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:01.733
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not exactly what you're like </v>

2021
01:58:02.161 --> 01:58:04.350
<v Speaker 5>because you're not chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2022
01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:05.993
<v Speaker 5>it's that kind of platform that </v>
<v Speaker 5>constitutes the evolutionary </v>

2023
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:12.300
<v Speaker 5>underpinnings of your psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what does that mean?</v>

2024
01:58:13.970 --> 01:58:14.803
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it means this is like perfectly fine to </v>

2025
01:58:16.701 --> 01:58:17.534
<v Speaker 5>us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2026
01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:20.480
<v Speaker 5>Can I automate things?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can have rabbits are people,</v>

2027
01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:22.820
<v Speaker 5>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll go along with that.</v>

2028
01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:28.290
<v Speaker 5>You remember Roger Rabbit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I presume most of you've watched that.</v>

2029
01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.840
<v Speaker 5>So this is the detective who's name I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't remember.</v>

2030
01:58:31.230 --> 01:58:35.450
<v Speaker 5>He has to go to toontown cause there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>cartoons and there's people and you know</v>

2031
01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:38.640
<v Speaker 5>they share the same world and you can go</v>
<v Speaker 5>to toontown.</v>

2032
01:58:38.641 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 5>Although it's kind of annoying because </v>
<v Speaker 5>cartoon figures are kind of annoying.</v>

2033
01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 5>Like there's slapstick types and so he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a very happy to be there.</v>

2034
01:58:45.970 --> 01:58:47.080
<v Speaker 5>And this is what it looks like.</v>

2035
01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2036
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.510
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything's animated,</v>

2037
01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:54.380
<v Speaker 5>meaning alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anima means soul by the way.</v>

2038
01:58:54.710 --> 01:58:59.540
<v Speaker 5>So everything has a personality and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know when you're reading books to kids,</v>

2039
01:59:00.170 --> 01:59:03.170
<v Speaker 5>the sun has a personality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>train has a personality,</v>

2040
01:59:03.290 --> 01:59:05.690
<v Speaker 5>jet has a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter what it is.</v>

2041
01:59:05.691 --> 01:59:08.570
<v Speaker 5>It has a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's because the child is learning</v>

2042
01:59:08.571 --> 01:59:11.300
<v Speaker 5>to understand the world using the </v>
<v Speaker 5>architecture,</v>

2043
01:59:11.301 --> 01:59:12.770
<v Speaker 5>social,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cognitive architecture.</v>

2044
01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:13.633
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the thing that's really interesting </v>

2045
01:59:14.841 --> 01:59:16.640
<v Speaker 5>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just blows me away.</v>

2046
01:59:17.210 --> 01:59:18.043
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution is conservative and so once </v>

2047
01:59:19.161 --> 01:59:21.590
<v Speaker 5>it's produced something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has to build on it.</v>

2048
01:59:22.130 --> 01:59:25.220
<v Speaker 5>It's like dos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the operating system.</v>

2049
01:59:25.221 --> 01:59:28.130
<v Speaker 5>It's like really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still there.</v>

2050
01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:29.053
<v Speaker 5>If I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>under windows 10 you can't get rid of </v>

2051
01:59:31.461 --> 01:59:32.294
<v Speaker 5>the damn thing because it's part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's part of the structure now and it's </v>

2052
01:59:36.261 --> 01:59:37.094
<v Speaker 5>like the keyboards we use,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which were actually designed to slow </v>

2053
01:59:39.711 --> 01:59:42.710
<v Speaker 5>typers down because with mechanical type</v>
<v Speaker 5>writers,</v>

2054
01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:44.570
<v Speaker 5>if you type too fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the keys would jam.</v>

2055
01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:45.613
<v Speaker 5>So they divine device,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the keyboard to slow you down and we </v>

2056
01:59:48.411 --> 01:59:50.300
<v Speaker 5>still use it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is stupid.</v>

2057
01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:55.900
<v Speaker 5>You know you want the high frequency </v>
<v Speaker 5>letters close to your middle fingers.</v>

2058
01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:57.493
<v Speaker 5>That isn't what it's like at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we can't change it because everyone </v>

2059
01:59:59.331 --> 02:00:01.760
<v Speaker 5>uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So your body plan,</v>

2060
02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:04.160
<v Speaker 5>that thing has been around a long time </v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2061
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:08.000
<v Speaker 5>If you look at mammals particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even lizards,</v>

2062
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:12.860
<v Speaker 5>there's so much like us in their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in their skeletal structure that is just</v>

2063
02:00:12.861 --> 02:00:14.030
<v Speaker 5>mind boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2064
02:00:14.031 --> 02:00:15.710
<v Speaker 5>And we're all variants of the same</v>

2065
02:00:17.610 --> 02:00:22.610
<v Speaker 5>symmetrical four legged mouth here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>

2066
02:00:24.570 --> 02:00:26.550
<v Speaker 5>And so you have to build to what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

2067
02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:28.980
<v Speaker 5>And if you have a social cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 5>architecture,</v>

2068
02:00:28.981 --> 02:00:29.814
<v Speaker 5>then you have to first understand the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world through the social cognitive </v>

2069
02:00:32.731 --> 02:00:35.550
<v Speaker 5>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what so bloody strange about that is</v>

2070
02:00:35.551 --> 02:00:36.384
<v Speaker 5>it actually seems to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We actually seem to develop a coherent </v>

2071
02:00:39.841 --> 02:00:44.190
<v Speaker 5>representation of being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say of being that's not the same</v>

2072
02:00:44.191 --> 02:00:46.890
<v Speaker 5>as nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not the same as the world.</v>

2073
02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:49.920
<v Speaker 5>Because when we think of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we think of the objective world.</v>

2074
02:00:50.370 --> 02:00:52.260
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not talking about the objective </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

2075
02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:54.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about the world of human </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

2076
02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:55.673
<v Speaker 5>And we see that through social cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 5>filter and it makes perfect sense to us </v>

2077
02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:01.440
<v Speaker 5>and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so strange.</v>

2078
02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:02.573
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's got this animated nature </v>

2079
02:01:05.611 --> 02:01:08.040
<v Speaker 5>and we don't have a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2080
02:01:08.041 --> 02:01:09.630
<v Speaker 5>we actually find it quite fun.</v>

2081
02:01:11.210 --> 02:01:12.043
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people go visit the Disney toontown and </v>

2082
02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:19.200
<v Speaker 5>participate in it 10 and have fun with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2083
02:01:19.201 --> 02:01:23.640
<v Speaker 5>And so that shows you as well how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how natural it is for us to,</v>

2084
02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:25.530
<v Speaker 5>to view things this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2085
02:01:25.531 --> 02:01:27.960
<v Speaker 5>cars have faces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2086
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:29.783
<v Speaker 5>Designers know that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know that people don't want a car </v>

2087
02:01:32.461 --> 02:01:33.294
<v Speaker 5>with three headlights because like who </v>
<v Speaker 5>wants to be associated with a three odd </v>

2088
02:01:37.221 --> 02:01:38.490
<v Speaker 5>monster?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one.</v>

2089
02:01:38.850 --> 02:01:39.683
<v Speaker 5>It's like two eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's something you could be </v>

2090
02:01:41.121 --> 02:01:46.121
<v Speaker 5>comfortable with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so cars have faces and like a bmw is</v>

2091
02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.780
<v Speaker 5>the new one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they really look Cadillac,</v>

2092
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:50.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they have sexy curves.</v>

2093
02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:52.550
<v Speaker 5>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do.</v>

2094
02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:54.470
<v Speaker 5>There's been MRI studies of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2095
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:55.783
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you showed men photographs of </v>

2096
02:01:58.730 --> 02:02:00.440
<v Speaker 5>attractive women looking directly at </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

2097
02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:02.960
<v Speaker 5>there's a little part of their brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>called the nucleus accumbens that lights</v>

2098
02:02:02.961 --> 02:02:05.660
<v Speaker 5>up because to have someone look directly</v>
<v Speaker 5>at you,</v>

2099
02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:07.910
<v Speaker 5>especially if they have like a smile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2100
02:02:08.010 --> 02:02:10.400
<v Speaker 5>is interpreted as an invitation to </v>
<v Speaker 5>approach.</v>

2101
02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:11.773
<v Speaker 5>And women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have the same damn problem because </v>

2102
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:15.820
<v Speaker 5>with women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if you go into drugstores say,</v>

2103
02:02:15.821 --> 02:02:18.410
<v Speaker 5>and you look at women's magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all the same.</v>

2104
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:21.020
<v Speaker 5>They've all evolved to the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>endpoint.</v>

2105
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:23.120
<v Speaker 5>They all have an attractive woman on </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

2106
02:02:23.210 --> 02:02:25.460
<v Speaker 5>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're looking right out.</v>

2107
02:02:25.610 --> 02:02:26.443
<v Speaker 5>And so when women see that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they actually see it as something to </v>

2108
02:02:28.431 --> 02:02:30.470
<v Speaker 5>with approach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an ideal.</v>

2109
02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:31.541
<v Speaker 5>And now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2110
02:02:31.541 --> 02:02:32.374
<v Speaker 5>when people say that those beauty ideals</v>
<v Speaker 5>are oppressive to women and all ideals </v>

2111
02:02:36.441 --> 02:02:38.690
<v Speaker 5>are oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the empirical research,</v>

2112
02:02:38.691 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 5>some of it done here suggests that </v>
<v Speaker 5>interacting with those images</v>

2113
02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:45.023
<v Speaker 5>helps the performance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the psychological function of helping </v>

2114
02:02:48.151 --> 02:02:52.220
<v Speaker 5>the woman equate herself with the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in most cases that actually produces</v>

2115
02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:54.480
<v Speaker 5>a po and elevation in mood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2116
02:02:54.481 --> 02:02:55.314
<v Speaker 5>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're really going to go to the </v>

2117
02:02:56.191 --> 02:02:57.024
<v Speaker 5>magazine store when you're just looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>for something to do and you're going to </v>

2118
02:02:59.371 --> 02:03:02.910
<v Speaker 5>buy something that makes you feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>depressed and oppressed.</v>

2119
02:03:03.210 --> 02:03:03.691
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2120
02:03:03.691 --> 02:03:06.240
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Magazines that do that to you,</v>

2121
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:09.240
<v Speaker 5>they will die because no one will buy </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2122
02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:12.030
<v Speaker 5>And there's a reason they all turned out</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same way.</v>

2123
02:03:12.031 --> 02:03:14.490
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're just responding to </v>
<v Speaker 5>demand.</v>

2124
02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:15.893
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2125
02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:19.433
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2126
02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:21.950
<v Speaker 5>faces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yes.</v>

2127
02:03:21.951 --> 02:03:23.990
<v Speaker 5>With regards to the sexy curves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2128
02:03:25.670 --> 02:03:28.190
<v Speaker 5>woman who looks upon picture looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>right out,</v>

2129
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:31.700
<v Speaker 5>a man will produce this activation in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the primary reward system.</v>

2130
02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:34.600
<v Speaker 5>Cocaine produces the same response and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Sodas,</v>

2131
02:03:34.610 --> 02:03:38.780
<v Speaker 5>sports cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially curvy red sports cars.</v>

2132
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.883
<v Speaker 5>And so that's why you often see an </v>
<v Speaker 5>attractive woman sitting on a curvy red </v>

2133
02:03:42.321 --> 02:03:45.500
<v Speaker 5>sports car in an ad because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2134
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:48.770
<v Speaker 5>if there's an ad for beer on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2135
02:03:48.890 --> 02:03:50.060
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's perfect.</v>

2136
02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:51.800
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2137
02:03:51.801 --> 02:03:54.740
<v Speaker 5>those are all primary reward reward </v>
<v Speaker 5>representations.</v>

2138
02:03:54.741 --> 02:03:58.700
<v Speaker 5>And they produce attraction because part</v>
<v Speaker 5>of positive emotion,</v>

2139
02:03:58.701 --> 02:03:59.534
<v Speaker 5>the dopamine dopaminergic Lee mediated </v>
<v Speaker 5>element and positive emotion is an </v>

2140
02:04:02.871 --> 02:04:03.704
<v Speaker 5>approach emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a satiation satisfaction </v>

2141
02:04:06.351 --> 02:04:07.790
<v Speaker 5>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all good.</v>

2142
02:04:07.791 --> 02:04:09.650
<v Speaker 5>There's something good here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can move towards it.</v>

2143
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:11.930
<v Speaker 5>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is what happiness is.</v>

2144
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:13.363
<v Speaker 5>That's directly what happiness is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not attaining something because </v>

2145
02:04:17.001 --> 02:04:19.130
<v Speaker 5>that just puts you in a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>

2146
02:04:19.410 --> 02:04:20.930
<v Speaker 5>You've got to figure out what to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>next.</v>

2147
02:04:22.590 --> 02:04:24.480
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I suggested to you</v>

2148
02:04:28.830 --> 02:04:29.663
<v Speaker 5>that one of the problems that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem I would say is not what the </v>

2149
02:04:34.861 --> 02:04:37.020
<v Speaker 5>world's made out of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how we should be in the,</v>

2150
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:39.960
<v Speaker 5>because we're alive and how we should </v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

2151
02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:40.551
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2152
02:04:40.551 --> 02:04:41.940
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fairly straight forward.</v>

2153
02:04:43.890 --> 02:04:46.140
<v Speaker 5>Not so much pain would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'd be good.</v>

2154
02:04:46.170 --> 02:04:47.790
<v Speaker 5>Not Too much anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2155
02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:50.170
<v Speaker 5>we're on board for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2156
02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:52.890
<v Speaker 5>little pleasure down then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some stability,</v>

2157
02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not dying.</v>

2158
02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:57.360
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>

2159
02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:00.600
<v Speaker 5>And then let's say from the Darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>

2160
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:04.050
<v Speaker 5>propagating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's what we're aimed at.</v>

2161
02:05:04.051 --> 02:05:06.300
<v Speaker 5>And the reason we're aimed at that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>you just think about this.</v>

2162
02:05:06.301 --> 02:05:11.130
<v Speaker 5>It's so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So every single one of your,</v>

2163
02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.980
<v Speaker 5>of the relatives you have in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancestry,</v>

2164
02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:15.420
<v Speaker 5>every single one of them</v>

2165
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:17.833
<v Speaker 5>successfully produced a child who </v>
<v Speaker 5>successively successfully produced a </v>

2166
02:05:23.061 --> 02:05:26.840
<v Speaker 5>child all the way back to 3 billion </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

2167
02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:29.113
<v Speaker 5>It's bloody unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the probability that you exist </v>

2168
02:05:31.521 --> 02:05:32.354
<v Speaker 5>while it's 100% because there you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the probability of predicting that </v>

2169
02:05:36.051 --> 02:05:37.520
<v Speaker 5>you would exist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2170
02:05:37.521 --> 02:05:38.354
<v Speaker 5>if you tried to predict it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the chance that the chances </v>

2171
02:05:41.631 --> 02:05:42.464
<v Speaker 5>that you're here are so infinite </v>
<v Speaker 5>testable that it's just absolutely mind </v>

2172
02:05:46.041 --> 02:05:46.874
<v Speaker 5>boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about that unbroken sequence of </v>

2173
02:05:49.401 --> 02:05:52.940
<v Speaker 5>success over literally over billions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

2174
02:05:53.450 --> 02:05:54.830
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

2175
02:05:55.430 --> 02:06:00.230
<v Speaker 5>And so you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously you have to think that there's</v>

2176
02:06:00.231 --> 02:06:03.320
<v Speaker 5>a pretty strong proclivity for that to </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>

2177
02:06:03.321 --> 02:06:04.154
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them are obviously was </v>

2178
02:06:04.551 --> 02:06:07.340
<v Speaker 5>necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not only that,</v>

2179
02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:12.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's necessary that impregnated </v>
<v Speaker 5>females have an infant.</v>

2180
02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:15.230
<v Speaker 5>It isn't necessary that they keep it </v>
<v Speaker 5>alive.</v>

2181
02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:20.800
<v Speaker 5>So you can't account for that continuity</v>
<v Speaker 5>merely from necessity.</v>

2182
02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:26.320
<v Speaker 5>You have to interject a least,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a small amount of consideration that the</v>

2183
02:06:26.931 --> 02:06:27.764
<v Speaker 5>care that's associated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially with taking care of infants </v>

2184
02:06:29.931 --> 02:06:30.764
<v Speaker 5>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2185
02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:35.060
<v Speaker 5>there are a lot of work that's there to </v>
<v Speaker 5>tennis.</v>

2186
02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:35.893
<v Speaker 5>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's manifested in the </v>

2187
02:06:37.071 --> 02:06:37.904
<v Speaker 5>personality trait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Agreeableness cause it looks to me like </v>

2188
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:41.203
<v Speaker 5>agreeableness is one of the dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 5>where men and women very most </v>

2189
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:47.330
<v Speaker 5>substantially agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks to me like the manifestation of</v>

2190
02:06:47.331 --> 02:06:48.164
<v Speaker 5>the maternal instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now men can be agreeable to because of </v>

2191
02:06:50.241 --> 02:06:52.130
<v Speaker 5>course male human beings take care of </v>
<v Speaker 5>children.</v>

2192
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:53.623
<v Speaker 5>You know if you're a grizzly bear female</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just chase the damn mail away cause </v>

2193
02:06:57.441 --> 02:06:59.540
<v Speaker 5>he'll kill your cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not so helpful.</v>

2194
02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:03.170
<v Speaker 5>But they're not maternal at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Quite the contrary.</v>

2195
02:07:03.650 --> 02:07:06.170
<v Speaker 5>But you know human manner are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>damned maternal.</v>

2196
02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:08.660
<v Speaker 5>They're not as a maternal is women on </v>
<v Speaker 5>average,</v>

2197
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:09.703
<v Speaker 5>although some women are less maternal </v>
<v Speaker 5>than some men because you know the </v>

2198
02:07:13.641 --> 02:07:16.880
<v Speaker 5>curves overlap but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on balance,</v>

2199
02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:21.770
<v Speaker 5>how are we in the world where all we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>already aware of our own vulnerability.</v>

2200
02:07:22.670 --> 02:07:25.880
<v Speaker 5>We're aware of our own shortcomings </v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say.</v>

2201
02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:26.893
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's partly from being a </v>

2202
02:07:27.771 --> 02:07:28.604
<v Speaker 5>social being cause people are always </v>
<v Speaker 5>signaling your shortcomings to you to </v>

2203
02:07:31.941 --> 02:07:32.774
<v Speaker 5>such a degree that you even signal your </v>
<v Speaker 5>shortcomings to yourself because while </v>

2204
02:07:35.621 --> 02:07:37.960
<v Speaker 5>you might as well fix them before </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone else points them out,</v>

2205
02:07:38.170 --> 02:07:39.003
<v Speaker 5>that's guilt and shame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know when Freud called that the </v>

2206
02:07:41.981 --> 02:07:42.814
<v Speaker 5>Superego,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the superego is kind of like the </v>

2207
02:07:43.811 --> 02:07:48.250
<v Speaker 5>internalized representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>judgmental father and culture I think is</v>

2208
02:07:48.251 --> 02:07:49.084
<v Speaker 5>represented as a father figure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God the father let's say because it's </v>

2209
02:07:53.171 --> 02:07:54.004
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh it's actually quite a bit like there </v>

2210
02:07:55.181 --> 02:07:57.550
<v Speaker 5>is an all seeing eye that's always </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching you.</v>

2211
02:07:57.880 --> 02:07:58.713
<v Speaker 5>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really intelligent way of </v>

2212
02:07:59.711 --> 02:08:00.544
<v Speaker 5>conceptualizing it because the group </v>
<v Speaker 5>which is more or less eternal is </v>

2213
02:08:05.741 --> 02:08:06.574
<v Speaker 5>watching you all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time and it's judging you all </v>

2214
02:08:10.511 --> 02:08:11.344
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we know that if you put people in a </v>

2215
02:08:13.961 --> 02:08:16.110
<v Speaker 5>room and you put a big eye on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2216
02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:19.600
<v Speaker 5>and then you give them an opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 5>cheat on some little cheeky thing.</v>

2217
02:08:19.601 --> 02:08:20.680
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing too important.</v>

2218
02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:22.593
<v Speaker 5>If they're in the room with the big eye,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're less likely to cheat if they're </v>

2219
02:08:24.581 --> 02:08:27.190
<v Speaker 5>in the room with no way at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2220
02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:28.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what do you do?</v>

2221
02:08:28.481 --> 02:08:29.314
<v Speaker 5>You keep an eye on your kids and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason you do that is so they don't </v>

2222
02:08:31.361 --> 02:08:33.730
<v Speaker 5>misbehave and we keep an eye on each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

2223
02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:38.170
<v Speaker 5>And so we have a representation of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as far as I can tell,</v>

2224
02:08:38.171 --> 02:08:41.830
<v Speaker 5>we represented as a transcendent figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>of judgment.</v>

2225
02:08:42.250 --> 02:08:43.310
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2226
02:08:43.311 --> 02:08:45.190
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2227
02:08:45.850 --> 02:08:47.200
<v Speaker 5>that's a pretty good metaphor.</v>

2228
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.863
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2229
02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:54.293
<v Speaker 5>one of the,</v>

2230
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.823
<v Speaker 5>this is a major intellectual battle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the major intellectual battle and it's </v>

2231
02:09:04.441 --> 02:09:05.274
<v Speaker 5>raging in universities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's basically a battle between </v>

2232
02:09:08.371 --> 02:09:13.371
<v Speaker 5>postmodernism and traditional and </v>
<v Speaker 5>tradition.</v>

2233
02:09:14.850 --> 02:09:16.440
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the right way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

2234
02:09:17.070 --> 02:09:19.500
<v Speaker 5>For the postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings have no nature.</v>

2235
02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:24.210
<v Speaker 5>We're blank slates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything that we are is enculturated,</v>

2236
02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:27.780
<v Speaker 5>so we're completely malleable and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>elements of our identity are malleable.</v>

2237
02:09:28.590 --> 02:09:31.320
<v Speaker 5>On the other side are the </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditionalists who are,</v>

2238
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:35.640
<v Speaker 5>I would say grounded more in</v>
<v Speaker 5>biology on the one hand,</v>

2239
02:09:35.641 --> 02:09:37.100
<v Speaker 5>but also in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

2240
02:09:37.101 --> 02:09:37.934
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the historical humanities tradition </v>

2241
02:09:41.551 --> 02:09:43.140
<v Speaker 5>that suggests that people have in </v>
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>

2242
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.260
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I explained some of that nature.</v>

2243
02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:48.900
<v Speaker 5>Most people want to have friends as part</v>
<v Speaker 5>of your nature.</v>

2244
02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:50.293
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people want to find love part of </v>

2245
02:09:52.471 --> 02:09:54.900
<v Speaker 5>your nature and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you suffer without it.</v>

2246
02:09:54.901 --> 02:09:56.010
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2247
02:09:56.011 --> 02:09:57.750
<v Speaker 5>you could say those are all social </v>
<v Speaker 5>constructs,</v>

2248
02:09:57.751 --> 02:10:00.270
<v Speaker 5>but</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can say,</v>

2249
02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:01.170
<v Speaker 5>you can say anything.</v>

2250
02:10:01.530 --> 02:10:06.530
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no to ever trust someone who has one</v>

2251
02:10:07.291 --> 02:10:10.470
<v Speaker 5>explanation for everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2252
02:10:10.471 --> 02:10:14.250
<v Speaker 5>how much intelligence does that take?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got one explanation,</v>

2253
02:10:14.251 --> 02:10:16.290
<v Speaker 5>you can just trot it out for every </v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomena.</v>

2254
02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:19.320
<v Speaker 5>This is an alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2255
02:10:19.321 --> 02:10:20.154
<v Speaker 5>here's what happened in park</v>
<v Speaker 5>nature back in the late 18 hundreds was </v>

2256
02:10:26.281 --> 02:10:30.330
<v Speaker 5>very interested in the dissolution of </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditional faith in,</v>

2257
02:10:30.331 --> 02:10:31.164
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the west.</v>

2258
02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 5>We fell out of our myth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a way of thinking about it.</v>

2259
02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:36.790
<v Speaker 5>We stopped believing in its fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 5>axioms.</v>

2260
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:40.790
<v Speaker 5>You start believing that there was such </v>
<v Speaker 5>a thing as a transcendent deity.</v>

2261
02:10:40.791 --> 02:10:41.624
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it didn't mesh well with the emerging </v>

2262
02:10:44.271 --> 02:10:48.050
<v Speaker 5>scientific viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so in the late 18 hundreds,</v>

2263
02:10:48.070 --> 02:10:49.640
<v Speaker 5>Nietzsche announced the death of God.</v>

2264
02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:51.413
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

2265
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:56.090
<v Speaker 5>Which sounds fairly presumptuous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't something,</v>

2266
02:10:56.091 --> 02:11:00.260
<v Speaker 5>he was celebrating the full quote and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>haven't gotten it exactly right is God's</v>

2267
02:11:00.261 --> 02:11:01.094
<v Speaker 5>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've killed him and we'll never find </v>

2268
02:11:02.781 --> 02:11:05.120
<v Speaker 5>enough water to wash away the rivers of </v>
<v Speaker 5>blood.</v>

2269
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:06.583
<v Speaker 5>So like that's a lot different than what</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see scrawled on bathroom walls and </v>

2270
02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:12.153
<v Speaker 5>Nietzsche hypothesized that in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 5>century millions of people would die in </v>

2271
02:11:17.151 --> 02:11:21.950
<v Speaker 5>the conflicts over what values we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to reign as an alternative to that</v>

2272
02:11:21.951 --> 02:11:25.280
<v Speaker 5>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he particularly brilliantly</v>

2273
02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:30.020
<v Speaker 5>pointed to communism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said that's where it's going to be in</v>

2274
02:11:30.021 --> 02:11:32.570
<v Speaker 5>Dostoyevsky did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

2275
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:37.690
<v Speaker 5>and since then there's this been this </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle.</v>

2276
02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:38.553
<v Speaker 5>He and the battle is kind of like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the battle is on the one hand between </v>

2277
02:11:41.470 --> 02:11:42.303
<v Speaker 5>social construction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>social constructionist utopians who </v>

2278
02:11:45.521 --> 02:11:46.354
<v Speaker 5>believe that human nature is infinitely </v>
<v Speaker 5>malleable and that with the proper </v>

2279
02:11:49.241 --> 02:11:50.074
<v Speaker 5>transformations in society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can bring apart about the perfect </v>

2280
02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:55.060
<v Speaker 5>state and the perfect human being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2281
02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:01.920
<v Speaker 5>and traditionalist</v>
<v Speaker 5>and young I think is the classic example</v>

2282
02:12:03.161 --> 02:12:03.994
<v Speaker 5>of this who believed that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>human nature and it's deeply embedded </v>

2283
02:12:08.081 --> 02:12:08.914
<v Speaker 5>within us and that the cultures we set </v>
<v Speaker 5>up have to manifest themselves in </v>

2284
02:12:13.421 --> 02:12:15.850
<v Speaker 5>accordance with that nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or they will fail.</v>

2285
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:19.143
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>young believed in the existence of a </v>

2286
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:22.210
<v Speaker 5>Meta narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hero myth,</v>

2287
02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:23.073
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he explained it's connections to </v>

2288
02:12:25.361 --> 02:12:29.650
<v Speaker 5>various religious traditions in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>staggeringly brilliant manner.</v>

2289
02:12:29.890 --> 02:12:32.110
<v Speaker 5>Camille Paglia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who I would recommend,</v>

2290
02:12:32.111 --> 02:12:34.270
<v Speaker 5>and I think I already told you that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2291
02:12:34.271 --> 02:12:35.104
<v Speaker 5>she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's already concluded after going </v>

2292
02:12:36.791 --> 02:12:39.850
<v Speaker 5>through a radical feminist period early </v>
<v Speaker 5>in her life,</v>

2293
02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:40.713
<v Speaker 5>that the proper way for society orient </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself is within a mythological </v>

2294
02:12:44.591 --> 02:12:45.424
<v Speaker 5>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that that's part of what the </v>

2295
02:12:46.421 --> 02:12:48.670
<v Speaker 5>humanities provides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2296
02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:51.130
<v Speaker 5>and the alternative is</v>

2297
02:12:54.190 --> 02:12:56.920
<v Speaker 5>rational arguments over what values are </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to dominate.</v>

2298
02:12:57.580 --> 02:13:00.580
<v Speaker 5>And it isn't obvious that rationality </v>
<v Speaker 5>can solve that problem.</v>

2299
02:13:01.090 --> 02:13:03.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hume's point.</v>

2300
02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:06.130
<v Speaker 5>David Hume said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't derive an ought from an is,</v>

2301
02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:08.013
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You cannot use science as a guide to </v>

2302
02:13:09.611 --> 02:13:12.220
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what do you use?</v>

2303
02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:19.440
<v Speaker 5>Instinct instinct manifested in </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagination and the evolution,</v>

2304
02:13:20.770 --> 02:13:23.710
<v Speaker 5>the evolved structure of your organic </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultures,</v>

2305
02:13:24.190 --> 02:13:26.110
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they have a structure?</v>

2306
02:13:26.890 --> 02:13:28.120
<v Speaker 5>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2307
02:13:28.121 --> 02:13:28.954
<v Speaker 5>so you ask yourself this question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it that every being shares </v>

2308
02:13:32.341 --> 02:13:33.174
<v Speaker 5>regardless of place and time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So any universally comprehensive </v>

2309
02:13:36.721 --> 02:13:40.260
<v Speaker 5>language that would be a Meta narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a myth,</v>

2310
02:13:40.290 --> 02:13:41.123
<v Speaker 5>a hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say a myth about what a human </v>

2311
02:13:43.111 --> 02:13:45.420
<v Speaker 5>being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only his life but should be like,</v>

2312
02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:49.950
<v Speaker 5>has to speak to us about those aspects </v>
<v Speaker 5>of experience that we all share.</v>

2313
02:13:49.951 --> 02:13:51.960
<v Speaker 5>Because otherwise we wouldn't understand</v>
<v Speaker 5>the damn story.</v>

2314
02:13:52.110 --> 02:13:55.980
<v Speaker 5>Now we go to how we go to stories that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we understand all the time,</v>

2315
02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:56.933
<v Speaker 5>like star wars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it really doesn't matter what </v>

2316
02:13:58.471 --> 02:13:59.340
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2317
02:13:59.341 --> 02:14:03.840
<v Speaker 5>everybody gets it more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So obviously there's stories that we can</v>

2318
02:14:03.841 --> 02:14:05.700
<v Speaker 5>understand and mutually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2319
02:14:05.701 --> 02:14:08.640
<v Speaker 5>we understand love stories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we understand stories of conflict,</v>

2320
02:14:08.641 --> 02:14:11.370
<v Speaker 5>we understand stories of betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we understand stories of anger.</v>

2321
02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:14.070
<v Speaker 5>And that's because we can feel jealousy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can feel love,</v>

2322
02:14:14.071 --> 02:14:15.620
<v Speaker 5>we can feel anger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2323
02:14:15.850 --> 02:14:17.910
<v Speaker 5>it's part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's right there.</v>

2324
02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:20.670
<v Speaker 5>We even know where the circuits are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2325
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:23.370
<v Speaker 5>And then you're like other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they feel it too.</v>

2326
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:26.400
<v Speaker 5>So very similar emotions as far as we </v>
<v Speaker 5>can tell.</v>

2327
02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:32.120
<v Speaker 5>So</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

2328
02:14:32.690 --> 02:14:36.530
<v Speaker 5>here's this is drive in large part from </v>
<v Speaker 5>young but not only,</v>

2329
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:39.620
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's what we share.</v>

2330
02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:42.073
<v Speaker 5>Natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>social world and the fact of our </v>

2331
02:14:45.801 --> 02:14:49.460
<v Speaker 5>existence as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that can be represented in different</v>

2332
02:14:49.461 --> 02:14:51.830
<v Speaker 5>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It can be represented as you,</v>

2333
02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:52.813
<v Speaker 5>the known,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the and the unknown or it could be you </v>

2334
02:14:55.790 --> 02:14:56.623
<v Speaker 5>culture and nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the same representations and the </v>

2335
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:04.070
<v Speaker 5>cultural representation tends to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>male.</v>

2336
02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:06.950
<v Speaker 5>That's God the father let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they</v>

2337
02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:12.110
<v Speaker 5>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Feminine Representation tends to be</v>

2338
02:15:13.730 --> 02:15:14.563
<v Speaker 5>female.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the known culture apollonian </v>

2339
02:15:20.301 --> 02:15:23.180
<v Speaker 5>control that's associated with the son </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness,</v>

2340
02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:24.230
<v Speaker 5>the king,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the patriarch,</v>

2341
02:15:24.231 --> 02:15:25.064
<v Speaker 5>the plow because it pushes up the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Phallus obviously order and </v>

2342
02:15:29.770 --> 02:15:31.640
<v Speaker 5>authority and the crushing weight of </v>
<v Speaker 5>tradition,</v>

2343
02:15:31.641 --> 02:15:35.960
<v Speaker 5>the wise old man and the tyrant dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the day sky,</v>

2344
02:15:36.410 --> 02:15:37.520
<v Speaker 5>the country mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the island,</v>

2345
02:15:37.521 --> 02:15:39.260
<v Speaker 5>the heights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ancestral spirits,</v>

2346
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:40.730
<v Speaker 5>the activity of the dead</v>

2347
02:15:44.850 --> 02:15:46.200
<v Speaker 5>captain hook,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a tyrant.</v>

2348
02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:49.020
<v Speaker 5>And that's why Peter Pan doesn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>grow up to become him.</v>

2349
02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:50.063
<v Speaker 5>And that's why Peter Pan doesn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>grow up well because he thinks that </v>

2350
02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:54.900
<v Speaker 5>adults are all tyrants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is captain hook a tyrant?</v>

2351
02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:59.400
<v Speaker 5>Because a crocodile ate his hand and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>crocodile has a clock in its stomach.</v>

2352
02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:03.630
<v Speaker 5>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>crocodile is time and time's already got</v>

2353
02:16:03.631 --> 02:16:07.110
<v Speaker 5>a piece of Captain Hook and he's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>very happy about it.</v>

2354
02:16:07.111 --> 02:16:09.300
<v Speaker 5>He's bitter and resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 5>tyrannical.</v>

2355
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:12.540
<v Speaker 5>And when Peter Pan looks at adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what he sees.</v>

2356
02:16:12.690 --> 02:16:13.523
<v Speaker 5>And he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why should I sacrifice the potential of </v>

2357
02:16:15.091 --> 02:16:18.120
<v Speaker 5>childhood for the singularity of tight </v>
<v Speaker 5>tyranny?</v>

2358
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:20.910
<v Speaker 5>And so we stay as immature his entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2359
02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:23.670
<v Speaker 5>And he's king of the lost boys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

2360
02:16:24.150 --> 02:16:29.070
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a porn star named Jeremy Christ.</v>

2361
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:31.330
<v Speaker 5>Can't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really an ugly guy.</v>

2362
02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:33.240
<v Speaker 5>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He is.</v>

2363
02:16:33.330 --> 02:16:36.490
<v Speaker 5>He is not ugly guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He admits it and he,</v>

2364
02:16:36.550 --> 02:16:37.383
<v Speaker 5>he said something funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was watching a documentary about him </v>

2365
02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:42.180
<v Speaker 5>and he said the funniest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>

2366
02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:48.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm the hero to people who think people </v>
<v Speaker 5>like me are heroes.</v>

2367
02:16:48.630 --> 02:16:50.490
<v Speaker 5>What a drag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2368
02:16:50.610 --> 02:16:54.420
<v Speaker 5>he's just in this horrible situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't admire the people that admire</v>

2369
02:16:54.421 --> 02:16:55.254
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he gets admired by them all the </v>

2370
02:16:56.401 --> 02:16:57.370
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2371
02:16:57.390 --> 02:16:58.860
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of like Peter Pan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2372
02:16:58.861 --> 02:17:01.470
<v Speaker 5>well he's king of the lost boys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't get windy either.</v>

2373
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:04.310
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She grows up,</v>

2374
02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:05.593
<v Speaker 5>she has a family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He asked to contend himself with </v>

2375
02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:11.030
<v Speaker 5>Tinkerbell and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tinkerbell doesn't exist.</v>

2376
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:13.970
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what happens when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>grow up.</v>

2377
02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:17.510
<v Speaker 5>That's a representation of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a nasty one.</v>

2378
02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:20.200
<v Speaker 5>A</v>
<v Speaker 5>nasty one.</v>

2379
02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:22.910
<v Speaker 5>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll kiss,</v>

2380
02:17:23.390 --> 02:17:24.223
<v Speaker 5>kiss a statue of Stella.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who cares that he murdered 30 million </v>

2381
02:17:28.041 --> 02:17:31.040
<v Speaker 5>people culture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2382
02:17:31.041 --> 02:17:31.874
<v Speaker 5>you know in the university you hear a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot about the patriarchy and how </v>

2383
02:17:34.491 --> 02:17:35.510
<v Speaker 5>oppressive it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2384
02:17:35.511 --> 02:17:35.991
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2385
02:17:35.991 --> 02:17:37.070
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely.</v>

2386
02:17:37.250 --> 02:17:38.690
<v Speaker 5>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

2387
02:17:38.691 --> 02:17:41.990
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of useful as well since it </v>
<v Speaker 5>provides the light and the heat,</v>

2388
02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:44.480
<v Speaker 5>the food and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you know,</v>

2389
02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:47.120
<v Speaker 5>kind of counterbalances it to some </v>
<v Speaker 5>degree.</v>

2390
02:17:48.350 --> 02:17:50.630
<v Speaker 5>Culture has a positive element and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>negative element.</v>

2391
02:17:50.631 --> 02:17:53.060
<v Speaker 5>The individual has a positive element </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a negative element.</v>

2392
02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:55.820
<v Speaker 5>Nature has a positive element and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>negative element.</v>

2393
02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:58.550
<v Speaker 5>And if people tell you a one sided </v>
<v Speaker 5>story,</v>

2394
02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:01.340
<v Speaker 5>which is the ideological story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they leave out bat,</v>

2395
02:18:01.730 --> 02:18:02.563
<v Speaker 5>they say all culture is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The human being is a despoiled and </v>

2396
02:18:05.631 --> 02:18:09.680
<v Speaker 5>nature is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like no nature kills you.</v>

2397
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:11.743
<v Speaker 5>Culture keeps you alive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's things about you that are </v>

2398
02:18:14.721 --> 02:18:17.300
<v Speaker 5>honorable and good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as well as things about you that aren't.</v>

2399
02:18:18.170 --> 02:18:19.003
<v Speaker 5>And you need to know both of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what the great stories tell </v>

2400
02:18:21.381 --> 02:18:22.214
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

2401
02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:24.053
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
